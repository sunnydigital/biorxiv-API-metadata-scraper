    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMany recent phylogenetic methods have focused on accurately inferring species trees when there is gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). For almost all of these methods, and for phylogenetic methods in general, the data for each locus is assumed to consist of orthologous, single-copy sequences. Loci that are present in more than a single copy in any of the studied genomes are excluded from the data. These steps greatly reduce the number of loci available for analysis. The question we seek to answer in this study is: What happens if one runs such species tree inference methods on data where paralogy is present, in addition to or without ILS being present? Through simulation studies and analyses of two large biological data sets, we show that running such methods on data with paralogs can still provide accurate results. We use multiple different methods, some of which are based directly on the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model, and some of which have been proven to be statistically consistent under it. We also treat the paralogous loci in multiple ways: from explicitly denoting them as paralogs, to randomly selecting one copy per species. In all cases the inferred species trees are as accurate as equivalent analyses using single-copy orthologs. Our results have significant implications for the use of ILS-aware phylogenomic analyses, demonstrating that they do not have to be restricted to single-copy loci. This will greatly increase the amount of data that can be used for phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "The kinetic hypothesis of biodiversity proposes that temperature is the main driver of variation in species richness, given its exponential effect on biological activity and, potentially, on rates of diversification. However, limited support for this hypothesis has been found to date. I tested the fit of this model on the variation of tree-species richness along a continuous latitudinal gradient in the Americas. I found that the kinetic hypothesis accurately predicts the upper bound of the relationship between the inverse of mean annual temperature (1/kK) and the natural logarithm of species richness, at a broad scale. In addition, I found that water availability and the number of days with freezing temperatures organize a part of the residual variation of the upper bound model. The finding of the model fitting on the upper bound rather than on the mean values suggest that the kinetic hypothesis is modeling the variation of the potential maximum species richness per unit of temperature. Likewise, the distribution of the residuals of the upper bound model in function of the number of days with freezing temperatures suggest the importance of environmental thresholds rather than gradual variation driving the observable variation in species richness.",

    "abstract": "Metastability in the brain is thought to be a mechanism involved in dynamic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions across multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, it is not clear how such organization is realized in underlying neural oscillations in a high-dimensional state space. It was shown that macroscopic oscillations often form phase-phase coupling (PPC) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which result in synchronization and amplitude modulation, respectively, even without external stimuli. These oscillations can also make spontaneous transitions across synchronous states at rest. Using resting-state electroencephalographic signals and the autism-spectrum quotient scores acquired from healthy humans, we show experimental evidence that the PAC combined with PPC allows amplitude modulation to be transient, and that the metastable dynamics with this transient modulation is associated with autistic-like traits. In individuals with a longer attention span, such dynamics tended to show fewer transitions between states by forming delta-alpha PAC. We identified these states as two-dimensional metastable states that could share consistent patterns across individuals. Our findings suggest that the human brain dynamically organizes inter-individual differences in a hierarchy of macroscopic oscillations with multiple timescales by utilizing metastability.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe human brain organizes cognitive and behavioral functions dynamically. For decades, the dynamic organization of underlying neural oscillations has been a fundamental topic in neuroscience research. Even without external stimuli, macroscopic oscillations often form phase-phase coupling and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) that result in synchronization and amplitude modulation, respectively, and can make spontaneous transitions across synchronous states at rest. Using resting-state electroencephalography signals acquired from healthy humans, we show evidence that these two neural couplings enable amplitude modulation to be transient, and that this transient modulation can be viewed as the transition among oscillatory states with different PAC strengths. We also demonstrate that such transition dynamics are associated with the ability to maintain attention to detail and to switch attention, as measured by autism-spectrum quotient scores. These individual dynamics were visualized as a trajectory among states with attracting tendencies, and involved consistent brain states across individuals. Our findings have significant implications for unraveling variability in the individual brains showing typical and atypical development.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is controlled by homeostatic mechanisms, which drive sleep after wakefulness, and a circadian clock, which confers the 24-hour rhythm of sleep. These processes interact with each other to control the timing of sleep in a daily cycle as well as following sleep deprivation. However, the mechanisms by which they interact are poorly understood. We show here that hugin+ neurons, previously identified as neurons that function downstream of the clock to regulate rhythms of locomotor activity, are also targets of the sleep homeostat. Sleep deprivation decreases activity of hugin+ neurons, likely to suppress circadian-driven activity during recovery sleep, and manipulations of hugin+ neurons affect sleep increases generated by activation of the homeostatic sleep locus, the dorsal fanshaped body (dFB). Also, mutations in peptides produced by the hugin+ locus increase recovery sleep following deprivation. Trans-synaptic mapping reveals that hugin+ neurons feed-back onto central clock neurons, which also show decreased activity upon sleep loss, in a Hugin-peptide dependent fashion. We propose that hugin+ neurons integrate circadian and sleep signals to modulate circadian circuitry and regulate the timing of sleep.",

    "abstract": "The anatomical reorganization required for optimal C4 photosynthesis should also impact plant hydraulics. Most C4 plants possess large bundle-sheath cells and high vein density, which should also lead to higher leaf hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) and capacitance. Paradoxically, the C4 pathway reduces water demand and increases water-use-efficiency, creating a potential mis-match between supply capacity and demand in C4 plant water relations. We use phylogenetic analyses, physiological measurements, and models to examine the reorganization of hydraulics in closely-related C4 and C3 grasses. Evolutionarily young C4 lineages have higher Kleaf, capacitance, turgor-loss-point, and lower stomatal conductance than their C3 relatives. In contrast, species from older C4 lineages show decreased Kleaf and capacitance, indicating that over time, C4 plants have evolved to optimize hydraulic investments while maintaining C4 anatomical requirements. The initial \"over-plumbing\" of C4 plants disrupts the positive correlation between maximal assimilation rate and Kleaf, decoupling a key relationship between hydraulics and photosynthesis generally observed in vascular plants.",

    "abstract": "C3 and C4 are major functional types in terrestrial biosphere models, with photosynthesis traits as important input parameters. The evolution of C4 required reorganizations of Calvin-Benson-cycle and coordination of C4-cycle enzymes, resulting in divergences of physiological traits between C3 and C4. In addition, photosynthesis further optimized after the evolution of C4 causing diversification within C4 lineages due to different evolutionary histories. We combined optimality modeling, physiological measurements and phylogenetic analysis to examine how various aspects of C4 photosynthetic machinery were reorganized and coordinated within C4 lineages and as compared to closely-related C3 in grasses. Optimality models and measurements indicated a higher maximal electron transport to maximal Rubisco carboxylation ratio (Jmax/Vcmax) in C4 than C3, consistent with the optimal prediction to maximize photosynthesis. The coordination between Calvin-Benson and C4 cycles (Vpmax/Vcmax), however, is in line with the optimal modeling results under 200 ppm, as opposed to current CO2. Such inconsistencies can be explained by a slowly declining assimilation rate beyond optimal Vpmax/Vcmax. Although rapid coordination occurred early in C4 evolution, C4 is still under optimizing processes and photosynthetic measures have continued to increase across time. Lastly, better understandings of Jmax/Vcmax, Vpmax/Vcmax and fluorescence-based-electron-transport proffer enhanced approaches to parameterize terrestrial biosphere models.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides a holistic snapshot of the entire protein set of a living cell on a molecular level. Currently, only a few deep learning approaches that involve peptide fragmentation spectra, which represent partial sequence information of proteins, exist. Commonly, these approaches lack the ability to characterize less studied or even unknown patterns in spectra because of their use of explicit domain knowledge. To elevate unrestricted learning from spectra, we introduce AHLF, a deep learning model that is end-to-end trained on 19.2 million spectra from multiple phosphoproteomic data sets. AHLF is interpretable and we show that peak-level feature importances and pairwise interactions between peaks are in line with corresponding peptide fragments. We demonstrate our approach by detecting post-translational modifications, specifically protein phosphorylation based on only the fragmentation spectrum without a database search. AHLF increases the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) by an average of 9.4% on recent phosphoproteomic data compared to the current-state-of-the-art on this task. To show the broad applicability of AHLF we use transfer learning to also detect cross-linked peptides, as used in protein structure analysis, with an AUC of up to 94%. We expect our approach to directly apply to cell signaling and structural biology which use phosphoproteomic and cross-linking data, but in principal any mass spectrometry based study can benefit from an interpretable, end-to-end trained model like AHLF.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/ahlf\n\nContactbernhard.renard@hpi.de",

    "abstract": "Nicotiana benthamiana is used extensively as a platform for transient gene expression and as a model system for studying plant-virus interactions. However, many tobacco-feeding generalist herbivores, including Myzus persicae (green peach aphid), Bemisia tabaci (whitefly), Macrosiphum euphorbiae (potato aphid), Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm), Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper), and Helicoverpa zea (corn earworm), grow poorly on N. benthamiana, limiting its utility for research on plant-insect interactions. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated knockout mutations in two N. benthamiana acylsugar acyltransferases, ASAT1 and ASAT2, which contribute to the biosynthesis of insect-deterrent acylsucroses. Whereas asat1 mutations reduced the abundance of two predominant acylsucroses, asat2 mutations caused almost complete depletion of foliar acylsucroses. The tested hemipteran and lepidopteran species survived, gained weight, and/or reproduced significantly better on asat2 mutant plants than on wildtype N. benthamiana. Furthermore, both asat1 and asat2 mutations reduced the water content and increased the temperature of leaves, indicating that foliar acylsucroses can protect against desiccation. Two experiments demonstrated the utility of the N. benthamiana asat2 mutant line for insect bioassays. Transmission of turnip mosaic virus by M. persicae was significantly improved by an asat2 mutation. Tobacco rattle virus constructs were used for virus-induced gene silencing of acetylcholinesterase, squalene synthase, toll-like receptor 7, and tubulin-specific chaperon D genes in B. tabaci, an experiment that would have been difficult with wild-type N. benthamiana due to high insect mortality. Additionally, the absence of acylsugars in asat2 mutant lines will simplify transient expression assays for the functional analysis of acylsugar biosynthesis genes from other Solanaceae.",

    "abstract": "Anti-disease breeding is becoming the most promising solution to cyprinid herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3) infection, the major threat to common carp aquaculture. Virus challenging studies suggested that a breeding strain of common carp is resistant to this disease. This study illustrates the immune mechanisms involved in anti-CyHV-3 ability. An integrative analysis of the protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) using transcriptomic data was performed. Tissues from the head kidney of common carp were extracted at day 0 (the healthy control) and day 7 after CyHV-3 infection (the survivors), and used to analyze the transcriptome through both Illumina and PacBio sequencing. Following analysis of the GO terms and KEGG pathways involved, the immune-related terms and pathways were merged. In order to dig out details in the immune aspect, The DEGs were filtered using the current common carp immune gene library. Immune gene categories and their corresponding genes in different comparison groups were revealed. Also, the immunological Gene Ontology terms for lncRNA modulation were retained. The weighted gene co-XSexpression network analysis was used to reveal the regulation of immune genes by lncRNA. The results demonstrated that the breeding carp strain develops marked resistance to CyHV-3 through a specific innate immune mechanism. The featured biological processes were autophagy, phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, and virus blockage by lectins and MUC3. Moreover, the immune suppressive signals, such as suppression of IL21R on STAT3, PI3K mediated inhibition on inflammation by dopamine upon infection, as well as the inhibition of NLRC3 on STING during a steady state. Possible susceptible factors for CyHV-3, such as ITGB1, TLR18, and CCL4, were also revealed from the non-breeding strain. The results of this study also suggested that Nramp and PAI regulated by LncRNA could facilitate virus infection and proliferation for infected cells respectively, while T cell leukemia homeobox 3 (TLX3) as well as galectin 3 function by lncRNA may play a role in the resistance mechanism. Therefore, immune factors that are immunogenetically insensitive or susceptible to CyHV-3 infection have been revealed.",

Determining which cell helps which cells replication is challenging. We developed a systematic approach, integrating modeling and experiments, for determining the length-scales of cell-cell communication (from microns to centimeters). With this approach, we discovered that differentiating murine ES cells, scattered across centimeters on a dish, communicate over millimeters to form one macroscopic entity that survives if and only if its centimeter-scale population-density is above a threshold value. Single-cell-level measurements, transcriptomics, and modeling revealed that this \"macroscopic quorum sensing\" arises from differentiating ES cells secreting and sensing survival-promoting FGF4 that diffuses over millimeters and activates YAP1-induced survival mechanisms. Through the same mechanism, a lone macroscopic, but not microscopic, colony survives differentiation. Our work rigorously establishes that in vitro ES-cell differentiation relies on macroscopic cooperation.",

GABAA receptors and GAD2+ innervation at or near nodes of Ranvier of sensory axons cause this facilitation, preventing spike propagation failure at the many axon branch points, which is otherwise common without GABA. In contrast, GABAA receptors are generally lacking from axon terminals (unlike GABAB) and do not presynaptically inhibit transmitter release onto motoneurons. GABAergic innervation near nodes and branch points allows individual branches to function autonomously, with GAD2+ neurons regulating which branches conduct, adding a computational layer to the neuronal networks generating movement and likely generalizing to other CNS axons.",

We collected 333 nests of this species from 14 localities and three laboratory-reared populations in Japan. All wild queens dissected had no sperm in their spermathecae. Laboratory observation confirmed that virgin queens produced workers without mating. Furthermore, microsatellite genotyping showed identical heterozygous genotypes between mothers and their respective daughters, suggesting an extremely low probability of sexual reproduction. Microbial analysis detected no bacterial genera that are known to induce thelytokous parthenogenesis in Hymenoptera. Finally, the lack of variation in partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA among individuals sampled from across Japan suggests recent rapid spread or selective sweep. M. triviale would be a promising model system of superorganism-like adaptation through comparative analysis with well-studied sexual congeners, including the pharaoh ant M. pharaonis.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic insemination is a mating behaviour during which the (sperm) donor uses a traumatic intromittent organ to inject an ejaculate through the epidermis of the (sperm) recipient, thereby frequently circumventing the female genitalia. Traumatic insemination occurs widely across animals, but the frequency of its evolution, the intermediate stages via which it originates, and the morphological changes that such shifts involve remain poorly understood. Based on observations in 145 species of the free-living flatworm genus Macrostomum, we identify at least nine independent evolutionary origins of traumatic insemination from reciprocal copulation, but no clear indication of reversals. These origins involve convergent shifts in multivariate morphospace of male and female reproductive traits, suggesting that traumatic insemination has a canalising effect on morphology. Signatures of male-female coevolution across the genus indicate that sexual selection and sexual conflict drive the evolution of traumatic insemination, because it allows donors to bypass postcopulatory control mechanisms of recipients.",

Although cellular life may have emerged spontaneously, programmable integration of building blocks into size, membrane property-controlled compartments (liposome or coacervate) towards cellular organization, without using specialized devices, has proven difficult. Here, we report a self-templated route to monodisperse complex droplets in bulk solution from coacervate-liposome synergy, with nanoliposome controlling coacervate size and coacervate templating on-surface nanoliposome fusion. Nanoliposome-coated monodisperse coacervates are self-assembled within 30 seconds, which are sealed by fusing nanoliposomes into size-controlled giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), with model building blocks combinatorially integrated into droplets. Defect-free membrane is established on coacervate, which render these complex GUVs surviving at extreme osmotic, salty and pH conditions (4 M NaCl, 100 mM HCl, 1 M NaOH), while providing homeostasis for enzymatic reactions, reminiscent of extremophiles.",

    "abstract": "A central goal in evolutionary biology is to determine the predictability of adaptive genetic changes. Despite many documented cases of convergent evolution at individual loci, little is known about the repeatability of gene family expansions and contractions. To address this void, we examined gene family evolution in the redheaded pine sawfly Neodiprion lecontei, a non-eusocial hymenopteran and exemplar of a pine-specialized lineage evolved from angiosperm-feeding ancestors. After assembling and annotating a draft genome, we manually annotated multiple gene families with chemosensory, detoxification, or immunity functions and characterized their genomic distributions and evolutionary history. Our results suggest that expansions of bitter gustatory receptor (GR), clan 3 cytochrome P450 (CYP3), and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) subfamilies may have contributed to pine adaptation. By contrast, there was no evidence of recent gene family contraction via pseudogenization. Next, we compared the number of genes in these same families across insect taxa that vary in diet, dietary specialization, and social behavior. In Hymenoptera, herbivory was associated with small GR and olfactory receptor (OR) families, eusociality was associated with large OR and small AMP families, and--unlike investigations in more closely related taxa--ecological specialization was not related to gene family size. Overall, our results suggest that gene families that mediate ecological interactions may expand and contract predictably in response to particular selection pressures, however, the ecological drivers and temporal pace of gene gain and loss likely varies considerably across gene families.",

    "abstract": "Volitional suppression of responses to distracting external stimuli enables us to achieve our goals. This volitional inhibition of a specific behavior is supposed to be mainly mediated by the cerebral cortex. However, recent evidence supports the involvement of the cerebellum in this process. It is currently not known whether different parts of the cerebellar cortex play differential or synergistic roles in planning and execution of this behavior. Here, we measured Purkinje cell (PC) responses in the medial and lateral cerebellum in two rhesus macaques during a pro- and antisaccade task. During an antisaccade trial, non-human primates were instructed to make a saccadic eye movement away from a target, rather than towards it, as in prosaccade trials. Our data shows that the cerebellum plays an important role not only during execution of the saccades, but also during the volitional inhibition of eye movements towards the target. Simple Spike (SS) modulation during the instruction and execution period of pro- and antisaccades was prominent in PCs of both medial and lateral cerebellum. However, only the SS activity in the lateral cerebellar cortex contained information about trial identity and showed a stronger reciprocal interaction with complex spikes. Moreover, SS activity of different PC groups modulated bidirectionally in both regions, but the PCs that showed facilitating and suppressive activity were predominantly associated with instruction and execution, respectively. These findings show that different cerebellar regions and PC groups contribute to goal-directed behavior and volitional inhibition, but with different propensities, highlighting the rich repertoire of cerebellar control in executive functions.\n\nSignificance StatementThe antisaccade task is commonly used in research and clinical evaluation as a test of volitional and flexible control of behavior. It requires volitional suppression of prosaccades, a function that has been attributed to the neocortex. However, recent findings indicate that cerebellum also contributes to this behavior. We recorded from neurons in the medial and lateral cerebellum to evaluate their responses in this task. We found that both regions significantly modulated their activity during this task, but only cells in the lateral cerebellum encoded the stimulus identity in each trial. These results indicate that the cerebellum actively contributes to the control of flexible behavior and that lateral and medial cerebellum play different roles during volitional eye movements.",

We isolated the bacteria from the face of a 2-year-old girl who was bitten by a cat. The organism was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequence, and phylogenetic analysise supported that this isolate was belong to B. zoohelcum. Due to the contradicts of culture characteristics of B. zoohelcum which described in reported literatures, we used different media to culture the bacteria. After 24 h incubation, Colombia blood agar (CBA), Mueller-Hinton agar plate with 5% sheep blood and chocolate agar (CA) grew well, but blood agar (BA) grew well until 72 h. The strain did not grow on McConkey agar (MAC), Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) and chocolate agar (containing vancomycin). The low detection rate of this strain was related to its harsh growth conditions and the limitations of traditional identification techniques. With the popularization of MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequence and our further understanding of the fastidious bacteria, we will quickly and accurately identify the B. zoohelcum, meanwhile the detection rate of this bacterium will also be significantly improved.

To test the use of the Himar1 derivative of the Chromatic Bacteria plasmid series for fluorescently tagging bacteria, recently isolated non-model organisms were conjugated with the Himar1 transposon plasmids. We were unsuccessful in delivering the plasmids into Gram positive bacterial isolates but were able to successfully integrate the transposon in isolates that we were previously unable to modify such as Sphingomonas sp.

Here we show that the arms race between phages and their hosts is mediated by large and highly diverse mobile genetic elements. These phage-defense elements display exceedingly fast evolutionary turnover, resulting in differential phage susceptibility among clonal bacterial strains while phage receptors remain invariant. Protection afforded by multiple elements is cumulative, and a single bacterial genome can harbor as many as 18 putative phage-defense elements. Overall, elements account for 90% of the flexible genome amongst closely related strains. The rapid turnover of these elements demonstrates that phage resistance is unlinked from other genomic features and that resistance to phage therapy might be as easily acquired as antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Among CD4+ T-cells, T helper 17 (Th17) cells are particularly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and are depleted from mucosal sites, which causes damage to the gut barrier resulting in microbial translocation-induced systemic inflammation, a hallmark of disease progression. Furthermore, a proportion of latently infected Th17 cells persist long-term in the gastro-intestinal lymphatic tract, where low-level HIV-1 transcription is observed. This residual viremia contributes to chronic immune activation. Thus, Th17 cells are key players in HIV pathogenesis and viral persistence, however it is unclear why these cells are highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Th17 cell differentiation depends on expression of the master transcriptional regulator RORC2, a retinoic acid-related nuclear hormone receptor that regulates specific transcriptional programs by binding to promoter/enhancer DNA. Here, we report that RORC2 is a key host-cofactor for HIV replication in Th17 cells. We found that specific inhibitors that bind to the RORC2 ligand-binding domain reduced HIV replication in CD4+ T-cells. Depletion of RORC2 inhibited HIV-1 infection, whereas RORC2 overexpression enhanced it. RORC2 was found to promote HIV-1 gene expression. Chromatin immune precipitation revealed that RORC2 binds to the nuclear receptor responsive element (NRRE) in the HIV-1 LTR. In treated HIV-1 patients, RORC2+ CD4 T cells contained more proviral DNA than RORC2- cells. Pharmacological inhibition of RORC2 potently reduced HIV-1 outgrowth in CD4+ T-cells from antiretroviral-treated patients. Altogether, these results provide a new explanation as to why Th17 cells are highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and point to RORC2 as a cell-specific target for HIV-1 therapy.\n\nSignificance statementHIV-1 infects CD4 T cells and among these, Th17 cells are known to be particularly permissive for virus replication. Infection of Th17 cells is critical for AIDS pathogenesis and viral persistence, however it is not clear why these cells are highly permissive to HIV-1. We found that Th17 cell permissiveness depends on expression of the hormone receptor RORC2, which is the master transcriptional regulator of Th17 cell differentiation. We identify RORC2 as a new, cell-specific host-dependency factor that can be targeted by small molecules. Our results point to RORC2 as a cell-specific target for HIV-1 therapy, an entirely new concept in the field, and suggest HIV-1 might have evolved to exploit RORC2 to promote its own persistence.",

We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across three additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used genome-wide association mapping and RNA-sequencing to show that three cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases were linked to a genetic locus associated with microbiome structure. These genes were more highly expressed in genotypes susceptible to fungal pathogens, which were central to microbial covariance networks, suggesting that host immune genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Theaceae, with three tribes and nine genera, is a family of great economic and ecological importance. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on plastid genome resolved the relationship among three tribes and the intergeneric relationships within Gordonieae and Stewartieae. However, generic level relationships within the largest tribe Theeae were not fully resolved and potential hybridization among genera within Theeae revealed previously also remains to be tested further. Here we conducted a comprehensive phylogenomic study of Theaceae based on transcriptomes and low-depth whole-genome sequencing of 57 species as well as additional plastome sequence data from previous work. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that Stewartieae was the first-diverging clade in Theaceae, consistent with previous study using plastomic data. Within Theeae, the highly supported Apterosperma-Laplacea clade grouped with Pyrenaria with maximum support based on the partitioned and unpartitioned concatenation analyses using the 610 low-copy nuclear genes, leaving Camellia and Polyspora as another sister genera in the tribe. PhyloNet analyses suggested one reticulation event within Camellia and Pyrenaria respectively, but no intergeneric reticulations were detected in Theeae. Another introgression was found between Gordonia lasianthus and the common ancestor of Gordonieae during the Late Oligocene. The existing land bridges (e.g. Bering land bridge) might have facilitated this ancient introgression. Further researches need to be conducted to uncover the interspecific introgression pattern within Camellia.

    "abstract": "Two popular approaches for modeling social evolution, evolutionary game theory and quantitative genetics, ask complementary questions but are rarely integrated. Game theory focuses on evolutionary outcomes, with models solving for evolutionarily stable equilibria, whereas quantitative genetics provides insight into evolutionary processes, with models predicting short-term responses to selection. Here we draw parallels between evolutionary game theory and interacting phenotypes theory, which is a quantitative genetic framework for understanding social evolution. First, we show how any evolutionary game may be translated into two quantitative genetic selection gradients, nonsocial and social selection, which may be used to predict evolutionary change from a single round of the game. We show that synergistic fitness effects may alter predicted selection gradients, causing changes in magnitude and sign as the population mean evolves. Second, we show how evolutionary games involving plastic behavioral responses to partners can be modeled using indirect genetic effects, which describe how trait expression changes in response to genes in the social environment. We demonstrate that repeated social interactions in models of reciprocity generate indirect effects and conversely, that estimates of parameters from indirect genetic effect models may be used to predict the evolution of reciprocity. We argue that a pluralistic view incorporating both theoretical approaches will benefit empiricists and theorists studying social evolution. We advocate the measurement of social selection and indirect genetic effects in natural populations to test the predictions from game theory, and in turn, the use of game theory models to aid in the interpretation of quantitative genetic estimates.",

Previous work has identified genetic variants associated with Alzheimers disease (AD) risk from large-scale genome-wide association study meta-analyses. To explore effects of known AD-risk variants, we performed a phenome-wide association study on ~2000 clinical, proteomic, and metabolic blood-based analytes obtained from 2,831 cognitively normal adult clients of a consumer-based scientific wellness company. Results uncovered statistically significant SNP-analyte associations for five genetic variants after correction for multiple testing (for SNPs in or near NYAP1, ABCA7, INPP5D, and APOE). These effects were detectable from early adulthood. Sex modified the effects of four genetic variants, with multiple interrelated immune-modulating effects associated with the PICALM variant. Sex-stratified GWAS results from an independent AD case-control meta-analysis supported sexspecific disease effects of the PICALM variant, highlighting the importance of sex as a biological variable. These analyses support evidence from previous functional genomics studies in the identification of a causal variant within the PILRA gene. Taken together, this study highlights clues to the earliest effects of AD genetic risk variants in individuals where disease symptoms have not (yet) arisen.",

    "abstract": "The expression of most bacterial genes commences with the binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP)-{sigma}70 holoenzyme to the promoter DNA. This initial RNAP-promoter closed complex undergoes a series of conformational changes, including the formation of a transcription bubble on the promoter and the loading of template DNA strand into the RNAP active site; these changes lead to the catalytically active open complex (RPO) state. Recent cryo-electron microscopy studies have provided detailed structural insight on the RPO and putative intermediates on its formation pathway. Here, we employ single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to interrogate the conformational dynamics and reaction kinetics during real-time RPO formation. We find that the RPO pathway is branched, generating RPO complexes with different stabilities. The RNAP cleft loops, and especially the {beta} rudder, stabilise the transcription bubble. The RNAP interactions with the promoter upstream sequence (beyond -35) stimulate transcription bubble nucleation and tune the reaction path towards stable forms of the RPO.

    "abstract": "Gram-positive bacteria contain sortase enzymes on their cell surfaces that catalyze transpeptidation reactions critical for proper cellular function. In vitro, sortases are used in sortase-mediated ligation (SML) reactions for a variety of protein engineering applications. Historically, sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus (saSrtA) has been the enzyme of choice for SML reactions. However, the stringent specificity of saSrtA for the sequence motif LPXTG limits its uses. Here, we use principal component analysis to identify a structurally conserved loop with a high degree of variability in all classes of sortases. We investigate the contribution of this {beta}7-{beta}8 loop, located between the catalytic cysteine and arginine residues and immediately adjacent to the target binding cleft, by designing and testing chimeric sortase enzymes. Our chimeras utilize natural sequence variation of Class A sortases from 8 species engineered into the SrtA sequence from Streptococcus pneumoniae (spSrtA). While some of our chimeric enzymes mimic the activity and selectivity of the wild-type protein from which the loop sequence is derived (e.g., that of saSrtA), others result in chimeric spSrtA enzymes able to accommodate a range of residues in the final position of the substrate motif (LPXTX). Using mutagenesis, structural, and sequence analyses, we identify three interactions facilitated by {beta}7-{beta}8 loop residues that appear to be broadly characteristic of Class A sortase enzymes. These studies provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of sortase target selectivity and can expand the sortase toolbox for future SML applications.",

While an efficient PM repair machinery can aid survival of healthy cells by preventing influx of extracellular calcium, it can also constitute an obstacle in drug delivery and photothermal therapy. We show how nanoscopic holes can be applied to the cell surface thus allowing identification of molecular components with a pivotal role in PM repair. Cells are punctured by locally heating gold nanostructures at the cell surface which causes nano-ruptures in cellular PMs. Recruitment of annexin V near the hole is found to locally reshape the ruptured plasma membrane. Experiments using model membranes, containing recombinant annexin V, provide further biophysical insight into the ability of annexin V to reshape edges surrounding a membrane hole. The thermoplasmonic method provides a general strategy to monitor the response to nanoscopic injuries to the cell surface.",

    "abstract": "PurposeUterine sarcomas are rare but deadly malignancies without effective treatment. The goal of this study was to characterize and identify potential mechanisms underlying observed variations in the immune microenvironment of different sarcoma subtypes, using integrated clinicopathological and molecular methods.\n\nExperimental designFifty-eight cases of uterine sarcoma with full clinicopathological annotation were analyzed for their immune landscape in the tumor microenvironment, gene, and protein expression. Cases included leiomyosarcoma (LMS; n=13), low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS; n=16), undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (UUS; n=26), and YWHAE-FAM22 translocation-bearing ESS (YFAM; n=3). Image analysis was used to quantify immune cells and immune regulatory proteins. Gene ontology and network enrichment analysis of matching transcriptomic data was used to relate over- and under expressed genes to pathways and further to the immune phenotype and clinicopathological findings.\n\nResultsImmune cell characterization revealed overall prevalence of regulatory T cells and the pro-tumor M2-like macrophages. Cytotoxic T cells were only found in ESS and UUS tumors. Expression of immune regulatory proteins was heterogeneous, with PD-L1 being undetectable. Hierarchical clustering of patients showed four immune signatures independent of tumor type, where infiltration of non-exhausted FOXP3+ cells and M1-like macrophages were associated with greater overall survival. High CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio in UUS and ESS was associated with poor survival and upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes and proteins and YAP nuclear localization.\n\nConclusionsUterine sarcomas present distinct immune signatures with prognostic value, independent of tumor type. This study suggests that the ECM is a potential regulator of the immune microenvironment in uterine sarcomas.",

We compared tumor cell populations with embryonic mouse sympatho-adrenal derivatives, and post-natal human adrenal gland. We provide evidence that low and high-risk neuroblastoma have different cell identities, representing two disease entities. Low-risk neuroblastoma presents a transcriptome that resembles sympatho- and chromaffin cells, whereas malignant cells enriched in high-risk neuroblastoma resembles an unknown subtype of TRKB+ cholinergic progenitor population identified in human post-natal gland. Analyses of these populations revealed different gene expression programs for worst and better survival in correlation with age at diagnosis.

To understand the molecular basis of enzalutamide resistance, we comprehensively analyzed prostate tumors and clinically relevant models. These studies revealed that enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells overexpress Tribbles 2 (Trib2), a pseudokinase. Expression of Trib2 is negatively regulated by androgen receptor signaling. Overexpression of Trib2 makes prostate cancer cells completely resistant to clinically relevant doses of enzalutamide. Trib2 downregulates expression of luminal markers but upregulates the neuronal transcription factor, BRN2, and the stemness factor, SOX2, to induce neuroendocrine differentiation. Our findings indicate that Trib2 confers resistance to enzalutamide therapy via a mechanism involving increased cellular plasticity and lineage switching.",

HEp-2 cells were exposed to increasing cortisol (hydrocortisone) concentrations for 24 or 48 hours, and cytotoxicity (MTT assay) proliferation assay (crystal violet assay), and immunolabeled 3D culture for fibronectin and FAK were analyzed. The group treated with hydrocortisone showed a significant increase in mitochondrial activity, as for the evaluation by the violet crystal, the treated group showed similar behavior to the control. The 3D culture showed dispersed cells within 24 hours with reduced FAK labeling; however, no changes were observed within 48 hours. Although some cases favored corticosteroid use in cancer patients, a more detailed analysis is necessary before prescribing them.",

In plants, AQPs have evolved to comprise a dynamic solute transport network occurring in all tissues and facilitating transport of water and vital solutes across various cellular membranes. Plant AQPs are involved in a multitude of plant physiological processes, however a better understanding is required of AQP structure-function relationships, multifunctionality and cell membrane localisation in order to begin to describe putative functional roles for the numerous plant AQP gene isoforms. Using an integrated approach, we characterised nine diverse Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) aquaporins, spanning the 3 largest AQP subfamilies (PIP, TIP, and NIP) and with varied gene expression profiles. High-throughput yeast-based functional screens identified novel candidates for water, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), boric acid (BA) and urea transport across the 3 AQP subfamilies. Using GFP translational fusions, AQPs observed in planta were localised to the plasma membrane, tonoplast and endoplasmic reticulum. AlphaFold protein models illustrated differences in pore shape and size across subfamilies. Our analysis supports the importance of functional data for deciphering unknown AQP structure-function relationships and uncovering novel candidates for in planta solute transport.",

    "abstract": "Verticillium wilt is a severe plant disease that causes massive losses in multiple crops. Increasing the plant resistance to Verticillium wilt is a critical challenge worldwide. Here, we report that the hemibiotrophic Verticillium dahliae (V. dahliae)-secreted Asp f2-like protein VDAL causes leaf wilting when applied to cotton leaves in vitro, but enhances the resistance to V. dahliae when overexpressed in Arabidopsis or cotton without affecting the plant growth and development. VDAL protein interacts with Arabidopsis E3 ligases PUB25 and PUB26 (PUBs) and is ubiquitinated by PUBs in vitro. However, VDAL is not degraded by PUB25 or PUB26 in planta. Besides, the pub25 pub26 double mutant shows higher resistance to V. dahliae than the wild type. PUBs interact with the transcription factor MYB6 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. MYB6 promotes plant resistance to Verticillium wilt while PUBs ubiquitinate MYB6 and mediate its degradation. VDAL competes with MYB6 for binding to PUBs, and the role of VDAL in increasing Verticillium wilt resistance depends on MYB6. Taken together, these results suggest that plants evolute a strategy to utilize the invaded effector protein VDAL to resist the V. dahliae infection without causing a hypersensitive response (HR), Alternatively, in order to take nutrients from host cells, hemibiotrophic pathogens may use some effectors to keep plant cells alive during its infection in order to take nutrients from host cells. This study provides the molecular mechanism for plants increasing disease resistance when overexpressing some effector proteins without inducing HR, and may promote searching for more genes from pathogenic fungi or bacteria to engineer plant disease resistance.\n\nOne-sentence summaryEctopically expressed VDAL in Arabidopsis alleviates the degradation of a positive disease response factor MYB6 through its interaction with PUB25/26 E3 ligases.",

Understanding genetic predisposition to IUGR is challenging, owing to extensive gene polymorphisms, linkage disequilibrium, and maternal and paternal influence. Here, we demonstrate that the inhibitory receptor, KIR2DL1, expressed on maternal uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, in interaction with the paternally-inherited HLA-C*05, an HLA-C group 2 allotype, expressed on fetal trophoblast cells, causes IUGR in a humanised mouse model. Micro-CT imaging of the uteroplacental vasculature revealed reduced uterine spiral artery diameter and increased segment length, increasing fetal blood flow resistance. Single cell RNA-Seq from the maternal-fetal interface highlighted expression programs activated by KIR2DL1-induced IUGR in several placental cell types, including degradation of extracellular matrix components, angiogenesis, and uNK cell communication, suggesting a complex response underlying IUGR. As current IUGR treatments are insufficient, our findings provide important insight for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is an oncogenic virus that enters cells by fusion of the viral and endosomal cellular membranes in a process mediated by viral surface glycoproteins. One of the cellular receptors hijacked by HHV-8 to gain access to cells is the EphA2 tyrosine kinase receptor, and the mechanistic basis of EphA2-mediated viral entry remains unclear. Using X-ray structure analysis, targeted mutagenesis and binding studies, we here show that the HHV-8 envelope glycoprotein complex gH/gL binds with sub-nanomolar affinity to EphA2 via molecular mimicry of the receptors cellular ligands, ephrins, revealing a pivotal role for the conserved gH residue E52 and the amino-terminal peptide of gL. Using FSI-FRET and cell contraction assays, we further demonstrate that the gH/gL complex also functionally mimics ephrin ligand by inducing EphA2 receptor association via its dimerization interface, thus triggering receptor signaling for cytoskeleton remodeling. These results now provide novel insight into the entry mechanism of HHV-8, opening avenues for the search of therapeutic agents that could interfere with HHV-8 related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is an important cause of bacterial infections worldwide, with multidrug resistant strains incurring substantial costs on human lives. Besides therapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in healthcare settings, the presence of sub-inhibitory antimicrobial residues in the environment and in the clinics selects for antimicrobial resistance (AMR), but the underlying genetic repertoire is less well understood. We used machine-learning to predict the population doubling time and growth yield of 1,432 genetically diverse E. coli expanding under exposure to three sub-inhibitory concentrations of six classes of antimicrobials from single nucleotide genetic variants, accessory gene variation and the presence of known AMR genes. We could predict cell yields in the held-out test data with an average correlation (Spearmans {rho}) of 0.63 (0.32 - 0.90 across concentrations) and cell doubling time with an average correlation of 0.47 (0.32 - 0.74 across concentrations), with moderate increases in sample size unlikely to improve predictions further. This points to the remaining missing heritability of growth under antimicrobials exposure being explained by effects that are too rare or weak to be captured unless sample size is dramatically increased, or by effects other than those conferred by the presence of individual SNPs and genes. Predictions based on whole genome information were generally superior to those based only on known AMR genes, and also accurate for AMR resistance at therapeutic concentrations. We also pinpointed genes and SNPs determining the predicted growth and thereby recapitulated the known AMR determinants. Finally, we estimated the effect sizes of resistance genes across the entire collection of strains, disclosing growth effects for known resistance genes for each strain. Our results underscore the potential of predictive modelling of growth patterns from genomic data under sub-inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials, although the remaining missing heritability poses an issue for achieving the accuracy and precision required for clinical use.\n\nImportancePredicting bacterial growth from genome sequences is important not only for a rapid characterization of strains in clinical diagnostic applications but for the identification of novel targets for drug discovery. Previous studies examined the relationship between bacterial growth and genotype in mutant libraries for laboratory strains, yet no study has so far examined the prediction power of genome sequences for bacterial growth in natural strains. In this study, we used a high throughput phenotypic assay to measure bacterial growth of a systematic collection of natural Escherichia coli strains and then employed machine learning models to predict bacterial growth from genomic data under non-therapeutic sub-inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials that are common in nonclinical settings. Our results revealed a moderate to strong correlation between predicted and actual values for different antimicrobials concentrations. Furthermore, the quantified effect of resistance genes on bacterial growth indicate these genes are still effective at sublethal antimicrobial concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Pond smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis) is a cold-freshwater fish species as a winter economic resource of aquaculture in South Korea. Due to its high susceptibility to abnormal water temperature from global warming, a large number of smelt die in hot summer. Here, we present the first draft genome of H. nipponensis and transcriptomic changes in molecular mechanisms or intracellular responses under heat stress. We combined Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies to generate the draft genome of H. nipponensis. Based on the reference genome, we conducted transcriptome analysis of liver and muscle tissues under normal (NT, 5{degrees}C) versus warm (HT, 23{degrees}C) conditions, to identify heat stress-induced genes and gene categories. We observed a total of 1,987 contigs, with N50 of 0.46 Mbp with a largest contig (3.03 Mbp) in the assembled genome. A total number of 20,644 protein coding genes were predicted, and 19,224 genes were functionally annotated: 15,955 genes for Gene Ontology (GO) terms; and 11,560 genes for KEGG Orthology (KO). We conducted the lost and gained genes analysis compared with three species that human, zebrafish and salmon. In the lost genes analysis, we detected smelt lost 4,461 (22.16%), 2,825 (10.62%), and 1,499 (3.09%) genes compare with above three species, respectively. In the gained genes analysis, we observed smelt gain 1,133 (5.49%), 1,670 (8.09%), and 229 (1.11%) genes compare with above species, respectively. From transcriptome analysis, a total of 297 and 331 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were identified in the liver and muscle tissues, respectively. Gene enrichment analysis of DEGs indicates that up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for lipid biosynthetic process (GO:0008610, P < 0.001) and regulation of apoptotic process (GO:0042981, P < 0.01), and down-regulated genes by immune responses such as myeloid cell differentiation (GO:0030099, P < 0.001) in the liver under heat stress. In muscle tissue, up-regulated genes were enriched for hypoxia (GO:0001666, P < 0.05), transcription regulator activity (GO:0140110, P < 0.001) and calcium-release channel activity (GO:0015278, P < 0.01), and down-regulated genes for nicotinamide nucleotide biosynthetic process (GO:0019359, P < 0.01). The results of KEGG pathway analysis were similar to that of gene enrichment analysis. The draft genome and transcriptomic of H. nipponensis will be used as a useful genetic resource for functional and evolutionary studies. Our findings will improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms and heat responses and will be useful for predicting survival of the smelt and its closely related species under global warming.",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery is the standard of care for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Unfortunately, response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is poor (<20%), as is the overall survival benefit at 5 years (5%). The EAC genome is complex and heterogeneous between patients, and it is not yet understood whether specific mutational patterns may result in chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance. To identify associations between genomic events and response to NAC in EAC, a comparative genomic analysis was performed in 65 patients with extensive clinical and pathological annotation using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We defined response using Mandard Tumor Regression Grade (TRG), with responders classified as TRG1-2 (n=27) and non-responders classified as TRG4-5 (n=38). We report a higher non-synonymous mutation burden in responders (median 2.08/Mb vs 1.70/Mb, P=0.036) and elevated copy number variation in non-responders (282 vs 136/patient, P<0.001). We identified copy number variants unique to each group in our cohort, with cell cycle (CDKN2A, CCND1), c-Myc (MYC), RTK/PIK3 (KRAS, EGFR) and gastrointestinal differentiation (GATA6) pathway genes being specifically altered in non-responders. Of note, NAV3 mutations were exclusively present in the non-responder group with a frequency of 22%. Thus, lower mutation burden, higher chromosomal instability and specific copy number alterations are associated with resistance to NAC.",

    "abstract": "The progression of precancerous lesions to malignancy is often accompanied by increasing complexity of chromosomal alterations but how these alterations arise is poorly understood. Here we performed haplotype-specific analysis of chromosomal copy-number evolution in the progression of Barretts esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) on multiregional whole-genome sequencing data of BE with dysplasia and microscopic EAC foci. We identified distinct patterns of copy-number evolution indicating multigenerational chromosomal instability that is initiated by cell division errors but propagated only after p53 loss. While abnormal mitosis, including whole-genome duplication, underlies chromosomal copy-number changes, segmental alterations display signatures of successive breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and chromothripsis of unstable dicentric chromosomes. Our analysis elucidates how multigenerational chromosomal instability generates copy-number variation in BE cells, precipitates complex alterations including DNA amplifications, and promotes their independent clonal expansion and transformation. In particular, we suggest sloping copy-number variation as a signature of ongoing chromosomal instability that precedes copy-number complexity.\n\nThese findings suggest copy-number heterogeneity in advanced cancers originates from chromosomal instability in precancerous cells and such instability may be identified from the presence of sloping copy-number variation in bulk sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe transcription of developmental regulatory genes is often controlled by multiple cis-regulatory elements. The identification and functional characterization of distal regulatory elements remains challenging, even in tractable model organisms like sea urchins.\n\nResultsWe evaluate the use of chromatin accessibility, transcription and RNA Polymerase II for their ability to predict enhancer activity of genomic regions in sea urchin embryos. ATAC-seq, PRO-seq, and Pol II ChIP-seq from early and late blastula embryos are manually contrasted with experimental cis-regulatory analyses available in sea urchin embryos, with particular attention to common developmental regulatory elements known to have enhancer and silencer functions differentially deployed among embryonic territories. Using the three functional genomic data types, machine learning models are trained and tested to classify and quantitatively predict the enhancer activity of several hundred genomic regions previously validated with reporter constructs in vivo.\n\nConclusionsOverall, chromatin accessibility and transcription have substantial power for predicting enhancer activity. For promoter-overlapping cis-regulatory elements in particular, the distribution of Pol II is the best predictor of enhancer activity in blastula embryos. Furthermore, ATAC- and PRO-seq predictive value is stage dependent for the promoter-overlapping subset. This suggests that the sequence of regulatory mechanisms leading to transcriptional activation have distinct relevance at different levels of the developmental gene regulatory hierarchy deployed during embryogenesis.",

Here, we aim to explore the cytogenotoxic effects of compound 3-epicaryoptin in Allium cepa root apical meristem cells. A. cepa roots were treated with 3-epicaryoptin (100, 150 & 200 g mL-1 concentration) and the standard compound colchicine (200 g mL-1 concentration) for 2, 4, 4+16 h (4 h treatment followed by 16 h recovery). Cytogenotoxicity was analysed by studying the root growth retardation (RGR), mitotic index (MI), and cellular aberrations. The result showed statistically significant (p<0.01), concentration-dependent RGR effects of 3-epicaryoptin treatment compared with the negative control. Study of cell frequency in different phases of cell division observed a significant (p<0.001) increase in the metaphase cell percentage (66.2{+/-}0.58 %, 150 g mL-1) and which subsequently caused an increase in the frequency of MI (12.29{+/-}0.34 %, 150 g mL-1) at 4h of 3-epicaryoptin treatment and that was comparable with the colchicine action. The cytological study revealed that the 3-epicaryoptin treatment could induce different types of chromosomal abnormalities such as colchicine like metaphase, vagrant chromosomes, sticky chromosomes, anaphase-bridge, and an increased frequency of micronuclei and polyploid cells. These findings indicate that 3-epicaryoptin is cytogenotoxic, and thus C. inerme should be used with caution in traditional medicine.",

Results obtained show that Paenibacillus sp.

We found that Paenibacillus sp. strain UY79 did not affect symbiotic association or growth promotion of alfalfa plants when co-inoculated with rhizobia. By whole genome sequence analysis, we determined that strain UY79 is a new species of Paenibacillus within the Paenibacillus polymyxa complex. Diverse genes putatively involved in biocontrol activity were identified in the UY79 genome. Moreover, according to genome mining and antibiosis assays, strain UY79 would have the capability to modulate the growth of bacteria commonly found in soil/plant communities.\n\nIMPORTANCEPhytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes are responsible for causing devastating losses in agricultural crops. Therefore, there is an enormous interest in the development of effective and complementary strategies that allow the control of the phytopathogens, reducing the input of agrochemicals in croplands. Discovery of new strains with expanded antifungal activities and with a broad spectrum of action is challenging and of great future impact. Diverse strains belonging to the P. polymyxa complex have been reported to be effective biocontrol agents. Results presented here show that the novel discovered strain of Paenibacillus sp. presents diverse traits involved in antagonistic activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens and would be a potential and valuable strain to be further assessed for the development of biofungicides.",

    "abstract": "Vascular networks are comprised of endothelial cells and mural cells, which include pericytes and smooth muscle cells. It is well established that new endothelial cells are derived from pre-existing ones during the angiogenic phase of blood vessel growth. By contrast, mural cell ontogeny is less clear with an ongoing debate whether mural cells possess mesenchymal stem cell properties. To elucidate the mechanisms controlling mural cell recruitment during development and tissue regeneration, we studied the formation of zebrafish caudal fin arteries. Mural cells showed morphological heterogeneity: cells colonizing arteries proximal to the body wrapped around them, while those in more distal regions extended protrusions along the proximo-distal vascular axis. Despite these differences, both cell populations expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) and the smooth muscle cell marker myosin heavy chain 11a (Myh11a). Loss of Pdgfrb signalling during development or tissue regeneration resulted in a substantial decrease in mural cells at the vascular front, while those proximal to the body were less affected. Using lineage tracing, we demonstrate that precursor cells located in periarterial regions of the caudal fin and expressing Pgdfrb can give rise to mural cells, while in regeneration newly formed mural cells were not derived from pre-existing ones. Together, our findings reveal conserved roles for pdgfrb signalling in development and regeneration, while at the same time illustrating a limited capacity of mural cells to self-renew or contribute to other cell types during tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "In early placental development, progenitor cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) differentiate along one of two cellular trajectories: the villous or extravillous pathways. CTBs committed to the villous pathway fuse with neighboring CTBs to form the outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), while CTBs committed to the extravillous pathway differentiate into invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVT). Unfortunately, little is known about the processes controlling human CTB progenitor maintenance and differentiation. To address this, we established a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from first trimester placentas to identify cell states important in trophoblast progenitor establishment, renewal, and differentiation. Multiple distinct trophoblast states were identified, representing progenitor CTBs, column CTBs, SCT precursors, and EVT. Lineage trajectory analysis identified a progenitor origin that was reproduced in human trophoblast stem cell organoids. Heightened expression of basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) defined this primitive state, where BCAM enrichment or gene silencing resulted in enhanced or diminished organoid growth. Together, this work describes at high-resolution trophoblast heterogeneity within the first trimester, resolves gene networks within human CTB progenitors, and identifies BCAM as a primitive progenitor marker and possible regulator.\n\nSummary StatementLineage trajectory modeling identifies multiple human progenitor trophoblast states and defines trophoblast differentiation kinetics, where BCAM-expressing progenitors demonstrate enhanced regenerative ability.",

CTBs committed to the villous pathway fuse with neighboring CTBs to form the outer multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), while CTBs committed to the extravillous pathway differentiate into invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVT). Unfortunately, little is known about the processes controlling human CTB progenitor maintenance and differentiation. To address this, we established a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from first trimester placentas to identify cell states important in trophoblast progenitor establishment, renewal, and differentiation. Multiple distinct trophoblast states were identified, representing progenitor CTBs, column CTBs, SCT precursors, and EVT. Lineage trajectory analysis identified a progenitor origin that was reproduced in human trophoblast stem cell organoids. Heightened expression of basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM) defined this primitive state, where BCAM enrichment or gene silencing resulted in enhanced or diminished organoid growth. Together, this work describes at high-resolution trophoblast heterogeneity within the first trimester, resolves gene networks within human CTB progenitors, and identifies BCAM as a primitive progenitor marker and possible regulator.\n\nSummary StatementLineage trajectory modeling identifies multiple human progenitor trophoblast states and defines trophoblast differentiation kinetics, where BCAM-expressing progenitors demonstrate enhanced regenerative ability.",

Yet, gathering statistics of growing organoids is currently limited by existing imaging methods and subsequent image analysis workflows that are either restricted to 2D, limited in resolution, or with a low throughput. Here, we present an automated high content imaging platform synergizing high density organoid cultures with 3D live light-sheet imaging. The platform is an add-on to a standard inverted microscope. We demonstrate our capacity to collect libraries of 3D images at a rate of 300 organoids per hour, enabling training of artificial intelligence-based algorithms to quantify the organoid morphogenetic organization at multiple scales with subcellular resolution. We validate our approach on different organotypic cell cultures (stem, primary, and cancer), and quantify the development of hundreds of neuroectoderm organoids (from human Embryonic Stem Cells) at cellular, multicellular and whole organoid scales.",

    "abstract": "Tandem-repeat proteins comprise small secondary structure motifs that stack to form one-dimensional arrays with distinctive mechanical properties that are proposed to direct their cellular functions. Here, we use single-molecule optical tweezers to study the folding of consensus-designed tetratricopeptide repeats (CTPRs) -- superhelical arrays of short helix-turn-helix motifs. We find that CTPRs display a spring-like mechanical response in which individual repeats undergo rapid equilibrium fluctuations between folded and unfolded conformations. We rationalise the force response using Ising models and dissect the folding pathway of CTPRs under mechanical load, revealing how the repeat arrays form from the centre towards both termini simultaneously. Strikingly, we also directly observe the proteins superhelical tertiary structure in the force signal. Using protein engineering, crystallography and single-molecule experiments, we show how the superhelical geometry can be altered by carefully placed amino-acid substitutions and examine how these sequence changes affect intrinsic repeat stability and inter-repeat coupling. Our findings provide the means to dissect and modulate repeat-protein stability and dynamics, which will be essential for researchers to understand the function of natural repeat proteins and to exploit artificial repeats proteins in nanotechnology and biomedical applications.\n\nSignificance statementRepetition of biological building blocks is crucial to modulating and diversifying structure and function of biomolecules across all organisms. In tandem-repeat proteins, the linear arrangement of small structural motifs leads to the formation of striking supramolecular shapes. Using a combination of single-molecule biophysical techniques and modelling approaches, we dissect the spring-like nature of a designed repeat protein and demonstrate how its shape and mechanics can be manipulated by design. These novel insights into the biomechanical and biochemical characteristics of this protein class give us a methodological basis from which to understand the biological functions of repeat proteins and to exploit them in nanotechnology and biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "Numerous cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa), are addicted to transcription programs driven by superenhancers (SEs). The transcription of genes at SEs is enabled by the formation of phase-separated condensates by transcription factors and co-activators with intrinsically disordered regions. The androgen receptor (AR), main oncogenic driver in PCa, contains large disordered regions and is co-recruited with the co-activator MED1 to SEs to promote oncogenic programs. In this work, we show that dynamic AR-rich, liquid-like foci form in PCa models upon androgen stimulation and correlate with AR transcriptional activity. The co-activator MED1 plays an essential role in the formation of AR foci while AR antagonists hinder their formation. These results suggest that enhanced compartmentalization of AR and co-activators at SEs may play an important role in the activation of oncogenic transcription programs in PCa. A better understanding of the assembly and the regulation of these AR-rich compartments may provide novel therapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "The diabetes drug canagliflozin acts primarily by inhibiting glucose reuptake by the sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidney proximal tubule, thereby lowering serum glucose levels. Canagliflozin also acts on SGLT1, a related transporter responsible for glucose uptake in the small intestine and more distal kidney tubules. Several cancers overexpress SGLT1 and SGLT2, where these transporters fuel tumor metabolism. A recent study by NIAs Interventions Testing Program (ITP) showed that canagliflozin treatment extends lifespan in male mice. Since cancer is the major cause of death in most mouse strains, including the UM-HET3 strain used by the ITP, this observation suggests that canagliflozin might exert anti-cancer effects in this context. Here, we treated a commonly-used mouse neoplasia model -- the intestinal adenoma-prone APCMin/+ strain -- with canagliflozin, to test the effects of drug treatment on tumor burden. Surprisingly, canagliflozin increased the total area of intestine involved by adenomas, an effect that was most marked in the distal intestine and in female mice. Immunohistochemical analysis suggested that canagliflozin may not influence adenoma growth via direct SGLT1/2 inhibition in neoplastic cells themselves. Instead, our results are most consistent with a model whereby canagliflozin aggravates adenoma development by altering the anatomic distribution of intestinal glucose absorption, as evidenced by increases in postprandial GLP-1 levels consistent with delayed glucose absorption. Our results suggest that canagliflozin exacerbates adenomatosis in the APCMin/+ model via complex, cell-non-autonomous mechanisms, and hint that sex differences in incretin responses may underlie differential effects of this drug on lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Human ribosomes, made of around 80 ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four ribosomal RNAs, have long been thought as uniform passive protein-making factories with little regulatory function. Recently, accumulating evidence showed heterogeneity of RP composition in ribosomes responsible for regulating gene expression in development and tumorigenesis. However, a comprehensive understanding of regulatory spectrum of RPs is still lacking. In this study, we conducted a systematic survey of regulatory specificity of human RPs on global gene expression. We quantified translational and transcriptional changes of gene expression upon deficiency of 75 RPs, including 44 from the large subunit (60S) and 31 from the small subunit (40S), by ribosomal profiling and RNA sequencing analysis. We showed that RP deficiency induced diverse expression changes, particularly at the translational level. RPs were subjected to co-translational regulation under ribosomal stress where deficiency of the 60S and the 40S RPs had opposite effects on the two subunits. RP deficiency perturbed expression of genes related to cell cycle, cellular metabolism, signal transduction and development. Deficiency of RPs from the 60S led to a greater repression effect on cell growth than that from the 40S by perturbing P53 signaling and cell cycle pathways. To demonstrate functional specificity of RPs, we showed that RPS8 deficiency stimulated cellular apoptosis and RPL13 or RPL18 deficiency promoted cellular senescence. We also showed that RPL11 and RPL15 played important roles in retina development and angiogenesis, respectively. Overall, our study demonstrated a widespread regulatory role of RPs in controlling cellular activity, providing an important resource which can offer novel insights into ribosome regulation in human diseases and cancer.",

Recent advances in single cell transcriptional approaches have enabled an examination of the human liver with unprecedented resolution. However, dissociation related cell perturbation can limit the ability to fully capture the human livers parenchymal cell fraction, which limits the ability to comprehensively profile this organ. Here, we report the transcriptional landscape of 73,295 cells from the human liver using matched single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). The addition of snRNA-seq enabled the characterization of interzonal hepatocytes at single-cell resolution, revealed the presence of rare subtypes of hepatic stellate cells previously only seen in disease, and detection of cholangiocyte progenitors that had only been observed during in vitro differentiation experiments. However, T and B lymphocytes and NK cells were only distinguishable using scRNA-seq, highlighting the importance of applying both technologies to obtain a complete map of tissue-resident cell-types. We validated the distinct spatial distribution of the hepatocyte, cholangiocyte and stellate cell populations by an independent spatial transcriptomics dataset and immunohistochemistry. Our study provides a systematic comparison of the transcriptomes captured by scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq and delivers a high-resolution map of the parenchymal cell populations in the healthy human liver.",

Our core genome phylogeny of almost 300 genomes suggests that there were several introductions of lineages from international clone 2 into the hospital. The molecular dating analysis shows that these introductions happened between 2004 and 2015. Furthermore, using the accessory genome, we show that these lineages were extensively disseminated across many wards in the hospital.

The constant expansion of newly-identified lncRNA genes requires that each one be comprehensively annotated to understand its molecular functions.

In this study, we show that it is exclusively conserved among non-human primates, suggesting its recent evolution and is expressed and processed into 12 distinct RNAs in testis, cervix, and uterus tissues. Further, we integrate de novo annotation of expressed LINC01016 transcripts and isoform-dependent gene expression analyses to show that human LINC01016 is a multi-exon gene, processed through differential exon usage with isoform-specific functions. Furthermore, in gynecological cancers, such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, LINC01016 is downregulated; however, its higher expression is predictive of relapse-free survival in these cancers. Collectively, these analyses reveal that, unlike coding RNAs, lncRNA isoforms are differentially regulated and precisely processed in specific tissues to perform distinct biological roles.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe distinct molecular role of LINC01016 isoforms reveals intricate biology associated with lncRNA transcription and processing.",

    "abstract": "Neural and functional recovery in lampreys from spinal cord transection has been well documented. However, the extent of axon regeneration is highly variable and it is not known whether it is related to the level of behavioral recovery. To address this, we examined how swimming kinematics were related to axon regeneration by quantifying the relationship between swimming performance and percent axon regeneration of transected lampreys after 11 weeks of recovery. We found that swimming speed was not related to percent axon regeneration but it was closely related to body wave frequency and speed. However, wave frequency and speed varied greatly within individuals which resulted in swimming speed also varying within individuals. In fact, most recovered individuals, regardless of percent axon regeneration, could swim at fast and slow speeds. However, none of the transected individuals were able to generate body waves as large as the control lampreys. In order to swim faster, transected lampreys increased their wave frequencies and, as a result, transected lampreys had much higher frequencies than control lamprey at comparable swimming velocities. These data suggest that the control lampreys swam more efficiently than transected lampreys. In conclusion, there appears to be a minimal recovery threshold in terms of percent axon regeneration required for lampreys to be capable of swimming, however, there also seems to be a limit to how much they can behaviorally recover.",

    "abstract": "The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria functions as a selective permeability barrier. Escherichia coli periplasmic Zn-metallopeptidase BepA contributes to the maintenance of OM integrity through its involvement in the biogenesis and degradation of LptD, a {beta}-barrel protein component of the lipopolysaccharide translocon. BepA either promotes the maturation of LptD when it is on the normal assembly pathway (on-pathway) or degrades it when its assembly is compromised (off-pathway). BepA performs these functions probably on the {beta}-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex. However, how BepA recognizes and directs an immature LptD to different pathways remains unclear. Here, we explored the interactions among BepA, LptD, and the BAM complex. We found that the interaction of the BepA edge-strand located adjacent to the active site with LptD was crucial not only for proteolysis but also, unexpectedly, for assembly promotion of LptD. Site-directed crosslinking analyses indicated that the unstructured N-terminal half of the {beta}-barrel-forming domain of an immature LptD contacts with the BepA edge-strand. Furthermore, the C-terminal region of the {beta}-barrel-forming domain of the BepA-bound LptD intermediate interacted with a \"seam\" strand of BamA, suggesting that BepA recognized LptD assembling on the BAM complex. Our findings provide important insights into the functional mechanism of BepA.",

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and other emerging strains are difficult to treat with antibiotics, so drug-free sutures with antimicrobial properties are a solution. Functionalized spider silk protein (spidroin) is a candidate for its extraordinary strength because it has a large repetitive region (150Rep) that forms crosslinked beta-sheets. The antimicrobial peptide HNP-1 can be connected to recombinant spidroin to create antimicrobial silk. Ni-NTA purified 2Rep-HNP1 fusion protein was mixed with recombinant NT2RepCT spidroin at 1:25, 1:20, 1:10 ratios, and spun into silk fibers by syringe-pumping protein into a 100% isopropanol bath. Beta-sheet crosslinking of the identical 2Rep regions tagged the 2Rep-HNP1 permanently onto the resultant silk. Silk showed no sign of degradation in an autoclave, PBS, or EtOH. The tagged 2Rep-HNP1 retained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity >90% against S. aureus and E. coli as measured by log reduction and radial diffusion assay. Furthermore, a modified expression protocol increased protein yield of NT2RepCT 2.8-fold, and variable testing of the spinning process demonstrated the industrial viability of silk production.

    "abstract": "Tyrosine-sulfated peptides are key regulators of plant growth and development. The disulfated pentapeptide phytosulfokine (PSK) mediates growth via leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases, PSKR1 and PSKR2. PSKRs are part of a response module at the plasma membrane that mediates short-term growth responses, but downstream signaling of transcriptional regulation remains unexplored. In Arabidopsis, tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by a single-copy gene (TPST). We performed a microarray-based transcriptome analysis in the tpst-1 mutant background that lacks sulfated peptides to identify PSK-regulated genes and genes that are regulated by other sulfated peptides. Of the 160 PSK-regulated genes, several had functions in root growth and development in agreement with shorter roots and a higher lateral root density in tpst-1. Further, tpst-1 roots developed higher numbers of root hairs and PSK induced expression of WEREWOLF (WER), its paralog MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 23 (MYB23) and At1g66800 that maintain non-hair cell fate. The tpst-1 pskr1-3 pskr2-1 mutant showed even shorter roots, and higher lateral root and root hair density than tpst-1 revealing unexpected synergistic effects of ligand and PSK receptor deficiencies. While residual activities may exist, overexpression of PSKR1 in the tpst-1 background induced root growth suggesting that PSKR1 may be active in the absence of sulfated ligands.\n\nHighlightPhytosulfokine (PSK) receptor signaling promotes root elongation, determines lateral root density and maintains non-hair cell fate partially independent of TPST responsible for the activating sulfation of PSK.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic synaptic scaling allows for bi-directional adjustment of the strength of synaptic connections in response to changes in their input. Protein phosphorylation modulates many neuronal and synaptic processes, but it has not been studied on a global, proteome-wide scale during synaptic scaling. To examine this, we used LC-MS/MS analyses to measure changes in the phosphoproteome in response to up- or down-scaling in cultured cortical neurons over minutes to 24 hours. Out of 45,000 phosphorylation events measured, ~3,300 (associated with 1,280 phospho-proteins) were regulated by homeostatic scaling. The activity-sensitive phosphoproteins were predominantly located at synapses and involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. We identified many early transient phosphorylation events which could serve as sensors for the activity offset as well as late and/or persistent phosphoregulation that could represent effector mechanisms driving the homeostatic response. Much of the persistent phosphorylation was reciprocally regulated by up- or down-scaling, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying these two poles of synaptic regulation make use of a common signaling axis.",

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion in the HTT gene that codes for an elongated polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. HTT is subject to multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate its cellular function. Mutating specific PTM sites within mutant HTT (mHTT) in HD mouse models can modulate disease phenotypes, highlighting the key role of HTT PTMs in the pathogenesis of HD. These findings have led to increased interest in developing small molecules to modulate HTT PTMs in order to decrease mHTT toxicity. However, the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological modulation of HTT PTMs in preclinical HD models remains largely unknown. HTT is palmitoylated at cysteine 214 by the huntingtin-interacting protein 14 (HIP14 or ZDHHC17) and 14-like (HIP14L or ZDHHC13) acyltransferases. Here, we assessed if HTT palmitoylation should be regarded as a therapeutic target to treat HD by (1) investigating palmitoylation dysregulation in rodent and human HD model systems, (2) measuring the impact of mHTT-lowering therapy on brain palmitoylation, and (3) evaluating if HTT palmitoylation can be pharmacologically modulate. We show that palmitoylation of mHTT and some HIP14/HIP14L-substrates is decreased early in multiple HD mouse models, and that aging further reduces HTT palmitoylation. Lowering mHTT in the brain of YAC128 mice is not sufficient to rescue aberrant palmitoylation. However, we demonstrate that mHTT palmitoylation can be normalized in COS-7 cells, in YAC128 cortico-striatal primary neurons and HD patient-derived lymphoblasts using an acyl-protein thioesterase (APT) inhibitor. Moreover, we show that modulating palmitoylation reduces mHTT aggregation and mHTT-induced cytotoxicity in COS-7 cells and YAC128 neurons.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPalmitoylation of mHTT is reduced in multiple transgenic HD mouse models\nC_LIO_LIHTT palmitoylation decreases with increasing polyQ length in HD patient cells\nC_LIO_LImHTT-lowering in mouse brains does not rescue aberrant palmitoylation\nC_LIO_LImHTT palmitoylation in HD patient-derived cells can be rescued via APT inhibition\nC_LIO_LIPromoting palmitoylation reduces mHTT aggregation and cytotoxicity in vitro\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to delays between actions and sensory feedback is important for efficiently interacting with our environment. Adaptation may rely on predictions of action-feedback pairing (motor-sensory component), or predictions of tactile-proprioceptive sensation from the action and sensory feedback of the action (inter-sensory component). Reliability of temporal information might differ across sensory feedback modalities (e.g. auditory or visual), influencing adaptation. Here, we investigated the role of motor-sensory and inter-sensory components on sensorimotor temporal recalibration for motor-auditory events (button press-tone) and motor-visual events (button press-Gabor patch). In the adaptation phase of the experiment, the motor action-feedback event pairs were presented with systematic temporal delays (0ms or 150ms). In the subsequent test phase, sensory feedback of the action were presented with variable delays. The participants were then asked whether this delay could be detected. To disentangle motor-sensory from inter-sensory component, we varied movements (active button press or passive depression of button) at adaptation and test. Our results suggest that motor-auditory recalibration is mainly driven by motor-sensory component, whereas motor-visual recalibration is mainly driven by inter-sensory component. Recalibration transferred from vision to audition, but not from audition to vision. These results indicate that motor-sensory and inter-sensory components of recalibration are weighted in a modality-dependent manner.",

Particularly, how activity is integrated within a cortical area depending on its topography is unknown. Here, we trained mice expressing channelrhodopsin in cortical excitatory neurons to track a bar photostimulation that rotated smoothly over the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). When photostimulation was aimed at vS1, the area which contains a contiguous representation of the whisker array at the periphery, mice could learn to discriminate angular positions of the bar to obtain a reward. In contrast, they could not learn the task when the photostimulation was aimed at the representation of the trunk and legs in S1, where neighboring zones represent distant peripheral body parts, introducing discontinuities. Mice demonstrated anticipation of reward availability, specifically when cortical topography enabled to predict future sensory activation. These results are particularly helpful for designing efficient cortical sensory neuroprostheses.\n\nTeaserOptogenetic stimulation sweeping the cortical surface: A way to provide precise sensory information and guide behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The development of many systemic autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, is associated with overactivation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway, lymphopenia, and increased follicular helper T (Tfh) cell differentiation. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these immunological perturbations remain incompletely understood. Here we show that the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) promotes Tfh differentiation and disrupts Treg homeostasis. Inactivation of mTORC2 in total T cells, but not in Tregs, greatly ameliorated the immunopathology in a systemic autoimmunity mouse model. This was associated with reduced Tfh differentiation, B cell activation, and reduced T cell glucose metabolism. Finally, we show that type I IFN can synergize with TCR ligation to activate mTORC2 in T cells, which partially contributes to T cell lymphopenia. These data indicate that mTORC2 may act as downstream of type I IFN, TCR, and costimulatory receptor ICOS, to promote glucose metabolism, Tfh differentiation, and T cell lymphopenia, but not to suppress Treg function in systemic autoimmunity. Our results suggest that mTORC2 might be a rational target for systemic autoimmunity treatment.",

In this study, we show that epithelial Gpr35 plays a critical role in goblet cell function. In mice, cell type-specific deletion of Gpr35 in epithelial cells but not in macrophages results in goblet cell depletion and dysbiosis, rendering these animals more susceptible to Citrobacter rodentium infection. Mechanistically, scRNA-seq analysis indicates that signaling of epithelial Gpr35 is essential to maintain normal pyroptosis levels in goblet cells. Our work shows that the epithelial presence of Gpr35 is a critical element for the function of goblet cell-mediated symbiosis between host and microbiota.",

For the Cas12a/Cas13a-based signal detection phase, we determine buffer conditions and substrate range for optimal detection performance. By comparing several chemical additives, we find that addition of L-proline can secure or enhance Cas12a/Cas13a detection capability. For isothermal amplification phase with typical LAMP and RPA methods, inclusion of L-proline can also enhance specific target amplification as determined by CRISPR detection. Using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we demonstrate CECRID has enhanced detection sensitivity over chemical additive-null method with either fluorescence or lateral flow strip readout.

Our rapidly increasing ability to quantify functional, compositional, and structural genomic diversity of populations forces the question of how to balance conservation goals - should the focus be on important functional diversity and key life history traits or on maximizing genomic diversity as a whole? Specifically, the intra-specific diversity (biocomplexity) comprised of phenotypic and genetic variation can determine the ability of a population to respond to changing environmental conditions. Here, we explore the biocomplexity of Californias Central Valley Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) population complex at the genomic level. Notably, despite apparent gene flow among individuals with the same migration (life history) phenotypes inhabiting different tributaries, each group is characterized by a surprising component of unique genomic diversity. Our results emphasize the importance of formulating conservation goals focused on maintaining biocomplexity at both the phenotypic and genotypic level. Doing so will maintain the species adaptive potential and increase the probability of persistence of the population complex despite changing environmental pressures.",

The magnitude of forest damages and the rates and mechanisms of forest recovery following Maria provide important benchmarks for understanding the ecology of extreme events. We used airborne lidar data acquired before (2017) and after Maria (2018, 2020) to quantify landscape-scale changes in forest structure along a 439-ha elevational gradient (100 to 800 m) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest.

Yet only 13% of the study area had canopy heights [&le;]2 m in 2018, a typical threshold for forest gaps, highlighting the importance of damaged trees and advanced regeneration on post-storm forest structure. Heterogeneous patterns of regrowth and recruitment yielded shorter and more open forests by 2020. Nearly 45% of forests experienced initial height loss (<-1 m, 2017-2018) followed by rapid height gain (>1 m, 2018-2020), whereas 21.6% of forests with initial height losses showed little or no height gain, and 17.8% of forests exhibited no structural changes >|1| m in either period. Canopy layers <10 m accounted for most increases in canopy height and fractional cover between 2018-2020, with gains split evenly between height growth and lateral crown expansion by surviving individuals.

    "abstract": "Females and males may face different selection pressures, such that alleles conferring a benefit in one sex may be deleterious in the other. Such sexual antagonism has received a great deal of theoretical and empirical attention, almost all of which has focused on diploids. However, a sizeable minority of animals display an alternative haplodiploid mode of inheritance, encompassing both arrhenotoky, whereby males develop from unfertilized eggs, and paternal genome elimination (PGE), whereby males receive but do not transmit a paternal genome. Alongside unusual genetics, haplodiploids often exhibit social ecologies that modulate the relative value of females and males. Here we develop a series of evolutionary-genetic models of sexual antagonism for haplodiploids, incorporating details of their molecular biology and social ecology. We find that: 1) PGE promotes female-beneficial alleles more than arrhenotoky, and to an extent determined by the timing of elimination - and degree of silencing of - the paternal genome; 2) sib-mating relatively promotes female-beneficial alleles, as do other forms of inbreeding, including limited male-dispersal, oedipal-mating, and the pseudo-hermaphroditism of Icerya purchasi; 3) resource competition between related females relatively inhibits female-beneficial alleles; and 4) sexual antagonism foments conflicts between parents and offspring, endosymbionts and hosts, and maternal-origin and paternal-origin genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEffective autonomous exoskeletons will need to be useful at a variety of walking speeds, but we do not know how optimal exoskeleton assistance should change with speed. Optimal exoskeleton assistance may increase with speed similar to biological torque changes or a well-tuned assistance profile may be effective at a variety of speeds.\n\nMethodsWe optimized hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance to reduce metabolic cost for three participants walking at 1.0 m/s, 1.25 m/s and 1.5 m/s. We measured metabolic cost, muscle activity, exoskeleton assistance and kinematics. We performed two tailed paired t-tests to determine significance.\n\nResultsExoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking compared to wearing the exoskeleton with no torque applied by 26%, 47% and 50% at 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 m/s, respectively. For all three participants, optimized exoskeleton ankle torque was the smallest for slow walking, while hip and knee torque changed slightly with speed in ways that varied across participants. Total applied positive power increased with speed for all three participants, largely due to increased joint velocities, which consistently increased with speed.\n\nConclusionsExoskeleton assistance is effective at a range of speeds and is most effective at medium and fast walking speeds. Exoskeleton assistance was less effective for slow walking, which may explain the limited success in reducing metabolic cost for patient populations through exoskeleton assistance. Exoskeleton designers may have more success when targeting activities and groups with faster walking speeds. Speed-related changes in optimized exoskeleton assistance varied by participant, indicating either the benefit of participant-specific tuning or that a wide variety of torque profiles are similarly effective.",

    "abstract": "Microphysiological systems mimic the in-vivo cellular ensemble and microenvironment with the goal of providing more human-like models for biopharmaceutical research. We report the first such model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB-on-chip) featuring both isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cells and continuous barrier integrity monitoring with <2-minute temporal resolution. We showcase its capabilities in the first microphysiological study of nitrosative stress and antioxidant prophylaxis. Relying on off-stoichiometry thiol-ene epoxy (OSTE+) for fabrication greatly facilitates assembly and sensor integration compared to the prevalent polydimethylsiloxane devices. The integrated cell-substrate endothelial resistance monitoring allows us to capture formation and breakdown of our blood-brain barrier model, consisting of co-cultured hiPSC-derived endothelial-like and astrocyte-like cells. We observe clear cellular disruption when exposing the BBB-on-chip to the nitrosative stressor linsidomine, and report on the barrier permeability and barrier-protective effects of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide. Using metabolomic network analysis, we further find drug-induced changes consistent with prior literature regarding, e.g., cysteine and glutathione involvement. A model like ours opens new possibilities for drug screening studies and personalized medicine, relying solely on isogenic human-derived cells and providing high-resolution temporal readouts that can help in pharmacodynamic studies.",

    "abstract": "The development of highly scalable single cell transcriptome technology has resulted in the creation of thousands of datasets, over 30 in the retina alone. Analyzing the transcriptomes between different projects is highly desirable as this would allow for better assessment of which biological effects are consistent across independent studies. However it is difficult to compare and contrast data across different projects as there are substantial batch effects from computational processing, single cell technology utilized, and the natural biological variation. While many single cell transcriptome specific batch correction methods purport to remove the technical noise it is difficult to ascertain which method functions works best. We developed a lightweight R package (scPOP) that brings in batch integration methods and uses a simple heuristic to balance batch merging and celltype/cluster purity. We use this package along with a Snakefile based workflow system to demonstrate how to optimally merge 766,615 cells from 33 retina datsets and three species to create a massive ocular single cell transcriptome meta-atlas. This provides a model how to efficiently create meta-atlases for tissues and cells of interest.",

    "abstract": "Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies uncovered an unexpected complexity in tumors, underlining the relevance of intratumor heterogeneity to cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Heterogeneity in the mutational composition of cancer cells is a result of distinct (sub)clonal expansions, each with a distinct metastatic potential and resistance to specific treatments. Unfortunately, due to their low read coverage per cell, scRNAseq datasets are too sparse and noisy to be used for detecting expressed mutations in single cells. Additionally, the large number of cells and mutations present in typical scRNAseq datasets are too large for available computational tools to, e.g., infer distinct subclones, lineages or trajectories in a tumor. Finally, there are no principled methods to assess distinct subclones inferred through single-cell sequencing data and the genomic alterations that seed and potentially cause them. Here we present Trisicell, a computational toolkit for scalable mutational intratumor heterogeneity inference and assessment from scRNAseq as well as single-cell genome or exome sequencing data. Trisicell allows reliable identification of distinct clonal lineages of a tumor, offering the ability to focus on the most important subclones and the genomic alterations that are associated with tumor proliferation. We comprehensively assessed Trisicell on a melanoma model by comparing distinct lineages and subclones it identifies on scRNAseq data, to those inferred using matching bulk whole exome (bWES) and transcriptome (bWTS) sequencing data from clonal sublines derived from single cells. Our results demonstrate that distinct lineages and subclones of a tumor can be reliably inferred and evaluated based on mutation calls from scRNAseq data through the use of Trisicell. Additionally, they reveal a strong correlation between aggressiveness and mutational composition, both across the inferred subclones, and among human melanomas. We also applied Trisicell to infer and evaluate distinct subclonal expansion patterns of the same mouse melanoma model after treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). After integratively analyzing our cell-specific mutation calls with their expression profiles, we observed that each subclone with a distinct set of novel somatic mutations is strongly associated with a specific developmental status. Moreover, each subclone had developed a unique ICB-resistance mechanism. These results demonstrate that Trisicell can robustly utilize scRNAseq data to delineate intratumor heterogeneity and help understand biological mechanisms underlying tumor progression and resistance to therapy.",

We have coupled fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting together with single-nucleus mRNA sequencing to construct a gene expression atlas of Arabidopsis thaliana early embryos at single-cell resolution. In addition to characterizing cell-specific transcriptomes, we found evidence that distinct epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms operate across emerging embryonic cell types.

These signals include the internal nutritional status, and in plants, TOR has been shown to be regulated by carbon, nitrogen and sulfur availability. In this study, we show that in Arabidopsis the TOR pathway also integrates phosphorus availability to actively modulate the cell cycle, which in turn regulates the intracellular content of amino acids and organic acids. We observed a substantial overlap between the phenotypic, metabolic and transcriptomic responses of TOR inactivation and phosphorus starvation in Arabidopsis cell culture. Although phosphorus availability modulates TOR activity, changes in the levels of TOR activity do not alter the expression of marker genes for phosphorus status. These data prompted us to place the sensing of phosphorus availability upstream of the modulation of TOR activity which, in turn, regulates the cell cycle and primary metabolism to adjust plant growth in plants.",

    "abstract": "RNA helicases play crucial functions in RNA biology. In plants, RNA helicases are encoded by large gene families, performing roles in abiotic stress responses, development, the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression as well as house-keeping functions. Several of these RNA helicases are targeted to the organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Cyanobacteria are the direct evolutionary ancestors of plant chloroplasts. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 encodes a single DEAD-box RNA helicase, CrhR, that is induced by a range of abiotic stresses, including low temperature. Though the {Delta}crhR mutant exhibits a severe cold-sensitive phenotype, the physiological function(s) performed by CrhR have not been described. To identify transcripts interacting with CrhR, we performed RNA co-immunoprecipitation with extracts from a Synechocystis crhR deletion mutant expressing the FLAG-tagged native CrhR or a K57A mutated version with an anticipated enhanced RNA binding. The composition of the interactome was strikingly biased towards photosynthesis-associated and redox-controlled transcripts. A transcript highly enriched in all experiments was the crhR mRNA, suggesting an auto-regulatory molecular mechanism. The identified interactome explains the described physiological role of CrhR in response to the redox poise of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and characterizes CrhR as an enzyme with a diverse range of transcripts as molecular targets.\n\nHighlightThe cyanobacterial DEAD-box RNA helicase CrhR binds mainly photosynthesis-associated and redox-controlled transcripts connecting its regulation, localization and phenotypes of mutants for the first time with a set of potential RNA targets.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal remodeling after brain injury is essential for functional recovery. After unilateral cortical lesion, axons from the intact cortex ectopically project to the denervated midbrain to compensate for the lost function, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address this issue, we examined gene expression profiles in denervated and intact mouse midbrains after hemispherectomy at P6, when ectopic contralateral projection occurs robustly. The analysis showed that various axon growth-related genes were upregulated in the denervated midbrain, and most of these genes are reportedly expressed by astrocytes or microglia. To identify the underlying molecules, the receptors for candidate upregulated molecules were knocked out in layer 5 projection neurons in the intact cortex, using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method, and axonal projection from the knocked-out cortical neurons was examined after hemispherectomy. We found that the ectopic projection was significantly reduced when integrin subunit beta 3 (Itgb3) or neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (Ntrk2, also known as TrkB) was knocked out. Overall, the present study suggests that midbrain-derived glial factors whose expression is upregulated after hemispherectomy are involved in lesion-induced remodeling of the cortico-mesencephalic projection.",

    "abstract": "Long-distance regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) has been achieved from the eye to the brain through activation of neuronal molecular pathways or pharmacological approaches. Unexpectedly, most of the regenerative fibers display guidance defects, which prevents reinnervation and further functional recovery. Therefore, characterizing the mature neuronal environment is essential to understand the adult axonal guidance in order to complete the circuit reconstruction. To this end, we used mass spectrometry to characterize the proteomes of major nuclei of the adult visual system: suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), ventral and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN, dLGN) and superior colliculus (SCol)), as well as the optic chiasm. These analyses revealed the presence of guidance molecules and guidance-associated factors in the adult visual targets. Moreover, by performing bilateral optic nerve crush, we showed that the expression of some proteins was significantly modulated by the injury in the visual targets, even in the ones most distal to the lesion site. On another hand, we found that the expression of guidance molecules was not modified upon injury. This implies that these molecules may possibly interfere with the reinnervation of the brain targets. Together, our results provides an extensive characterization of the molecular environment in intact and injured conditions. These findings open new ways to correct regenerating axon guidance notably by manipulating the expression of the corresponding guidance receptors in the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Many environmentally and clinically important fungi are sensitive to toxic, bacterially-produced, redox-active molecules called phenazines. Despite being vulnerable to phenazine-assault, fungi inhabit microbial communities that contain phenazine producers. Because many fungi cannot withstand phenazine challenge, but some bacterial species can, we hypothesized that bacterial partners may protect fungi in phenazine-replete environments. In the first soil sample we collected, we co-isolated several such physically associated pairings. We discovered the novel species Paraburkholderia edwinii and demonstrated it can protect a co-isolated Aspergillus species from phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) by sequestering it, acting as a toxin sponge; in turn, it also gains protection. When challenged with PCA, P. edwinii changes its morphology, forming aggregates within the growing fungal colony. Further, the fungal partner triggers P. edwinii to sequester PCA and maintains conditions that limit PCA toxicity by promoting an anoxic and highly reducing environment. A mutagenic screen revealed this program depends on the stress-inducible transcriptional repressor HrcA. We show that one relevant stressor in response to PCA challenge is fungal acidification and that acid stress causes P. edwinii to behave as though the fungus were present. Finally, we reveal this phenomenon as widespread among Paraburkholderia with moderate specificity among bacterial and fungal partners, including plant and human pathogens. Our discovery suggests a common mechanism by which fungi can gain access to phenazine-replete environments, and provides a tractable model system for its study. These results have implications for how rhizosphere microbial communities as well as plant and human infection sites are policed for fungal membership.",

Estimates from this approach can be subject to different biases due to the use of weak instruments and winners curse, which can change as a function of the overlap between the exposure and outcome samples.\n\nWe developed a method (MRlap) that simultaneously considers weak instrument bias and winners curse, while accounting for potential sample overlap. Assuming spike-and-slab genomic architecture and leveraging LD-score regression and other techniques, we could analytically derive, reliably estimate, and hence correct for the bias of IVW-MR using association summary statistics only.\n\nWe tested our approach using simulated data for a wide range of realistic settings. In all the explored scenarios, our correction reduced the bias, in some situations by as much as 30 folds. Additionally, our results are consistent with the fact that the strength of the biases will decrease as the sample size increases and we also showed that the overall bias is also dependent on the genetic architecture of the exposure, and traits with low heritability and/or high polygenicity are more strongly affected. Applying MRlap to obesity-related exposures revealed significant differences between IVW-based and corrected effects, both for non-overlapping and fully overlapping samples.\n\nOur method not only reduces bias in causal effect estimation but also enables the use of much larger GWAS sample sizes, by allowing for potentially overlapping samples.",

    "abstract": "Determining the unbinding pathways of potential small molecule compounds from their target proteins is of great significance for designing efficacious treatment solutions. One of these potential compounds is the approved HIV-1 protease inhibitor, Indinavir, which has a weak effect on the HTLV-1 protease. In this work, by employing the SuMD method, we reconstructed the unbinding pathways of Indinavir from HIV and HTLV-1 proteases to compare and understand the mechanism of the unbinding and discover the reasons for the lack of inhibitory activity against the HTLV-1 protease. We achieved multiple unbinding events from both HIV and HTLV-1 proteases. Also, we found that the mobility and fluctuations of the flap region are higher in the HTLV-1 protease, making the drug less stable. We realized that critically positioned aromatic residues such as Trp98/Trp98' and Phe67/Phe67' in the HTLV-1 protease could make strong {pi}-Stacking interactions with Indinavir, which are unfavorable for the stability of Indinavir in the active site. The details found in this study can make a reasonable explanation for the lack of inhibitory activity of this drug against HTLV-1 protease. We believe the details discovered in this work can help design more effective and more selective inhibitors for the HTLV-1 protease.",

    "abstract": "Pangenomics is emerging as a powerful computational paradigm in bioinformatics. This field uses population-level genome reference structures, typically consisting of a sequence graph, to mitigate reference bias and facilitate analyses that were challenging with previous reference-based methods. In this work, we extend these methods into transcriptomics to analyze sequencing data using the pantranscriptome: a population-level transcriptomic reference. Our novel toolchain can construct spliced pangenome graphs, map RNA-seq data to these graphs, and perform haplotype-aware expression quantification of transcripts in a pantranscriptome. This workflow improves accuracy over state-of-the-art RNA-seq mapping methods, and it can efficiently quantify haplotype-specific transcript expression without needing to characterize a samples haplotypes beforehand.",

    "abstract": "Shape plays a fundamental role in biology. Traditional phenotypic analysis methods measure some features but fail to measure the information embedded in shape comprehensively. To extract, compare, and analyze this information embedded in a robust and concise way, we turn to Topological Data Analysis (TDA), specifically the Euler Characteristic Transform. TDA measures shape comprehensively using mathematical representations based on algebraic topology features. To study its use, we compute both traditional and topological shape descriptors to quantify the morphology of 3121 barley seeds scanned with X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) technology at 127 micron resolution. The Euler Characteristic Transform measures shape by analyzing topological features of an object at thresholds across a number of directional axes. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis of the information encoded by the topological signature reveals that the Euler Characteristic Transform picks up successfully the shape of the crease and bottom of the seeds. Moreover, while traditional shape descriptors can cluster the seeds based on their accession, topological shape descriptors can cluster them further based on their panicle. We then successfully train a support vector machine (SVM) to classify 28 different accessions of barley based exclusively on the shape of their grains. We observe that combining both traditional and topological descriptors classifies barley seeds better than using just traditional descriptors alone. This improvement suggests that TDA is thus a powerful complement to traditional morphometrics to comprehensively describe a multitude of \"hidden\" shape nuances which are otherwise not detected.",

    "abstract": "Creating invariant representations from an ever-changing speech signal is a major challenge for the human brain. Such an ability is particularly crucial for preverbal infants who must discover the phonological, lexical and syntactic regularities of an extremely inconsistent signal in order to acquire language. Within visual perception, an efficient neural solution to overcome signal variability consists in factorizing the input into orthogonal and relevant low-dimensional components. In this study we asked whether a similar neural strategy grounded on phonetic features is recruited in speech perception.\n\nUsing a 256-channel electroencephalographic system, we recorded the neural responses of 3-month-old infants to 120 natural consonant-vowel syllables with varying acoustic and phonetic profiles. To characterize the specificity and granularity of the elicited representations, we employed a hierarchical generalization approach based on multivariate pattern analyses. We identified two stages of processing. At first, the features of manner and place of articulation were decodable as stable and independent dimensions of neural responsivity. Subsequently, phonetic features were integrated into phoneme-identity (i.e. consonant) neural codes. The latter remained distinct from the representation of the vowel, accounting for the different weights attributed to consonants and vowels in lexical and syntactic computations.\n\nThis study reveals that, despite the paucity of articulatory motor plans and productive skills, the preverbal brain is already equipped with a structured phonetic space which provides a combinatorial code for speech analysis. The early availability of a stable and orthogonal neural code for phonetic features might account for the rapid pace of language acquisition during the first year.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFor adults to comprehend spoken language, and for infants to acquire their native tongue, it is fundamental to perceive speech as a sequence of stable and invariant segments despite its extreme acoustic variability. We show that the brain can achieve such a critical task thanks to a factorized representational system which breaks down the speech input into minimal and orthogonal components: the phonetic features. These elementary representations are robust to signal variability and are flexibly recombined into phoneme-identity percepts in a secondary processing phase. In contradiction with previous accounts questioning the availability of authentic phonetic representations in early infancy, we show that this neural strategy is implemented from the very first stages of language development.",

    "abstract": "The 3' untranslated region (UTR) plays critical roles in determining the level of gene expression, through effects on activities such as mRNA stability and translation. The underlying functional elements within this region have largely been identified through analyses of the limited number of native genes. To explore the effects of sequence elements when not present in biologically evolved sequence backgrounds, we analyzed hundreds of thousands of random 50-mers inserted into the 3' UTR of a reporter gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We determined relative protein expression levels from the fitness of a library of transformants in a growth selection. We find that the consensus 3' UTR efficiency element significantly boosts expression, independent of sequence context; on the other hand, the consensus positioning element has only a small effect on expression. Some sequence motifs that are binding sites for Puf proteins substantially increase expression in this random library, despite these proteins generally being associated with post-transcriptional downregulation when bound to native mRNAs. Thus, the regulatory effects of 3' UTR sequence features like the positioning element and Puf binding sites appear to be strongly dependent on their context within native genes, where they exist alongside co-evolved sequence features. Our measurements also allowed a systematic examination of the effects of point mutations within efficiency element motifs across diverse sequence backgrounds. These mutational scans reveal the relative in vivo importance of individual bases in the efficiency element, which likely reflects their roles in binding the Hrp1 protein involved in cleavage and polyadenylation.",

    "abstract": "Single molecule pulling experiments report time-dependent changes in the extension (X) of a biomolecule as a function of the applied force (f). By fitting the data to one-dimensional analytical models of the energy landscape, the hopping rates between the folded and unfolded states in two-state folders, the height and the location of the transition state (TS) can be extracted. Although this approach is remarkably insightful, there are cases for which the energy landscape is multidimensional (catch bonds being the most prominent). To assess if the unfolding energy landscape in small single domain proteins could be one dimensional, we simulated force-induced unfolding of Ubiquitin (Ub) using the coarse-grained Self-Organized Polymer-Side Chain (SOP-SC) model. Brownian dynamics simulations using the SOP-SC model reveal that the Ub energy landscape is weakly multidimensional (WMD) governed predominantly by a single barrier. The unfolding pathway is confined to a narrow reaction pathway that could be described as diffusion in a quasi 1D X-dependent free energy profile. However, a granular analysis using the Pfold analysis, which does not assume any form for the reaction coordinate, shows that X alone does not account for the height, and more importantly, the location of the TS. The f-dependent TS location moves towards the folded state as f increases, in accord with the Hammond postulate. Our study shows that, in addition to analyzing the f-dependent hopping rates, the transition state ensemble must also be determined without resorting to X as a reaction coordinate in order to describe the unfolding energy landscapes of single domain proteins, especially if they are only WMD.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/437368v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd1480org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d12c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c4839org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59aab9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Transcription initiation starts with unwinding of promoter DNA by RNA polymerase (RNAP) to form a catalytically competent RNAP-promoter complex (RPO). Despite extensive study, the mechanism of promoter unwinding has remained unclear, in part due to the transient nature of intermediates on path to RPo. Here, using single-molecule unwinding-induced fluorescence enhancement to monitor promoter unwinding, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor RNAP clamp conformation, we analyze RPo formation at a consensus bacterial core promoter. We find that the RNAP clamp is closed during promoter binding, remains closed during promoter unwinding, and then closes further, locking the unwound DNA in the RNAP active-centre cleft. Our work defines a new, \"bind-unwind-load-and-lock,\" model for the series of conformational changes occurring during promoter unwinding at a consensus bacterial promoter and provides the tools needed to examine the process in other organisms and at other promoters.\n\nSignificance statementTranscription initiation, the first step and most important step in gene expression for all organisms, involves unwinding of promoter DNA by RNA polymerase (RNAP) to form an open complex (RPo); this step also underpins transcriptional regulation and serves as an antibiotic target. Despite decades of research, the mechanism of promoter DNA unwinding has remained unresolved. Here, we solve this puzzle by using single-molecule fluorescence to directly monitor conformational changes in the promoter DNA and RNAP in real time during RPo formation. We show that RPo forms via a \"bind-unwind-load-and-lock\" mechanism, where the promoter unwinds outside the RNAP cleft, the unwound template DNA loads into the cleft, and RNAP \"locks\" the template DNA in place by closing the RNAP clamp module.",
