    "abstract": "BackgroundCharacterising gene function for the ever-increasing number and diversity of species with annotated genomes relies almost entirely on computational prediction methods. These software are also numerous and diverse, each with different strengths and weaknesses as revealed through community benchmarking efforts. Meta-predictors that assess consensus and conflict from individual algorithms should deliver enhanced functional annotations.\n\nResultsTo exploit the benefits of meta-approaches, we developed CrowdGO, an open-source consensus-based Gene Ontology (GO) term meta-predictor that employs machine learning models with GO term semantic similarities and information contents. By re-evaluating each gene-term annotation, a consensus dataset is produced with high-scoring confident annotations and low-scoring rejected annotations. Applying CrowdGO to results from a deep learning-based, a sequence similarity-based, and two protein domain-based methods, delivers consensus annotations with improved precision and recall. Furthermore, using standard evaluation measures CrowdGO performance matches that of the communitys best performing individual methods.\n\nConclusionCrowdGO offers a model-informed approach to leverage strengths of individual predictors and produce comprehensive and accurate gene functional annotations.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationCrowdGO is implemented in Python3, and is freely available from https://gitlab.com/mreijnders/CrowdGO, with a Snakemake workflow and pre-trained models.",

    "abstract": "Webers law states that the ratio of the smallest perceptual change in an input signal and the background signal is constant. The law is observed across the perception of weight, light intensity, and sound intensity and pitch. Conventionally, two models of perception have been proposed to explain Webers law, namely the logarithmic and the linear model. Later, another formulation of Webers law was proposed which links it with exact adaptation. This paper argues in favour of the linear model, which requires the sensory system to generate linear input-output relationship over several orders of magnitude. To this end, a four-node motif (FNM) is constructed from first principles whose series provides almost linear relationship between input signal and output over arbitrary range of input signal. Mathematical analysis into the origin of this quasi-linear relationship shows that the series of coherent type-1 feed-forward loop (C1-FFL) is able to provide perfectly linear input-output relationship over arbitrary range of input signal. FNM also reproduces the neuronal data of numerosity detection study on monkey. The series of FNM also provides a mechanism for sensitive detection over arbitrary range of input signal when the output has an upper limit. Further, the series of FNM provides a general basis for a class of bow-tie architecture where the number of receptors is much lower than the range of input signal and the \"decoded output\". Besides (quasi-)linear input-output relationship, another example of this class of bow-tie architecture that the series of FNM is able to produce is absorption spectra of cone opsins of humans. Further, the series of FNM and C1-FFL, respectively, can compute logarithm over arbitrary range of input signal.",

    "abstract": "-Synuclein and family members {beta}-, and {gamma}-synuclein, are presynaptic proteins that sense and generate membrane curvature, properties important for synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling. {beta}{gamma}-synuclein triple knockout (KO) neurons exhibit SV endocytosis (SVE) deficits. Here, we investigate how SVE is regulated by -synuclein. Immuno-electron microscopy (EM) of synaptosomes reveals that -synuclein relocalizes from SVs to the synaptic membrane upon stimulation, allowing -synuclein to function on presynaptic membranes during or after stimulation. On cell membranes, we observe that -synuclein is colocalized with clathrin and its adaptor AP180. Clathrin patches that contain both -synuclein and AP180 were significantly larger than clathrin patches containing either protein alone. We also find that recruitment of clathrin and AP180 recruitment to membranes are altered in the absence of synucleins. Visualizing clathrin assembly on membranes using an in vitro endocytosis reconstitution system reveals that -synuclein increases clathrin patch size and enhances clathrin lattice curvature, facilitating normal clathrin coated pit maturation. Thus, -synuclein is an endocytic accessory protein that acts at early stages of SVE to controls the size and curvature of clathrin structures on the membrane.",

Current detection methods of viral infections have limitations in speed, accuracy, accessibility, and usability. This project presents a novel, widely applicable viral diagnostic test that uses a modified version of rolling circle amplification (RCA) to be sensitive, specific, direct RNA targeted, colorimetric and operable at room temperature. We are specifically detecting the following high-impact viruses: SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A (H1N1pdm09), and Influenza B (Victoria Lineage), although our test can be adapted to any viral infection. Results using synthetic viral DNA and RNA sequences show that our diagnostic test takes approximately one hour, detects femtomolar concentrations of RNA strands, and differentiates between virus strains. We believe implementing our diagnostic test will provide faster responses to future viral-related outbreaks for quicker societal recovery.",

    "abstract": "Degenerate neural circuits perform the same function despite being structurally different. However, it is unclear whether neural circuits with interacting neuromodulator sources can themselves be degenerate while maintaining the same neuromodulatory function. Here, we address this by computationally modelling the neural circuits of neuromodulators serotonin and dopamine, local glutamatergic and GABAergic interneurons, and their possible interactions, under reward/punishment-based conditioning tasks. The neural modelling is constrained by relevant experimental studies of the VTA or DRN system using e.g. electrophysiology, optogenetics, and voltammetry. We first show that a single parsimonious, sparsely connected neural circuit model can recapitulate several separate experimental findings that indicated diverse, heterogeneous, distributed and mixed DRN-VTA neuronal signalling in reward and punishment tasks. The inability for this model to recapitulate all observed neuronal signalling suggests potentially multiple circuits acting in parallel. Then using computational simulations and dynamical systems analysis, we demonstrate that several different stable circuit architectures can produce the same observed network activity profile, hence demonstrating degeneracy. Due to the extensive D2-mediated connections in the investigated circuits, we simulate D2 receptor agonist by increasing the connection strengths emanating from the VTA DA neurons. We found that the simulated D2 agonist can distinguish among sub-groups of the degenerate neural circuits based on substantial deviations in specific neural populations activities in reward and punishment conditions. This forms a testable model prediction using pharmacological means. Overall, this theoretical work suggests the plausibility of degeneracy within neuromodulator circuitry and has important implication for the stable and robust maintenance of neuromodulatory functions.",

    "abstract": "Among women, breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer worldwide and has the second highest mortality rate of any cancer in the United States. The breast cancer related death rate is 40% higher in African American women compared to European American women. The incidence of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer for which there is no targeted therapy, is approximately three times higher in non-Hispanic Black women (NHBW) compared to non-Hispanic White women (NHWW). The drivers of these differences in breast cancer incidence and mortality are still poorly understood, and likely lie in an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Here, we aimed to identify chemical exposures which may play a role in breast cancer disparities. Using chemical biomonitoring data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and biological activity data from the EPAs ToxCast program, we assessed the toxicological profiles of chemicals with higher biomarker concentrations in US NHBW. We conducted a literature search to identify a gene set of breast cancer targets included in ToxCast to analyze the response of prioritized chemicals in these assays. Forty-three chemical biomarkers are significantly higher in NHBW. Investigation of these chemicals in ToxCast resulted in a total of 32,683 assays for analysis, 5,172 of which contained nonzero values for the concentration at which the dose-response fitted model reaches the cutoff considered \"active\" and the scaled top value of dose response curve. Of these chemicals BPA, PFOS, and thiram are most comprehensively assayed. 2,5-dichlorophenol, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and methyl and propyl parabens had higher biomarker concentrations in NHBW and moderate testing and activity in ToxCast. The distribution of active concentrations for these chemicals in ToxCast assays are comparable to biomarker concentrations in NHBW. Through this integrated analysis, we have identified that multiple chemicals, including thiram, propylparaben, and p,p DDE, with disproportionate exposures in NHBW, have breast cancer associated biological activity at human exposure relevant doses.",

    "abstract": "The morphology of breast cancer cells is often used as an indicator of tumour severity and prognosis. Additionally, morphology can be used to identify more fine-grained, molecular developments within a cancer cell, such as transcriptomic changes and signaling pathway activity. Delineating the interface between morphology and signaling is important to understand the mechanical cues that a cell processes in order to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and consequently metastasize. However, the exact regulatory systems that define these changes remain poorly characterised. In this study, we employ a network-systems approach to integrate imaging data and RNA-seq expression data. Our workflow allows the discovery of unbiased and context-specific gene expression signatures and cell signaling sub-networks relevant to the regulation of cell shape, rather than focusing on the identification of previously known, but not always representative, pathways. By constructing a cell-shape signaling network from shape-correlated gene expression modules and their upstream regulators, we found central roles for developmental pathways such as WNT and Notch as well as evidence for the fine control of NFkB signaling by numerous kinase and transcriptional regulators. Further analysis of our network implicates a gene expression module enriched in the RAP1 signaling pathway as a mediator between the sensing of mechanical stimuli and regulation of NFkB activity, with specific relevance to cell shape in breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The translocated intimin receptor (Tir) is a central effector of Attaching and Effacing (A/E) pathogens responsible for worldwide foodborne disease cases. Tir acts as a cell-surface receptor in host cells, rewiring intracellular processes to assist infection by targeting multiple host proteins. We sought to understand the basis for Tir binding diversity in signaling. Here, we establish that Tir is a disordered protein with host-like binding motifs. A trait we find prevalent in several other effectors secreted by A/E bacteria. We disclose that Tir has a disordered C-terminal intracellular tail (C-Tir) with non-random structural preferences at phosphorylation sites, including host-like tyrosine-based motifs, with versatile lipid- and SH2 domain binding capability pre-phosphorylation. We show that multi-site tyrosine phosphorylation enables C-Tir to engage SH2 domains in a multivalent manner, consistent with Tirs scaffold/hub role for host proteins. Last, we uncover Tirs ability to dimerizes via its partially disordered N-terminal intracellular domain. Collectively, our findings provide an updated picture of Tirs intracellular side, highlighting its ability to mimic host disordered membrane receptors versatility as a molecular strategy for host evasion.\n\nSummaryTir is a cell-surface receptor secreted by life-threatening pathogens. Upon delivery into host cells, Tir inserts the host plasma membrane providing a means for these extracellular pathogens to control host intracellular processes. To prevent pathogens from relying on Tir, it is essential to understand its intracellular mechanics. This paper provides a coherent picture of the intracellular side of Tir, highlighting its ability to copycat the interactions of disordered intracellular domains of host immune receptors. This copycatting allows the bacterial pathogens to modulate critical host processes, allowing infection to spread further without triggering the immune system response. This work proposes that other bacterial secreted pathogenic proteins exploit intrinsic disorder to hijack human cells, suggesting a widespread host subversion mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The entry of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) into aquatic systems has been documented for large municipal wastewater treatment plants, but there is less study of the impact of smaller plants that are situated on small rural rivers. We sampled water metagenomes for ARG and taxa composition from the Kokosing River, a small rural river in Knox County, Ohio, which has been designated an Ohio State Scenic River for retention of natural character. Samples were obtained 1.0 km upstream, 120 m downstream, and 6.4 km downstream from the effluent release of the Mount Vernon wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). ARGS were identified in metagenomes using ShortBRED markers from the CARD database screened against UniPROT. Through all seasons, the metagenome just downstream of the WWTP effluent showed a substantial elevation of at least 15 different ARGs, including 6 ARGs commonly associated with Acinetobacter baumannii such as msrE, mphE (macrolide resistance) and tet(39) (tetracycline resistance). The ARGs most prevalent near the effluent pipe persisted 6.4 km downriver. Using MetaPhlAn2 clade-specific marker genes, the taxa distribution near the effluent showed elevation of reads annotated as Acinetobacter species as well as gut-associated taxa, Bacteroides and Firmicutes. The ARG levels and taxa prevalence showed little dependence on seasonal chlorination of the effluent. Nitrogen and phosphorus were elevated near the effluent pipe but had no consistent correlation with ARG levels. We show that in a rural river microbiome, year-round wastewater effluent substantially elevates ARGs including those associated with multidrug-resistant A. baumanii.\n\nIMPORTANCEAntibiotic resistance is a growing problem worldwide, with frequent transmission between pathogens and environmental organisms. Rural rivers can support high levels of recreational use by people unaware of inputs from treated wastewater, while WWTPs can generate a small but significant portion of flow volume into a river surrounded by forest and agriculture. There is little information on the rural impacts of WWTP effluent on the delivery and transport of antibiotic resistance genes. In our study, the river water proximal to wastewater effluent shows evidence for the influx of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii, an opportunistic pathogen of concern for hospitals but also widespread in natural environments. Our work highlights the importance of wastewater effluent in management of environmental antibiotic resistance, even in high quality, rural river systems.",

In humans, coordination at a macroscopic level (the pacing of movements) is evident both in daily life (e.g., walking) and skilled (e.g., music and dance) behaviors. By examining the fine structure of movement, we here show that interpersonal coordination is established also at a microscopic - sub-movement - level. Natural movements appear as marked by recurrent (2-3 Hz) speed breaks, i.e., submovements, that are traditionally considered the result of intermittency in (visuo)motor control. In a series of interpersonal motor coordination tasks, we demonstrate that submovements are not independent between interacting partners but produced in a tight temporal relation that reflects the directionality in the partners informational coupling. These findings unveil a potential core mechanism for behavioral coordination that is based on between-persons synchronization of the intrinsic dynamics of action-perception cycles.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations in arousal, controlled by subcortical neuromodulatory systems, continuously shape cortical state, with profound consequences for information processing. Yet, how arousal signals influence cortical population activity in detail has so far only been characterized for a few selected brain regions. Traditional accounts conceptualize arousal as a homogeneous modulator of neural population activity across the cerebral cortex. Recent insights, however, point to a higher specificity of arousal effects on different components of neural activity and across cortical regions. Here, we provide a comprehensive account of the relationships between fluctuations in arousal and neuronal population activity across the human brain. Exploiting the established link between pupil size and central arousal systems, we performed concurrent magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and pupillographic recordings in a large number of participants, pooled across three laboratories. We found a cascade of effects relative to the peak timing of spontaneous pupil dilations: Decreases in low-frequency (2-8 Hz) activity in temporal and lateral frontal cortex, followed by increased high-frequency (>64 Hz) activity in mid-frontal regions, followed by monotonic and inverted-U relationships with intermediate frequency-range activity (8-32 Hz) in occipito-parietal regions. Pupil-linked arousal also coincided with widespread changes in the structure of the aperiodic component of cortical population activity, indicative of changes in the excitation-inhibition balance in underlying microcircuits. Our results provide a novel basis for studying the arousal modulation of cognitive computations in cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in the control and resolution of viral infections and can adopt a wide range of phenotypes and effector functions depending on the inflammatory context and the duration and extent of antigen exposure. Similarly, viral infections can exert diverse selective pressures on populations of clonally related T cells. Technical limitations have nevertheless made it challenging to investigate the relationship between clonal selection and transcriptional phenotypes of virus-specific T cells. We therefore performed single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and transcriptome sequencing of virus-specific CD8 T cells in murine models of acute, chronic and latent infection. We observed clear infection-specific populations corresponding to memory, effector, exhausted, and inflationary phenotypes. We further uncovered a mouse-specific and polyclonal T cell response, despite all T cells sharing specificity to a single viral epitope, which was accompanied by stereotypic TCR germline gene usage in all three infection types. Persistent antigen exposure during chronic and latent viral infections resulted in a higher proportion of clonally expanded T cells relative to acute infection. We furthermore observed a relationship between transcriptional heterogeneity and clonal expansion for all three infections, with highly expanded clones having distinct transcriptional phenotypes relative to lowly expanded clones. Finally, we developed and utilized a bioinformatic pipeline integrating pseudotime and clonality, termed Clonotyme, to further support a model in which expanded virus-specific CD8+ T cells adopt heterogenic, yet preferentially, effector-like phenotypes. Together our work relates clonal selection to gene expression in the context of viral infection and further provides a dataset and accompanying software for the immunological community.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a highly invasive type of brain tumor with an irregular morphology and blurred infiltrative borders that may affect different parts of the brain. Therefore, it is a challenging task to identify the exact boundaries of the tumor in an MR image. In recent years, deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in the field of image processing and have been utilized for accurate image segmentation in medical applications. However, due to the inherent constraints of CNNs, tens of thousands of images are required for training, and collecting and annotating such a large number of images poses a serious challenge for their practical implementation. Here, for the first time, we have optimized a network based on the capsule neural network called SegCaps, to achieve accurate glioma segmentation on MR images. We have compared our results with a similar experiment conducted using the commonly utilized U-Net. Both experiments were performed on the BraTS2020 challenging dataset. For U-Net, network training was performed on the entire dataset, whereas a subset containing only 20% of the whole dataset was used for the SegCaps. To evaluate the results of our proposed method, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) was used. SegCaps and U-Net reached DSC of 87.96% and 85.56% on glioma tumor core segmentation, respectively. The SegCaps uses convolutional layers as the basic components and has the intrinsic capability to generalize novel viewpoints. The network learns the spatial relationship between features using dynamic routing of capsules. These capabilities of the capsule neural network have led to a 3% improvement in results of glioma segmentation with fewer data while it contains 95.4% fewer parameters than U-Net.",

    "abstract": "Cation-coupled chloride cotransporters play a key role in generating the Cl electrochemical gradient on the cell membrane which is important for regulation of many cellular processes. However, the cooperation of transporters and channels of the plasma membrane in holding the ionic homeostasis of the whole cell remains poorly characterized because of the lack of a suitable tool for its computation. Our software successfully predicted in real-time changes in the ion homeostasis of U937 cells after stopping the Na/K pump, but so far considered the model with only NC cotransporter. Here the model with all main types of cotransporters is used in computation of the rearrangements of ionic homeostasis due to stopping the pump and associated with the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) of cells swollen in hypoosmolar medium. The parameters obtained for the real U937 cells are used. Successful prediction of changes in ion homeostasis in real-time after stopping the pump using the model with all major cotransporters indicates that the model is reliable. Using this model for analysis RVD showed that there is a \"physical\" RVD, associated with the time-dependent changes in electrochemical ion gradients, but not with alteration of channels and transporters of the plasma membrane that should be considered in studies of truly active regulatory processes mediated by the intracellular signaling network. The developed software can be useful for calculation of the balance of the partial unidirectional fluxes of monovalent ions across the cell membrane of various cells under various conditions.",

    "abstract": "Integrative mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as transposons and insertion sequences, propagate within bacterial genomes, but persistence times in individual lineages are short. For long-term survival, MGEs must continuously invade new hosts by horizontal transfer. Theoretically, MGEs that persist for millions of years in single lineages, and are thus subject to vertical inheritance, should not exist. Here we draw attention to an exception -- a class of MGE termed REPIN. REPINs are non-autonomous MGEs whose duplication depends on non-jumping RAYT transposases. Comparisons of REPINs and typical MGEs show that replication rates of REPINs are orders of magnitude lower, REPIN population size fluctuations correlate with changes in available genome space, REPIN conservation depends on RAYT function, and REPIN diversity accumulates within host lineages. These data lead to the hypothesis that REPINs form enduring, beneficial associations with eubacterial chromosomes. Given replicative nesting, our hypothesis predicts conflicts arising from the diverging effects of selection acting simultaneously on REPINs and host genomes. Evidence in support comes from patterns of REPIN abundance and diversity in two distantly related bacterial species. Together this bolsters the conclusion that REPINs are the genetic counterpart of mutualistic endosymbiotic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Vocalizations, like many social displays, are often elaborate, rhythmically structured behaviors that are modulated by a complex combination of cues. Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alstons singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina), for example, each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguous for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally co-label neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong co-labeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal grey and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive co-labeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. Although we observe some novel patterns of double-labelling, the progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.",

    "abstract": "This work studies the effects of the two rounds of Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) at the origin of the vertebrate lineage on the architecture of the human gene regulatory networks. We integrate information on transcriptional regulation, miRNA regulation, and protein-protein interactions to comparatively analyse the role of WGD and Small Scale Duplications (SSD) in the structural properties of the resulting multilayer network. We show that complex network motifs, such as combinations of feed-forward loops and bifan arrays, deriving from WGD events are specifically enriched in the network. Pairs of WGD-derived proteins display a strong tendency to interact both with each other and with common partners and WGD-derived transcription factors play a prominent role in the retention of a strong regulatory redundancy. Combinatorial regulation and synergy between different regulatory layers are in general enhanced by duplication events, but the two types of duplications contribute in different ways. Overall, our findings suggest that the two WGD events played a substantial role in increasing the multi-layer complexity of the vertebrate regulatory network by enhancing its combinatorial organization, with potential consequences on its overall robustness and ability to perform high-level functions like signal integration and noise control.",

    "abstract": "Variation in social status predicts molecular, physiological, and life history outcomes across a broad range of species, including our own. Experimental studies indicate that some of these relationships persist even when the physical environment is held constant. Here, we draw on data sets from one such study--experimental manipulation of dominance rank in captive female rhesus macaques--to investigate how social status shapes the lived experience of these animals to alter gene regulation, glucocorticoid physiology, and mitochondrial DNA phenotypes. We focus specifically on dominance rank-associated dimensions of the social environment, including both competitive and affiliative interactions. Our results show that simple summaries of rank-associated behavioral interactions are often better predictors of molecular and physiological outcomes than dominance rank itself. However, while measures of immune function are best explained by agonism rates, glucocorticoid-related phenotypes tend to be more closely linked to affiliative behavior. We conclude that dominance rank serves as a useful summary for investigating social environmental effects on downstream outcomes. Nevertheless, the behavioral interactions that define an individuals daily experiences reveal the proximate drivers of social status-related differences, and are especially relevant for understanding why individuals who share the same social status sometimes appear physiologically distinct.",

Little is known about its biosynthesis and metabolism in plants or its mode of action against parasites. When VH is isolated from Psorospermum glaberrimum, it is rapidly converted into madagascine anthrone and anthraquinone, which are characterized by markedly different fluorescent properties. To locate the fluorescence of VH in living plant cells and discriminate it from that of the other metabolites, an original strategy combining spectral imaging (SImaging), confocal microscopy and non-targeted metabolomics using mass spectrometry, was developed. Besides VH, structurally related molecules including madagascine, emodin, quinizarin as well as lapachol and fraxetin were analyzed. This strategy readily allowed a spatiotemporal characterization and discrimination of spectral fingerprints from anthranoids-derived metabolites and related complexes with cations and proteins. In addition, our study validates the capability of plant cells to metabolize VH into madagascine anthrone, anthraquinones and unexpected metabolites, leading to new hypotheses on the metabolism of anthranoids in plants.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, rRNAs and spliceosomal snRNAs are heavily modified posttranscriptionally. Pseudouridylation and 2-O-methylation are the most abundant types of RNA modifications. They are mediated by modification guide RNAs, also known as small nucleolar (sno)RNAs and small Cajal body-specific (sca)RNAs. We used yeast and vertebrate cells to test guide activities predicted for a number of snoRNAs, based on their regions of complementarity with rRNAs. We showed that human SNORA24 is a genuine guide RNA for 18S-{Psi}609, despite some non-canonical base-pairing with its target. At the same time, we found quite a few snoRNAs that have the ability to base-pair with rRNAs and can induce predicted modifications in artificial substrate RNAs, but do not modify the same target sequence within endogenous rRNA molecules. Furthermore, certain fragments of rRNAs can be modified by the endogenous yeast modification machinery when inserted into an artificial backbone RNA, even though the same sequences are not modified in endogenous yeast rRNAs. In Xenopus cells a guide RNA generated from scaRNA, but not from snoRNA, could induce an additional pseudouridylation of U2 snRNA at position 60; both guide RNAs were equally active on a U2 snRNA-specific substrate in yeast cells. Thus, posttranscriptional modification of functionally important RNAs, such as rRNAs and snRNAs, is highly regulated and more complex than simply strong base-pairing between a guide RNA and substrate RNA. We discuss possible regulatory roles for these unexpected modifications.",

Here, we use MinION and Illumina sequencing to characterize a C. metapsilosis isolate that originated from a separate hybridization. One of the parents of the new isolate is very closely related to parent A. However, the other parent (parent C) is not the same as parent B. Unlike C. metapsilosis AB isolates, the C. metapsilosis AC isolate has not undergone introgression at the Mating Type-like Locus. In addition, the A and C haplotypes are not fully collinear. The C. metapsilosis AC isolate has undergone Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) with a preference for haplotype A, indicating that this isolate is in the early stages of genome stabilization.",

    "abstract": "The proteasome is the principal cellular protease, and recognizes target proteins that have been covalently marked by ubiquitin chains. The ubiquitin signal is subject to rapid editing at the proteasome, allowing it to reject substrates based on topological features of their attached ubiquitin chains. Editing is mediated by a key regulator of the proteasome, deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6. The proteasome activates Ubp6, whereas Ubp6 inhibits the proteasome-both by deubiquitinating proteasome-bound ubiquitin conjugates, and through a noncatalytic effect that does not involve deubiquitination. We report mutants in both Ubp6 and proteasome subunit Rpt1 that abrogate Ubp6 activation. The Ubp6 mutations fall within its ILR element, defined here, which is conserved from yeast to mammals. The ILR is a component of the BL1 blocking loop, other parts of which obstruct ubiquitin access to the catalytic groove in free Ubp6. Rpt1 docking at the ILR opens the catalytic groove by rearranging not only BL1 but also a novel network of three directly interconnected active-site-blocking loops. Ubp6 activation and noncatalytic proteasome inhibition by Ubp6 are linked in that they were eliminated by the same Ubp6 and Rpt1 mutations. Ubp6 and ubiquitin together drive the proteasome into a unique conformational state associated with proteasome inhibition. Our results identify a multicomponent allosteric switch that exerts simultaneous control over the activity of both Ubp6 and the proteasome, and suggest that their active states are in general mutually exclusive. The findings lead to a new paradigm for allosteric control of deubiquitinating enzymes.",

However, how R-loops inherently impact replication fork progression is not understood. Here, we characterize R-loop-replisome collisions using a fully reconstituted eukaryotic DNA replication system. We find that RNA:DNA hybrids and G-quadruplexes at both co-directional and head-on R-loops can impact fork progression by inducing fork stalling, uncoupling of leading strand synthesis from replisome progression, and nascent strand gaps. RNase H1 and Pif1 suppress replication defects by resolving RNA:DNA hybrids and G-quadruplexes, respectively. We also identify an intrinsic capacity of replisomes to maintain fork progression at certain R-loops by unwinding RNA:DNA hybrids, repriming leading strand synthesis downstream of G-quadruplexes, or utilizing R-loop transcripts to prime leading strand restart during co-directional R-loop-replisome collisions. Collectively, the data demonstrates that the outcome of R-loop-replisome collisions is modulated by R-loop structure, providing a mechanistic basis for the distinction of deleterious from non-deleterious R-loops.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant efforts in the last years to improve therapeutic options, pancreatic cancer remains a fatal disease and is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the next decade. Late diagnosis and a complex, fibrotic tumor microenvironment produces a therapeutically hardly approachable situation with rapidly emerging resistance mechanisms. In response to this hostile microenvironment, previous research identified lipid metabolic pathways to be highly enriched in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. Thereby, cholesterol uptake and synthesis was shown to promote a growth advantage to, and chemotherapy resistance for PDAC tumor cells. Here, we demonstrate that efficient, net-cholesterol removal from cancer cells, driven by high-density lipoprotein (HDL) mediated efflux, results in a significant PDAC cell growth reduction, apoptosis and a decreased PDAC tumor development in vivo. This effect is driven by an HDL particle composition-dependent interaction with SR-B1 and ABCA1 on cancer cells, two major lipid flux receptors, which differentially regulate cholesterol transport at the plasma membrane. Eventually, we show that pancreatic cancer patients display reduced plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol, directly translating into a reduced cholesterol efflux capacity of patient-derived plasma samples. We conclude that cholesterol depletion from PDAC cells, together with possible interventions that shunt the import and endogenous synthesis pathways of cholesterol, might represent a promising strategy to increase and complement the currently available treatment options to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Translation initiation is a highly regulated process which broadly affects eukaryotic gene expression. Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is a central player in canonical and alternative pathways for ribosome recruitment. Here we have investigated how direct binding of eIF3 contributes to the large and regulated differences in protein output conferred by different 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) of cellular mRNAs. Using an unbiased high-throughput approach to determine the affinity of budding yeast eIF3 for native 5'-UTRs from 4,252 genes, we demonstrate that eIF3 binds specifically to a subset of 5'-UTRs that contain a short unstructured binding motif, AMAYAA. eIF3 binding mRNAs have higher ribosome density in growing cells and are preferentially translated under certain stress conditions, supporting the functional relevance of this interaction. Our results reveal a new class of translational enhancer and suggest a mechanism by which changes in core initiation factor activity enact mRNA-specific translation programs.",

    "abstract": "In agriculture, adoption of reduced tillage practices is a widespread adaptation to global change. The cessation of plowing reduces erosion, slows soil organic matter oxidation, and promotes soil carbon accrual, but it can also result in the development of potential N2O spots from denitrification activity. In this study, we hypothesized that 16S rRNA-based composition of bacterial-archaeal assemblages would differ in agricultural soils subjected for forty years to a range of disturbance intensities, with annual moldboard plowing (MP) being the most intensive. No-till planting (NT) represented tillage management with the least amount of disturbance, while chisel-disking (CD), a type of conservation tillage, was intermediate. All long-term tillage plots had been planted with the same crops grown in a three-year crop rotation (corn-soybean-small grain+cover crop), and both bulk and rhizosphere soils were analyzed from the corn and soybean years. We also evaluated denitrification gene markers by quantitative PCR at multiple points (three growth stages of corn and soybean). Tillage intensity, soil compartment (bulk or rhizosphere), crop year, growth stage, and interactions all exerted effects on community diversity and composition. Compared to MP and CD, NT soils had lower abundances of denitrification genes, higher abundances of nitrate ammonification genes, and higher abundances of taxa at the family level associated with the inorganic N cycle processes of archaeal nitrification and anammox. Soybean rhizospheres exerted stronger selection on community composition and diversity relative to corn rhizospheres. Interactions between crop year, management, and soil compartment had differential impacts on N gene abundances related to denitrification and nitrate ammonification. Opportunities for managing hot spots or hot moments for N losses from agricultural soils may be discernible through improved understanding of tillage intensity effects, although weather and crop type are also important factors influencing how tillage influences microbial assemblages and N use.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination is one of the most crucial post-translational protein modifications involved in a myriad of biological pathways. This process is reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs) that deconjugate the ubiquitin (Ub) moiety or poly-Ub chains from substrates. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been focused on targeting DUBs for drug discovery. However, most chemical compounds with inhibitory activity for DUBs suffer from mild potency and low selectivity. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a phage display-based protein engineering strategy for generating Ub variant (UbV) inhibitors and have previously successfully applied it to the Ub-specific protease (USP) family of cysteine proteases. In this work, we leveraged the UbV platform to target STAMBP, a member of the JAB1/MPN/MOV34 (JAMM) metalloprotease family of DUB enzymes. We identified two UbVs (UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3) that bind to STAMBP with high affinity but differ in their selectivity for the closely related paralog STAMBPL1. We determined the STAMBPL1-UbVSP.1 complex structure by X-ray crystallography, revealing hotspots of the tight JAMM-UbV interaction. Finally, we show that UbVSP.1 and UbVSP.3 are potent inhibitors of the STAMBP isopeptidase activity, far exceeding the reported small-molecule inhibitor BC-1471. This work demonstrates that UbV technology is suitable to develop tool molecules for metalloproteases. These tools can be used to understand the cellular function of JAMM family DUBs.",

    "abstract": "Myxococcus xanthus bacteria are a model system for understanding pattern formation and collective cell behaviors. When starving, cells aggregate into fruiting bodies to form metabolically inert spores. During predation, cells self-organize into traveling cell-density waves termed ripples. Both phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy are used to observe these patterns but each has its limitations. Phase-contrast images have higher contrast, but the resulting image intensities lose their correlation with cell density. The intensities of fluorescence microscopy images, on the other hand, are well correlated with cell density, enabling better segmentation of aggregates and better visualization of streaming patterns in between aggregates. However, fluorescence microscopy requires the engineering of cells to express fluorescent proteins and can be phototoxic to the cells. To combine the advantages of both imaging methodologies, we develop a generative adversarial network that converts phase-contrast into fluorescent images. By including an additional histogram-equalized output to the state-of-art pix2pixHD algorithm, our model generates accurate images of aggregates and streams, enabling the estimation of aggregate positions and sizes, but with small shifts of their boundaries. Further training on ripple patterns enables accurate estimation of the rippling wavelength. Our methods are thus applicable for many other phenotypic behaviors and pattern formation studies.",

    "abstract": "Although a broad range of viruses cause myocarditis, the mechanisms that underlie viral myocarditis are poorly understood. Here, we report that the M2 gene is a determinant of reovirus myocarditis. The M2 gene encodes outer capsid protein 1, which mediates host membrane penetration during reovirus entry. We infected newborn C57BL/6 mice with reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) or a reassortant reovirus in which the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) was substituted into the T1L genetic background (T1L/T3DM2). T1L was non-lethal in wild-type mice, whereas greater than 90% of mice succumbed to T1L/T3DM2 infection. T1L/T3DM2 produced higher viral loads than T1L at the site of inoculation. In secondary organs, T1L/T3DM2 was detected with more rapid kinetics and reached higher peak titers than T1L. We found that hearts from T1L/T3DM2-infected mice were grossly abnormal, with large lesions indicative of substantial inflammatory infiltrate. Lesions in T1L/T3DM2-infected mice contained necrotic cardiomyocytes with pyknotic debris, and extensive lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration. In contrast, T1L induced the formation of small purulent lesions in a small subset of animals, consistent with T1L being mildly myocarditic. Finally, more activated caspase-3-positive cells were observed in hearts from animals infected with T1L/T3DM2 compared to T1L. Together, our findings indicate that substitution of the T3D M2 allele into an otherwise T1L genetic background is sufficient to change a non-lethal infection into a lethal infection. Our results further indicate that T3D M2 enhances T1L replication and dissemination in vivo, which potentiates the capacity of reovirus to cause myocarditis.\n\nIMPORTANCEReovirus is a non-enveloped virus with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome that serves as a model for studying viral myocarditis. The mechanisms by which reovirus drives myocarditis development are not fully elucidated. We found that substituting the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) into an otherwise type 1 Lang (T1L) genetic background (T1L/T3DM2) was sufficient to convert the non-lethal T1L strain into a lethal infection in neonatal C57BL/6 mice. T1L/T3DM2 disseminated more efficiently and reached higher maximum titers than T1L in all organs tested, including the heart. T1L is mildly myocarditic and induced small areas of cardiac inflammation in a subset of mice. In contrast, hearts from mice infected with T1L/T3DM2 contained extensive cardiac inflammatory infiltration and more activated caspase-3-positive cells, which is indicative of apoptosis. Together, our findings identify the reovirus M2 gene as a new determinant of reovirus-induced myocarditis.",

    "abstract": "The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a broadly distributed interbacterial weapon that can be used to eliminate competing bacterial populations. Although unarmed target populations are typically used to study T6SS function, bacteria most likely encounter other T6SS-armed competitors in nature. The outcome of such battles is not well understood, neither is the connection between the outcomes with the subcellular details of the T6SS. Here, we incorporated new biological data derived from natural competitors of Vibrio fischeri light organ symbionts to build a biochemical model for T6SS function at the single cell level. The model accounts for activation of structure formation, structure assembly, and deployment. By developing an integrated agent-based model (IABM) that incorporates strain-specific T6SS parameters, we replicated outcomes of biological competitions, validating our approach. We used the IABM to isolate and manipulate strain-specific physiological differences between competitors, in a way that is not possible using biological samples, to identify winning strategies for T6SS-armed populations. We found that a tipping point exists where the cost of building more T6SS weapons outweighs their protective ability. Furthermore, we found that competitions between a T6SS-armed population and a unarmed target had different outcomes dependent on the geometry of the battlefield: target cells survived at the edges of a range expansion scenario where unlimited territory could be claimed, while competitions within a confined space, much like the light organ crypts where natural V. fischeri compete, resulted in the rapid elimination of the unarmed competitor.",

    "abstract": "Urinary catheterization facilitates Escherichia coli colonization of the urinary tract and increases infection risk. While specific pathotypes are well-recognized for some E. coli infections, it is unclear whether strain-specific characteristics among E. coli are associated with infection risk in catheterized patients. Here we used comparative genomics and a simulated catheter biofilm model to compare strains associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CAASB). CAUTI was associated with a phylotype B2 sub-clade dominated by the multidrug resistant ST131 lineage, while CAASB isolates were genetically more diverse. Catheter-associated biofilm formation was widespread but quantitatively variable among isolates. Network community analysis resolved distinct groups of genes associated with infection or biofilm formation, with iron acquisition-associated genes prominent throughout. Using a reporter construct and targeted mutagenesis, we detected a biofilm phenotype for the ferric citrate transport (Fec) system, the most prominent correlate of high catheter biofilm formation in these patients. In mixed cultures, catheter biofilms formed by some CAASB strains suppressed catheter colonization by ST131 CAUTI isolates. These results are consistent with a paradigm in which catheter biofilm-associated genes increase infection risk in strains with a high pathogenic potential and decrease infection risk through niche exclusion in strains with low pathogenic potential.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomic turnovers are common in the evolutionary histories of biological communities. Such turnovers are often associated with the emergence and diversification of groups that have achieved fundamental innovations beneficial in various ecological niches. In the present study, we show that such innovation-driven turnovers could be analyzed using an equation that describes the dynamics of zero-fitness isoclines in a two-dimensional trait space comprising a \"fundamental trait\" (describing fundamental innovation) and a \"niche trait\" (describing niche position) or with its higher-dimensional extensions. Our equation allows analytical prediction of evolutionary source-sink dynamics along the niche axis for an arbitrary unimodal (or multimodal with weak separation) carrying capacity distribution. The prediction was confirmed by numerical simulation under different assumptions for resource competition, reproduction, and mutation. In the simulated evolution, biodiversity sources are the central niches having higher carrying capacities than the outer niches, allowing species there the faster evolutionary advancement in fundamental traits and their repeated diversification into outer niches, which outcompete the indigenous less advanced species. The outcompeted species go extinct or evolve directionally toward the far outer niches of the far slower advancement because of the far lower carrying capacities. In consequence of this globally acting process over niches, species occupying peripheral (i.e., the outermost) niches can have significantly primitive fundamental traits and deep divergence times from their closest relatives, and thus, they correspond to living fossils. The extension of this analysis for multiple geographic regions showed that living fossils are also expected in geographically peripheral regions for the focal species group.\n\nSignificance StatementWe developed a new equation for analyzing the long-term coevolution of many species through their directional evolution, evolutionary branching, and extinction in an arbitrary trait space comprising traits describing niche positions and traits describing fundamental innovations. This equation describes the many coevolving species as a fluid, as in the study of galaxy dynamics in astronomical physics. This equation may be used to explain how innovation-driven taxonomic turnovers generate diversification hotspots and coldspots among niches or geographical regions, accompanied by continuous production of \"living fossil\" species in peripheries, in a logic equivalent to that deduced by Darwin and Darlington from empirical observations.",

    "abstract": "To design appropriate treatments, one must be able to characterize accurately the response of bacteria to antibiotics. When exposed to {beta}-lactam treatments, bacteria can be resistant and/or tolerant, and populations can exhibit resilience. Disentangling these phenomena is challenging and no consolidated understanding has been proposed so far. Because these responses involve processes happening at several levels, including the molecular level (e.g. antibiotic degradation), the cell physiology level (filamentation) and the population level (release of {beta}-lactamases into the environment), quantitative modelling approaches are needed. Here, we propose a model of bacterial response to {beta}-lactam treatments that accounts for bacterial resistance, tolerance, and population resilience. Our model can be calibrated solely based on optical density readouts, can predict the inoculum effect, and leads to a mechanistically relevant classification of bacterial response to treatments that goes beyond the classical susceptible / intermediate / resistant classification. Filamentation-mediated tolerance and collective enzyme-mediated antibiotic degradation are essential model features to explain the complex observed response of cell populations to antibiotic treatments.",

TREM2 is a highly penetrant microglia risk gene for AD, which appears central to the coordination of the damage response by microglia in AD. Its absence has a negative impact on Tau and amyloid symptoms and pathologies. Full knowledge of its pathway and relationships with other brain cells in AD has not been fully characterised, but will be essential to fully evaluate the impact of manipulating this pathway for treatment development and to establish the best targets for achieving this. We used whole genome RNA sequencing of hippocampus and cortical brain samples from control, AD, and AD TREM2 risk carriers to identify TREM2-dependent genes driving changes in pathways, processes and cell types in AD. Through highly influential intra and intermodular hub genes and overall changes in the levels of gene expression, TREM2-DAP12 was found to strongly influence a number of other microglia, oligodendrocyte and endothelial genes, notably those involved in complement and Fc{gamma} receptor function, microglia-associated ribosomal genes and oligodendrocyte genes, particularly proteosomal subunits. These strong TREM2 centred co-expression relationships were significantly disrupted in AD cases with a TREM2 risk variant, revealing for the first time genes and pathways directly impacted by TREM2 in the brains of AD patients. Consistent with its function as a lipid sensor, our data supports a role for TREM2 in mediating oligodendrocyte and/or myelin clearance in AD which may be essential not only for preserving healthy tissue homeostasis but may also serve to minimise the persistence of antigenic peptides and lipids which may lead to detrimental pro-inflammatory sequelae. Further work should expand our knowledge of TREM2 on complement and Fc{gamma} receptor function and its impact on oligodendcrotye and myelin integrity and further evaluate the genes and pathways we have identified as possible treatment targets for AD.",

Here, we develop a tailored bioinformatic pipeline to integrate public and proprietary single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. As a result, we robustly identify for the first time 14 intermediate cell states and 11 stages of differentiation in the endothelial and mesenchymal BM compartments, respectively. Our data provide the most comprehensive description to date of the murine HSC-regulatory microenvironment and suggests a higher level of specialization of the cellular circuits than previously anticipated. Furthermore, this deep characterization allows to infer conserved features in human, suggesting that the layers of microenvironmental regulation of hematopoiesis may also be shared between species.

    "abstract": "Pathogenic Leptospira species cause leptospirosis, a neglected zoonotic disease recognized as a global public health problem. It is also the cause of the most common cattle infection that results in major economic losses due to reproductive problems. {gamma}{delta} T cells play a role in the protective immune response in livestock species against Leptospira while human {gamma}{delta} T cells also respond to Leptospira. Thus, activation of {gamma}{delta} T cells has emerged as a potential component for optimization of vaccine strategies. Bovine {gamma}{delta} T cells proliferate and produce IFN-{gamma} in response to vaccination with inactivated leptospires and this response is mediated by a specific subpopulation of the WC1-bearing {gamma}{delta} T cells. WC1 molecules are members of the group B scavenger receptor cysteine rich (SRCR) superfamily and are composed of multiple SRCR domains, of which particular extracellular domains act as ligands for Leptospira. Since WC1 molecules function as both pattern recognition receptors and {gamma}{delta} TCR coreceptors, the WC1 system has been proposed as a novel target to engage {gamma}{delta} T cells. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of leptospiral protein antigens in the activation of WC1+ {gamma}{delta} T cells and identified two leptospiral outer membrane proteins able to interact directly with them. Interestingly, we show that the protein-specific {gamma}{delta} T cell response is composed of WC1.1+ and WC1.2+ subsets, although a greater number of WC1.1+{gamma}{delta} T cells respond. Identification of protein antigens will enhance our understanding of the role {gamma}{delta} T cells play in the leptospiral immune response and in recombinant vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Completion of the Lassa virus (LASV) life cycle critically depends on the activities of the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in replication and transcription of the viral RNA genome in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The contribution of cellular proteins to these processes remains unclear. Here, we applied proximity proteomics to define the interactome of LASV polymerase in cells, under conditions that recreate LASV RNA synthesis. We engineered a LASV polymerase-biotin ligase (TurboID) fusion protein that retained polymerase activity and successfully biotinylated the proximal proteome, which allowed the identification of 42 high-confidence LASV polymerase interactors. We subsequently performed an siRNA screen to identify those interactors that have functional roles in authentic LASV infection. As proof-of-principle, we characterized eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a (eRF3a/GSPT1), which we found to be a proviral factor that physically associates with LASV polymerase. Targeted degradation of GSPT1 by a small molecule drug candidate, CC-90009, resulted in strong inhibition of LASV infection in cultured cells. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using proximity proteomics to illuminate and characterize yet to be defined, host-pathogen interactome, which can reveal new biology and uncover novel targets for the development of antivirals against highly pathogenic RNA viruses.\n\nSignificance StatementLassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), represents an important public health problem in Western Africa. There is no FDA-approved therapeutic intervention to treat LF. Due to its limited genome coding capacity, LASV proteins are often multifunctional and orchestrate complex interactions with cellular factors to execute steps required to complete the viral life cycle. LASV polymerase is essential for replication and expression of the viral genome, and thus is an attractive target for antiviral intervention. Here we present the first host interactome of the LASV polymerase, which can guide identification of novel druggable host cellular targets for the development of cost-effective antiviral therapies for LF.",

    "abstract": "Turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) provide a globally important source of protein and constitute the second most important source of poultry meat in the world. Bacterial diseases are common in commercial poultry production causing significant production losses for farmers. Due to the increasingly recognized problems associated with large-scale/indiscriminant antibiotic use in agricultural settings, poultry producers need alternative methods to control common bacterial pathogens. In this study we compared the cecal microbiota of wild and domestic turkeys, hypothesizing that environmental pressures faced by wild birds may select for a disease-resistant microbial community. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified from cecal samples indicate that free-roaming wild turkeys carry a rich and variable microbiota compared to domestic turkeys raised on large-scale poultry farms. Wild turkeys also had very low levels of Staphylococcus, Salmonella and E. coli when compared to domestic turkeys. E. coli strains isolated from wild or domestic turkey cecal samples also belong to distinct phylogenetic backgrounds and differ in their propensity to carry virulence genes. E. coli strains isolated from factory-raised turkeys were far more likely to carry genes for capsule (kpsII, kpsIII) or siderophore (iroN, fyuA) synthesis than those isolated from wild turkeys. These results suggest that the microbiota of wild turkeys may provide colonization resistance against common poultry pathogens.\n\nImportanceDue to the increasingly recognized problems associated with antibiotic use in agricultural settings, poultry producers need alternative methods to control common bacterial pathogens. In this study we compare the microbiota of wild and domestic turkeys. Results suggest that free ranging wild turkeys carry a distinct microbiome when compared to farm raised turkeys. The microbiome of wild birds contains very low levels of poultry pathogens compared to farm raised birds.

    "abstract": "A novel Hendra virus (HeV) variant, not detected by routine testing, was identified and isolated from a Queensland horse that suffered acute, fatal disease consistent with HeV infection. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the variant to have ~83% nucleotide identity to the prototype HeV strain. An updated RT-qPCR assay was designed for routine HeV surveillance. In silico and in vitro comparison of the receptor-binding protein with prototypic HeV showed that the human monoclonal antibody m102.4 used for post-exposure prophylaxis, as well as the current equine vaccine, should be effective against this variant. Genetic similarity of this virus to sequences detected from grey-headed flying-foxes suggests the variant circulates at-least in this species. Studies determining infection kinetics, pathogenicity, reservoir-species associations, viral-host co-evolution and spillover dynamics for this virus are urgently needed. Surveillance and biosecurity practices should be updated to appreciate HeV spillover risk across all regions frequented by flying foxes.",

    "abstract": "Researchers often claim that sibling analysis can be used to separate causal genetic effects from the assortment of biases that contaminate most downstream genetic studies. Indeed, typical results from sibling models show large (>50%) attenuations in the associations between polygenic scores and phenotypes compared to non-sibling models, consistent with researchers expectations about bias reduction. This paper explores these expectations by using family (quad) data and simulations that include indirect genetic effect processes and evaluates the ability of sibling models to uncover direct genetic effects. We find that sibling models, in general, fail to uncover direct genetic effects; indeed, these models have both upward and downward biases that are difficult to sign in typical data. When genetic nurture effects exist, sibling models create \"measurement error\" that attenuate associations between polygenic scores and phenotypes. As the correlation between direct and indirect effect changes, this bias can increase or decrease. Our findings suggest that interpreting results from sibling analysis aimed at uncovering direct genetic effects should be treated with caution.",

    "abstract": "Translation is the process by which ribosomes synthesize proteins. Ribosome profiling recently revealed that many short sequences previously thought to be noncoding are pervasively translated. To identify protein-coding genes in this noncanonical translatome, we combine an integrative framework for extremely sensitive ribosome profiling analysis, iRibo, with high-powered selection inferences tailored for short sequences. We construct a reference translatome for Saccharomyces cerevisiae comprising 5,400 canonical and almost 19,000 noncanonical translated elements. Only 14 noncanonical elements were evolving under detectable purifying selection. Surprisingly, a representative subset of translated elements lacking signatures of selection demonstrated involvement in processes including DNA repair, stress response and post-transcriptional regulation. Our results suggest that most translated elements are not conserved protein-coding genes and contribute to genotype-phenotype relationships through fast-evolving molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The induction of interferon-stimulated genes by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, is a critical host defence to fight virus infections. Here, a highly expressed poxvirus protein 018 is shown to inhibit IFN-induced signalling by binding the SH2 domain of STAT1 to prevent STAT1 association with an activated IFN receptor. Despite the presence of additional inhibitors of IFN-induced signalling, a poxvirus lacking 018 was attenuated in mice. The 2.0 [A] crystal structure of the 018:STAT1 complex reveals a mechanism for a high-affinity, pTyr-independent mode of binding to an SH2 domain. Furthermore, the STAT1 binding motif of 018 shows sequence similarity to the STAT1-binding proteins from Nipah virus, which like 018, block the association of STAT1 with an IFN receptor. Taken together, these results provide detailed mechanistic insight into a potent mode of STAT1 antagonism, found to exist in genetically diverse virus families.",
