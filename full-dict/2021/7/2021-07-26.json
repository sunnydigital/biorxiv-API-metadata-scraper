    "abstract": "CRISPR-based homing gene drives can be designed to disrupt essential genes whilst biasing their own inheritance, leading to suppression of mosquito populations in the laboratory. This class of gene drives relies on CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage of a target sequence and copying ( homing) therein of the gene drive element from the homologous chromosome. However, target site mutations that are resistant to cleavage yet maintain the function of the essential gene are expected to be strongly selected for. Targeting functionally constrained regions where mutations are not easily tolerated should lower the probability of resistance. Evolutionary conservation at the sequence level is often a reliable indicator of functional constraint, though the actual level of underlying constraint between one conserved sequence and another can vary widely. Here we generated a novel gene drive in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, targeting an ultra-conserved target site in a haplosufficient essential gene (AGAP029113) required during mosquito development, which fulfils many of the criteria for the target of a population suppression gene drive. We then designed a selection regime to experimentally assess the likelihood of generation and subsequent selection of gene drive resistant mutations at its target site. We simulated, in a caged population, a scenario where the gene drive was approaching fixation, where selection for resistance is expected to be strongest. Continuous sampling of the target locus revealed that a single, restorative, in-frame nucleotide substitution was selected. Our findings show that ultra-conservation alone need not be predictive of a site that is refractory to target site resistance. Our strategy to evaluate resistance in vivo could help to validate candidate gene drive targets for their resilience to resistance and help to improve predictions of the invasion dynamics of gene drives in field populations.\n\nAuthor summaryGene drives have the potential to be applied as novel control strategy of disease-transmitting mosquitoes, by spreading genetic traits that suppress or modify the target population. Many gene drive elements work by recognising and cutting a specific target sequence in the mosquito genome and copying themselves into that target sequence allowing the gene drive to increase in frequency in the population.\n\nLike other mosquito control interventions, efficacy will greatly depend on minimising the development of resistance to the gene drive mechanism - most likely via a change in the target sequence that prevents further cutting. One strategy to reduce resistance is to target sequences that are highly conserved, which implies that changes cannot easily be tolerated. We developed a strategy that simulates high selection pressure, under which resistance is most likely to emerge, and therefore provides a stringent test of its propensity to arise. Unlike previous results with another gene drive, we recovered a resistant allele within a few generations of gene drive exposure and at high frequency. Our results show that conserved sequences can vary hugely in ability to tolerate mutations and highlights the need to functionally validate future candidate gene drive target sites for their robustness to resistance.",

    "abstract": "The disease caused by Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer) causes large economic losses to the global duck industry every year. Serotype-related genomic variation (such as in O-antigen and capsular polysaccharide gene clusters) has been widely used for the serotyping in many gram-negative bacteria. To date, there have been few studies focused on genetic basis of serotypes in R. anatipestifer. Here, we used pan-genome-wide association studies (Pan-GWAS) to identify the serotype-specific genetic loci of 38 R. anatipestifers strain. Analyses of the loci of 11 serotypes showed that the loci could be well mapped with the serotypes of the corresponding strains. We constructed the knockout strain for the wzy gene at the locus, and the results showed that the mutant lost the agglutination characteristics to positive antisera. Based on the of Pan-GWAS results, we developed a multiple PCR method to identify serotypes 1, 2, and 11 of R. anatipestifer. Our study provides a precedent for systematically analysing the genetic basis of the R anatipestifer serotypes and establishing a complete serotyping system in the future.\n\nHighlightsO_LIR. anatipestifer serotype-specific locus was identified by Pan-GWAS for the first time.\nC_LIO_LIMolecular serotyping multiplex PCR was developed based on O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Drug repositioning became the first choice for treating Covid-19 patients due to the urgent need to deal with the pandemic. Similarities in the hijacking mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 and several type of cancer, suggest the repurposing of cancer drugs to treat Covid-19. CK2 kinase antagonists have been proposed for the treatment of cancer. A recent study in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus found a significant CK2 kinase activity, and the use of a CK2 inhibitor showed antiviral responses. CIGB-300, originally designed as an anticancer peptide, is an antagonist of CK2 kinase activity that binds to CK2 phospho-acceptor sites. Recent preliminary results show an antiviral activity of CIGB-300 versus a surrogate model of coronavirus. Here we present a computational biology study that provides evidences at the molecular level of how CIGB-300 might interfere with SARS-CoV-2 life cycle inside infected human cells. First, from SARS-CoV studies, we infer the potential incidence of CIGB-300 in SARS-CoV-2 interference on immune response. Next, from the analysis of multiple Omics data, we propose the action of CIGB-300 since early stage of viral infections perturbing the virus hijacking of RNA splicing machinery. It was also predicted the interference of CIGB-300 in virus-host interactions responsible for the high infectivity and the particular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, we provide evidences of CIGB-300 attenuation of phenotypes related to muscle, bleeding, coagulation and respiratory disorders.",
