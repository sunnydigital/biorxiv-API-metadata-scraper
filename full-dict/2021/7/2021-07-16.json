    "abstract": "Roughly 10% of the human population is left-handed, and this rate is increased in some brain-related disorders. The neuroanatomical correlates of hand preference have remained equivocal. We re-sampled structural brain image data from 28,802 right-handers and 3,062 left-handers (UK Biobank population dataset) to a symmetrical surface template, and mapped asymmetries for each of 8,681 vertices across the cerebral cortex in each individual. Left-handers and right-handers showed average differences of surface area asymmetry within fusiform, anterior insular, anterior-middle-cingulate and precentral cortex. Meta-analyzed functional imaging data implicated these regions in executive functions and language. Polygenic disposition to left-handedness was associated with two of these regional asymmetries, and 18 loci previously linked with left-handedness by genome-wide screening showed associations with one or more of these asymmetries. Implicated genes included six encoding microtubule-related proteins: TUBB, TUBA1B, TUBB3, TUBB4A, MAP2 and NME7 - the latter is mutated in left-right reversal of the visceral organs. There were also two cortical regions where average thickness asymmetry was altered in left-handedness: on the postcentral gyrus and inferior occipital cortex, functionally annotated with hand sensorimotor and visual roles. These cortical thickness asymmetries were not heritable. Heritable surface area asymmetries of language-related regions may link the etiologies of hand preference and language, whereas non-heritable asymmetries of sensorimotor cortex may manifest as consequences of hand preference.",

    "abstract": "Action choices are influenced by future and recent past action states. For example, when performing two actions in succession, response times (RT) to initiate the second action are reduced when the same hand is used. These findings suggest the existence of effector-specific processing for action planning. However, given that each hand is primarily controlled by the contralateral hemisphere, the RT benefit might actually reflect effector-independent, hemisphere-specific rather than effector-specific repetition effects. Here, participants performed two consecutive movements, each with a hand or a foot, in one of two directions. Direction was specified in an egocentric reference frame (inward, outward) or in an allocentric reference frame (left, right). Successive actions were initiated faster when the same limb (e.g., left hand - left hand), but not when the other limb of the same body side (e.g., left foot - left hand) executed the second action. The same-limb advantage was evident even when the two movements involved different directions, whether specified egocentrically or allocentrically. Corroborating evidence from computational modeling lends support to the claim that repetition effects in action planning reflect persistent changes in baseline activity within neural populations that encode effector-specific action plans.",

    "abstract": "1.The mechanisms underlying associations between cognitive set shifting impairments and balance dysfunction are unclear. Cognitive set shifting refers to the ability to flexibly adjust behavior to changes in task rules or contexts, which could be involved in flexibly adjusting balance recovery behavior to different contexts, such as the direction the body is falling. Prior studies found associations between cognitive set shifting impairments and severe balance dysfunction in populations experiencing frequent falls. The objective of this study was to test whether cognitive set shifting ability is expressed in successful balance recovery behavior in older adults with high clinical balance ability (N=19, 71 {+/-} 7 years, 6 female). We measured cognitive set shifting ability using the Trail Making Test and clinical balance ability using the miniBESTest. For most participants, cognitive set shifting performance (Trail Making Test B-A = 37 {+/-} 20s) was faster than normative averages (46s for comparable age and education levels), and balance ability scores (miniBESTest = 25 {+/-} 2 / 28) were above the threshold for fall risk (23 for people between 70-80 years). Reactive balance recovery in response to support-surface translations in anterior and posterior directions was assessed in terms of body motion, muscle activity, and brain activity. Across participants, lower cognitive set shifting ability was associated with smaller peak center of mass displacement during balance recovery, lower directional specificity of late phase balance-correcting muscle activity (i.e., greater antagonist muscle activity 200-300ms after perturbation onset), and larger cortical N1 responses (100-200ms). None of these measures were associated with clinical balance ability. Our results suggest that cognitive set shifting ability is expressed in balance recovery behavior even in the absence of profound clinical balance disability. Specifically, our results suggest that lower flexibility in cognitive task performance is associated with lower ability to incorporate the directional context into the cortically-mediated later phase of the motor response. The resulting antagonist activity and stiffer balance behavior may help explain associations between cognitive set shifting impairments and frequent falls.",

The poorly known \"EE derived signals\" mediating the EE effects are thought to be generated within the central nervous system. Here, we shift the focus to the body periphery, revealing that gut microbiota signals are crucial for EE-driven plasticity. Developmental analysis of intestinal bacteria composition in EE mice revealed striking differences from standard condition (ST) animals and enhanced levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Depleting the EE mice gut microbiota with an antibiotic cocktail decreased SCFA and prevented EE induction of adult ocular dominance (OD) plasticity, spine dynamics and microglia rearrangement. SCFA treatment in ST mice mimicked the EE induction of adult OD plasticity and morphological microglial rearrangement. Remarkably, transferring the microbiota of EE mice to ST recipients activated adult OD plasticity. Thus, taken together our data suggest that experience-dependent changes in gut microbiota regulate brain plasticity.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought devastating consequences at a clinical, social and economical levels. Therefore, anticipation of potential novel SARS-causing species or SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced binding to ACE2 is key in the prevention of future threats to come. We have characterized a de novo single substitution, Q498Y, in SARS-CoV-2 RBD that confers stronger adherence to ACE2. While the SARS-CoV-2 {beta} variant, which includes three simultaneous amino acid replacements, induces a 4-fold stronger affinity, a single Q498Y substitution results in 2.5-fold tighter binding, compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 2019 strain. Additionally, we crystallized RBDQ498Y complexed with ACE2 and provide here the structural basis for this enhanced affinity.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 variants brought new waves of infection worldwide. In particular, Delta variant (B.1.617.2 lineage) has become predominant in many countries. These variants raised the concern for their potential immune escape to the currently approved vaccines. ZF2001 is a subunit vaccine received emergency use authorization (EUA) in both China and Uzbekistan, with more than 100-million doses administrated with a three-dose regimen. The tandem-repeat dimer of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) was used as the antigen. In this work, we evaluated the neutralization of ZF2001-elicited antisera to SARS-CoV-2 variants including all four variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) and other three variants of interest (Epsilon, Eta and Kappa) by pseudovirus-based assay. We found antisera preserved majority of the neutralizing activity against these variants. E484K/Q substitution is the key mutation to reduce the RBD-elicited sera neutralization. Moreover, ZF2001-elicited sera with a prolonged intervals between the second and third dose enhanced the neutralizing titers and resilience to SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Genetic truncations in a gene encoding a putative glucose-PTS protein (manL, EIIABMan) were identified in subpopulations of two separate laboratory stocks of Streptococcus sanguinis SK36; the mutants had reduced PTS activities on glucose and other monosaccharides. Using an engineered mutant of manL and its complemented derivative, we showed that the ManL-deficient strain had improved bacterial viability in stationary phase and was better able to inhibit the growth of the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. Transcriptional analysis and biochemical assays suggested that the manL mutant underwent reprograming of central carbon metabolism that directed pyruvate away from production of lactate, increasing production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and excretion of pyruvate. Addition of pyruvate to the medium enhanced the survival of SK36 in overnight cultures. Meanwhile, elevated pyruvate levels were detected in the cultures of a small, but significant percentage ([~]10%), of clinical isolates of oral commensal bacteria. Furthermore, the manL mutant showed higher expression of the arginine deiminase system than the wild type, which enhanced the ability of the mutant to raise environmental pH when arginine was present. Significant discrepancies in genome sequence were identified between strain SK36 obtained from ATCC and the sequence deposited in GenBank. As the conditions that are likely associated with the emergence of spontaneous manL mutations, i.e. excess carbohydrates and low pH, are those associated with caries development, we propose that the glucose-PTS strongly influences commensal-pathogen interactions by altering the production of ammonia, pyruvate, and H2O2.\n\nImportanceA health-associated dental microbiome provides a potent defense against pathogens and diseases. Streptococcus sanguinis is an abundant member of a health-associated oral flora that antagonizes pathogens by producing hydrogen peroxide. There is a need for a better understanding of the mechanisms that allow bacteria to survive carbohydrate-rich and acidic environments associated with the development of dental caries. We report the isolation and characterization of spontaneous mutants of S. sanguinis with impairment in glucose transport. The resultant reprograming of central metabolism in these mutants reduced the production of lactic acid and increased pyruvate accumulation; the latter enables these bacteria to better cope with hydrogen peroxide and low pH. The implications of these discoveries in the development of dental caries are discussed.",

    "abstract": "For many intracellular bacterial pathogens manipulating host cell survival is essential for maintaining a replicative niche, and is a common strategy used to promote infection. The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is well known to hijack host machinery for its own benefit, such as targeting the host histone H3 for modification by SIRT2. However, in what way this modification benefits infection, as well as the molecular players involved, remain unknown. Here we show that SIRT2 activity supports Listeria intracellular survival by maintaining genome integrity and host cell viability. This protective effect is dependent on H3K18 deacetylation, which safeguards the host genome by counteracting infection-induced DNA damage. Mechanistically, infection causes SIRT2 to interact with the nucleic acid binding protein TDP-43 and localise to genomic R-loops, where H3K18 deacetylation occurs. This work highlights novel functions of TDP-43 and R-loops during bacterial infection and identifies the mechanism through which L. monocytogenes co-opts SIRT2 to allow efficient infection.",

Potentially active genes display nucleosome depleted regions flanked by positioned -1 and +1 nucleosomes.

Here, using acute nutrient starvation to rapidly reprogramme the genome, we show highly dynamic upstream or downstream shifts in the position of +1 nucleosomes, coincident with levels of transcriptionally engaged Pol2 at 58% of genes. Transcript level changes broadly reflect Pol2 occupancy changes with a delay but can be further influenced by Pub1 or Puf3 dependent changes in transcript degradation rates. The response to acute stress has a second component as we also observed genome-wide changes in Pol2 distribution on genes, independent of changes in Pol2 occupancy, with Pol2 accumulating upstream of a +170 nt stalling site. Mathematical modelling supports a global increase in promoter-proximal early transcription termination as a major component of the global stress response. Thus, we uncover a two-component transcriptional response to stress, one focused on the +1 nucleosome, the second on Pol2 itself.\n\nO_LIA two-component responses to acute stress involving a gene-specific response and a global response\nC_LIO_LIDynamic shifting of +1 nucleosome position with transcriptional activation or repression.\nC_LIO_LIGlobal targeting of Pol2 leading to early transcription termination on acute stress\nC_LI",

These diseases are caused by oncogenic mutations in the endothelium which result in overactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Lack of robust in vivo preclinical data has prevented the development and translation into clinical trials of specific molecular therapies for these diseases. Here, we describe a new reproducible preclinical in vivo model of PI3K-driven vascular malformations using the postnatal mouse retina. This model reproduces human disease with Pik3ca activating mutations expressed in a mosaic pattern and vascular malformations formed in veins and capillaries. We show that active angiogenesis is required for the pathogenesis of vascular malformations caused by activating Pik3ca mutations. Using this model, we demonstrate that low doses of the AKT inhibitor miransertib both prevents and induces the regression of PI3K-driven vascular malformations.

Functionally, CSP has been implicated in chaperoning synaptic proteins and in misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS), but how CSP dysfunction causes lipofuscinosis and neurodegeneration is unclear. Here we report two distinct protein quality control functions of CSP at endolysosomes and perinuclear vesicles, respectively. We show that the endolysosome-associated CSP promotes microautophagy of misfolded clients, but is dispensable for MAPS. By contrast, the perinuclear-localized CSP, regulated by a previously unknown CSP interactor named CD98hc, is critical for MAPS but unneeded for microautophagy. Importantly, these processes are coupled by CSP in a J-domain regulated manner. Uncoupling these two processes, as seen in cells lacking CD98hc or expressing ANCL-associated CSP mutants, generates CSP-containing AFSMs resembling NCL patient-derived lipofuscin, and also induces neurodegeneration in a Drosophila ANCL model. These findings suggest that blocking MAPS while allowing CSP-mediated microautophagy disrupts lysosome homeostasis, causing CSP-associated lipofuscinosis and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6) is a marker of osteoprogenitor cells and is dynamically expressed during in vitro osteodifferentation of mouse and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). While the Lgr6 genomic locus has been associated with osteoporosis in human cohorts, the precise molecular function of LGR6 in osteogenesis and maintenance of bone mass are not yet known. In this study, we performed in vitro Lgr6 knockdown and overexpression experiments in murine osteoblastic cells and find decreased Lgr6 levels results in reduced osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization. Consistent with these data, overexpression of Lgr6 in these cells leads to significantly increased proliferation and osteodifferentiation. To determine whether these findings are recapitulated in vivo, we performed microCT and ex vivo osteodifferentiation analyses using our newly generated CRISPR-Cas9 mediated Lgr6 mouse knockout allele (Lgr6-KO). We find that ex vivo osteodifferentiation of Lgr6-KO primary MSCs is significantly reduced, and 8 week-old Lgr6-KO mice have less trabecular bone mass as compared to Lgr6 wildtype controls, indicating that Lgr6 is necessary for normal osteogenesis and to attain peak bone mass. Toward mechanism, we analyzed in vitro signaling in the context of two LGR6 ligands, RSPO2 and MaR1. We find that RSPO2 stimulates LGR6-mediated WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling whereas MaR1 stimulates LGR6-mediated cAMP activity, suggesting two ligand-dependent functions for LGR6 receptor signaling during osteogenesis. Collectively, this study reveals that Lgr6 is necessary for wildtype levels of proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, and achieving peak bone mass.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) differentiations can capture developmental phenotypes and processes. They are useful for studying fundamental biological mechanisms driving tissue morphogenesis and cell lineage development. Here, we show temporal development of lung cell lineages using hPSC that recapitulate developmental milestones observed in primary tissue, the generation of renewable fetal lung epithelial spheroids, and the functional utility of the lung models at different differentiation stages for cystic fibrosis disease modeling. We first show the presence of hPSC-derived lung progenitor cells reminiscent of early trimester lung development and containing basal stem cells that generate renewable airway spheroids. Maturation and polarization in air liquid interface (ALI) generates additional epithelial cell lineages found in adult airways, including pulmonary neuroendocrine, brush, mature basal, ciliated and secretory cell types. Finally, pseudotime and RNA velocity analyses of the integrated datasets from fetal and ALI stages reveal both previously identified and new cell lineage relationships. Overall, hPSC differentiation can capture aspects of human lung development and potentially provide important insight into congenital causes of diseases.",

    "abstract": "The genetic composition of the gut microbiota is constantly reshaped by ecological and evolutionary forces. These strain-level dynamics can be challenging to understand because they emerge from complex spatial growth processes that take place within a host. Here we introduce a general population genetic framework to predict how stochastic evolutionary forces emerge from simple models of microbial growth in spatially extended environments like the intestinal lumen. Our framework shows how fluid flow and longitudinal variation in growth rate combine to shape the frequencies of genetic variants in sequenced fecal samples, yielding analytical expressions for the effective generation times, selection coefficients, and rates of genetic drift. We find that the emergent evolutionary dynamics can often be captured by well-mixed models that lack explicit spatial structure, even when there is substantial spatial variation in species-level composition. By applying these results to the human colon, we find that continuous fluid flow and simple forms of wall growth are unlikely to create sufficient bottlenecks to allow large fluctuations in mutant frequencies within a host. We also find that the effective gener-ation times may be significantly shorter than expected from traditional average growth rate estimates. Our results provide a starting point for qua ntifying genetic turnover in spatially extended settings like the gut microbiota, and may be relevant for other microbial ecosystems where unidirectional fluid flow plays an important role.",

    "abstract": "Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is frequently overexpressed in cancer, but the role of MELK in cancer is still poorly understood. MELK was shown to have roles in many cancer-associated processes including tumor growth, chemotherapy resistance, and tumor recurrence. To determine whether the frequent overexpression of MELK can be exploited in therapy, we performed a high-throughput screen using a library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants to identify genes whose functions become essential when MELK is overexpressed. We identified two such genes: LAG2 and HDA3. LAG2 encodes an inhibitor of the SCF ubiquitin-ligase complex, while HDA3 encodes a subunit of the HDA1 histone deacetylase complex. We find that one of these synthetic lethal interactions is conserved in mammalian cells, as inhibition of a human homolog of HDA3 (HDAC4) is synthetically toxic in MELK overexpression cells. Altogether, our work might provide a new angle of how to exploit MELK overexpression in cancers and might thus lead to novel intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Introgressive hybridization is an important process in evolution but challenging to identify, undermining the efforts to understand its role and significance. On the other hand, many analytical methods assume direct descent from a single common ancestor, and admixture among populations can violate their assumptions and lead to seriously biased results. A detailed analysis of 888 whole genome sequences of nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) revealed a complex pattern of population ancestry involving multiple waves of gene flow and introgression across northern Europe. The two recognized lineages were found to have drastically different histories and their secondary contact zone was wider than anticipated, displaying a smooth gradient of foreign ancestry with some curious deviations from the expected pattern. Interestingly, the freshwater isolates provided peeks into the past and helped to understand the intermediate states of evolutionary processes. Our analyses and findings paint a detailed picture of the complex colonization history of northern Europe and provide back-drop against which introgression and its role in evolution can be investigated. However, they also expose the challenges in analyses of admixed populations and demonstrate how hidden admixture and colonization history misleads the estimation of admixture proportions and population split times.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are middle-repeated DNA sequences that can move along chromosomes using internal coding and regulatory regions. By their ability to move and because they are repeated, TEs can promote mutations. Especially they can alter the expression pattern of neighboring genes and have been shown to be involved in the mammalian regulatory network evolution. Human and mouse share more than 95% of their genomes and are affected by comparable diseases, which makes the mouse a perfect model in cancer research. However not much investigation concerning the mouse TE content has been made on this topics. In human cancer condition, a global activation of TEs can been observed which may ask the question of their impact on neighboring gene functioning. In this work, we used RNA sequences of highly aggressive pancreatic tumors from mouse to analyze the gene and TE deregulation happening in this condition compared to pancreas from healthy animals. Our results show that several TE families are deregulated and that the presence of TEs is associated with the expression divergence of genes in the tumor condition. These results illustrate the potential role of TEs in the global deregulation at work in the cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "The formation of social relationships in complex groups is critical in shaping patterns of social organization and behavioral development. In many birds, young individuals remain dependent on their parents for extended periods but must abruptly transition to navigating interactions in the wider group after independence. While lack of social relationships during this period is detrimental in the development of later social skills, little is known about the social relationships juveniles form after independence in many bird species. In this study we describe patterns of social interactions in juvenile Gouldian Finches (Erythrura gouldiae) during transitions from family groups into flocks of unfamiliar individuals. A group of 20 juveniles from 4 families were introduced into two flocks. After introductions juveniles showed a gradient of approach rates with most approaches directed towards siblings, followed by juvenile peers, adult females, and lastly adult males. Significant preferences for siblings resulted in the emergence of sibling subgroups within the larger social network. This active self-assortment of siblings suggests that sibling sub-groups are an important bridge linking social connections within the family and the wider group. Such findings suggests that sibling relationships have a critical role in the socialization after independence, as well as structuring the social organization of Gouldian finch flocks.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila (LP) avoids phagocytosis by secreting nearly 300 effector proteins into the host cytosol. SidE family of effectors (SdeA, SdeB, SdeC and SidE) employ phosphoribosyl serine ubiquitination to target an array of host Rab GTPases and innate immune factors. To suppress the deleterious toxicity of SidE enzymes in a timely manner, LP employs a metaeffector named SidJ. Upon activation by host Calmodulin (CaM), SidJ executes an ATP-dependent glutamylation to modify the catalytic residue Glu860 in the mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (mART) domain of SdeA. SidJ is a unique glutamylase that adopts a kinase-like fold but contains two nucleotide-binding pockets. There is a lack of consensus about the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of SidJ. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of SidJ in complex with its substrate SdeA in two different states of catalysis. Our structures reveal that both phosphodiesterase (PDE) and mART domains of SdeA make extensive contacts with SidJ. In the pre-glutamylation state structure of the SidJ-SdeA complex, adenylylated E860 of SdeA is inserted into the non-canonical (migrated) nucleotide-binding pocket of SidJ. Structure-based mutational analysis indicates that SidJ employs its migrated pocket for the glutamylation of SdeA. Finally, using mass spectrometry, we identified several transient autoAMPylation sites close to both the catalytic pockets of SidJ. Our data provide unique insights into the substrate recognition and the mechanism of protein glutamylation by the pseudokinase SidJ.",

    "abstract": "Pooling metabolomics data across studies is often desirable to increase the statistical power of the analysis. However, this can raise methodological challenges as several preanalytical and analytical factors could introduce differences in measured concentrations and variability between datasets. Specifically, different studies may use variable sample types (e.g., serum versus plasma) collected, treated and stored according to different protocols, and assayed in different laboratories using different instruments. To address these issues, a new pipeline was developed to normalize and pool metabolomics data through a set of sequential steps: (i) exclusions of the least informative observations and metabolites and removal of outliers; imputation of missing data; (ii) identification of the main sources of variability through PC-PR2 analysis; (iii) application of linear mixed models to remove unwanted variability, including samples originating study and batch, and preserve biological variations while accounting for potential differences in the residual variances across studies. This pipeline was applied to targeted metabolomics data acquired using Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ kits in eight case-control studies nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Comprehensive examination of metabolomics measurements indicated that the pipeline improved the comparability of data across the studies. Our pipeline can be adapted to normalize other molecular data, including biomarkers as well as proteomics data, and could be used for pooling molecular datasets, for example in international consortia, to limit biases introduced by inter-study variability. This versatility of the pipeline makes our work of potential interest to molecular epidemiologists.",

    "abstract": "Malignant hepatocellular cancers are the most common primary liver malignancies in children, and hepatoblastomas (HBs) account for more than two-thirds of these cases. While most HBs respond to chemotherapy and have favorable outcomes, the 3-year overall survival rate for high-risk HBs is below 50% and guidelines for their classification and treatment are still evolving. HB risk-stratification efforts using clinical, histological, and molecular parameters have been reported to help identify patients that require more or less aggressive therapies in retrospective studies, and are being validated in clinical trials. However, risk assessment is particularly challenging for cancers with certain histologies, including tumors in the recently proposed provisional hepatocellular neoplasm not otherwise specified (HCN NOS) category. HCN NOSs exhibit either intermediate or combined HB and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) histological features, and while neoplasms with such features were observed over a decade ago, only a handful have been characterized and little is known about their biology and clinical features. Here, we molecularly characterized a series of clinically annotated HCN NOSs that demonstrated either intermediate HB/HCC histology or distinct coexisting areas with HB and HCC histological features. In addition, molecular profiling of HBs demonstrating focal pleomorphism or anaplasia (HB FPA) revealed underlying biological features previously observed in HCCs. Our study suggested that HCN NOSs and HB FPAs are aggressive tumors, irrespective of patient age or resectability. Consequently, we designated them collectively as HBs with carcinoma features (HBCs) and outlined histological and molecular characteristics for their diagnosis and treatment. In our single-institution study, transplanted HBC patients were significantly and more than twice as likely to have good outcomes, highlighting the importance of molecular testing and aggressive early intervention.",

Knockdown the expression of TaBln1 by virus-induced gene silencing reduced Pst growth and development, and enhanced the host defense response. In addition, TaBln1 was found to physically interact with TaCaM3 on the plasma membrane. Silencing TaCaM3 with virus-induced gene silencing increased fungal infection areas and sporulation and reduced wheat resistance to the Pst CYR23 and CYR31. Moreover, we found that the TaCaM3 transcription level could be induced by treatment with chitin but not flg22.

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, mediate homeostatic processes, allowing individuals to adjust to fluctuating environments. The regulation of circadian cortisol responses, a key homeostatic function, has been shown to be heritable. However, to understand better the role of parental care in shaping physiological functioning in long-lived mammals with protracted parental care, there is a need to disentangle genetic and non-genetic parental contributions to variation in glucocorticoid phenotypes. We used a dataset of 6,123 cortisol measures from urine samples from 170 wild chimpanzees spanning 18 years of data collection. We found consistent inter-individual differences in circadian cortisol phenotypes, with differences most apparent when considering average cortisol levels given the effect of time of day. Maternal effects explained around 10% (2-18%) variation in these average cortisol levels, while variation attributable to genetic factors was not distinguishable from zero. Our results indicate, relative to genetic effects, a qualitatively stronger influence of mothers, whether via epigenetic processes or via behavioral priming for coping with stressors, in shaping cortisol phenotypes in this species. This provides novel insight into the vital role of mothers in the developmental plasticity of long-lived mammals and, more generally, the selective pressures shaping physiological plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Automated mouse phenotyping through the high-throughput analysis of home cage behavior has brought hope of a more effective and efficient method for testing rodent models of diseases. Advanced video analysis software is able to derive behavioral sequence data sets from multiple-day recordings. However, no dedicated mechanisms exist for sharing or analyzing these types of data. In this article, we present a free, open-source software actionable through a web browser (an R Shiny application), which can perform state-of-the-art multidimensional analysis of home cage behavioral sequence data. The software aligns time-series data to the light/dark cycle, and then uses different time windows to produce up to 162 behavior variables per animal. It prevents p-hacking by providing an analysis that uses a principal component analysis strategy, while also representing the behavior graphically for further explorative analysis. A machine-learning approach was implemented, but it proved ineffective at separating the experimental groups.\n\nThe software requires spreadsheets that provide information about the experiment (i.e., metadata), thus promoting a data management strategy that leads to FAIR data production. This encourages the publication of some metadata even when the data are kept private. We tested our software by comparing the behavior of female mice in videos recorded twice at 3 and 7 months in a home cage monitoring system. This study demonstrated that combining data management with data analysis leads to a more efficient and effective research process.",

    "abstract": "Spider silk is a protein-based material whose toughness suggests possible novel applications. A particularly fascinating example of silk toughness is provided by Darwins bark spider (Caerostris darwini) found in Madagascar. This spider produces extraordinarily tough silk, with an average toughness of 350 MJ/m and over 50% extensibility, and can build river-bridging webs with a size of 2.8 m2. Recent studies have suggested that specific spidroins expressed in C. darwini are responsible for the mechanical properties of its silk. Therefore, a more comprehensive investigation of spidroin sequences, silk thread protein contents, and phylogenetic conservation among closely related species is required. Here, we conducted genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of C. darwini and its close relative Caerostris extrusa. A variety of spidroins and low-molecular-weight proteins were found in the dragline silk of these species; all of the genes encoding these proteins were conserved in both genomes, but their genes were more expressed in C. darwini. The potential to produce very tough silk is common in the genus Caerostris, and our results may suggest the existence of plasticity allowing silk mechanical properties to be changed by optimizing related gene expression in response to the environment.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal effects associated with COVID-19 are highly variable for reasons that are not understood. In this study, we used intestinal organoid-derived cultures differentiated from primary human specimens as a model to examine inter-individual variability. Infection of intestinal organoids derived from different donors with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in orders of magnitude differences in virus replication in small intestinal and colonic organoid-derived monolayers. Susceptibility to infection correlated with ACE2 expression level and was independent of donor demographic or clinical features. ACE2 transcript levels in cell culture matched the amount of ACE2 in primary tissue indicating this feature of the intestinal epithelium is retained in the organoids. Longitudinal transcriptomics of organoid-derived monolayers identified a delayed yet robust interferon signature, the magnitude of which corresponded to the degree of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, virus with the Omicron variant spike protein infected the organoids with the highest infectivity, suggesting increased tropism of the virus for intestinal tissue. These results suggest that heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 replication in intestinal tissues results from differences in ACE2 levels, which may underlie variable patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The effect of nutrient availability on plant growth and the terrestrial carbon sink under climate change and elevated CO2 remains one of the main uncertainties of the terrestrial carbon cycle. This is partially due to the difficulty of assessing nutrient limitation at large scales over long periods of time. Consistent declines in leaf nitrogen (N) content and leaf {delta}15N have been used to suggest that nitrogen limitation has increased in recent decades, most likely due to the concurrent increase in atmospheric CO2. However, such datasets are often not straightforward to interpret due to the complex factors that contribute to the spatial and temporal variation in leaf N and isotope concentration. We use the land surface model QUINCY, which has the unique capacity to represent N isotopic processes, in conjunction with two large datasets of foliar N and N isotope content. We run the model with different scenarios to test whether foliar {delta}15N isotopic data can be used to infer large scale nitrogen limitation and if the observed trends are caused by increasing atmospheric CO2, changes in climate or changes in sources of anthropogenic N deposition. We show that while the model can capture the observed change in leaf N content and predicts widespread increases in N limitation, it does not capture the pronounced, but very spatially heterogeneous, decrease in foliar {delta}15N observed in the data across the globe. The addition of an observed temporal trend in isotopic composition of N deposition leads to a more pronounced decrease in simulated leaf {delta}15N. Our results show that leaf {delta}15N observations should not, on their own, be used to assess global scale N limitation and that using such a dataset in conjunction with a land surface model can reveal the drivers behind the observed patterns.",

    "abstract": "Mediation models are a set of statistical techniques that investigate the mechanisms that produce an observed relationship between an exposure variable and an outcome variable in order to deduce the extent to which the relationship is influenced by intermediate mediator variables. For a case-control study, the most common mediation analysis strategy employs a counterfactual framework that permits estimation of indirect and direct effects on the odds ratio scale for dichotomous outcomes, assuming either binary or continuous mediators. While this framework has become an important tool for mediation analysis, we demonstrate that we can embed this approach in a unified likelihood framework for mediation analysis in case-control studies that leverages more features of the data (in particular, the relationship between exposure and mediator) to improve efficiency of indirect effect estimates. One important feature of our likelihood approach is that it naturally incorporates cases within the exposure-mediator model to improve efficiency. Our approach does not require knowledge of disease prevalence and can model confounders and exposure-mediator interactions, and is straightforward to implement in standard statistical software. We illustrate our approach using both simulated data and real data from a case-control genetic study of lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "The mdx mouse (C57BL/10ScSn-DMDmdx/J) is the oldest model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Mdx remains popular and has not been replaced by newer mouse models, despite criticisms that mdx has a nearly normal lifespan and mild pathology while DMD remains a severe, fatal disease. At some point we noticed that the absence of mdx RNA-seq data limited our ability to assess the results of physiological work on the mouse model and to compare these results to human genetic data [1]. We carried out RNA-seq analysis of wild-type and mdx mice of 2 and 5 months of age, using three hindlimb muscles per mouse: the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and the soleus (SOL), with a total of 55 samples. We then mined the data and found that each of the three muscles is a valid experimental model for DMD-related mouse work, even the FDB, despite a delayed pathology development. We also show that the mdx mouse muscles are enriched in metabolic, developmental, regenerational and structural pathways that have been found to be the \"disease signature\" of DMD in young and presymptomatic subjects [38, 39]. Additionally, we show that healthy human muscle fiber microtubules present the grid-like organization found in control rodents but perturbed in the mdx mouse. We conclude that the mdx mouse appropriately mimics the early stages of DMD, with its microtubule defects signaling fiber regeneration [35]. We hope that these results may contribute to a better understanding of the failure of regeneration as DMD progresses.",

These act as heterochronic genes in regulating developmental timing in response to the steroid hormone ecdysone and play important roles in cell differentiation. Here we identify two additional long non-coding RNAs in the let-7 complex, we named let-A and let-B. Both are transcribed in the large first intron of the primary RNA encoding the microRNAs. We show these RNAs to be sequentially expressed in early pupal stages in response to ecdysone signaling, albeit exhibiting a different expression pattern compared to the microRNA let-7. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of let-A in Drosophila cancer cells induces rapid cell death. Dead cells further release RNA molecules in the medium that is becoming toxic to other cancer cells. In vivo grown tumors lose their tumorigenicity after being incubated in the let-A induced medium. Moreover, feeding flies carrying transplanted tumor cells with such induced medium leads to reduced growth of tumors in a subset of hosts. Our results uncover a new lncRNA which can act as a potent and specific cell death effector for Drosophila tumor cells.",

With respect to standard genome editing technologies, CRISPR-Cas machinery can be introduced in the form of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), thus avoiding the introduction of exogenous DNA into cells. The interest on the application of DNA-free delivery into plant cells is constantly increasing, especially in the case of valuable woody plants elite varieties where CRISPR-Cas9 technology would preserve their genotype, while still resulting into targeted genetic modifications. The use of single cells fits well the requirements of New Breeding Technologies, by ensuring both the CRISPR-Cas DNA-free delivery as RNPs and, since every plant will be regenerated from a single edited cell, the absence of chimerism. However, the use of protoplasts cell culture from woody plants is generally hampered by low editing efficiencies and an unsuccessful regenerative process.\n\nWe here describe a successful DNA-free methodology to obtain fully edited grapevine plants, regenerated from protoplasts obtained from V. vinifera cv. Crimson seedless L. embryogenic callus. The transfected protoplasts were edited on the Downy Mildew susceptibility gene VvDMR6-2.

Using BioID mass spectrometry and a mitochondrial targeting assay, we establish that tensin3 associates with the mechanosensors talin and vinculin. We show that the talin R11 rod domain binds directly to a helical motif within the central intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of tensin3, whilst vinculin binds indirectly to tensin3 via talin. Using CRISPR knock-out cells in combination with defined tensin3 mutations, we show (i) that tensin3 is critical for formation of 5{beta}1-integrin FBs and for fibronectin fibrillogenesis, and (ii) the talin/tensin3 interaction drives this process, with vinculin acting to potentiate it.",

Vectors corresponding to amino acid substitutions are classified based on whether they are accessible via a single-nucleotide mutation. It is shown that the standard genetic code establishes a \"choice architecture\" that permits nearly independent tuning of the properties related with size and those related with hydrophobicity. This work sheds light on the non-arbitrary benefits of evolvability that may have shaped the development standard genetic code to increase the probability that adaptive point mutations will be generated. Illustrations of the usefulness of visualizing amino acid substitutions in a 3D physicochemical space are shown using recent datasets collected regarding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. First, the substitutions most responsible for antibody escape are almost always inaccessible via single nucleotide mutation, and change multiple properties concurrently. Second, it is shown that assays of ACE2 binding by sarbecovirus variants, including the viruses responsible for SARS and COVID-19, are more easily understood when plotted with this method. The results of this research can extend our understanding of certain hereditary disorders caused by point mutations, as well as guide the development of rational protein and vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Populations of cortical neurons respond to common input within a millisecond. Morphological features and active ion channel properties were suggested to contribute to this astonishing processing speed. Here we report an exhaustive study of ultrafast population coding for varying axon initial segment (AIS) location, soma size, and axonal current properties. In particular, we studied their impact on two experimentally observed features 1) precise action potential timing, manifested in a wide-bandwidth dynamic gain, and 2) high-frequency boost under slowly fluctuating correlated input. While the density of axonal channels and their distance from the soma had a very small impact on bandwidth, it could be moderately improved by increasing soma size. When the voltage sensitivity of axonal currents was increased we observed ultrafast coding and high-frequency boost. We conclude that these computationally relevant features are strongly dependent on axonal ion channels voltage sensitivity, but not their number or exact location. We point out that ion channel properties, unlike dendrite size, can undergo rapid physiological modification, suggesting that the temporal accuracy of neuronal population encoding could be dynamically regulated. Our results are in line with recent experimental findings in AIS pathologies and establish a framework to study structure-function relations in AIS molecular design.",

Such mechanisms can be studied combining high-throughput molecular profiling technologies such as transcriptomics and metabolomics. However, the integrative analysis of multi-omics data in order to unravel disease mechanisms is a challenging task without advanced bioinformatics training.

    "abstract": "SARM1 is an inducible TIR-domain NAD+ hydrolase that mediates pathological axon degeneration. SARM1 is activated by an increased ratio of NMN to NAD+, which competes for binding to an allosteric activating site. When NMN binds, the TIR domain is released from autoinhibition, activating its NAD+ hydrolase activity. The discovery of this allosteric activating site led us to hypothesize that other NAD+-related metabolites might also activate SARM1. Here we show that the nicotinamide analogue 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP), first identified as a neurotoxin in the 1940s, is converted to 3-APMN which activates SARM1 and induces SARM1-dependent NAD+ depletion, axon degeneration and neuronal death. Systemic treatment with 3-AP causes rapid SARM1-dependent death, while local application to peripheral nerve induces SARM1-dependent axon degeneration. We also identify a related pyridine derivative, 2-aminopyridine, as another SARM1-dependent neurotoxin. These findings identify SARM1 as a candidate mediator of environmental neurotoxicity, and furthermore, suggest that SARM1 agonists could be developed into selective agents for neurolytic therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cover-all mapping of the distribution of neurons in the human brain would have a significant impact on the deep understanding of brain function. Therefore, complete knowledge of the structural organization of different human brain regions at the cellular level would allow understanding their role in the functions of specific neural networks. Recent advances in tissue clearing techniques have allowed important advances towards this goal. These methods use specific chemicals capable of dissolving lipids, making the tissue completely transparent by homogenizing the refractive index. However, labeling and clearing human brain samples is still challenging. Here, we present an approach to perform the cellular mapping of the human cerebral cortex coupling immunostaining with SWITCH/TDE clearing and confocal microscopy. A specific evaluation of the contributions of the autofluorescence signals generated from the tissue fixation is provided as well as an assessment of lipofuscin pigments interference. Our evaluation demonstrates the possibility of obtaining an efficient clearing and labeling process of parts of adult human brain slices, making it an excellent method for morphological classification and antibody validation of neuronal and non-neuronal markers.",

    "abstract": "Animals and their commensal bacteria are known to reciprocally influence many traits of their physiology. Specifically, microbes contribute to the maintenance of the immune system homeostasis, improve host digestive processes, and sustain host growth and development. Several studies have reported that such effects result from an intricate network of nutritional, metabolic and immune inputs and partly rely on the capacity of microbes to regulate the hosts transcriptional response. However, these evidences mainly come from comparing the transcriptional response caused by commensal bacteria with that of axenic animals, making it difficult to identify the specific animal genes that are regulated by beneficial microbes. Here, we employ a well-established model of nutritional symbiosis, Drosophila melanogaster associated with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, to understand the host genetic pathways regulated by beneficial bacteria and leading to improved host growth and development. Using isogenic L. plantarum strains bearing different growth-promoting effects, we show that the microbial benefit to the host relies on the down-regulation of peptidoglycan- recognition proteins. In particular, we report that the lower expression of PGRP-SC1 exerted by growth-promoting bacteria is responsible for their higher proliferation and the consequent increased production of beneficial metabolites, which ultimately leads to improved host growth and development. Our study helps elucidate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect exerted by commensal bacteria, defining the role of PGRP-SC1 in the relationship between Drosophila and its gut microbes.\n\nIMPORTANCECommensal bacteria are in constant association with their animal hosts, significantly affecting animal physiology through an intricate network of nutritional, metabolic and immune inputs. Yet, how beneficial bacteria specifically improve animal health is not fully understood. Here, we used a well-established model of nutritional symbiosis to understand how beneficial gut microbes improve host growth via regulation of its transcriptional response. Our study advances the current knowledge in host-microbe interactions by demonstrating that commensal bacteria improve fly growth by actively regulating the expression of immune effectors, which lead to higher immune tolerance. This leads to higher bacterial proliferation and the increased production of beneficial microbial metabolites, which are then consumed by the host. Our results shed light on the complex mechanisms underlying the relationships between a host and its gut microbes.",

    "abstract": "The rates of cell growth, division, and carbon loss of microbial populations are key parameters for understanding how organisms interact with their environment and how they contribute to the carbon cycle. However, the invasive nature of current analytical methods has hindered efforts to reliably quantify these parameters. In recent years, size-structured matrix population models (MPMs) have gained popularity for estimating rate parameters of microbial populations by mechanistically describing changes in microbial cell size distributions over time. And yet, the construction, analysis, and biological interpretation of these models are underdeveloped, as current implementations do not adequately constrain or assess the biological feasibility of parameter values, leading to inference which may provide a good fit to observed size distributions but does not necessarily reflect realistic physiological dynamics. Here we present a flexible Bayesian extension of size-structured MPMs for testing underlying assumptions describing the dynamics of a marine phytoplankton population over the day-night cycle. Our Bayesian framework takes prior scientific knowledge into account and generates biologically interpretable results. Using data from an exponentially growing laboratory culture of the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, we herein demonstrate the performance improvements of our approach over current models and isolate previously ignored biological processes, such as respiratory and exudative carbon losses, as critical parameters for the modeling of microbial population dynamics. The results demonstrate that this modeling framework can provide deeper insights into microbial population dynamics provided by flow-cytometry time-series data.\n\nAuthor summaryIdentifying the growth and population dynamics of marine microorganisms in their natural habitat is crucial to understanding the flow of carbon in the oceans but remains a grand challenge due to the invasive nature of current measurement methods. As time-series observations of population size structure have become more commonplace in aquatic environments, matrix population models (MPMs), which aim to mechanistically describe the change in size structure of these populations over time, have gained in popularity over the last decade. However, the underlying assumptions and behavior of MPMs have not been adequately scrutinized, and parameter values are difficult to interpret biologically, leading to inference that may not reflect plausible physiological dynamics. Here, we develop a Bayesian extension of the MPM framework to examine biological assumptions, improve interpretability of model output, and account for additional biological processes. We evaluated the performance of our models on a publicly available dataset of laboratory experiment time-series measurements of the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, Earths most abundant photosynthetic organisms, demonstrated the performance improvements of our approach over current models, and isolated previously ignored respiratory and exudative carbon losses as critical parameters for the modeling of microbial population dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen where the emergence of antibiotic resistant lineages, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is a major health concern. While some MRSA lineages are restricted to the healthcare setting, the epidemiology of MRSA is changing globally, with the rise of specific lineages causing disease in healthy people in the community. In the past two decades, community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged as a clinically important and virulent pathogen associated with serious skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI). These infections are primarily toxin driven, leading to the suggestion that hyper-virulent lineages/multi-locus sequence types (STs) exist. To examine this, we compared the toxic activity of 475 MRSA isolates representing five major MRSA STs (ST22, ST93, ST8, ST239 and ST36) by employing a monocyte-macrophage THP-1 cell line as a surrogate for measuring gross cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that while certain MRSA STs contain highly toxic isolates, there is such variability within lineages to suggest that this aspect of virulence should not be inferred from the genotype of any given isolate. Furthermore, by interrogating the accessory gene regulator (Agr) sequences in this collection we identified several Agr mutations that were associated with reduced toxicity. Interestingly, the majority of isolates that were attenuated in toxin production contained no mutations in the agr locus, indicating a role of other undefined genes in S. aureus toxin regulation.",

Although environmental DNA is rapidly becoming the tool of choice to assess biodiversity 1-3 there are few eDNA sample types that effectively capture terrestrial vertebrate diversity and those that do can be laborious to collect, require special permits and contain PCR inhibitory substances, which can lead to detection failure. Thus there is an urgent need for novel environmental DNA approaches for efficient and cost-effective large-scale routine monitoring of terrestrial vertebrate diversity. Here we show that DNA metabarcoding of airborne environmental DNA filtered from air can be used to detect a wide range of local vertebrate taxa. We filtered air at three localities in Copenhagen Zoo, detecting mammal, bird, amphibian and reptile species present in the zoo or its immediate surroundings. Our study demonstrates that airDNA has the capacity to complement and extend existing terrestrial vertebrate monitoring methods and could form the cornerstone of programs to assess and monitor terrestrial communities, for example in future global next generation biomonitoring frameworks 4,5.",

Aggregate seeds released from affected cells are internalized by naive cells and induce the prion-like templating of soluble Tau into neurotoxic aggregates. Here we show in a cellular model system and in neurons that Clusterin, an abundant extracellular chaperone, strongly enhances Tau aggregate seeding. Upon interaction with Tau aggregates, Clusterin stabilizes highly potent, soluble seed species. Tau/Clusterin complexes enter recipient cells via endocytosis and compromise the endolysosomal compartment, allowing transfer to the cytosol where they propagate aggregation of endogenous Tau. Thus, upregulation of Clusterin, as observed in AD patients, may enhance Tau seeding and possibly accelerate the spreading of Tau pathology.",

    "abstract": "Fatty-acid (FA) signaling contributes to {beta}-cell mass expansion in the face of nutrient excess, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that sphingolipids, generated by the intracellular metabolism of FA, are implicated in the {beta}-cell proliferative response to FA. Isolated rat islets were exposed to individual FA in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose for 48 h and the contribution of the de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway was tested using the serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor myriocin, the sphingosine kinase (SphK) inhibitor SKI II, or adenovirus-mediated knockdown of SphK, fatty-acid-elongase-1 (ELOVL1) and acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP). Wistar rat were infused with glucose and the lipid emulsion ClinOleic and received SKI II by gavage. B-cell proliferation was assessed by immunochemistry or flow cytometry. Sphingolipidomic analyses were performed by LC-MS/MS. Amongst the various FA tested, only oleate increased {beta}-cell proliferation. Myriocin, SKI II, and SphK knockdown all decreased oleate-induced {beta}-cell proliferation. Oleate exposure did not increase the total amount of sphingolipids but led to a specific rise in 24:1 species. Knockdown of ACBP or ELOVL1 inhibited oleate-induced {beta}-cell proliferation. We conclude that unsaturated very long-chain sphingolipids produced from the available pool of C24:1 acyl-CoA mediate oleate-induced {beta}-cell proliferation in rats.",

    "abstract": "Assessing where wildlife populations are at risk from future habitat loss is particularly important for land-use planning and avoiding biodiversity declines. Combining projections of future deforestation with species density information provides an improved way to anticipate such declines. Using the endemic and critically endangered Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) as a case study we applied a spatio-temporally explicit deforestation model to forest loss data from 2001-2017 and projected future impacts on orangutans to the 2030s. Our projections point to continued deforestation across the island, amounting to a loss of forest habitat for 26,200 (CI: 19,500-34,000) orangutans. Populations currently persisting in forests gazetted for industrial timber and oil palm concessions, or unprotected forests outside of concessions, were projected to experience the worst losses within the next 15 years, amounting to 15,400 (CI: 12,000-20,500) individuals. Lowland forests with high orangutan densities in West and Central Kalimantan were also projected to be at high risk from deforestation, irrespective of land-use. In contrast, most protected areas and logging concessions currently harboring orangutans will continue to face low levels of deforestation. Our business-as-usual projections indicate the importance of protected areas, efforts to prevent the conversion of logged forests for the survival of highly vulnerable wildlife, and protecting orangutan habitat in plantation landscapes. The modeling framework could be expanded to other species with available density or occurrence data. Our findings highlight that species conservation should not only attempt to act on the current situation, but also be adapt to changes in drivers to be effective.",

Most existing TWAS tools require cumbersome preparation of genotype input files and extra coding to enable parallel computation. To improve the efficiency of TWAS tools, we develop TIGAR-V2, which directly reads VCF files, enables parallel computation, and reduces up to 90% computation cost (mainly due to loading genotype data) compared to the original version. TIGAR-V2 can train gene expression imputation models using either nonparametric Bayesian Dirichlet Process Regression (DPR) or Elastic-Net (as used by PrediXcan), perform TWAS using either individual-level or summary-level GWAS data, and implements both burden and variance-component statistics for gene-based association tests. We trained gene expression prediction models by DPR for 49 tissues using GTEx V8 by TIGAR-V2 and illustrated the usefulness of these Bayesian cis-eQTL weights through TWAS of breast and ovarian cancer utilizing public GWAS summary statistics. We identified 88 and 37 risk genes respectively for breast and ovarian cancer, most of which are either known or near previously identified GWAS (~95%) or TWAS (~40%) risk genes and three novel independent TWAS risk genes with known functions in carcinogenesis. These findings suggest that TWAS can provide biological insight into the transcriptional regulation of complex diseases. TIGAR-V2 tool, trained Bayesian cis-eQTL weights, and LD information from GTEx V8 are publicly available, providing a useful resource for mapping risk genes of complex diseases.",

We found more selective editing and RNA hyper-editing in neurons relative to oligodendrocytes. The pattern of RNA editing was highly cell type-specific, with 189,229 cell type-associated sites. The cellular specificity for thousands of sites was confirmed by single nucleus RNA-sequencing.

Here, we use the thioredoxin from Candidatus Photodesmus katoptron, an uncultured symbiont of flashlight fish, to explore evolutionary and engineering aspects of protein folding in heterologous hosts. The symbiont protein is a standard thioredoxin in terms of 3D-structure, stability and redox activity. However, its refolding in vitro is very slow and its expression in E. coli leads to insoluble protein. By contrast, resurrected Precambrian thioredoxins express efficiently in E. coli, plausibly reflecting an ancient adaptation to unassisted folding. We have used a statistical-mechanical model of the folding landscape to guide back-to-ancestor engineering of the symbiont protein. Remarkably, we find that the efficiency of heterologous expression correlates with the in vitro refolding rate and that the ancestral expression efficiency can be achieved with only 1-2 back-to-ancestor replacements. These results demonstrate a sequence-engineering approach to rescue inefficient heterologous expression, a major biotechnological bottleneck.",

    "abstract": "The fusion gene MLL-AF4 defines a high-risk subtype of pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, relapse can be associated with a switch from acute lymphoblastic to acute myeloid leukaemia. Here we show that these myeloid relapses share oncogene fusion breakpoints with their matched lymphoid presentations and can originate in either early, multipotent progenitors or committed B-cell precursors. Lineage switching is linked to substantial changes in chromatin accessibility and rewiring of transcriptional programmes indicating that the execution and maintenance of lymphoid lineage differentiation is impaired. We show that this subversion is recurrently associated with the dysregulation of repressive chromatin modifiers, notably the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylation complex, NuRD. In addition to mutations, we show differential expression or alternative splicing of NuRD members and other genes is able to reprogram the B lymphoid into a myeloid gene regulatory network. Lineage switching in MLL-AF4 leukaemia is therefore driven and maintained by defunct epigenetic regulation.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWe demonstrate diverse cellular origins of lineage switched relapse within MLL-AF4 pro-B acute leukaemia. Irrespective of the developmental origin of relapse, dysregulation of NuRD and/or other epigenetic machinery underpins fundamental lineage reprogramming with profound implications for the increasing use of epitope directed therapies in this high-risk leukaemia.",

    "abstract": "The treatment approach to advanced, ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) utilizing sequential ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represents a paradigm of precision oncology. Lorlatinib is currently the most advanced, potent and selective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the clinic. However, tumors invariably acquire resistance to lorlatinib, and after sequential ALK TKIs culminating with lorlatinib, diverse refractory compound ALK mutations can emerge. Here, we determine the spectrum of lorlatinib-resistant compound ALK mutations identified in patients after treatment with lorlatinib, the majority of which involve ALK G1202R or I1171N/S/T. By assessing a panel of lorlatinib analogs against compound ALK mutant in vitro and in vivo models, we identify structurally diverse lorlatinib analogs that harbor differential selective profiles against G1202R- versus I1171N/S/T-based compound ALK mutations. Structural analysis revealed that increased potency against compound mutations was achieved primarily through two different mechanisms of improved targeting of either G1202R- or I1171N/S/T-mutant kinases. Based on these results, we propose a classification of heterogenous ALK compound mutations designed to focus the development of distinct therapeutic strategies for precision targeting of compound resistance mutations following sequential TKIs.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of humoral B cell-mediated immunity to effectively respond to and protect against pathogenic infections is largely driven by the presence of a diverse repertoire of polyclonal antibodies in the serum, which are produced by plasma cells (PCs).1,2 Recent studies have started to reveal the balance between deterministic mechanisms and stochasticity of antibody repertoires on a genotypic level (i.e., clonal diversity, somatic hypermutation, germline gene usage).3-8 However, it remains unclear if clonal selection and expansion of PCs follows any deterministic rules or is stochastic with regards to phenotypic antibody properties (i.e., antigen-binding, affinity, epitope specificity). Here we report on the in-depth genotypic and phenotypic characterization of clonally expanded PC antibody repertoires following protein immunization. We find that there is only a strong correlation with antigen-specificity among the most expanded clones (top ~ 10), whereas among the rest of the clonal repertoire antigen-specificity is stochastic. Furthermore, we report both on a polyclonal repertoire and clonal lineage level that antibody-antigen binding affinity does not correlate with clonal expansion or somatic hypermutation. Lastly, we provide evidence for convergence towards dominant epitopes despite clonal sequence diversity among the most expanded clones. Our results highlight the extent to which clonal expansion can be ascribed to antigen binding, affinity and epitope specificity and they have implications for the assessment of effective vaccines.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/452687v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e907c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fc45b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@44bd91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f98f3e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has increased at an alarming pace in the recent years. Molecular-based methods such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) offer a potential alternative to the conventional labour-intensive methods traditionally used to characterise AMR phenotypes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether WGS could be used as a predictor of AMR in Escherichia coli isolates of bovine origin.\n\nGenomes of 143 E. coli cultured from cattle presenting with diarrhoea or mastitis were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. AMR genes were identified using the ResFinder and AMRFinder databases. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion was performed on a panel of 10 antibiotics, covering 7 antimicrobial classes. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements were made using the Sensititre plate with 6 antibiotics, covering 5 antimicrobial classes. Correlation between genotype and phenotype was assessed statistically by means of a two-by-two table analysis and Cohens kappa ({kappa}) test.\n\nThe overall {kappa} correlation between WGS and disk diffusion was 0.81, indicating a near perfect agreement, and the average positive predicted value was 77.4 %. Correlation for individual antimicrobial compounds varied, with five yielding near perfect agreement ({kappa} = 0.81-1.00; amoxicillin, florfenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), one showing substantial agreement ({kappa} = 0.65; nalidixic acid), and four showing moderate agreement ({kappa} = 0.41- 0.60). The overall {kappa} correlation between WGS and MIC was 0.55 indicating moderate agreement, and the average positive predicted value was 68.6 %. Three antibiotics yielded near perfect agreement (gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and a further three showed fair agreement ({kappa} = 0.21-0.40).\n\nWGS is a useful tool that can be used for the prediction of AMR phenotypes, and correlates well with disk diffusion results. MIC measurements may be necessary for antimicrobial compounds with a high proportion of intermediately resistant isolates recorded, such as cephalothin.\n\nHighlightsO_LICulture based antimicrobial susceptibility testing is used to identify therapeutics in the treatment of clinical veterinary isolates\nC_LIO_LIWhole genome sequencing is increasingly adopted for surveillance, epidemiological traceback investigations, and detection of antimicrobial resistance genes\nC_LIO_LILittle is known in correlations between antimicrobial resistance genotypes and disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing\nC_LIO_LIThis study finds that whole genome sequencing is a useful predictor for antimicrobial susceptibility however, minimum inhibitory concentration measurements may still be needed for intermediately resistant isolates\nC_LI",

Here, we introduce new sampling methods for Direct PCR in Arabidopsis and rice and compare them to previously published methods. CutTip, stabbing a pipette tip into a plant and depositing the tip of the pipette tip into the reaction buffer, yielded high accuracy for genotyping Arabidopsis and rice. This did not require visible tissue fragments in the reactions. We found that using short thin segments of fishing line, called Line-PCR, to be even more practical and highly accurate. Compared to traditional and other Direct PCR preparation methods, Line-PCR is faster, inexpensive, easier, uses less plastic and chemicals, and causes the least tissue damage. CutTip and Line-PCR require no modified PCR reagents. Line-PCR particularly lacks any complicated steps. Probably, the most difficult step in Line-PCR is a wipe of the tweezer between samples. These methods can help address the challenge of genotyping at different scales with high accuracy. CutTip and Line-PCR also simplify the application of PCR in the field.",

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) shows elevated actin assembly dependence under high membrane tension. Why actin assembly at CME sites occurs heterogeneously even within the same cell, and how assembly forces are harnessed, are not fully understood. Here, endocytic dynamics, actin presence, and geometry of CME proteins from three different functional modules, were analyzed using three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, and machine-learning-based computation. When hundreds of CME events were compared, sites with actin assembly showed a distinct signature, a delay between completion of coat expansion and vesicle scission, indicating that actin assembly occurs preferentially at stalled CME sites. N-WASP is recruited to one side of CME sites where it is positioned to stimulate asymmetric actin assembly. We propose that asymmetric actin assembly rescues stalled CME sites by pulling vesicles into the cell much like a bottle opener pulls off a bottle cap.",

    "abstract": "Autophagosomes are double-membrane intracellular vesicles that degrade protein aggregates, intracellular organelles, and other cellular components. During the development of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, many somatic and germ cells undergo apoptosis. These cells are engulfed and degraded by their neighboring cells. We discovered a novel role of autophagosomes in facilitating the degradation of apoptotic cells using a real-time imaging technique. Specifically, the double-membrane autophagosomes in engulfing cells are recruited to the surfaces of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells and subsequently fuse to phagosomes, allowing the inner vesicle to enter the phagosomal lumen. Mutants defective in the production of autophagosomes display significant defects in the degradation of apoptotic cells, demonstrating the importance of autophagosomes to this process. The signaling pathway led by the phagocytic receptor CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and the large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1) promotes the recruitment of autophagosomes to phagosomes. Moreover, the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes with phagosomes requires the functions of the small GTPase RAB-7 and the HOPS complex components. Further observations suggest that autophagosomes provide apoptotic cell-degradation activities in addition to and in parallel of lysosomes. Our findings reveal that, unlike the single-membrane, LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) vesicles reported for mammalian phagocytes, the canonical double-membrane autophagosomes facilitate the clearance of C. elegans apoptotic cells. These findings add autophagosomes to the collection of intracellular organelles that contribute to phagosome maturation, identify novel crosstalk between the autophagy and phagosome maturation pathways, and discover the upstream signaling molecules that initiate this crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Diploid and stable karyotypes are associated with health and fitness in animals. In contrast, whole genome duplications (WGDs) - doubling full chromosome content - are linked to genetic instability (GIN) and frequently found in human cancers 1-3. It has been established that WGDs fuel chromosome instability through abnormal mitosis 4-8, however, the immediate consequences of tetraploidy in the first interphase are not known. This is an essential question because single WGD events such as cytokinesis failure can promote tumorigenesis 9. Here, we found that newly born tetraploid human cells undergo high rates of DNA damage during DNA replication in the first S-phase. Using DNA combing and single cell sequencing, we show that DNA replication dynamics is perturbed, generating under- and over-replicated regions. Mechanistically, we found that these defects result from the lack of protein mass scaling up at the G1/S transition, which impairs the fidelity of DNA replication. This work shows that within a single interphase, unscheduled tetraploid cells can acquire highly abnormal karyotypes. These findings provide an explanation for the GIN landscape that favors tumorigenesis after tetraploidization.",

    "abstract": "Most traits in livestock, crops and humans are polygenic, that is, a large number of loci contribute to genetic variation. Effects at these loci lie along a continuum ranging from common low-effect to rare high-effect variants that cumulatively contribute to the overall phenotype. Statistical methods to calculate the effect of these loci have been developed and can be used to predict phenotypes in new individuals. In agriculture, these methods are used to select superior individuals using genomic breeding values; in humans these methods are used to quantitatively measure an individuals disease risk, termed polygenic risk scores. Both fields typically use SNP array genotypes for the analysis. Recently, genotyping-by-sequencing has become popular, due to lower cost and greater genome coverage (including structural variants). Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) portable sequencers have the potential to combine the benefits genotyping-by-sequencing with portability and decreased turn-around time. This introduces the potential for in-house clinical genetic disease risk screening in humans or calculating genomic breeding values on-farm in agriculture. Here we demonstrate the potential of the later by calculating genomic breeding values for four traits in cattle using low-coverage ONT sequence data and comparing these breeding values to breeding values calculated from SNP arrays. At sequencing coverages between 2X and 4X the correlation between ONT breeding values and SNP array-based breeding values was > 0.92 when imputation was used and > 0.88 when no imputation was used. With an average sequencing coverage of 0.5x the correlation between the two methods was between 0.85 and 0.92 using imputation, depending on the trait. This demonstrates that ONT sequencing has great potential for in clinic or on-farm genomic prediction.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenomic prediction is a method that uses a large number of genetic markers to predict complex phenotypes in livestock, crops and humans. Currently the techniques we use to determine genotypes requires complex equipment which can only be used in laboratories. However, Oxford Nanopore Technologies have released a portable DNA sequencer, which can genotype a range of organisms in the field. As a result of the devices higher error rate, it has largely only been considered for specific applications, such as characterising large mutations. Here we demonstrated that despite the devices error rate, accurate genomic prediction is also possible using this portable device. The ability to accurately predict complex phenotypes such as the predisposition to schizophrenia in humans or lifetime fertility in livestock in-situ would decrease the turnaround time and ultimately increase the utility of this method in the human clinical and on-farm settings.",

Methods were built using data from 14 participants from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), and applied to 1, 250 MACS participants.

Here we show that ectopic expression of Drosophila let-A is also exerting an oncolytic toxicity in several human cancer cell lines, but shows almost no effect in more differentiated or cell lines derived from normal tissue. We demonstrate that let-A RNA prepared by in vitro transcription and provided in the growth medium is sufficient to induce cell death both in human and Drosophila cancer cells. The activity of in vitro transcribed let-A is most efficient in its full length, but requires prior modification/processing to become active. let-A induces a reduction of nucleolar size in treated cells. We show exo/endocytosis and Toll signaling pathway to be necessary for let-A-induced toxicity.

Tau has been observed within the nuclei of neurons, but there is a gap in understanding regarding the mechanism by which tau modulates transcription. We are interested in the P301L mutation of tau, which has been associated with FTD and increased tau aggregation. Our study utilized tau-inducible HEK (iHEK) cells to reveal that WT and P301L tau distinctively alter the transcription and alternative polyadenylation (APA) profiles of numerous nuclear precursors mRNAs, which then translate to form proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and splicing. We isolated total mRNA before and after over-expressing tau and then performed Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-Seq) to characterize mRNA expression and APA profiles. We characterized changes in Gene Ontology (GO) pathways using EnrichR and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We observed that P301L tau up-regulates genes associated with reactive oxygen species responsiveness as well as genes involved in dendrite, microtubule, and nuclear body/speckle formation. The number of genes regulated by WT tau is greater than the mutant form, which indicates that the P301L mutation causes loss-of-function at the transcriptional level. WT tau up-regulates genes contributing to cytoskeleton-dependent intracellular transport, microglial activation, microtubule and nuclear chromatin organization, formation of nuclear bodies and speckles. Interestingly, both WT and P301L tau commonly down-regulate genes responsible for ubiquitin-proteosome system. In addition, WT tau significantly down-regulates several genes implicated in chromatin remodeling and nucleosome organization. Although there are limitations inherent to the model systems used, this study will improve understanding regarding the nuclear impact of tau at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. This study also illustrates the potential impact of P301L tau on the human brain genome during early phases of pathogenesis.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile tau biology has been extensively studied and closely linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, our current understanding of taus functions in the nucleus is limited. Given the role of tau in disease progression and pathogenesis, elucidating the function of tau activity in transcription and its nuclear accumulation may reveal novel therapeutic targets; therefore, helping identify new upstream pathways that have yet to be investigated. In this study, we used tau-inducible cell lines to uncover new molecular mechanisms by which tau functions in the nucleus. This study systematically investigates the changes in transcriptomic and alternative polyadenylation profiles modulated by WT and mutant P301L tau protein. In this manuscript, we report following new findings (i) tau modulates gene expression of transcripts associated with chromatin remodeling and splicing complexes; (ii) WT and mutant P301L tau regulate, differentially, transcription and alternative polyadenylation (APA) profiles; and (iii) P301L mutation affects the transcription mediated by tau protein. The potential role of tau in mediating transcription and alternative polyadenylation processes is not well studied, representing a novelty in the field. Therefore, this research establishes a new direction for investigating tau nuclear function in both human and mouse brains.",

    "abstract": "Superspreader hosts carry out most pathogen transmission events and are often disease tolerant since they remain asymptomatic despite high pathogen burdens. Here we describe the superspreader immune state that allows for disease tolerance. In a model of Salmonella infection, superspreader mice develop colitis with robust CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, however, they remain asymptomatic. We found that superspreaders have significantly more regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the distal gut compared to non-superspreader infected hosts. Surprisingly, the depletion of Tregs did not induce pathogen clearance but rather exacerbated weight loss, increased gut inflammation, and compromised epithelial intestinal barrier. This loss of tolerance correlated with dramatic increases in cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, CD4 neutralization in Tregs-depleted superspreaders was sufficient to rescue tolerance. Our results indicate that Tregs play a crucial role in maintaining immunologic tolerance in the guts of superspreader mice by suppressing cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activities.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSuperspreader hosts are the main cause of disease transmission and a very important public health concern. Here, we evaluated the immunological tolerance of the Salmonella infected superspreaders in a mouse model. By manipulating Tregs, we demonstrated the immunological mechanism from the host to maintain health status and high pathogen burden. Tregs depletion in the superspreaders led to severe disease, with damage of the intestinal epithelia, and high morbidity without having any effect on shedding and systemic Salmonella burden. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the damage of the intestinal epithelia was related to cytotoxic activity of T cells. When Tregs were depleted, CD8+ T cells produced high levels of granzyme B and perforin. CD8+ T cells neutralization in Tregs depleted mice led to increased cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, neutralization of CD4+ T cells in the Tregs depleted mice led to a reduction in the CD8+ T cells producing granzyme B and it was sufficient to rescue host tolerance in this model. We demonstrate for the first time that cytotoxic CD4+ T cells damage the epithelial intestinal barrier and contribute to loss of tolerance in the context of a superspreader host. These findings open new perspectives to understand mechanisms of tolerance in the intestine of a superspreader host.",
