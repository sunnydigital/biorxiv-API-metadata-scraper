    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a genus of protists that cause life-threatening and economically important diseases of human and animal populations in Sub-Saharan Africa. T. brucei cells are covered in surface glycoproteins some of which are used to escape the host immune system. Exo-/endocytotic trafficking of these and other molecules occurs via a single copy organelle called the flagellar pocket (FP). The FP is maintained and enclosed around the flagellum by the flagellar pocket collar (FPC). To date, the most important cytoskeletal component of the FPC is an essential, calcium-binding, polymer-forming protein called TbBILBO1. In searching for novel immune-tools to study this protein, we raised nanobodies against TbBILBO1. Nanobodies (Nb) that were selected according to their binding properties to TbBILBO1, were tested as immunofluorescence tools, and expressed as intrabodies (INb). One of them, Nb48, proved to be the most robust nanobody and intrabody. We further demonstrate that inducible, cytoplasmic expression of INb48 was lethal to these parasites, producing abnormal phenotypes resembling those of TbBILBO1 RNAi knockdown. Our results validate the feasibility of generating functional single-domain antibody derived intrabodies to target trypanosome cytoskeleton proteins.",

    "abstract": "Intramembrane proteolysis regulates important processes such as signaling and transcriptional and posttranslational abundance control of proteins with key functions in metabolic pathways. This includes transcriptional control of mevalonate pathway genes, thereby ensuring balanced biosynthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoids. Our work shows that, at high cholesterol levels, signal peptide peptidase (SPP) cleaves squalene synthase (SQS), an enzyme that defines the branching point for allocation of isoprenoids to the sterol and non-sterol arms of the mevalonate pathway. This intramembrane cleavage releases SQS from the membrane and targets it for proteasomal degradation. Regulation of this mechanism is achieved by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRC8 that, in addition to ubiquitinating SQS in response to cholesterol levels, acts as an allosteric activator of SPP-catalyzed intramembrane cleavage of SQS. Cellular cholesterol levels increase in the absence of SPP activity. Hence, SPP-TRC8 mediated abundance control of SQS acts as a regulation step within the mevalonate pathway.",

    "abstract": "A  histone code defines system-level crosstalk between histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) to induce specific biological outcomes. Proteome-scale information of co-existing PTM across the entire chromatin landscape of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, was lacking. Here, we used advanced quantitative middle-down proteomics to identify combinations of PTMs in both the proliferative, asexual stages and transmissible, sexual gametocyte stages of P. falciparum. We provide an updated, high-resolution compendium of 72 PTMs on H3 and H3.3, of which 30 are novel to the parasite. Co-existing PTMs with unique stage distinction was identified, indicating a dynamic and complex histone code with increased connectivity of novel PTMs seen in gametocytes. Chromatin proteomics of a gametocyte-specific combination, H3R17me2K18acK23ac, identified a SAGA-like effector complex (including the transcription factor AP2-G2) tied to this combination to regulate gene expression in mature gametocytes. Ultimately, this study unveils previously undiscovered histone PTMs and their functional relationship with co-existing partners. These results highlight that investigating chromatin regulation in the parasite using single histone PTM assays might overlook higher order gene regulation for distinct proliferation and differentiation processes.",

    "abstract": "Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is an herbaceous annual crop of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). It is increasingly cultivated for its nutritious grains, which are rich in protein and essential amino acids, lipids, and minerals. Quinoa exhibits a high tolerance towards various abiotic stresses including drought and salinity, which supports its agricultural cultivation under climate change conditions. The use of quinoa grains is compromised by anti-nutritional saponins, a terpenoid class of secondary metabolites deposited in the seed coat; their removal before consumption requires extensive washing, an economically and environmentally unfavorable process; or their accumulation can be reduced through breeding. In this study, we analyzed the seed metabolomes, including amino acids, fatty acids, and saponins, from 471 quinoa cultivars, including two related species, by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. Additionally, we determined a large number of agronomic traits including biomass, flowering time, and seed yield. The results revealed considerable diversity between genotypes and provide a knowledge base for future breeding or genome editing of quinoa.\n\n\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@160e784org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff8bd1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13446daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11796eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b607b8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in physiology and disease in mammals result from the effects of three classes of factors that are inherently unequal in males and females: reversible (activational) effects of gonadal hormones, permanent (organizational) effects of gonadal hormones, and cell-autonomous effects of sex chromosomes, as well as genes driven by these classes of factors. Often, these factors act together to cause sex differences in specific phenotypes, but the relative contribution of each and the interactions among them remain unclear. Here, we used the Four Core Genotypes (FCG) mouse model with or without hormone replacement to distinguish the effects of each class of sex-biasing factors on transcriptome regulation in liver and adipose tissues. We found that the activational hormone levels have the strongest influence on gene expression, followed by the organizational gonadal sex effect and, lastly, sex chromosomal effect, along with interactions among the three factors. Tissue specificity was prominent, with a major impact of estradiol on adipose tissue gene regulation, and of testosterone on the liver transcriptome. The networks affected by the three sex-biasing factors include development, immunity and metabolism, and tissue-specific regulators were identified for these networks. Furthermore, the genes affected by individual sex-biasing factors and interactions among factors are associated with human disease traits such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. Our study offers a tissue-specific account of the individual and interactive contributions of major sex-biasing factors to gene regulation that have broad impact on systemic metabolic, endocrine, and immune functions.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are vulnerable to physical insults which compromise the integrity of both dendrites and axons. Although several molecular pathways of axon regeneration are identified, our knowledge of dendrite regeneration is limited. To understand the mechanisms of dendrite regeneration, we used PVD neurons in C. elegans having stereotyped branched dendrites. Using femtosecond laser, we severed the primary dendrites and axon of this neuron. After severing the primary dendrites near the cell body, we observed sprouting of new branches from the proximal site within 6 hours, which regrew further with timein an unstereotyped manner.This was accompanied by reconnection between the proximal and distal dendrites as well as the fusion among the higher-order branches as reported before. We quantified the regeneration pattern in threeaspects -territory length, number of branchesand fusion phenomena.Axonal injury causes a retraction of the severed end followed by a Dual leucine zipper kinase-1 (DLK-1) dependent regrowth from the severed end.We tested the roles of the major axon regenerationsignaling hubs such as DLK-1-RPM-1, cAMP elevation, let-7 miRNA, AKT-1, Phosphatidyl serine exposure/PS in dendrite regeneration. We found that neither regrowth nor fusionis affected by the axon injury pathway molecules. Surprisingly, we found that the RAC GTPase CED-10and its upstream GEF TIAM-1 play a cell-autonomous role in dendrite regeneration. Additionally, function of CED-10 in epidermal cell is critical for post-dendrotomy fusion phenomena. This work describes a novel regulatory mechanism of dendrite regeneration andprovides a framework for understanding the cellular mechanism of dendrite regeneration using PVD neuron as a model system.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHumans can quickly adjust their grip force to a change in friction at the object-skin interface during dexterous manipulation in a precision grip. To perform this adjustment, they rely on the feedback of the mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the fingertip skin. Because these tactile afferents encode information related to skin deformation, the nature of the feedback signaling a change in friction must somehow originate from a difference in the way the skin deforms when manipulating objects of different frictions. To better characterize the origin of the underlying sensory events, we asked human participants to perform a grip-lifting task with a manipulandum equipped with an optical imaging system. This system enabled to monitor fingertip skin strains through transparent plates of glass that had different levels of friction. We observed that, following an unexpected change in friction, participants adapted their grip force within 370ms after contact with the surface. By comparing the deformation patterns when unexpectedly switching from a high to a low friction condition, we found a significant increase in skin deformation inside the contact area arising over 100ms before the motor response, during the loading phase, suggesting that local and partial deformation patterns prior to lift-off are used in the nervous system to adjust the grip force as a function of the frictional condition.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide an artificial link by which the brain can directly interact with the environment. To achieve fine BCI control, participants must modulate the patterns of the cortical oscillations generated from the motor and somatosensory cortices. However, it remains unclear how humans regulate cortical oscillations, the controllability of which substantially varies across individuals. Here, we performed simultaneous electroencephalography (to assess BCI control) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (to measure brain activity) in healthy participants. Self-regulation of cortical oscillations induced activity in the basal ganglia-cortical network (BgCN) and the neurofeedback control network (NfCN). Successful self-regulation correlated with striatal activity in the BgCN, through which patterns of cortical oscillations were likely modulated. Moreover, BgCN and NfCN connectivity correlated with strong and weak self-regulation, respectively. The findings indicate that the BgCN is important for self-regulation, the understanding of which should help advance BCI technology.",

    "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) strains, including the foodborne pathogen E. coli O157:H7, are responsible for thousands of hospitalizations each year. Various environmental triggers can modulate pathogenicity in EHEC by inducing expression of Shiga toxin (Stx), which is encoded on a lambdoid prophage and transcribed together with phage late genes. Cell-free supernatants of the sequence type (ST) 73 E. coli strain 0.1229 are potent inducers of Stx2a production in EHEC, suggesting that 0.1229 secretes a factor that activates the SOS response and leads to phage lysis. We previously demonstrated that this factor, designated microcin (Mcc) 1229, was proteinaceous and plasmid-encoded. To further characterize Mcc1229 and support its classification as a microcin, we investigated its regulation, determined its receptor, and identified loci providing immunity. Production of Mcc1229 was increased upon iron limitation, as determined by ELISA, lacZ fusions, and qRT-PCR. Spontaneous Mcc1229-resistant mutants and targeted gene deletion revealed that CirA was the Mcc1229 receptor. TonB, which interacts with CirA in the periplasm, was also essential for Mcc1229 import. Subcloning of the Mcc1229 plasmid indicated that Mcc activity was neutralized by two ORFs, each predicted to encode a domain of unknown function (DUF)-containing protein. In a germfree mouse model of infection, colonization with 0.1229 suppressed subsequent colonization of EHEC. Although Mcc1229 was produced in vivo, it was dispensable for colonization suppression. The regulation, import, and immunity determinants identified here are consistent with features of other Mccs, suggesting that Mcc1229 be included in this class of small molecules.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing need for long-term monitoring of ecosystems and their services to inform on-ground management and policy direction. The supply of many ecosystem services relies on connections that span multiple ecosystems. Monitoring the underlying condition of interconnected ecosystems, using established indicators, is therefore required to track effectiveness of past interventions and, ideally, identify impending change. Here we conduct performance testing of ecological indicators for a catchment-to-coast system with the aim of identifying the time-scales over which they respond to change. We chose a case-study of a coastal fishery in Northern Australia that exhibits strong catchment-to-coast connectivity, has long-term available data and is under threat from water resource development. We developed a novel approach to performance testing. Our model drew on state-space modelling to capture ecological dynamics, and structural equation modelling to capture covariation in indictors timeseries. We first quantified covariation among three established ecological indicators: pasture biomass, vegetation greenness and barramundi catch per unit effort. Covariation in the indicators was driven by river flow, with higher values of all indicators occurring in years with greater river flow. We then defined reference bounds for each indicator that accounted for natural variation in river flow. We predicted the emergence times for each indicator, as the time taken for each indicator to emerge from the background of natural variation. Emergence times quantified at 80% and higher confidence levels were >10 years in all cases. Past trends and current status of ecosystem service flows are often used by decision makers to directly inform near-term actions, particularly provisioning services (such as barramundi catch) due to their important contribution to regional economies. We found that the ecological indicators should be used to assess historical performance over decadal timespans, but not as short-term indicators of recent change. More generally, we offer an approach to performance testing of indicators. This approach could be useful for quantifying time-scales of ecosystem response in other systems where cross-ecosystem connections are important.",

These microbes are commercially important for several industries due to their intrinsic genomic attributes such as bacteriocins, carbohydrate-active enzymes, plasmids etc. Even though the species of Leuconostoc are commercially significant, their taxonomy is largely based on old, low resolution traditional methods. There have been several taxonomic reclassifications in the past which are inadequate for microbiologist and food industry professionals to truly demarcate any new strain of genus Leuconostoc. The current taxonomy of the genus is largely based on classical approaches, which are in utmost need of reinvestigation by whole genome-based approaches. In the present study, the taxono-phylogenomic analysis clearly depicted sixteen species including three novel genomospecies in addition to several reshufflings across the species namely, L. mesenteroides, L. pseudomesenteroides, L. gelidum and L. lactis. The presence of a wide range of carbohydrate-active enzymes, type III polyketide synthase and vector plasmids suggested the biotechnological potential of constituent strains of the genera. Further, the absence of antibiotic gene clusters reaffirms their utility in industries such as food and dairy. Such large-scale in-depth genome-based study can shed light on the nature of the genome dynamics of the species and help to obtain a more robust taxonomic classification.",

    "abstract": "Maples (the genus Acer) represent important and beloved forest, urban, and ornamental trees distributed throughout the Northern hemisphere. They exist in a diverse array of native ranges and distributions, across spectrums of tolerance or decline, and have varying levels of susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stress. Among Acer species, several stand out in their importance to economic interest. Here we report the first two chromosome-scale genomes for North American species, Acer negundo and Acer saccharum. Both assembled genomes contain scaffolds corresponding to 13 chromosomes, with A. negundo at a length of 442 Mb, N50 of 32 Mb and 30,491 genes, and A. saccharum at 626 Mb, N50 of 46 Mb, and 40,074 genes. No recent whole genome duplications were detected, though A. saccharum has local gene duplication and more recent bursts of transposable elements, as well as a large-scale translocation between two chromosomes. Genomic comparison revealed that A. negundo has a smaller genome with recent gene family evolution that is predominantly contracted and expansions that are potentially related to invasive tendencies and tolerance to abiotic stress. Examination of expression from RNA-Seq obtained from A. saccharum grown in long-term aluminum and calcium soil treatments at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, provided insights into genes involved in aluminum stress response at the systemic level, as well as signs of compromised processes upon calcium deficiency, a condition contributing to maple decline.\n\nSignificance statementThe first chromosome-scale assemblies for North American members of the Acer genus, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and boxelder (Acer negundo), as well as transcriptomic evaluation of abiotic stress response in A. saccharum.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWIt is a real challenge for life cycle assessment practitioners to identify all relevant substances contributing to the ecotoxicity. Once this identification has been made, the lack of corresponding ecotoxicity factors can make the results partial and difficult to interpret. So, it is a real and important challenge to provide ecotoxicity factors for a wide range of compounds. Nevertheless, obtaining such factors using experiments is tedious, time-consuming, and made at a high cost. A modeling method that could predict these factors from easy-to-obtain information on each chemical would be of great value. Here, we present such a method, based on machine learning algorithms, that used molecular descriptors to predict two specific endpoints in continental freshwater for ecotoxicological and human impacts. The different tested machine learning algorithms show good performances on a learning database and the non-linear methods tend to outperform the linear ones. The cluster-then-predict approaches usually show the best performances which suggests that these predicted models must be derived for somewhat similar compounds.

    "abstract": "AbstractWe introduce a deep learning model that predicts super-resolved versions of diffraction-limited microscopy images. Our model, named Task- Assisted Generative Adversarial Network (TA-GAN), incorporates an auxiliary task (e.g. segmentation, localization) closely related to the observed biological nanostructures characterization. We evaluate how TA-GAN improves generative accuracy over unassisted methods using images acquired with different modalities such as confocal, brightfield (diffraction-limited), super-resolved stimulated emission depletion, and structured illumination microscopy. The generated synthetic resolution enhanced images show an accurate distribution of the F-actin nanostructures, replicate the nanoscale synaptic cluster morphology, allow to identify dividing S. aureus bacterial cell boundaries, and localize nanodomains in simulated images of dendritic spines. We expand the applicability of the TA-GAN to different modalities, auxiliary tasks, and online imaging assistance. Incorporated directly into the acquisition pipeline of the microscope, the TA-GAN informs the user on the nanometric content of the field of view without requiring the acquisition of a super-resolved image. This information is used to optimize the acquisition sequence, and reduce light exposure. The TA-GAN also enables the creation of domain-adapted labeled datasets requiring minimal manual annotation, and assists microscopy users by taking online decisions regarding the choice of imaging modality and regions of interest.",

    "abstract": "The postsynaptic region is the receiving part of the synapse comprising thousands of proteins forming an elaborate and dynamically changing network indispensable for the molecular mechanisms behind fundamental phenomena such as learning and memory. Despite the growing amount of information about individual protein-protein interactions in this network, these data are mostly scattered in the literature or are stored in generic databases that are not designed to display aspects which are fundamental to understanding postsynaptic functions. To overcome these limitations we collected postsynaptic protein-protein interactions (PPIs) together with a high amount of detailed structural and biological information and launched a freely available resource, the Postsynaptic Interaction Database (PSINDB) to make these data and annotations accessible. PSINDB includes tens of thousands of binding regions together with structural features mediating and regulating the formation of PPIs, annotated with detailed experimental information about each interaction. PSINDB is expected to be useful for numerous aspects of molecular neurobiology research, from experiment design to network and systems biology-based modeling and analysis of changes in the protein network upon various stimuli.

Changes in microtubule dynamics are essential for the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, and misregulation can lead to aneuploidy and cancer. Using in vitro reconstitution assays we show that the mitotic spindle protein Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 2 (CKAP2) has a strong effect on nucleation of microtubules by lowering the critical tubulin concentration 100-fold. CKAP2 increases the apparent rate constant ka of microtubule growth by 50-fold and increases microtubule growth rates. In addition, CKAP2 strongly suppresses catastrophes. Our results identify CKAP2 as the most potent microtubule growth factor to date. These finding help explain CKAP2s role as an important spindle protein, proliferation marker, and oncogene.",

    "abstract": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful imaging technique and has been widely used in current material science research. The attempts of applying STEM into biological research have been going on for decades while applications have still been limited because of the existing bottlenecks in dose efficiency and non-linearity in contrast. Recently, integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) STEM technique emerged and achieved a linear phase contrast imaging condition, while resolving signals of light elements next to heavy ones even at low electron dose. This enables successful investigation of beam sensitive materials. Here, we investigate iDPC-STEM advantages in biology, in particular, chemically fixed and resin embedded biological tissues. By comparing results to the conventional TEM, we have found that iDPC-STEM not only shows better contrast but also resolves more structural details at molecular level, including conditions of extremely low dose and minimal heavy-atom staining. For thick sample sections, iDPC-STEM is particularly advantageous. Unlike TEM, it avoids contrast inversion canceling effects, and by adjusting the depth of focus, fully preserves the contrast of relevant features along with the sample. In addition, using depth-sectioning, iDPC-STEM enables resolving in-depth structural variation. Our work suggests that promising, wide and attractive applications of iDPC-STEM in biological research are opening.",

    "abstract": "De novo somatic point mutations identified in breast cancer are predominantly non-coding and typically attributed to altered regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters. However, while the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) form a large portion of the mammalian genome, their biological functions are mostly poorly characterized in cancers. In this study, using a newly developed tool, SomaGene, we reanalyze de novo somatic point mutations from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) whole-genome sequencing data of 1,855 breast cancers. We identify 929 candidates of ncRNAs that are significantly and explicitly mutated in breast cancer samples. By integrating data from the ENCODE regulatory features and FANTOM5 expression atlas, we show that the candidate ncRNAs in breast cancer samples significantly enrich for active chromatin histone marks (1.9 times), CTCF binding sites (2.45 times), DNase accessibility (1.76 times), HMM predicted enhancers (2.26 times) and eQTL polymorphisms (1.77 times). Importantly, we show that the 929 ncRNAs contain a much higher level (3.64 times) of breast cancer-associated genome-wide association (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than genome-wide expectation. Such enrichment has not been seen with GWAS SNPs from other diseases. Using breast tissue related Hi-C data we then show that 82% of our candidate ncRNAs (1.9 times) significantly interact with the promoter of protein-coding genes, including previously known cancer-associated genes, suggesting the critical role for candidate ncRNA genes in activation of essential regulators of development and differentiation in breast cancer. We provide an extensive web-based resource (http://ncrna.ictic.sharif.edu), to communicate our results with the research community. Our list of breast cancer-specific ncRNA genes has the potential to provide a better understanding of the underlying genetic causes of breast cancer. Lastly, the tool developed in this study can be used in the analysis of somatic mutations in all cancers.",

Compound 21 (C21) is a non-peptide AT2R agonist that produces neuroprotective effects. However, the behavioral effects of C21 and its involvement with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-TRKB system still need further investigation.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to assess the effect of C21 on the activation of TRKB and its consequences on conditioned fear. The administration of C21 (0.1-10M/15min) increased the surface levels of TRKB but was not sufficient to increase the levels of phosphorylated TRKB (pTKB) in cultured cortical neurons from rat embryos. Consistent with increased TRKB surface expression, C21 (10M/15min or 3 days) facilitated the effect of BDNF (0.1ng/ml/15min) on pTRKB in these cells. In contextual fear conditioning, the freezing time of C21-treated (administered intranasally) wild-type mice was decreased compared to the vehicle-treated group, but no effect of C21 was observed in BDNF.het animals. We observed no effect of C21 in the elevated plus-maze test for anxiety.\n\nTaken together, our results indicate that C21 facilitated BDNF effect by increasing the levels of TRKB on the cell surface and reduced the freezing time of mice in a BDNF-dependent manner, but not through a general anxiolytic-like effect.",

Developing new tools for fast and accurate estimation of chlorophyll parameters, chlorophyll a (Chl-a), chlorophyll b (Chl-b) content, and their ratio (Chl-a/b), can promote breeding programs of wheat with enhanced climate adaptively. Spectral reflectance of leaves is affected by changes in pigments concentration and can be used to estimate chlorophyll parameters. The current study identified and validated the top spectral indices known and developed new vegetation indices (VIs) for Chl-a and Chl-b content estimation and used them to non-destructively estimate Chl-a/b values and compare them to hyperspectral estimations. Three wild emmer introgression lines, with contrasting drought stress responsiveness dynamics, were selected. Well and limited irrigation irrigation regimes were applied. The wheat leaves were spectrally measured with a handheld spectrometer to acquire their reflectance at the 330 to 790 nm range. Regression models based on calculated VIs as well as all hyperspectral curves were calibrated and validated against chlorophyll extracted values. The developed VIs resulted in high accuracy of Chl-a and Chl-b estimation allowing indirect non-destructive estimation of Chl-a/b with root mean square error (RMSE) values that could fit 6 to 10 times in the range of the measured values. They also performed similarly to the hyperspectral models. Altogether, we present here a new tool for a non-destructive estimation of Chl-a/b which can serve as a basis for future breeding efforts of climate-resilience wheat as well as other crops.",

Remarkably, we find that the rearrangement events exhibit a specific landscape of rearrangement frequency. We further reveal that the landscape is shaped by combinatorial effects of chromatin accessibility and spatial contact probability. The rearrangements tend to occur in 3D spatially proximal and chromatin-accessible regions. Enormous numbers of rearrangements by SCRaMbLE provide a driving force to potentiate directed genome evolution, and investigation of the rearrangement landscape offers mechanistic insights into the dynamics of genome evolution.",

TI-2 Ags strongly induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC){delta} and PKC{delta} mediated the AID transcription through the induction of BATF, the key transcriptional regulator of AID expression. In PKC{delta}-deficient mice, production of IgG was intact against TD Ag but abrogated against typical TI-2 Ags as well as commensal bacteria, and experimental disruption of the gut epithelial barrier resulted in fatal bacteremia.

    "abstract": "To acquire phosphorus, cyanobacteria use the typical bacterial ABC-type phosphate transporter, which is composed of a periplasmic high-affinity phosphate-binding protein PstS and a channel formed by two transmembrane proteins PstC and PstA. The pstS gene has been identified in the genomes of cyanophages that infect the unicellular cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. However, it is unknown how the cyanophage PstS interplays with the host PstC and PstA to function as a chimeric ABC transporter. Here we showed that the cyanophage P-SSM2 PstS protein was abundant in the infected Prochlorococcus NATL2A cells and the host phosphate uptake rate was enhanced after infection. This is consistent with our biochemical and structural analyses showing that the phage PstS protein is indeed a high-affinity phosphate-binding protein. We further modeled the complex structure of phage PstS with host PstCA and revealed three putative interfaces that may facilitate the formation of the chimeric ABC transporter. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanism by which cyanophages enhance the phosphate uptake rate of cyanobacteria. Phosphate acquisition by infected bacteria can increase the phosphorus contents of released cellular debris and virus particles, which together constitute a significant proportion of the marine dissolved organic phosphorus pool.",

    "abstract": "The dramatic change in morphology of chromosomal DNAs between interphase and mitosis is one of the defining features of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Two types of enzymes, namely cohesin and condensin confer the topology of chromosomal DNA by extruding DNA loops. While condensin normally configures chromosomes exclusively during mitosis, cohesin does so during interphase. The processivity of cohesins LE during interphase is limited by a regulatory factor called WAPL, which induces cohesin to dissociate from chromosomes via a mechanism that requires dissociation of its kleisin from the neck of SMC3. We show here that a related mechanism may be responsible for blocking condensin II from acting during interphase. Cells from patients carrying mutations in the Mcph1 gene undergo premature chromosome condensation but it has never been established for certain whether MCPH1 regulates condensin II directly. We show that deletion of Mcph1 in mouse embryonic stem cells unleashes an activity of condensin II that triggers formation of compact chromosomes in G1 and G2 phases, which is accompanied by enhanced mixing of A and B chromatin compartments, and that this occurs even in the absence of CDK1 activity. Crucially, inhibition of condensin II by MCPH1 depends on the binding of a short linear motif within MCPH1 to condensin IIs NCAPG2 subunit. We show that the activities of both Cohesin and Condensin II may be restricted during interphase by similar types of mechanisms as MCPH1s ability to block condensin IIs association with chromatin is abrogated by the fusion of SMC2 with NCAPH2. Remarkably, in the absence of both WAPL and MCPH1, cohesin and condensin II transform chromosomal DNAs of G2 cells into chromosomes with a solenoidal axis showing that both SMC complexes must be tightly regulated to adjust both the chromatids structure and their segregation.",

    "abstract": "Vertical variations in physical and chemical conditions drive changes in marine zooplankton community diversity and composition. In turn, zooplankton communities play a critical role in regulating the transfer of organic matter produced in the surface ocean to deeper layers. Yet, the links between zooplankton community composition and the strength of vertical fluxes of particles remain elusive, especially on a global scale. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of variations in zooplankton community composition and vertical particle flux in the upper kilometer of the global ocean. Zooplankton samples were collected across five depth layers and vertical particle fluxes were assessed using continuous profiles of the Underwater Vision Profiler (UVP5) at 57 stations covering seven ocean basins. Zooplankton samples were analysed using a Zooscan and individual organisms were classified into 19 groups for the quantitative analyses. Zooplankton abundance, biomass and vertical particle flux decreased from the surface to 1000m depth at all latitudes. The zooplankton abundance decrease rate was stronger at sites characterised by oxygen minima (< 5{micro}mol O2.kg-1) where most zooplankton groups showed a marked decline in abundance, except the jellyfishes, molluscs, annelids, large protists and a few copepod families. The attenuation rate of vertical particle fluxes was weaker at such oxygen-depleted sites. Canonical redundancy analyses showed that the epipelagic zooplankton community composition depended on the community structure of surface phytoplankton and the quantity and the quality of the produced particulate organic matter. We provide a consistent baseline of plankton community structure together with estimates of vertical flux and a contribution to our understanding of global zooplankton dynamics in the upper kilometer of the global ocean. Our results further suggest that future changes in surface phytoplankton composition and mesopelagic oxygen loss might lead to profound changes in zooplankton abundance and community structure in both the euphotic and mesopelagic ocean. These changes may affect the vertical export and hereby the strength of the biological carbon pump",

Cap rupture is however difficult to predict due to the heterogenous composition of the plaque, unknown material properties, and the stochastic nature of the event. Here, we aim to create tissue engineered human fibrous cap models with a variable but controllable collagen composition, suitable for mechanical testing, to scrutinize the reciprocal relationships between composition and mechanical properties.\n\nMyofibroblasts were cultured in 1 x 1.5 cm-sized fibrin-based constrained gels for 21 days according to established (dynamic) culture protocols (i.e. static, intermittent or continuous loading) to vary collagen composition (e.g. amount, type and organization). At day 7, a soft 2 mm O fibrin inclusion was introduced in the centre of each tissue to mimic the soft lipid core, simulating the heterogeneity of a plaque.\n\nResults demonstrate reproducible collagenous tissues, that mimic the bulk mechanical properties of human caps and vary in collagen composition due to the presence of an successfully integrated soft inclusion and the culture protocol applied. The models can be deployed to assess tissue mechanics, evolution and failure of fibrous caps or complex heterogeneous tissues in general.",

However, the integrative analysis of the impact of UPRmt activation on different layers of signaling in animals with a different genetic background is lacking. In this study, we applied systems approaches to investigate the effect of UPRmt induced by administering doxycycline (Dox) on transcriptome, proteome, lipidome, and metabolome in two genetically divergent C. elegans strains. We found that Dox prolongs lifespan of both worm strains through pathways in both shared and strain-specific manners. From the integrated omics datasets, we observed a strong impact of Dox on mitochondrial functions, detected upregulated defense response and lipid metabolism, identified decreased triglycerides and lowered metabolome profiles in both strains. This conserved phenomic footprint has great translational value as it indicates that the beneficial effects of Dox-induced UPRmt on health and lifespan are consistent across different genetic backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Echinoids are key components of modern marine ecosystems. Despite a remarkable fossil record, the emergence of their crown group is documented by few specimens of unclear affinities, rendering much of their early history uncertain. The origin of sand dollars, one of its most distinctive clades, is also unclear due to an unstable phylogenetic context and discrepancies between molecular divergence times and fossil evidence. We employ seventeen novel genomes and transcriptomes to build a phylogenomic dataset with a near-complete sampling of major lineages. With it, we revise the phylogeny and divergence times of echinoids, and place their history within the broader context of echinoderm evolution. We also introduce the concept of a chronospace--a multidimensional representation of node ages--and use it to explore the effects of using alternative gene samples, models of molecular evolution, and clock priors. We find the choice of clock model to have the strongest impact on divergence times, while the use of site-heterogeneous models shows little effects. The choice of loci shows an intermediate impact, affecting mostly deep Paleozoic nodes, for which clock-like genes recover dates more congruent with fossil evidence. Our results reveal that crown group echinoids originated in the Permian and diversified rapidly in the Triassic, despite the relative lack of fossil evidence for this early diversification. We also clarify the relationships among sand dollars and their close relatives, showing that the genus Apatopygus represents a relict lineage with a deep Jurassic origin. Surprisingly, the origin of sand dollars is confidently dated to the Cretaceous, implying ghost ranges spanning approximately 50 million years, a remarkable discrepancy with their rich fossil record.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to the most challenging pandemic in this century, posing major economic and health challenges worldwide. Revealing host genes essential for infection by multiple variants of SASR-CoV-2 can provide insights into the virus pathogenesis, and facilitates the development of novel broad-spectrum host-directed therapeutics. Here, employing genome-scale CRISPR screens, we provide a comprehensive data-set of cellular factors that are exploited by WT-SARS-CoV-2 as well as two additional recently emerged variants of concerns (VOCs), Alpha and Beta. These screens identified known and novel host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including various components belonging to the Clathrin-dependent transport pathway, ubiquitination and Heparan sulfate biogenesis. In addition, the host phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis processes appeared to have major anti-viral functions. Comparative analysis of the different VOCs revealed the host factors KREMEN2 and SETDB1 as potential unique candidates required only to the Alpha variant, providing a possible explanation for the increased infectivity of this variant. Furthermore, the analysis identified GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, as an essential pro-viral gene for all variants inspected. We revealed that GATA6 directly regulates ACE2 transcription and accordingly, is critical for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Analysis of clinical samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals showed an elevated level of GATA6, indicating the important role GATA6 may be playing in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 resulted in down-modulation of ACE2 and consequently to inhibition of the viral infectivity. Overall, we show GATA6 represents a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategies and reaffirm the value of the CRISPR loss-of-function screens in providing a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Domestic cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and given that they are in close contact with people, assessing the potential risk cats represent for the transmission and maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 is important. Assessing this risk implies quantifying transmission from humans-to-cats, from cats-to-cats and from cats-to-humans. Here we quantified the risk of cat-to-cat transmission by reviewing published literature describing transmission either experimentally or under natural conditions in infected households. Data from these studies were collated to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number R0 among cats. The estimated R0 was significantly higher than 1, hence cats could play a role in the transmission and maintenance of SARS-CoV-2. Questions that remain to be addressed are the risk of transmission from humans-to-cats and cats-to-humans. Further data on household transmission and data on virus levels in both the environment around infected cats and their exhaled air could be a step towards assessing these risks.",

    "abstract": "Pre-existing T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in individuals without prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in several studies. While emerging evidence hints toward prior exposure to common-cold human coronaviruses (HCoV), the extent of- and conditions for-cross-protective immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs remain open. Here, by leveraging a comprehensive pool of publicly available functionally evaluated SARS-CoV-2 peptides, we report 126 immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 peptides with high sequence similarity to 285 MHC-presented target peptides from at least one of four HCoV, thus providing a map describing the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 shared and private immunogenic peptides with functionally validated T cell responses. Using this map, we show that while SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides in general exhibit higher level of dissimilarity to both self-proteome and -microbiomes, there exist several SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides with high similarity to various human protein coding genes, some of which have been reported to have elevated expression in severe COVID-19 patients. We then combine our map with a SARS-CoV-2-specific TCR repertoire data from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls and show that whereas the public repertoire for the majority of convalescent patients are dominated by TCRs cognate to private SARS-CoV-2 peptides, for a subset of patients, more than 50% of their public repertoires that show reactivity to SARS-CoV-2, consist of TCRs cognate to shared SARS-CoV-2-HCoV peptides. Further analyses suggest that the skewed distribution of TCRs cognate to shared and private peptides in COVID-19 patients is likely to be HLA-dependent. Finally, by utilising the global prevalence of HLA alleles, we provide 10 peptides with known cognate TCRs that are conserved across SARS-CoV-2 and multiple human coronaviruses and are predicted to be recognised by a high proportion of the global population. Overall, our work indicates the potential for HCoV-SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells, which is likely dependent on differences in HLA-coding genes among individuals. These findings may have important implications for COVID-19 heterogeneity and vaccine-induced immune responses as well as robustness of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.",

This enabled our discovery and capacity to reliably identify non-reproducible Ab-Ag interactions (NRI), as well as our development of a powerful explanatory model (\"0-RI-NRI-Hook four-state model\") that is [mAb]-dependent, regardless of specificity, which ultimately shows that both NSI and NRI are not predictable yet certain-to-happen. In experiments using seven FDA-approved mAb drugs, we demonstrated the use of NSI counts in predicting epitope type.

Here, we develop scalable co-transcriptional RNA strand displacement (ctRSD) circuits that are rationally programmed via base pairing interactions. ctRSD addresses the limitations of DNA-based strand displacement circuits by isothermally producing circuit components via transcription. We demonstrate the programmability of ctRSD in vitro by implementing logic and amplification elements, and multi-layer signaling cascades. Further, we show ctRSD kinetics are accurately predicted by a simple model of coupled transcription and strand displacement, enabling model-driven design. We envision ctRSD will enable rational design of powerful molecular circuits that operate in biological systems, including living cells.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a conserved, multi-step process of capturing proteolytic cargo in autophagosomes for lysosome degradation. The capacity to remove toxic proteins that accumulate in neurodegenerative disorders attests to the disease-modifying potential of the autophagy pathway. However, neurons respond only marginally to conventional methods for inducing autophagy, limiting efforts to develop therapeutic autophagy modulators for neurodegenerative diseases. The determinants underlying poor autophagy induction in neurons and the degree to which neurons and other cell types are differentially sensitive to autophagy stimuli are incompletely defined. Accordingly, we sampled nascent transcript synthesis and stabilities in fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons (iNeurons), thereby uncovering a neuron-specific stability of transcripts encoding myotubularin-related phosphatase 5 (MTMR5). MTMR5 is an autophagy suppressor that acts with its binding partner, MTMR2, to dephosphorylate phosphoinositides critical for autophagy initiation and autophagosome maturation. We found that MTMR5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress autophagy in iNeurons and undifferentiated iPSCs. Using optical pulse labeling to visualize the turnover of endogenously-encoded proteins in live cells, we observed that knockdown of MTMR5 or MTMR2, but not MTMR9, significantly enhances neuronal degradation of TDP-43, an autophagy substrate implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, our findings establish a regulatory mechanism of autophagy intrinsic to neurons and targetable for clearing disease-related proteins in a cell type-specific manner. In so doing, our results not only unravel novel aspects of neuronal biology and proteostasis, but also elucidate a strategy for modulating neuronal autophagy that could be of high therapeutic potential for multiple neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Segmented negative-strand RNA bunyaviruses encode a multi-functional polymerase that performs genome replication and transcription. Here, we establish conditions for in vitro activity of La Crosse virus polymerase and visualize by cryo-electron microscopy its conformational dynamics, unveiling the precise molecular mechanics underlying its essential activities. Replication initiation is coupled to distal duplex promoter formation, endonuclease movement, prime-and-realign loop extension and closure of the polymerase core that direct the template towards the active site. Transcription initiation depends on C-terminal region closure and endonuclease movements that firstly prompt primer cleavage and secondly promote primer entry in the active site. Product realignment after priming, observed in replication and transcription, is triggered by the prime-and-realign loop. Switch to elongation results in polymerase reorganization and core region opening to facilitate template-product duplex formation in the active site cavity. The detailed uncovered mechanics will be crucial for future design of antivirals counteracting bunyaviral life-threatening pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) often harbour diverse polymicrobial communities. These airway infections can be impossible to resolve though antibiotic intervention, even though isolates of the individual species present are susceptible to the treatment when tested in vitro. This suggests that susceptibility to antimicrobial agents may be altered in the presence of other microbial species. In this work, we investigate how polymicrobial cultures of key CF-associated species respond to challenge with species-specific antimicrobial agents; colistin (targets Pseudomonas aeruginosa), fusidic acid (targets Staphylococcus aureus) and fluconazole (targets Candida albicans). We found that, compared with growth in axenic cultures, the target organism was protected (sometimes by several orders of magnitude) from the effect(s) of the antimicrobial agent when grown in a polymicrobial culture. This decreased antimicrobial efficacy in polymicrobial cultures was found to have both phenotypic and inherited components. Whole genome sequencing of the colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis or pilus biogenesis. Colistin resistance associated with loss-of-function mutations in the LPS biosynthetic gene, wzy, could be complemented by expression of the wild-type wzy gene in trans. Our findings indicate that the polymicrobial nature of the CF airways is likely to have a significant impact on the clinical response to antimicrobial therapy.",

    "abstract": "PurposeGenital warts are one of the most common sexually transmitted infections and are known to develop due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially HPV types 6 and 11. However, their prevalence and subtypes in male genital warts remains poorly defined. HPV vaccine is administered to men in part to prevent anogenital warts and it is important to investigate their expected impact in male anogenital warts.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe have herein conducted a multicenter, prospective study to analyze HPV type distribution in genital warts of 1000 Korean men by using DNA microarray that can detect 40 types of genital HPV.\n\nResults1000 out of 1015 genital warts showed HPV DNA. Out of 1000 HPV-positive samples, 18.8% showed mixed infection and 81.2% showed single infection. Of 18 high-risk (16.2%) and 14 low-risk (94.3%) HPV types detected, the most common type of HPV types were HPV6 (59.5%), followed by HPV11 (24.3%), HPV16 (5.8%), HPV91 (5.3%), HPV40 (3.3%). 85.9% showed the 9 HPV types covered by the vaccine. Sixteen of the 200 HPV specimens submitted for sequencing showed discrepant results compared to the DNA sequencing.\n\nConclusionsMale genital warts predominantly show low-risk type HPV (HPV 6 and 11). However, high-risk HPV is not uncommon and the role of high-risk HPV in genital warts may be considered. The Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine is expected to provide protection against about >80% of male genital warts. Further HPV typing studies in male genital warts are necessary in other races and geographical areas to define the role and management of high-risk type HPV in male genital warts.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading opportunistic pathogen capable of causing fatal infections in immunocompromised individuals and patients with degenerative lung diseases. Agricultural soil and plants are the vast reservoirs of this dreaded pathogen. However, there have been limited attempts to analyze the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa strains associated with edible vegetable plants. This study aims to elucidate the virulence attributes of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the rhizosphere and endophytic niches of cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and chili collected from agricultural fields. Virulence of the agricultural strains was compared to three previously characterized clinical isolates. Our results showed that 50% of the plant-associated strains formed significant levels of biofilm and exhibited swarming motility. Nearly 80% of these strains produced considerable levels of rhamnolipid and exhibited at least one type of lytic activity (hemolysis, proteolysis, and lipolysis). Their virulence was also assessed based on their ability to suppress the growth of plant pathogens (Xanthomonas oryzae, Pythium aphanidermatum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium oxysporum) and kill a select nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans). The plant-associated strains showed significantly higher virulence against the bacterial phytopathogen whereas the clinical strains had significantly higher antagonism against the fungal pathogens. In C. elegans slow-killing assay, the clinical strains caused 50-100% death while a maximum of 40% mortality was induced by the agricultural strains. This study demonstrates that some of the P. aeruginosa strains associated with edible plants harbor multiple virulence traits. Upon infection of humans or animals, these strains may evolve to be more pathogenic and pose a significant health hazard.",

    "abstract": "PDMS chips have proven to be suitable environments for the growth of several filamentous organisms. However, depending on the specimen, the pattern of growth and cell differentiation has been rarely investigated. We monitored the developmental pattern of the brown alga Ectocarpus inside a PDMS lab-on-chip. Two main methods of inoculation of the lab-on-chip were tested, i.e. by injection of spores or by insertion of sporophyte filaments into the chamber. Growth rate, growth trajectory, cell differentiation, and branching were the main development steps that were monitored for 20 days inside 25 m or 40 m parallel channels under standard light and temperature conditions. They were shown to be similar to those observed in non-constrained in-vitro conditions. Labelling of Ectocarpus cell wall polysaccharides - both with calcofluor for cellulose, and by immunolocalisation for alginates with monoclonal antibodies-showed expected patterns when compared to open space growth using either epifluorescence or confocal microscopy. Overall this article describes the experimental conditions for observing and studying the basic unaltered processes of brown algal growth using microfluidic technology, which provides the basis for future biochemical and biological research.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins that self-assemble into amyloid and amyloid-like fibres can adopt polymorphic forms. These forms have been observed both in vitro and in vivo and can arise through variations in the steric-zipper interactions between {beta}-sheets, variations in the arrangements between protofilaments, and differences in the number of protofilaments that make up a given fibre class. Different polymorphs which arise from the same precursor molecule not only exhibit different levels of toxicity, but importantly can contribute to different disease conditions. In this work, we show that in the presence of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine, a highly abundant lipid in the plasma membrane of neurons, the aggregation of -synuclein is markedly accelerated and yields a diversity of polymorphic forms under identical experimental conditions. This morphological diversity includes thin and curly amyloid fibrils, helical and twisted ribbons, nanotubes and flat sheets. TEM analysis of fibrils sampled from the early stage of the growth phase shows the presence of helical and twisted ribbons, indicating that these morphological variants form at the early stages of aggregation. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) indicated the presence of lipids collocated with the mature fibrils. This finding has important implication as the presence of -synuclein with co-localized high lipid content has been reported in Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinsons disease and other synucleinopathies. Thus, the present study demonstrates that an interface, such as that provided by a lipid membrane, can not only modulate the kinetics of -synuclein amyloid aggregation but also plays an important role in the formation of morphological variants by incorporating lipid molecules in the process of amyloid fibril formation.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence implicates thalamo-cortical oscillations with the neuropathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ) in both mice and humans. Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying sleep perturbations in SZ remain unclear. Here, we characterised the dynamics of thalamo-cortical networks across sleep-wake states in a mouse model carrying a mutation in the enzyme glutathione synthetase gene (Gclm-/-) associated with SZ in humans. We hypothesised that deficits in parvalbumin immunoreactive cells in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - caused by oxidative stress - impact thalamocortical dynamics, thus affecting non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and sleep homeostasis. Using polysomnographic recordings in mice, we showed that KO mice exhibited a fragmented sleep architecture, similar to SZ patients and altered sleep homeostasis responses revealed by an increase in NREM latency and slow wave activities during the recovery period (SR). Although NREM sleep spindle rate during spontaneous sleep was similar in Gclm-/- and Gcml +/+, KO mice lacked a proper homeostatic response during SR. Interestingly, using multisite electrophysiological recordings in freely-moving mice, we found that high order thalamic network dynamics showed increased synchronisation, that was exacerbated during the sleep recovery period subsequent to SD, possibly due to lower bursting activity in TRN-antero dorsal thalamus circuit in KO compared to WT littermates. Collectively, these findings provide a mechanism for SZ associated deficits of thalamo-cortical neuron dynamics and perturbations of sleep architecture.",

    "abstract": "The latent HIV-1 reservoir containing stably integrated and transcriptionally silent proviruses in CD4+ T cells is a major barrier for virus eradication. Targeted reactivation of the latent reservoir remains a major challenge in establishing a path for an HIV-1 cure. Here, we investigated the possibility of reactivating the HIV-1 reservoir by targeting engineered bacteriophage T4 capsid nanoparticles to reservoir cells. The surface lattice of the 120 x 86 nm phage capsid was arrayed with CD4 binding ligands such as recombinant CD4DARPin or the HIV-1 gp140 envelope protein. When exposed to either PBMCs or the resting CD4+ T cells in vitro, these nanoparticles caused T cells activation without inducing global T cell activation. Furthermore, the nanoparticles reactivated HIV-1 proviral transcription that led to virus assembly and release in the J-Lat cells, a cell line model of HIV-1 latency. Intriguingly, the observed T cell activation and HIV-1 latency reversal did not occur through the classic PKC or NFAT pathways suggesting the involvement of a yet unknown pathway. These studies demonstrate that engineered non-infectious bacteriophages could be potentially exploited for HIV-1 cure and other targeted T cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 vaccine immunofocusing strategies have the potential to induce broadly reactive nAbs. Here, we engineered a panel of diverse, membrane-resident native HIV-1 trimers vulnerable to two broad targets of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), the V2 apex and fusion peptide (FP). Selection criteria included i) high expression and ii) infectious function, so that trimer neutralization sensitivity can be profiled in pseudovirus assays. Initially, we boosted the expression of 17 candidate trimers by truncating gp41 and introducing a gp120-gp41 SOS disulfide to prevent gp120 shedding. \"Repairs\" were made to fill glycan holes and other strain-specific aberrations. A new neutralization assay allowed PV infection when our standard assay was insufficient. Trimers with exposed V3 loops, a target of non-neutralizing antibodies, were discarded. To try to increase V2-sensitivity, we removed clashing glycans and modified the V2 loops C-strand. Notably, a 167N mutation improved V2-sensitivity. Glycopeptide analysis of JR-FL trimers revealed near complete sequon occupation and that filling the N197 glycan hole was well-tolerated. In contrast, sequon optimization and inserting/removing other glycans in some cases had local and global \"ripple\" effects on glycan maturation and sequon occupation in the gp120 outer domain and gp41. V2 mAb CH01 selectively bound trimers with small high mannose glycans near the base of the V1 loop, thereby avoiding clashes. Knocking in a N49 glycan perturbs gp41 glycans via a distal glycan network effect, increasing FP NAb sensitivity - and sometimes improving expression. Finally, a biophysical analysis of VLPs revealed that i) [~]25% of particles bear Env spikes, ii) spontaneous particle budding is high and only increases 4-fold upon Gag transfection, and iii) Env+ particles express [~]30-40 spikes. Overall, we identified 7 diverse trimers with a range of sensitivities to two targets that should enable rigorous testing of immunofocusing vaccine concepts.\n\nAuthor SummaryDespite almost 40 years of innovation, an HIV vaccine to induce antibodies that block virus infection remains elusive. Challenges include the unparalleled sequence diversity of HIVs surface spikes and its dense sugar coat that limits antibody access. However, a growing number of monoclonal antibodies from HIV infected donors provide vaccine blueprints. To date, these kinds of antibodies have been difficult to induce by vaccination. However, two antibody targets, one at the spike apex and another at the side of the spikes are more forgiving in their  demands for unusual antibodies. Here, we made a diverse panel of HIV spikes vulnerable at these two sites for later use as vaccines to try to focus antibodies on these targets. Our selection criteria for these spikes were: i) that the spikes, when expressed on particles, are infectious, allowing us to appraise our vaccine designs in an ideal manner; ii) that spikes are easy to produce by cells in quantities sufficient for vaccine use. Ultimately, we selected 7 trimers that will allow us to explore concepts that could bring us closer to an HIV vaccine.",

Here we describe the antibody repertoires elicited by different VSGs.

They are also highly discriminatory: minor alterations within these exposed epitopes confer antigenically-distinct properties to these VSGs and elicit different repertoires. We propose that the patterned and repetitive nature of the VSG coat focuses host immunity to a restricted set of immunodominant epitopes per VSG, eliciting a highly stereotyped response, minimizing cross reactivity between different VSGs and facilitating prolonged immune evasion through epitope variation.",

The screen recovered twenty-one potential host proteins that modulate ZIKV replication in an IFN-dependent manner, including the previously known IFITM3 and LY6E. Further characterization contributed to delineate the spectrum of action of these genes towards other pathogenic RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV-2. Our data revealed that APOL3 acts as a proviral factor for ZIKV and several other related and unrelated RNA viruses. In addition, we showed that MTA2, a chromatin remodeling factor, possesses potent flavivirus-specific antiviral functions. Our work identified previously unrecognized genes that modulate the replication of RNA viruses in an IFN-dependent way, opening new perspectives to target weakness points in the life cycle of these viruses.",

    "abstract": "The chimpanzee cytomegalovirus (CCMV) is the closest relative of human CMV (HCMV). Because of the high conservation between these two species and the ability of human cells to fully support CCMV replication, CCMV holds great potential as a model system for HCMV. To make the CCMV genome available for precise and rapid gene manipulation techniques, we captured the genomic DNA of CCMV strain Heberling as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Selected BAC clones were reconstituted to infectious viruses, growing to similar high titers as parental CCMV. DNA sequencing confirmed the integrity of our clones and led to the identification of two polymorphic loci within the CCMV genome. To re-evaluate the CCMV coding potential, we analyzed the transcriptome and proteome of infected cells and identified several novel ORFs, splice variants, and regulatory RNAs. We further characterized the dynamics of CCMV gene expression and found that viral proteins cluster into five distinct temporal classes. In addition, our datasets revealed that the host response to CCMV infection and the de-regulation of cellular pathways are in line with known hallmarks of HCMV infection. In a first functional experiment, we investigated a proposed frameshift mutation in UL128 that was suspected to restrict CCMVs cell tropism. In fact, repair of this frameshift re-established productive CCMV infection in endothelial and epithelial cells, expanding the options of CCMV as an infection model. Thus, BAC-cloned CCMV can serve as a powerful tool for systematic approaches in comparative functional genomics, exploiting the close phylogenetic relationship between CCMV and HCMV.",

    "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic and re-emerging virus which causes sporadic but severe infections in humans. Currently, no vaccines against NiV have been approved. We previously showed that ChAdOx1 NiV provides full protection against a lethal challenge with NiV Bangladesh (NiV-B) in hamsters. Here, we investigated the efficacy of ChAdOx1 NiV in the lethal African green monkeys (AGMs) NiV challenge model. AGMs were vaccinated either 4 weeks before challenge (prime vaccination), or 8 and 4 weeks before challenge with ChAdOx1 NiV (prime-boost vaccination). A robust humoral and cellular response was detected starting 14 days post initial vaccination. Upon challenge, control animals displayed a variety of signs and had to be euthanized between 5- and 7-days post inoculation. In contrast, vaccinated animals showed no signs of disease, and we were unable to detect infectious virus in all but one swab and all tissues. Importantly, no to limited antibodies against fusion protein or nucleoprotein IgG could be detected 42 days post challenge, suggesting that vaccination induced a very robust protective immune response preventing extensive virus replication.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA single vaccination with ChAdOx1 NiV protects African green monkeys against lethal disease induced by Nipah virus inoculation.",

    "abstract": "Centrioles and cilia are conserved, microtubule-based structures critical for cell function and development. Their structural and functional defects cause cancer and developmental disorders. How microtubules are organized into ordered structures by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and tubulin modifications is best understood during mitosis but is largely unexplored for the centrioles and the ciliary axoneme, which are composed of remarkably stable microtubules that maintain their length at steady state. In particular, we know little about the identity of the centriolar and ciliary MAPs and how they work together during the assembly and maintenance of the cilium and centriole. Here, we identified Enkurin domain containing 1 (ENKD1) as a component of the centriole wall and the axoneme in mammalian cells, and showed that it has extensive proximity interactions with these compartments and MAPs. Using in vitro and cellular assays, we found that ENKD1 is a new MAP that promotes microtubule polymerization and regulates microtubule organization and stability. Consistently, overexpression of ENKD1 increased tubulin polymerization and acetylation and disrupted microtubule organization. Cells depleted for ENKD1 were defective in ciliary length and content regulation and failed to respond to Hedgehog pathway activation. Together, our results establish ENKD1 as a new centriolar and ciliary MAP that regulate primary cilium structure and function, and advances our understanding of the functional and regulatory relationship between MAPs and the primary cilium.",

    "abstract": "Platinum-based antineoplastic drugs, such as cisplatin, are commonly used to induce tumor cell death. Cisplatin is believed to induce apoptosis as a result of cisplatin-DNA adducts that inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis. Although idea that DNA damage underlines anti-proliferative effects of cisplatin is dominant in cancer research, there is a poor correlation between the degree of the cell sensitivity to cisplatin and the extent of DNA platination. Here, we propose a novel mechanism of cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity. We show that cisplatin suppresses formation of Stress Granules (SGs), pro-survival RNA granules with multiple roles in cellular metabolism. Mechanistically, cisplatin inhibits cellular translation to promote disassembly of polysomes and aggregation of ribosomal subunits. As SGs are in equilibrium with polysomes, cisplatin-induced shift towards ribosomal aggregation suppresses SG formation and promotes cellular death. Our data also explain nephrotoxic, neurotoxic and ototoxic effects of cisplatin treatment.",

To-date, the relative effects of human-wildlife and wildlife-wildlife interactions on the likelihood of such outbreaks remain unclear.\nC_LIO_LIIn this study, we used social network analysis and epidemiological Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models, to track zoonotic outbreaks through wild animals joint propensities to engage in social-ecological co-interactions with humans, and their social grooming interactions with conspecifics.\nC_LIO_LIWe collected behavioral and demographic data on 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.) living in (peri)urban environments across Asia. Outbreak sizes predicted by the SIR models were related to structural features of the social networks, and particular properties of individual animals connectivity within those networks.\nC_LIO_LIOutbreak sizes were larger when the first-infected animal was highly central, in both types of networks. Across host-species, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques, the effects of network centrality on outbreak sizes were stronger through macaques human co-interaction networks compared to grooming networks.\nC_LIO_LIOur findings, independent of pathogen-transmissibility, suggest that wildlife populations in the Anthropocene are vulnerable to zoonosis more so due to their propensities to aggregate around anthropogenic factors than their gregariousness with conspecifics. Thus, the costs of zoonotic outbreaks may outweigh the potential/perceived benefits of jointly interacting with humans to procure anthropogenic food. From One Health perspectives, animals that consistently interact with both humans and conspecifics across time and space are useful targets for disease spillover assessments and control.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Tens of thousands of genetic variants associated with gene expression (cis-eQTLs) have been discovered in the human population. These eQTLs are active in various tissues and contexts, but the molecular mechanisms of eQTL variability are poorly understood, hindering our understanding of genetic regulation across biological contexts. Since many eQTLs are believed to act by altering transcription factor (TF) binding affinity, we hypothesized that analyzing eQTL effect size as a function of TF level may allow discovery of mechanisms of eQTL variability. Using GTEx Consortium eQTL data from 49 tissues, we analyzed the interaction between eQTL effect size and TF level across tissues and across individuals within specific tissues and generated a list of 6,262 TF-eQTL interactions across 1,598 genes that are supported by at least two lines of evidence. These TF-eQTLs were enriched for various TF binding measures, supporting with orthogonal evidence that these eQTLs are regulated by the implicated TFs. We also found that our TF-eQTLs tend to overlap genes with gene-by-environment regulatory effects and to colocalize with GWAS loci, implying that our approach can help to elucidate mechanisms of context-specificity and trait associations. Finally, we highlight an interesting example of IKZF1 TF regulation of an APBB1IP gene eQTL that colocalizes with a GWAS signal for blood cell traits. Together, our findings provide candidate TF mechanisms for a large number of eQTLs and offer a generalizable approach for researchers to discover TF regulators of genetic variant effects in additional QTL datasets.\n\nAuthor SummaryGene expression is regulated by local genomic sequence and can be affected by genetic variants. In the human population, tens of thousands of cis-regulatory variants have been discovered that are associated with altered gene expression across tissues, cell types, or environmental conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of how these small changes in the genome sequence affect genome function would offer insight to the genetic regulatory code and how gene expression is controlled across tissues and environments. Current research efforts suggest that many regulatory variants effects on gene expression are mediated by them altering the binding of transcription factors, which are proteins that bind to DNA to regulate gene expression. Here, we exploit the natural variation of TF activity among 49 tissues and between 838 individuals to elucidate which TFs regulate which regulatory variants. We find 6,262 TF-eQTL interactions across 1,598 genes that are supported by at least two lines of evidence. We validate these interactions using functional genomic and experimental approaches, and we find indication that they may pinpoint mechanisms of environment-specific genetic regulatory effects and genetic variants associated to diseases and traits.",

    "abstract": "Two alternative architectures have been proposed for PrPSc, the most notorious prion: a parallel in register {beta} stack (PIRIBS) and a 4-rung {beta}-solenoid (4R{beta}S). We challenged these two models by measuring intermolecular 13C-13C dipole-dipole couplings of 13CO-labelled Phe residues in a fully infectious sample of recombinant bank vole PrPSc (recBVPrPSc) using a PITHIRDS-CT solid state NMR (ssNMR) experiment. To our surprise, data strongly support a PIRIBS architecture. However, the mean distance measured ([~]6.5 [A]) suggests that a minimum of two of the three Phe residues are not perfectly stacked at the canonical [~]5 [A] cross-{beta} distance. Additional ssNMR experiments show some local conformational variability of the Phe residues within limits of a relatively high rigidity. The most parsimonious interpretation of our data is that recBVPrPSc is arranged as a PIRIBS, although additional conformers with alternative architectures cannot be excluded, including a mixture of PIRIBS and 4R{beta}S.\n\nAuthor summaryPrPSc is the most notorious prion. It is an infectious protein that cuases fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. PrPSc is the aberrant version of a brain protein, PrPC. PrPSc and PrPC have the same prinary structure, but different secondary, tertiaty and quaternary structures. PrPSc is capable of templating PrPC to convert to the PrPSc conformation, which is the basis of its capacity to propagate. Two plausible structural models of PrPSc have been proposed, the four-rung {beta}-solenoid (4R{beta}S) and the parallel in-register {beta} stack (PIRIBS) model. In both cases the driving force of the templating mechanism consists of \"sticky\" surface {beta}-strands; however, in the PIRIBS model all the {beta}-strands that conform a PrPSc monomer lie flat on a surface whereas in the 4R{beta}S model they wind in a corkscrew fashion. Here, we analyzed fully infectious recombinant PrPSc using a solid state NMR technique, PITHIRDS, that allows probing distances between specific labelled amino acid residues. To our surprise (as we have defended the 4R{beta}S model in the past), results clearly show the presence of a PIRIBS structure in our sample.",

    "abstract": "The catalytic activity of Syk-family tyrosine kinases is regulated by a tandem-SH2 module (tSH2 module). In the autoinhibited state, this module adopts a conformation which stabilizes an inactive conformation of the kinase domain. The binding of the tSH2 module to doubly-phosphorylated tyrosine-containing motifs necessitates a conformational change, thereby relieving kinase inhibition and promoting activation. We determined the crystal structure of the isolated tSH2 module of Syk and find, in contrast to ZAP-70, that its conformation more closely resembles that of the peptide-bound state, rather than the autoinhibited state. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, reveal that the dynamics of the tSH2 modules of Syk and ZAP-70 differ, with most of these differences occurring in the C-terminal SH2 domain. Our data suggest that the conformational landscapes of the tSH2 modules in Syk and ZAP-70 have been tuned differently, such that the auto-inhibited conformation of the Syk tSH2 module is less stable. This feature of Syk likely contributes to its ability to more readily escape autoinhibition when compared to ZAP-70, consistent with tighter control of downstream signaling pathways in T cells.",

Yet, MS/MS quantification of lowly abundant modifications in non-ribosomal RNAs is unreliable, and the dynamic features of various modifications poorly understood. We developed a 13C labeling approach, 13C-dynamods, to quantify the turnover of base modifications in newly transcribed RNA. This turnover-based approach helped to resolve mRNA from ncRNA modifications in purified RNA or free ribonucleosides, and showed the distinct kinetics of N6-methyladenosine (m62A) versus 7-methylguanosine (m7G) in polyA+-purified RNA. We uncovered that N6,N6-dimethyladenosine (m62A) exhibits a distinct turnover in small RNAs and free ribonucleosides when compared to the known m6 A-modified large rRNAs. Finally, combined measurements of turnover and abundance informed on the transcriptional versus posttranscriptional sensitivity of modified ncRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, to stress conditions. Thus, 13C-dynamods enables studies of origin of modified RNAs at steady-state and their dynamics under non-stationary conditions.",

    "abstract": "Plant nutrient uptake is critical to maintain an optimum balance between vegetative and reproductive growth and fruit quality. Nutrient imbalances, and more specifically the relationship of potassium, magnesium and nitrogen to calcium, can be critical for fruit quality in apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.). In perennial plants, it is difficult to conduct short-term experiments to measure plant uptake and distribution in response to either cultivar or treatment because of substantial preexisting nutrient pools already present. The use of isotopically labeled nitrogen, and nutrient analogs such as strontium and rubidium allow for the quantification of uptake and distribution that is often not possible with bulk mineral analysis. Here, the objective was to understand how scion genotype influences nutrient uptake and partitioning between aboveground and below ground parts of the tree. In this experiment, 10 atom% 15N, Strontium (Sr), and Rubidium (Rb) were applied to three different potted apple cultivars that were either treated with ABA 250 mg/L or 500 mg/L or an untreated control. After 70 days of growth, overall recovery rates of each tracer reflected the mobility of their nutrient analog. Strontium had an average tracer recovery rate of 3.9%, followed by 15N with 14.6% recovery and finally Rb with 15.1%. Independent of treatment,  Gala significantly absorbed more tracer followed by Granny Smith and Honeycrisp for Rb and Sr but not 15N. These results have implications in understanding the association between aboveground factors like transpiration and nutrient uptake and distribution in apple.",
