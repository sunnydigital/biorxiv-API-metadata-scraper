    "abstract": "Despite highly advanced diagnosis and treatment strategies, breast cancer patient outcomes vary extensively, even among individuals with the same diagnosis. Thus, a better understanding of the unique molecular characteristics that underlie tumor trajectories and responses to therapy remains a central goal. We report that chromatin patterns represent an important characteristic, capable of stratifying tumor identity and progression. We find that patterns of chromatin accessibility can be classified into 3 major groups, representing Basal-like tumors, hormone receptor (HR)-expressing tumors, and invasive lobular Luminal-A tumors. Major chromatin differences occur throughout the genome at motifs for the transcription factor FOXA1 in HR-positive tumors, and motifs for SOX9 in Basal-like tumors. A large portion of lobular Luminal-A tumors display a chromatin signature defined by accessibility at FOXA1 binding motifs, distinguishing them from others within this subtype. Expression of the histone chaperone ANP32E is inversely correlated with tumor progression and chromatin accessibility at FOXA1 binding sites. Tumors with high levels of ANP32E exhibit an immune response and proliferative gene expression signature, whereas tumors with low ANP32E levels appear programmed for differentiation. Our results indicate that ANP32E may function through chromatin state regulation to control breast cancer differentiation and tumor plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult malignant brain tumor, with a median survival of 21 months and a 100% recurrence rate. Even though many of the critical oncogenic drivers for GBM have been identified, the basis of gliomagenesis is still under investigation. To identify novel genes that contribute to GBM progression, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen. We identified four previously unstudied genes - PSMB3, CHCHD4, SPDYE5, HSPA1 - which had elevated expression in cancer and demonstrated a significant positive correlation with respect to GBM growth and patient survival in vivo and patient datasets. Furthermore, overexpression of PSMB3 and HSPA5 in neural stem cells resulted in transformation to a cancer phenotype. Further investigation of PSMB3, a subunit of the proteasome, allowed us to identify both ubiquitin-mediated and non-ubiquitin-mediated mechanisms of oncogenesis. Ultimately, the data from our CRISPR screens suggests that these genes drive tumor progression, making them promising therapeutic targets for GBM.",

    "abstract": "Plants use intracellular immune receptors (NLRs) to detect pathogen-derived effector proteins. The Arabidopsis NLR pair RRS1-R/RPS4 confers disease resistance to different bacterial pathogens by perceiving structurally distinct effectors AvrRps4 from Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi and PopP2 from Ralstonia solanacearum via an integrated WRKY domain in RRS1-R. How the WRKY domain of RRS1 (RRS1WRKY) perceives distinct classes of effector to initiate an immune response is unknown. We report here the crystal structure of the in planta processed C-terminal domain of AvrRps4 (AvrRps4C) in complex with RRS1WRKY. Perception of AvrRps4C by RRS1WRKY is mediated by the {beta}2-{beta}3 segment of RRS1WRKY that binds an electronegative patch on the surface of AvrRps4C. Structure-based mutations that disrupt AvrRps4C/RRS1WRKY interactions in vitro compromise RRS1/RPS4-dependent immune responses. We also show that AvrRps4C can associate with the WRKY domain of the related but distinct RRS1B/RPS4B NLR pair, and the DNA binding domain of AtWRKY41, with similar binding affinities. This work demonstrates how integrated domains in plant NLRs can directly bind structurally distinct effectors to initiate immunity.\n\nSignificanceThis study reveals a mechanism of effector recognition by a plant NLR immune receptor that carries an integrated domain (ID) which mimics an authentic pathogen effector target. An Arabidopsis immune receptor carrying RRS1 and RPS4 NLR proteins detects the Pseudomonas syringae pv. pisi secreted effector AvrRps4 via a WRKY ID in RRS1. We used structural biology to reveal the mechanisms of AvrRps4/WRKY interaction and demonstrated that this binding is essential for effector recognition in planta. Our analysis revealed distinctive features of the WRKY ID that mediate the recognition of structurally distinct effectors from different bacterial pathogens. These insights could enable engineering NLRs with novel recognition specificities, and enhances our understanding of how effectors interact with host proteins.",

    "abstract": "PurposeRecent calls to improve transparency in peer review have prompted examination of many aspects of the peer review process. Peer review systems often allow confidential comments to editors that could reduce transparency to authors, yet this option has escaped scrutiny. Our study explores 1) how reviewers use the confidential comments section and 2) alignment between comments to the editor and comments to authors with respect to content and tone.\n\nMethodsOur dataset included 358 reviews of 168 manuscripts submitted between January 1, 2019 and August 24, 2020 to a health professions education journal with a single blind review process. We first identified reviews containing comments to the editor. Then, for the reviews with comments, we used procedures consistent with conventional and directed qualitative content analysis to develop a coding scheme and code comments for content, tone, and section of the manuscript. For reviews in which the reviewer recommended \"reject,\" we coded for alignment between reviewers comments to the editor and to authors. We report descriptive statistics.\n\nResults49% of reviews contained comments to the editor (n=176). Most of these comments summarized the reviewers impression of the article (85%), which included explicit reference to their recommended decision (44%) and suitability for the journal (10%). The majority of comments addressed argument quality (56%) or research design/methods/data (51%). The tone of comments tended to be critical (40%) or constructive (34%). For the 48 reviews recommending \"reject,\" the majority of comments to the editor contained content that also appeared in comments to the authors (65%); additional content tended to be irrelevant to the manuscript. Tone frequently aligned (85%).\n\nConclusionFindings indicate variability in how reviewers use the confidential comments to editor section in online peer review systems, though generally the way they use them suggests integrity and transparency to authors.",

For instance, the intricate interactions between tumour and host cannot be adequately recapitulated in monoculture of tumour-derived cell lines. More complex co-culture models usually rely on sorting procedures for proteome analyses and rarely capture the details of protein glycosylation. Here, we report a strategy termed Bio-Orthogonal Cell line-specific Tagging of Glycoproteins (BOCTAG). Cells are equipped by transfection with an artificial biosynthetic pathway that transforms bioorthogonally tagged sugars into the corresponding nucleotide-sugars. Only transfected cells incorporate bioorthogonal tags into glycoproteins in the presence of non-transfected cells. We employ BOCTAG as an imaging technique and to annotate cell-specific glycosylation sites in mass spectrometry-glycoproteomics. We demonstrate application in co-culture and mouse models, allowing for profiling of the glycoproteome as an important modulator of cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by epilepsy, intellectual disability, and sudden death, due to heterozygous variants in SCN1A with loss of function of the sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. Nav1.1-expressing parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons (PV-INs) from pre-weanling Scn1a+/- mice show impaired action potential generation. A novel approach assessing PV-IN function in the same mice at two developmental time points showed that, at post-natal day (P) 16-21, spike generation was impaired all mice, deceased prior or surviving to P35. However, synaptic transmission was selectively dysfunctional in pre-weanling mice that did not survive. Spike generation in surviving mice normalized by P35, yet we again identified abnormalities in synaptic transmission. We conclude that combined dysfunction of PV-IN spike generation and synaptic transmission drives disease severity, while ongoing dysfunction of synaptic transmission contributes to chronic pathology. Modeling revealed that PV-IN axonal propagation is more sensitive to decreases in sodium conductance than spike generation.",

    "abstract": "This work was initiated because an old publication suggested that electrocoagulation of four paraldehyde fuchsin positive cells in the brain of Locusta migratoria might produce a diuretic hormone, the identity of which remains unknown, since none of the antisera to the various putative Locusta diuretic hormones recognizes these cells. The paraldehyde fuchsin positive staining suggests a peptide with a disulfide bridge and the recently identified Locusta calcitonins have both a disulfide bridge and are structurally similar to calcitonin-like diuretic hormone.\n\nIn situ hybridization and antisera raised to calcitonin-A and -B were used to show were these peptides are expressed in Locusta. Calcitonin-A is produced by neurons and neuroendocrine cells that were previously shown to be immunoreactive to an antiserum to pigment dispersing factor (PDF). The apparent PDF-immunoreactivity in these neurons and neuroendocrine cells is due to crossreactivity with the calcitonin-A precursor. As confirmed by both an PDF-precursor specific antiserum and in situ hybridisation, those calcitonin-A expressing cells do not express PDF.\n\nCalcitonin B is expressed by numerous enteroendocrine cells in the midgut as well as the midgut caeca. A guinea pig antiserum to calcitonin A seemed quite specific as it recognized only the calcitonin A expressing cells. However, rabbit antisera to calcitonin-A and-B both crossreacted with neuroendocrine cells in the brain that produce ACP, this is almost certainly due to the common C-terminal dipeptide SPamide that is shared between Locusta calcitonin-A, calcitonin-B and ACP.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavior is strongly context-dependent and behavioral performance is often modulated by internal state. In particular, different social contexts can alter anxiety levels and modulate social behavior. The vertebrate-specific neuropeptide parathyroid hormone 2 (pth2) is directly regulated by the presence or absence of conspecifics in zebrafish. As its cognate receptor, the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (pth2r), is widely expressed across the brain, we tested fish lacking the functional Pth2 peptide in several anxiety-related and social paradigms. Rodents lacking PTH2 display increased anxiety-related behavior. Here we show that the propensity to react to sudden stimuli with an escape response is increased in pth2-/- zebrafish, consistent with elevated anxiety. While overall social preference for conspecifics is maintained in pth2-/- fish until the early juvenile stage, we found that both social preference and shoaling are altered later in development. The data presented suggest that the neuropeptide Pth2 modulates several conserved behavioral features, and may thus enable the animal to react appropriately in different social contexts.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA major challenge in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases including periodontal diseases is the development of therapeutics to safely and specifically direct resolution of inflammation in a localized manner. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of a novel approach that addresses this unmet clinical need. Using an enzyme fusion protein of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO) and galectin-3 (Gal3) with tissue-anchored and thus localized immunomodulatory properties, we prevented and halted progression of induced polymicrobial periodontal disease. Efficacy was achieved with repeated treatment with IDO-Gal3 and was measured by effects on mandibular bone loss, soft tissue inflammation and local T cell plasticity. Specifically, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of IDO-Gal3 were effective in reducing vertical mandibular bone loss and loss of mandibular bone volume and bone thickness induced by chronic polymicrobial infection. The efficacy observed is at least in part due to localized regulation of innate immune mediators such as IL-1{beta}, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as chemoattractants including IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP-1, while enhancing the expression of immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10. In addition, IDO-Gal3 treatment suppressed the induction of pathogenic CD4+Th1, CD8+Tc1, CD4+Th1/Th17, and CD8+Tc1/Tc17, while promoting the induction of homeostatic CD4+Th17, CD8+Tc17 and CD4+Tregs. Importantly, the efficacy of prophylactically and therapeutically administered IDO-Gal-3 is not dependent on bacterial burden as there were no appreciable effects on bacterial burden following either method of administration. Lastly, therapeutic rather than prophylactic administration of IDO-Gal3 is most effective in preventing mandibular bone loss through more robust innate and adaptive immune modulation. Together these and our previously published data indicate that therapeutic administration of IDO-Gal3 addresses the clinical needs for adjunctive therapeutics to treat active and/or established periodontal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group of cells, which can suppress the immune response, promote tumor progression and impair the efficacy of immunotherapies. Consequently, the pharmacological targeting of MDSC is emerging as a new immunotherapeutic strategy to stimulate the natural anti-tumor immune response and potentiate the efficacy of immunotherapies. Herein, we leveraged genetically modified models and a small molecule inhibitor to validate Calcium-Calmodulin Kinase Kinase 2 (CaMKK2) as a druggable target to control MDSC accumulation in tumor-bearing mice. The results indicated that deletion of CaMKK2 in the host attenuated the growth of engrafted tumor cells, and this phenomenon was associated with increased antitumor T cell response and decreased accumulation of MDSC. The adoptive transfer of MDSC was sufficient to restore the ability of the tumor to grow in Camkk2-/- mice, confirming the key role of MDSC in the mechanism of tumor rejection. In vitro studies indicated that blocking of CaMKK2 is sufficient to impair the yield of MDSC. Surprisingly, MDSC generated from Camkk2-/- bone marrow cells also showed a higher ability to terminally differentiate toward more immunogenic cell types (e.g inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells) compared to wild type (WT). Higher intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in Camkk2-/- MDSC, increasing their susceptibility to apoptosis and promoting their terminal differentiation toward more mature myeloid cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a known CaMKK2 proximal target controlling the oxidative stress response, fine-tunes ROS accumulation in MDSC. Accordingly, failure to activate the CaMKK2-AMPK axis can account for the elevated ROS levels in Camkk2-/- MDSC. These results highlight CaMKK2 as an important regulator of the MDSC lifecycle, identifying this kinase as a new druggable target to restrain MDSC expansion and enhance the efficacy of anti-tumor immunotherapy.",

Proper mitotic spindle orientation relies on polarised anchoring of force generators to the cell cortex by the evolutionarily conserved Gi-LGN-NuMA complex. However, the polarity cues that control cortical patterning of this ternary complex remain largely unknown in mammalian epithelia. Here we identify the membrane-associated protein Annexin A1 (ANXA1) as a novel interactor of LGN in mammary epithelial cells. ANXA1 acts independently of Gi to instruct the accumulation of LGN and NuMA at the lateral cortex to ensure cortical anchoring of Dynein-Dynactin and astral microtubules and thereby planar alignment of the mitotic spindle. Loss of ANXA1 randomises mitotic spindle orientation, which in turn disrupts epithelial architecture and luminogenesis in three-dimensional cultures of primary mammary epithelial cells. Our findings establish ANXA1 as an upstream cortical cue that regulates LGN to direct planar cell divisions during mammalian epithelial morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus displays staggering cellular diversity, chiefly established during embryogenesis by the interplay of several signalling pathways and a battery of transcription factors. However, the contribution of epigenetic cues to hypothalamus development remains unclear. We mutated the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 gene Eed in the developing mouse hypothalamus, which resulted in the loss of H3K27me3; a fundamental epigenetic repressor mark. This triggered ectopic expression of posteriorly expressed regulators (e.g., Hox homeotic genes), upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors and reduced proliferation. Surprisingly, despite these effects, single cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that the majority of neuronal subtypes were still generated in Eed mutants. However, we observed an increase in Glutamatergic/GABAergic double-positive cells, as well as loss/reduction of dopamine, Hypocretin/Orexin and Tac2 neurons. These findings indicate that many aspects of the hypothalamic gene regulatory flow can proceed without the key H3K27me3 epigenetic repressor mark, and points to a unique sensitivity of particular neuronal sub-types to a disrupted epigenomic landscape.",

    "abstract": "Bergmanns Rule--which posits that larger animals live in colder areas--is thought to influence variation in body size within species across space and time, but evidence for this claim is mixed. We tested four competing hypotheses for spatio-temporal variation in body size within bat species during the past two decades across North America. Bayesian hierarchical models revealed that spatial variation in body mass was most strongly (and negatively) correlated with mean annual temperature, supporting the heat conservation hypothesis (historically believed to underlie Bergmanns Rule). Across time, variation in body mass was most strongly (and positively) correlated with net primary productivity, supporting the resource availability hypothesis. Climate change could influence body size in animals through both changes in mean annual temperature and in resource availability. Rapid reductions in body size associated with increasing temperatures have occurred in short-lived, fecund species, but such reductions likely transpire more slowly in longer-lived species.",

    "abstract": "Venom expressed by the nearly 50,000 species of spiders on Earth largely remains an untapped reservoir of a diverse array of biomolecules with potential for pharmacological and agricultural applications. A large fraction of the noxious components of spider venoms are a functionally diverse family of structurally related polypeptides with an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) motif. The cysteine-rich nature of these toxins makes structural elucidation difficult, and most studies have focused on venom components from the small handful of medically relevant spider species such as the highly aggressive Brazilian wandering spider Phoneutria nigriventer. To alleviate difficulties associated with the study of ICK toxins in spiders, we devised a comprehensive approach to explore the evolutionary patterns that have shaped ICK functional diversification using venom gland transcriptomes and proteomes from phylogenetically distinct lineages of wandering spiders and their close relatives. We identified 626 unique ICK toxins belonging to seven topological elaborations. Phylogenetic tests of episodic diversification revealed distinct regions between cysteine residues that demonstrated differential evidence of positive or negative selection, which may have structural implications towards the specificity and efficacy of these toxins. Increased taxon sampling and whole genome sequencing will provide invaluable insights to further understand the evolutionary processes that have given rise to this diverse class of toxins.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STR), also known as microsatellite markers are currently used for genetic parentage verification within equine. Transitioning from STR to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to perform equine parentage verification is now a potentially feasible prospect and a key area requiring evaluation is parentage testing accuracies when using SNP based methods, in comparison to STRs. To investigate, we utilised a targeted equine genotyping by sequencing (GBS) panel of 562 SNPs to SNP genotype 309 Thoroughbred horses - inclusive of 55 previously parentage verified offspring. Availability of STR profiles for all 309 horses, enabled comparison of parentage accuracies between SNP and STR panels. An average sample call rate of 97.2% was initially observed, and subsequent removal of underperforming SNPs realised a pruned final panel of 516 SNPs. Simulated trio and partial parentage scenarios were tested across 12-STR, 16-STR, 147-SNP and 516-SNP panels. False-positives (i.e. expected to fail parentage, but pass) ranged from 0% for 147-SNP and 516-SNP panels to 0.003% when using 12-STRs within trio parentage scenarios, and 0% for 516-SNPs to 1.6% for 12-STRs within partial parentage scenarios. Our study leverages targeted GBS methods to generate low-density equine SNP profiles and demonstrates the value of SNP based equine parentage analysis in comparison to STRs - particularly when performing partial parentage discovery.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa plays a critical role in coordinating numerous cellular processes. We extracted and quality controlled all publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets for P. aeruginosa to find 281 high-quality transcriptomes. We produced 83 new RNAseq data sets under critical conditions to generate a comprehensive compendium of 364 transcriptomes. We used this compendium to reconstruct the TRN of P. aeruginosa using independent component analysis (ICA). We identified 104 independently modulated sets of genes (called iModulons), among which 81 (78%) reflect the effects of known transcriptional regulators. We show that iModulons: 1) play an important role in defining the genomic boundaries of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs); 2) show increased expression of the BGCs and associated secretion systems in conditions that emulate cystic fibrosis (CF); 3) show the presence of a novel BGC named RiPP (bacteriocin producer) which might have a role in worsening CF outcomes; 4) exhibit the interplay of amino acid metabolism regulation and central metabolism across carbon sources, and 5) clustered according to their activity changes to define iron and sulfur stimulons. Finally, we compare the iModulons of P. aeruginosa with those of E. coli to observe conserved regulons across two gram negative species. This comprehensive TRN framework covers almost every aspect of the transcriptional regulatory machinery in P. aeruginosa, and thus could prove foundational for future research of its physiological functions.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels play critical roles in propagating action potentials and otherwise manipulating ionic gradients in excitable cells. These channels open in response to membrane depolarization, selectively permeating sodium ions until rapidly inactivating. Structural characterization of the gating cycle in this channel family has proved challenging, particularly due to the transient nature of the open state. A structure from the bacterium Magnetococcus marinus Nav (NavMs) was initially proposed to be open, based on its pore diameter and voltage-sensor conformation. However, the functional annotation of this model, and the structural details of the open state, remain disputed. In this work, we used molecular modeling and simulations to test possible open-state models of NavMs. The full-length experimental structure, termed here the -model, was consistently dehydrated at the activation gate, indicating an inability to conduct ions. Based on a spontaneous transition observed in extended simulations, and sequence/structure comparison to other Nav channels, we built an alternative {pi}-model featuring a helix transition and the rotation of a conserved asparagine residue into the activation gate. Pore hydration, ion permeation and state-dependent drug binding in this model were consistent with an open functional state. This work thus offers both a functional annotation of the full-length NavMS structure, and a detailed model for a stable Nav open state, with potential conservation in diverse ion-channel families.",

    "abstract": "RNA degradation inside the plant vacuole by the ribonuclease RNS2 is essential for maintaining nucleotide concentrations and cellular homeostasis via the nucleotide salvage pathway. However, the mechanisms by which RNA is transported into the vacuole are not well understood. While selective macroautophagy may contribute to this transport, macroautophagy-independent transport pathways also exist. Here we demonstrate a mechanism for direct RNA transport into vacuoles that is active in purified vacuoles and is ATP hydrolysis-dependent. We identify the RNA helicase SKI2 as a factor required for this transport pathway, as ski2 mutant vacuoles are defective in transport. ski2 mutants have an increased autophagy phenotype that can be rescued by exogenous addition of nucleosides, consistent with a function in nucleotide salvage. This newly-described transport mechanism is therefore critical for RNA degradation, recycling and cytoplasmic nucleotide homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) has been theorized to participate in a range of social, cognitive, and affective functions. Yet, previous accounts do not consider how the DMN contributes to other brain regions depending on psychological context, thus rendering our understanding of DMN function incomplete. We addressed this gap by applying a novel network-based psychophysiological interaction (nPPI) analysis to the reward task within the Human Connectome Project. We first focused on the task-evoked responses of the DMN and other networks involving the prefrontal cortex, including the executive control network (salience network) and the left and right frontoparietal networks. Consistent with a host of prior studies, the DMN exhibited a relative decrease in activation during the task, while the other networks exhibited a relative increase during the task. Next, we used nPPI analyses to assess whether these networks exhibit task-dependent changes in connectivity with other brain regions. Strikingly, we found that the experience of reward enhances task-dependent connectivity between the DMN and the ventral striatum, an effect that was specific to the DMN. Surprisingly, the strength of DMN-VS connectivity was correlated with personality characteristics relating to openness. Taken together, these results advance models of DMN by demonstrating how it contributes to other brain systems during task performance and how those contributions relate to individual differences.",

Missense mutation(s) of Rab7 underlies the pathogenesis of Charcot Marie Tooth 2B (CMT2B) peripheral neuropathy. Herein, we investigated how mitochondrial morphology and function were impacted by the CMT2B associated Rab7V162M mutation in fibroblasts from human CMT2B patients as well as in a knockin mouse model. In contrast to recently published results from studies of using heterologous overexpression systems, our results have demonstrated significant mitochondrial fragmentation in fibroblasts of both human CMT2B patients and CMT2B mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, we have shown that mitochondria were fragmented and axonal mitochondrial movement was dysregulated in primary cultured E18 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, but not in E18 hippocampal and cortical primary neurons. We also show that inhibitors to either the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 or to the nucleotide binding to Rab7 normalized the mitochondrial deficits in both MEFs and E18 cultured DRG neurons. Our study has revealed, for the first time, that expression of CMT2B Rab7 mutation at physiological level enhances Drp1 activity to promote mitochondrial fission, that may potentially underlie selective vulnerability of peripheral sensory neurons in CMT2B pathogenesis.",

Utilizing these paired multi-omic data, we define Domains of Regulatory Chromatin (DORCs) of immune stimulation and find that cells alter chromatin accessibility prior to production of gene expression at time scales of minutes. Further, the construction of the stimulation GRN elucidates TF activity at disease-associated DORCs. Overall, FigR enables the elucidation of regulatory interactions across single-cell data, providing new opportunities to understand the function of cells within tissues.",

However, insights into the spatial expression of genes have been limited by a lack of robust methodology. We therefore developed a set of algorithms for quantifying and comparing tissue-wide spatial patterns of gene expression within and across species. Here we apply these algorithms to compare cortex-wide expression of Id2 and RZR{beta} mRNA in early postnatal mice and voles. We show that neocortical patterns of Id2 expression are moderately conserved between species, but that the degree of conservation varies by cortical layer and area. By comparison, patterns of RZR{beta} expression are highly conserved in somatosensory areas, and more variable between species in visual and auditory areas. We consider if these differences reflect independent evolution in the 35 million years since the last common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Adherens junctions allow cell contact to inhibit epithelial migration. But a long-standing puzzle is how locomotion is downregulated when E-cadherin adhesions form at surfaces perpendicular, but not those parallel, to the direction of migration. We now show that this arises from coupling between E-cadherin adhesions and the retrograde cortical flows of leader cells in migrating epithelia. At interfaces perpendicular to the direction of motion, such flows are antiparallel, which generates a tensile signal that induces the actin-binding domain of -catenin to promote lateral growth of nascent adhesions and inhibit the lamellipodial activity necessary for migration. At interfaces parallel to the direction of motion, by contrast, cortical flows are aligned and no such mechanical inhibition takes place. Therefore, -catenin mechanosensitivity in the clutch between E-cadherin and cortical F-actin allows cells to interpret the direction of motion via cortical flows and trigger the first signal for contact to inhibit locomotion.",
