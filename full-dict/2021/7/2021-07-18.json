    "abstract": "Flying over the open sea is energetically costly for terrestrial birds. Despite this, over-water journeys of many birds, sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, are uncovered by bio-logging technology. To understand how these birds afford their flights over the open sea, we investigated the role of atmospheric conditions, specifically wind and uplift, in subsidizing over-water flight at the global scale. We first established that {Delta}T, the temperature difference between sea surface and air, is a meaningful proxy for uplift over water. Using this proxy, we showed that the spatio-temporal patterns of sea-crossing in terrestrial migratory birds is associated with favorable uplift conditions. We then analyzed route selection over the open sea for five facultative soaring species, representing all major migratory flyways. The birds maximized wind support when selecting their sea-crossing routes and selected higher uplift when suitable wind support was available. They also preferred routes with low long-term uncertainty in wind conditions. Our findings suggest that, in addition to wind, uplift may play a key role in the energy seascape for bird migration that in turn determines strategies and associated costs for birds crossing ecological barriers such as the open sea.",

    "abstract": "Complex tissue regeneration is extremely rare among adult mammals. An exception, however, is the superior tissue healing of multiple organs in spiny mice (Acomys). While Acomys species exhibit the remarkable ability to heal complex tissue with minimal scarring, little is known about their cardiac structure and response to cardiac injury. In this study, we first examined baseline Acomys cardiac anatomy and function in comparison with the commonly used laboratory Mus strains (C57BL6 and SWR). Our results demonstrated comparable cardiac anatomy and function between Acomys and Mus, but Acomys exhibited a higher percentage of cardiomyocytes exhibiting immature characteristics. In response to myocardial infarction, all animals experienced a comparable level of initial cardiac damage. However, Acomys demonstrated superior ischemic tolerance and cytoprotection in response to injury as evidenced by cardiac functional stabilization, higher survival rate and smaller scar size 50 days after injury compared to the inbred and outbred mouse strains. Overall, these findings demonstrate augmented myocardial preservation in spiny mice post-MI and establish Acomys as a new adult mammalian model for cardiac research.",

    "abstract": "Blast-induced hearing difficulties affect thousands of veterans and civilians. The long-term impact of even a mild blast exposure on the central auditory system is hypothesized to contribute to lasting behavioral complaints associated with mild blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI). Although recovery from mild blast has been studied separately over brief or long time windows, few, if any, studies have investigated recovery longitudinally over short-term and longer-term (months) time windows. Specifically, many peripheral measures of auditory function either recover or exhibit subclinical deficits, masking deficits in processing complex, real-world stimuli that may recover differently. Thus, examining the acute time course and pattern of neurophysiological impairment using appropriate stimuli is critical to better understanding and intervention of bTBI-induced auditory system impairments. Here, we compared auditory brainstem response, middle-latency auditory evoked potentials, and envelope following responses. Stimuli were clicks, tone pips, amplitude modulated tones in quiet and in noise, and speech-like stimuli (iterated rippled noise pitch contours) in adult male rats subjected to mild blast and sham exposure over the course of two months. We found that blast animals demonstrated drastic threshold increases and auditory transmission deficits immediately after blast exposure, followed by substantial recovery during the window of 7-14 days post-blast, though with some deficits remaining even after two months. Challenging conditions and speech-like stimuli can better elucidate mild bTBI-induced auditory deficit during this period. Our results suggest multiphasic recovery and therefore potentially different time windows for treatment, and deficits can be best observed using a small battery of sound stimuli.\n\nNew and NoteworthyFew studies on blast-induced hearing deficits go beyond simple sounds and sparsely track post-exposure. Therefore, the recovery arc for potential therapies and real-world listening is poorly understood. Evidence suggested multiple recovery phases over 2 months post-exposure. Hearing thresholds largely recovered within 14 days and partially explained recovery. However, mid-latency responses, responses to AM in noise, and speech-like pitch sweeps exhibited extended changes, implying persistent central auditory deficits and the importance of subclinical threshold shifts.",

    "abstract": "The transition between pluripotent and tissue-specific states is a key aspect of development. Understanding the pathways driving these transitions will facilitate the engineering of properly differentiated cells for experimental and therapeutic uses. Here, we showed that during mesoderm differentiation, the transcription factor Oct1 activated developmental lineage-appropriate genes that were silent in pluripotent cells. Using mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with an inducible knockout of Oct1, we showed that Oct1 deficiency resulted in poor induction of mesoderm-specific genes, leading to impaired mesodermal and terminal muscle differentiation. Oct1-deficient cells exhibited poor temporal coordination of the induction of lineage-specific genes and showed inappropriate developmental lineage branching, resulting in poorly differentiated cell states retaining epithelial characteristics. In ESCs, Oct1 localized with the pluripotency factor Oct4 at mesoderm-associated genes and remained bound to those loci during differentiation after the dissociation of Oct4. Binding events for Oct1 overlapped with those for the histone lysine demethylase Utx, and an interaction between Oct1 and Utx suggested that these two proteins cooperate to activate gene expression. The specificity of the ubiquitous Oct1 for the induction of mesodermal genes could be partially explained by the frequent coexistence of Smad and Oct binding sites at mesoderm-specific genes and the cooperative stimulation of mesodermal gene transcription by Oct1 and Smad3. Together, these results identify Oct1 as a key mediator of mesoderm lineage-specific gene induction.",

    "abstract": "Fluid-filled biological cavities are ubiquitous, but their collective dynamics has remained largely unexplored from a physical perspective. Based on experimental observations in early embryos, we propose a model where a cavity forms through the coarsening of myriad of pressurized micrometric lumens, that interact by ion and fluid exchanges through the intercellular space. Performing extensive numerical simulations, we find that hydraulic fluxes lead to a self-similar coarsening of lumens in time, characterized by a robust dynamic scaling exponent. The collective dynamics is primarily controlled by hydraulic fluxes, which stem from lumen pressures differences and are dampened by water permeation through the membrane. Passive osmotic heterogeneities play, on the contrary, a minor role on cavity formation but active ion pumping can largely modify the coarsening dynamics: it prevents the lumen network from a collective collapse and gives rise to a novel coalescence-dominated regime exhibiting a distinct scaling law. Interestingly, we prove numerically that spatially biasing ion pumping may be sufficient to position the cavity, suggesting a novel mode of symmetry breaking to control tissue patterning. Providing generic testable predictions, our model forms a comprehensive theoretical basis for hydro-osmotic interaction between biological cavities, that shall find wide applications in embryo and tissue morphogenesis.\n\nAuthor summaryThe formation of a single biological cavity, or lumen, in tissues and embryos has been widely studied experimentally but the collective dynamics of multiple lumens has received much less attention. Here, we focus on a particular type of lumens, which are located at the adhesive side of cells and can therefore interact directly through the intercellular space, as recently observed in the very first stages of embryogenesis. We propose a generic model to describe the hydraulic and osmotic exchanges between lumens themselves, and with the surrounding cellular medium. Lumens are pressurized by a surface tension, which leads naturally to their coarsening into a single final cavity through hydraulic exchanges. With extensive numerical simulations and mean-field theory we predict that such coarsening dynamics follows a robust scaling law, that barely depends on concentration heterogeneities between lumens. On the contrary, active osmotic pumping largely influences the collective dynamics by favoring lumen coalescence and by biasing the position of the final cavity. Our theoretical work highlights the essential role of hydraulic and osmotic flows in morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutics that promote oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination are needed to restore neurological function in demyelinating diseases. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an essential lipid metabolite that signals through five G-protein coupled receptors. S1P receptor agonists such as Fingolimod are valuable immunosuppressants used to treat multiple sclerosis, and promote oligodendrocyte survival. However, the role for endogenous S1P, synthesized by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), in oligodendrocyte survival and myelination has not been established. This study investigated the requirement for SphK2 in oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination using the cuprizone mouse model of acute demyelination, followed by spontaneous remyelination. Oligodendrocyte density did not differ between untreated wild- type (WT) and SphK2 knockout (SphK2-/-) mice. However, cuprizone treatment caused significantly greater loss of mature oligodendrocytes in SphK2-/- compared to WT mice. Following cuprizone withdrawal, spontaneous remyelination occurred in WT but not SphK2-/- mice, even though progenitor and mature oligodendrocyte density increased in both genotypes. Levels of cytotoxic sphingosine and ceramide were higher in the corpus callosum of SphK2-/- mice, and in contrast to WT mice, did not decline following cuprizone withdrawal in SphK2-/- mice. We also observed a significant reduction in myelin thickness with ageing in SphK2-/- compared to WT mice. These results provide the first evidence that SphK2, the dominant enzyme catalysing S1P synthesis in the adult brain, is essential for remyelination following a demyelinating insult and myelin maintenance with ageing. We propose that persistently high levels of sphingosine and ceramide, a direct consequence of SphK2 deficiency, may block remyelination.\n\nTable of Contents Image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/431183v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e01edcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9fdf6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6012org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3513b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Main PointsO_LIThe lipid kinase sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) is essential for remyelination following a demyelinating insult (cuprizone).\nC_LIO_LISphK2 protects against cuprizone-mediated oligodendrocyte loss.\nC_LIO_LISphK2 deficiency leads to thinner myelin with ageing.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The ability to discriminate between different ionic species, termed ion selectivity, is a key feature of ion channels and forms the basis for their physiological function. Members of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) superfamily of trimeric ion channels are typically sodium selective, but to a surprisingly variable degree. While acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are weakly sodium selective (sodium:potassium around 10:1), ENaCs show a remarkably high preference for sodium over potassium (>500:1). The most obvious explanation for this discrepancy may be expected to originate from differences in the pore-lining second transmembrane segment (M2). However, these show a relatively high degree of sequence conservation between ASICs and ENaCs and previous functional and structural studies could not unequivocally establish that differences in M2 alone can account for the disparate degrees of ion selectivity. By contrast, surprisingly little is known about the contributions of the first transmembrane segment (M1) and the preceding pre-M1 region. In this study, we use conventional and non-canonical amino acid-based mutagenesis in combination with a variety of electrophysiological approaches to show that the pre-M1 and M1 regions of mASIC1a channels are major determinants of ion selectivity. Mutational investigations of the corresponding regions in hENaC show that they contribute less to ion selectivity, despite affecting ion conductance. In conclusion, our work supports the notion that the remarkably different degrees of sodium selectivity in ASICs and ENaCs are achieved through different mechanisms. The results further highlight how M1 and pre-M1 are likely to differentially affect pore structure in these related channels.",

    "abstract": "The biomedical literature has consistently highlighted that long-term elevation of glucocorticoids might impair immune functions. In wild animals, patterns are less clear. Here, we re-explored the stress-immunity relationship considering the potential effects of behavioural profiles. Thirteen captive roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) were monitored over an eight-week period encompassing two capture events. We assessed how changes in baseline faecal cortisol metabolite (FCM) concentrations following a standardised capture protocol and vaccination affected changes in thirteen immune parameters of the innate and adaptive immunity, and whether behavioural profiles were linked to changes in baseline FCM levels and immune parameters. We found that individuals showing an increase in baseline FCM levels also exhibited an increase in immunity and were characterised by more reactive behavioural profiles (low activity levels, docility to manipulation and neophilia). Our results suggest that immunity of large mammals may be influenced by glucocorticoids, but also behavioural profiles, as it is predicted by the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. Our results highlight the need to consider co-variations between behaviour, immunity and glucocorticoids in order to improve our understanding of the among-individual variability in the stress-immunity relationships observed in wildlife, as they may be underpinned by different life-history strategies.",

We find that PcrA binds tightly to a transcription elongation complex in a manner dependent on protein:protein interaction with the conserved PcrA C-terminal Tudor domain. The helicase binds predominantly to two positions on the surface of RNAP. The PcrA C-terminal domain engages a conserved region in a lineage-specific insert within the {beta} subunit which we identify as a helicase interaction motif present in many other PcrA partner proteins, including the nucleotide excision repair factor UvrB. The catalytic core of the helicase binds near the RNA and DNA exit channels and blocking PcrA activity in vivo leads to the accumulation of R-loops. We propose a role for PcrA as an R-loop suppression factor that helps to minimise conflicts between transcription and other processes on DNA including replication.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe changing landscape of genomics research and clinical practice has created a need for computational pipelines capable of efficiently orchestrating complex analysis stages while handling large volumes of data across heterogeneous computational environments. Workflow Management Systems (WfMSs) are the software components employed to fill this gap.\n\nResultsThis work provides an approach and systematic evaluation of key features of popular bioinformatics WfMSs in use today: Nextflow, CWL, and WDL and some of their executors, along with Swift/T, a workflow manager commonly used in high-scale physics applications. We employed two use cases: a variant-calling genomic pipeline and a scalability-testing framework, where both were run locally, on an HPC cluster, and in the cloud. This allowed for evaluation of those four WfMSs in terms of language expressiveness, modularity, scalability, robustness, reproducibility, interoperability, ease of development, along with adoption and usage in research labs and healthcare settings. This article is trying to answer, \"which WfMS should be chosen for a given bioinformatics application regardless of analysis type?\".\n\nConclusionsThe choice of a given WfMS is a function of both its intrinsic language and engine features. Within bioinformatics, where analysts are a mix of dry and wet lab scientists, the choice is also governed by collaborations and adoption within large consortia and technical support provided by the WfMS team/community. As the community and its needs continue to evolve along with computational infrastructure, WfMSs will also evolve, especially those with permissive licenses that allow commercial use. In much the same way as the dataflow paradigm and containerization are now well understood to be very useful in bioinformatics applications, we will continue to see innovations of tools and utilities for other purposes, like big data technologies, interoperability, and provenance.",

    "abstract": "Pain perception is decreased by shifting attentional focus away from a threatening event. This attentional analgesia engages parallel descending control pathways from anterior cingulate (ACC) to locus coeruleus, and ACC to periaqueductal grey (PAG) - rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), indicating possible roles for noradrenergic or opioidergic neuromodulators. To determine which pathway modulates nociceptive activity in humans we used simultaneous whole brain-spinal cord pharmacological-fMRI (N=39) across three sessions. Noxious thermal forearm stimulation generated somatotopic-activation of dorsal horn (DH, C6 segment) whose activity mirrored attentional pain modulation. Activity in an adjacent cluster reported the interaction between task and noxious stimulus. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that ACC recruits PAG and RVM to modulate spinal cord activity. Blocking endogenous opioids with Naltrexone impairs attentional analgesia and disrupts RVM-DH and ACC-PAG connectivity. Noradrenergic augmentation with Reboxetine did not alter attentional analgesia. Cognitive pain modulation is mediated by opioidergic ACC-PAG-RVM descending control which supresses spinal nociceptive activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome size is implicated in form, function, and ecological success of a species. Two principally different mechanisms are proposed as major drivers of eukaryotic genome evolution and diversity: Polyploidy (i.e., whole genome duplication: WGD) or smaller duplication events and bursts in the activity of repetitive elements (RE). Here, we generated de novo genome assemblies of 17 caddisflies covering all major lineages of Trichoptera. Using these and previously sequenced genomes, we use caddisflies as a model for understanding genome size evolution in diverse insect lineages.\n\nResultsWe detect a ~14-fold variation in genome size across the order Trichoptera. We find strong evidence that repetitive element (RE) expansions, particularly those of transposable elements (TEs), are important drivers of large caddisfly genome sizes. Using an innovative method to examine TEs associated with universal single copy orthologs (i.e., BUSCO genes), we find that TE expansions have a major impact on protein-coding gene regions, with TE-gene associations showing a linear relationship with increasing genome size. Intriguingly, we find that expanded genomes preferentially evolved in caddisfly clades with a higher ecological diversity (i.e., various feeding modes, diversification in variable, less stable environments).\n\nConclusionOur findings provide a platform to test hypotheses about the potential evolutionary roles of TE activity and TE-gene associations, particularly in groups with high species, ecological, and functional diversities.",

    "abstract": "The spiking activity of populations of cortical neurons is well described by a small number of population-wide covariance patterns, the \"latent dynamics\". These latent dynamics are largely driven by the same correlated synaptic currents across the circuit that determine the generation of local field potentials (LFP). Yet, the relationship between latent dynamics and LFPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterised this relationship for three different regions of primate sensorimotor cortex during reaching. The correlation between latent dynamics and LFPs was frequency-dependent and varied across regions. However, for any given region, this relationship remained stable across behaviour: in each of primary motor and premotor cortices, the LFP-latent dynamics correlation profile was remarkably similar between movement planning and execution. These robust associations between LFPs and neural population latent dynamics help bridge the wealth of studies reporting neural correlates of behaviour using either type of recordings.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that sensorimotor adaptation involves at least two processes (i.e., fast and slow) that differ in retention and error sensitivity. Previous work has shown that repeated exposure to an abrupt force field perturbation results in greater error sensitivity for both the fast and slow processes. While this implies that the faster relearning is associated with increased error sensitivity, it remains unclear what aspects of prior experience modulate error sensitivity. In the present study, we manipulated the initial training using different perturbation schedules, thought to differentially affect fast and slow learning processes based on error magnitude, and then observed what effect prior learning had on subsequent adaptation. During initial training of a visuomotor rotation task, we exposed three groups of participants to either an abrupt, a gradual, or a random perturbation schedule. During a testing session, all three groups were subsequently exposed to an abrupt perturbation schedule. Comparing the two sessions of the control group who experienced repetition of the same perturbation, we found an increased error sensitivity for both processes. We found that the error sensitivity was increased for both the fast and slow processes, with no reliable changes in the retention, for both the gradual and structural learning groups when compared to the first session of the control group. We discuss the findings in the context of how fast and slow learning processes respond to a history of errors.\n\nNew & NoteworthyWe investigated what aspects of prior experience modulate error sensitivity, within the framework of a two-state model of short-term sensorimotor adaptation. We manipulated initial training on a visuomotor adaptation reaching task using specific perturbation schedules that are thought to differentially affect fast and slow learning processes, and we tested what effect these had on subsequent adaptation. We found that sensitivity to adaptation error was similarly modulated by abrupt, gradual, and random perturbation schedules.",

    "abstract": "Articular cartilage (AC) is essential for body movement, but is highly susceptible to degenerative diseases and has poor self-repair capacity. To improve current subpar regenerative treatment, developmental mechanisms of AC should be clarified and, specifically, how postnatal multi-zone organization is acquired. Primary cilia are cell surface organelles crucial for mammalian tissue morphogenesis and while the importance of chondrocyte primary cilia is well appreciated their specific roles in postnatal AC morphogenesis remain unclear. To explore these mechanisms, we used a murine conditional loss-of-function approach (Ift88-flox) targeting joint-lineage progenitors (Gdf5Cre) and monitored postnatal knee AC development. Joint formation and growth up to juvenile stages were largely unaffected, however mature AC (aged 2 months) exhibited disorganized extracellular matrix, decreased aggrecan and collagen II due to reduced gene expression (not increased catabolism), and marked reduction of AC modulus by 30-50%. In addition, we discovered the surprising findings that tidemark patterning was severely disrupted and accompanied alterations in hedgehog signaling that were also dependent on regional load-bearing functions of AC. Interestingly, Prg4 expression was also increased in those loaded sites. Together, our data provide evidence that primary cilia orchestrate postnatal AC morphogenesis, dictating tidemark topography, zonal matrix composition and mechanical load responses.",

In part 3, we describe those experimental conditions under which we ourselves have failed to observe forward entrainment, and provide new data on use of complex envelope patterns as entraining stimuli, show data on intersubject variability, and provide new findings on psychometric functions that characterize the strength of forward entrainment at different SNRs.

    "abstract": "Fasting requires tight coordination between the metabolism and transcriptional output of hepatocytes to maintain systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis. Genetically-defined deficits in hepatic fatty acid oxidation result in dramatic fasting-induced hepatocyte lipid accumulation and induction of genes for oxidative metabolism, thereby providing a mouse model to interrogate the mechanisms by which the liver senses and transcriptionally responds to fluctuations in lipid levels. While fatty acid oxidation is required for a rise in acetyl-CoA and subsequent lysine acetylation following a fast, changes in histone acetylation (total, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac) associated with transcription do not require fatty acid oxidation. Instead, excess fatty acids prompt induction of lipid catabolic genes largely via ligand-activated Ppar. We observe that active enhancers in fasting mice are enriched for Ppar binding motifs, and that inhibition of hepatic fatty acid oxidation results in elevated enhancer priming and acetylation proximal to Ppar binding sites within regulatory elements largely associated with genes in lipid metabolism. Also, a greater number of Ppar-associated H3K27ac signal changes occur at active enhancers compared to promoters, suggesting a genomic mechanism for Ppar to tune target gene expression levels. Overall, these data demonstrate the requirement for Ppar activation in maintaining transcriptionally permissive hepatic genomic architecture particularly when fatty acid oxidation is limiting.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIFasting-induced transcription and histone acetylation are largely independent of acetyl-CoA concentration.\nC_LIO_LIDeficits in fatty acid oxidation prompt epigenetic changes and Ppar-sensitive transcription.\nC_LIO_LIFasting prompts enhancer priming and acetylation proximal to Ppar binding sites independent of Ppar.\nC_LIO_LIPatterns of Ppar target genes can be distinguished by epigenetic marks at promoters and enhancers.\nC_LI",

CFTR-W1282X truncated protein retains partial function, so increasing its levels by inhibiting NMD of its mRNA will likely be beneficial. Because NMD regulates the normal expression of many genes, gene-specific stabilization of CFTR-W1282X mRNA expression is more desirable than general NMD inhibition. Synthetic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to prevent binding of exon junction complexes (EJC) downstream of premature termination codons (PTCs) attenuate NMD in a gene-specific manner. We developed a cocktail of three ASOs that specifically increases the expression of CFTR W1282X mRNA and CFTR protein in ASO-transfected human bronchial epithelial cells. This treatment increased the CFTR-mediated chloride current. These results set the stage for clinical development of an allele-specific therapy for CF caused by the W1282X mutation.",

Although various biological membranes have shown to alter the structure and aggregation propensity of SN, a thorough understanding of the molecular and mechanical mechanism of amyloidogenesis in membranes remains unanswered. Herein, we examined the structural changes, binding properties, and amyloidogenicity of three variations of SN mutants under two types of liposomes, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and presynaptic vesicle mimetic (Mimic) membranes. While neutrally charged DOPC membranes elicited marginal changes in the structure and amyloid fibrillation of SNs, negatively charged Mimic membranes induced dramatic helical folding and biphasic amyloid generation. At low concentration of Mimic membranes, the amyloid fibrillation of SNs was promoted in a dose-dependent manner. However, further increases in the concentration constrained the fibrillation process. These results suggest the dual effect of Mimic membranes on regulating the amyloidogenesis of SN, which is rationalized by the amyloidogenic structure of SN and condensation-dilution of local SN concentration. Finally, we propose physicochemical properties of SN and membrane surfaces, and their propensity to drive electrostatic interactions as decisive factors of amyloidogenesis.",

All the variants were located in the EGFR mutation hotspot (exons 18-21). The sensitivity of these variants to afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, and osimertinib was systematically studied by determining their enrichment in massively parallel cytotoxicity assays using an endogenous EGFR-depleted cell line, PC9.\n\nResultsA total of 3,914 and 70,475 variants were detected in the constructed EGFR Substitution-Deletion (Sub-Del) and exon 20 Insertion (Ins) libraries, accounting for 99.3% and 55.8% of the designed variants, respectively.

While there is substantial evidence indicating loss of E-cadherin in the lung epithelium of patients with COPD, it is not known if this is causal to the disease. We investigated if loss of E-cadherin can result in lung disease using in both in vitro models of primary, differentiated human cells and in mouse models. Using a cell type-specific promoter using Cre/LoxP mice system to knock-out E- cadherin in ciliated and alveolar epithelial cell (Type 1 and Type 2) populations in adult mouse models, we determined that loss of E-cadherin caused airspace enlargement, as well as increased airway hyperresponsiveness indicating that it does have a causative role in causing COPD. Strategies to upregulate CDH1 (encodes for E-cadherin) in CHBEs and cigarette-smoke injured NHBEs can rescue the dysfunctional epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are large protein assemblies that facilitate transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope (NE) [1, 2]. How thousands of NPCs rapidly assemble after open mitosis to form a functional NE is not known. Recruitment of the Nup107-160 outer ring scaffold to chromatin initiates NPC assembly. The Nup53/93 complex bridges the outer ring to the central channel to form a functional pore [3-6]. Nup53 interacts with the conserved transmembrane nucleoporin Ndc1; however, how Ndc1 contributes to post-mitotic NPC assembly is unclear [7-9]. Here, we use C. elegans embryos to show that the timely formation of a functional NE after mitosis depends on Ndc1. Endogenously tagged Ndc1 is recruited early to the reforming NE and is highly mobile in the nuclear rim. 3D analysis of post-mitotic NE formation revealed a decreased NPC density in NEs of ndc1 deleted embryos - continuous nuclear membranes contained few holes where assembling NPCs are normally located. Nup160 is highly mobile in NEs depleted of Ndc1 and outer ring scaffold components are less enriched at the rim. When both ndc1 and nup53 are absent, nuclear assembly fails. Together, these data show that Ndc1 dynamically associates with the NE and promotes stable association of the outer ring scaffold in the NE to facilitate NPC assembly after open mitosis. Furthermore, Ndc1 and Nup53 function in parallel to drive nuclear assembly. We propose that Ndc1 is a dynamic membrane adaptor that helps recruit and promote the self-assembly of the nuclear pore scaffold to drive post-mitotic NPC assembly.",

    "abstract": "Imprinting is a critical part of normal embryonic development in mammals, controlled by defined parent-of-origin (PofO) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) known as imprinting control regions. As we and others have shown, direct nanopore sequencing of DNA provides a mean to detect allelic methylation and to overcome the drawbacks of methylation array and short-read technologies. Here we leverage publicly-available nanopore sequence data for 12 standard B-lymphocyte cell lines to present the first genome-wide mapping of imprinted intervals in humans using this technology. We were able to phase 95% of the human methylome and detect 94% of the well-characterized imprinted DMRs. In addition, we found 28 novel imprinted DMRs (12 germline and 16 somatic), which we confirmed using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. Analysis of WGBS data in mus musculus, rhesus macaque, and chimpanzee suggested that 12 of these are conserved. We also detected subtle parental methylation bias spanning several kilobases at seven known imprinted clusters. These results expand the current state of knowledge of imprinting, with potential applications in the clinic. We have also demonstrated that nanopore long reads, can reveal imprinting using only parent-offspring trios, as opposed to the large multi - generational pedigrees that have previously been required.",

    "abstract": "RNA detection is crucial for biological research and clinical diagnosis. The current methods include both direct and amplification-based RNA detection. These methods require complicated procedures, suffering from low sensitivity, slow turnaround, and amplification bias. The CRISPR/Cas13a system is a direct RNA detection method via target RNA induced collateral cleavage activity. However, to detect low concentration RNA with CRISPR/Cas13a, target amplification is always required. Herein, we optimize the components of the CRISPR/Cas13a assay to enhance the sensitivity of viral RNA detection which improve the detection limit from 1 pM up to 100 fM. In addition, the integration of CRISPR/Cas13a biosensing and single molecule super resolution imaging is a novel strategy for direct and amplification-free RNA detection. After surface modification, fluorescent RNA reporters are immobilized on the glass coverslip surface and fluorescent signals are captured by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), shifting the measurement from spectroscopy to imaging. We quantify the fluorescence signal intensity before and after collateral cleavage of the CRISPR system when viral RNA is present and achieve a detection limit of 10 fM. Therefore, we provide a novel TIRFM-based system to visualize the CRISPR trans-cleavage for direct and robust RNA detection.",

    "abstract": "Spider venom GDPD-like phospholipases D (SicTox) have been identified to be one of the major toxins in recluse spider venom. They are divided into two major clades: the  clade and the {beta} clade. Most  clade toxins present high activity against lipids with choline head groups such as sphingomyelin, while activities in {beta} clade toxins vary and include preference for substrates containing ethanolamine headgroups (Sicarius terrosus, St_{beta}IB1). A structural comparison of available PLDs structures reveals a conserved aromatic cage in the  clade. To test the potential influence of the aromatic cage on membrane-lipid specificity we performed molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of the binding of several PLDs onto lipid bilayers containing choline headgroups; two SicTox from the  clade, Loxosceles intermedia IA1 (Li_IA) and Loxosceles laeta III1 (Ll_III1), and one from the {beta} clade, St_{beta}IB1. The simulation results reveal that the aromatic cage captures a choline-headgroup and suggest that the cage plays a major role in lipid specificity. We also simulated an engineered St_{beta}IB1, where we introduced the aromatic cage, and this led to binding with choline-containing lipids. Moreover, a multiple sequence alignment revealed the conservation of the aromatic cage among the  clade PLDs. Here, we confirmed the membrane binding site of  and {beta} clade PLDs on choline and ethanolamine-containing bilayers, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggest a major role in choline lipid recognition of the aromatic cage of the  clade PLDs. The MD simulation results are supported by in vitro liposome binding assay experiments.",

Histological staining is often used for annotation or segmentation of FTUs, but chemical stains can introduce artefacts through experimental factors that influence analysis. Secondly, many molecular -omics techniques are incompatible with common histological stains. To enable FTU segmentation and annotation in human kidney without the need for histological staining, we detail here the use of widefield autofluorescence (AF) microscopy as a simple, label-free modality that provides detailed renal morphology comparable to periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stained tissue in both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh frozen samples and with no tissue processing beyond sectioning. We demonstrate automated deep learning-based glomerular unit recognition and segmentation on PAS and AF images of the same tissue section from 9 fresh frozen samples and 9 FFPE samples. All training comparisons were carried out using registered AF microscopy and PAS stained whole slide images originating from the same section, and the recognition models were built with the exact same training and test examples. Measures of recognition performance, such as the Dice-Sorensen coefficient, the true positive rate, and the positive predictive value differed less than 2% between standard PAS and AF microscopy for both preservation methods. These results demonstrate that AF is a potentially powerful tool to study human kidney tissue, that it can serve as a label-free source for automated and manual annotation of tissue structures.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between adolescent ethanol uses and its impacts throughout life is not conclusive. Thus, we evaluated if the low and high consumption of ethanol during the postpuberty period interferes with reproduction in adulthood, the ethanol-naive offspring development and if there are dose-related effects. Females and males rats were divided into three groups: low drinker (L), with UChA rats fed with ethanol ad libitum drinking < 1.9 g / kg / day, high drinker (H), with UChB rats fed with ethanol ad libitum drinking from 2 to 5 g / kg / day, and control (C), with rats without access to ethanol. The L and H groups were exposed to ethanol 10% (v/ v) from 65 to 80 days, with withdrawal after this period. The study was conducted in two phases. The retrospective analysis (1st phase) verified the consumption of ethanol between sexes, the litter size, and the sex ratio of offspring. The gestational and reproductive parameters of parents and the development of pups were analyzed in the 2nd phase. We observed a higher consumption of ethanol in females and a reduced litter size in both drinkers groups. Body weight gain and gestational feed consumption were lower in L and H. The offsprings body weight was also lower associated with alteration in landmarks of physical development. The high postpubertal ethanol use accents the impacts on consumers and offspring. The paternal and maternal reproductive organs weight was altered in group H, with an increase in morphologically abnormal sperm. We conclude that low and high post-pubertal alcohol consumption impairs reproductive parameters, even after withdrawal with long-term effects. Ethanol-naive offspring are also harmed, with effects associated with the dose of ethanol.",

    "abstract": "Bypassing natures evolutionary trajectory, de novo protein generation--defined as creating artificial protein sequences from scratch--could enable breakthrough solutions for biomedical and environmental challenges. Viewing amino acid sequences as a language, we demonstrate that a deep learning-based language model can generate functional artificial protein sequences across families, akin to generating grammatically and semantically correct natural language sentences on diverse topics. Our protein language model is trained by simply learning to predict the next amino acid for over 280 million protein sequences from thousands of protein families, without biophysical or coevolutionary modeling. We experimentally evaluate model-generated artificial proteins on five distinct antibacterial lysozyme families. Artificial proteins show similar activities and catalytic efficiencies as representative natural lysozymes, including hen egg white lysozyme, while reaching as low as 44% identity to any known naturally-evolved protein. The X-ray crystal structure of an enzymatically active artificial protein recapitulates the conserved fold and positioning of active site residues found in natural proteins. We demonstrate our language models ability to be adapted to different protein families by accurately predicting the functionality of artificial chorismate mutase and malate dehydrogenase proteins. These results indicate that neural language models successfully perform de novo protein generation across protein families and may prove to be a tool to shortcut evolution.",

    "abstract": "Selectivity for direction of motion is a key feature of primary visual cortical neurons. Visual experience is required for direction selectivity in carnivore and primate visual cortex, but the circuit mechanisms of its formation remain incompletely understood. Here we examined how developing lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons may contribute to cortical direction selectivity. Using in vivo electrophysiology techniques, we examined LGN receptive field properties of visually naive female ferrets before and after exposure to 6 hours of motion stimuli in order to assess the effect of acute visual experience on LGN cell development. We found that acute experience with motion stimuli did not significantly affect the weak orientation or direction selectivity of LGN neurons. In addition, we found that neither latency nor sustainedness or transience of LGN neurons significantly changed with acute experience. These results suggest that the direction selectivity that emerges in cortex after acute experience is computed in cortex and cannot be explained by changes in LGN cells.\n\nSignificance StatementThe development of typical neural circuitry requires experience-independent and experience-dependent factors. In the visual cortex of carnivores and primates, selectivity for motion arises as a result of experience, but we do not understand whether the major brain area that sits between the retina and the visual cortex - the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus - also participates. Here we found that lateral geniculate neurons do not exhibit changes as a result of several hours of visual experience with moving stimuli, at a time when visual cortical neurons undergo a rapid change. We conclude that lateral geniculate neurons do not participate in this plasticity, and that changes in cortex are likely responsible for the development of direction selectivity in carnivores and primates.",

Further, the radical pairs in cryptochrome also can explain magnetoreception in animals. Based on a simple radical pair mechanism model of the animal magnetic compass, we show that both magnetic fields and lithium can influence the spin dynamics of the naturally occurring radical pairs and hence modulate the circadian clocks rhythms. Using a simple chemical oscillator model for the circadian clock, we show that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the chemical oscillator model, which translates into a change in the circadian period. Our model can reproduce the results of two independent experiments, magnetic fields and lithium effects on the circadian clock. Our model predicts that stronger magnetic fields would shorten the clocks period. We also predict that lithium influences the clock in an isotope-dependent manner. Furthermore, our model also predicts that magnetic fields and hyperfine interactions modulate oxidative stress. The findings of this work suggest that quantum nature and entanglement of radical pairs might play roles in the brain, as another piece of evidence in addition to recent results on xenon anesthesia and lithium effects on hyperactivity.",

    "abstract": "Central pacemaker neurons regulate circadian rhythms and undergo diurnal variation in electrical activity in mammals and flies. In mammals, circadian variation in the intracellular chloride concentration of pacemaker neurons has been proposed to influence the response to GABAergic neurotransmission through GABAA receptor chloride channels. However, results have been contradictory, and a recent study demonstrated circadian variation in pacemaker neuron chloride without an effect on GABA response. Therefore, whether and how intracellular chloride regulates circadian rhythms remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate a signaling role for intracellular chloride in the Drosophila ventral lateral (LNv) pacemaker neurons. In control flies, intracellular chloride increases in LNv neurons over the course of the morning. Chloride transport through the sodium-potassium-2-chloride (NKCC) and potassium-chloride (KCC) cotransporters is a major determinant of intracellular chloride concentrations. Drosophila melanogaster with loss-of-function mutations in the NKCC encoded by Ncc69 have abnormally low intracellular chloride six hours after lights on, and a lengthened circadian period. Loss of kcc, which is expected to increase intracellular chloride, suppresses the long-period phenotype of Ncc69 mutant flies. Activation of a chloride-inhibited kinase cascade, consisting of the WNK (With No Lysine (K)) kinase and its downstream substrate, Fray, is necessary and sufficient to prolong period length. Fray activation of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Irk1, is also required for the long-period phenotype. These results indicate that the NKCC-dependent rise in intracellular chloride in Drosophila LNv pacemaker neurons restrains WNK-Fray signaling and overactivation of an inwardly rectifying potassium channel to maintain normal circadian period length.",

    "abstract": "Lateralization is a hallmark of somatosensory processing in the mammalian brain. However, in addition to their contralateral representation, unilateral tactile stimuli also modulate neuronal activity in somatosensory cortices of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The cellular organization and functional role of these ipsilateral stimulus responses in awake somatosensory cortices, especially regarding stimulus coding, are unknown. Here, we targeted silicon probe recordings to the vibrissa region of primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed mice of either sex while delivering ipsilateral and contralateral whisker stimuli. Ipsilateral stimuli drove larger and more reliable responses in S2 than in S1, and activated a larger fraction of stimulus-responsive neurons. Ipsilateral stimulus-responsive neurons were rare in layer 4 of S1, but were located in equal proportion across all layers in S2. Linear classifier analyses further revealed that decoding of the ipsilateral stimulus was more accurate in S2 than S1, while S1 decoded contralateral stimuli most accurately. These results reveal substantial encoding of ipsilateral stimuli in S1 and especially S2, consistent with the hypothesis that higher cortical areas may integrate tactile inputs across larger portions of space, spanning both sides of the body.\n\nS1ignificance StatementTactile information obtained by one side of the body is represented in the activity of neurons of the opposite brain hemisphere. However unilateral tactile stimulation also modulates neuronal activity in the other, or ipsilateral, brain hemisphere. This ipsilateral activity may play an important role in the representation and processing of tactile information, in particular when the sense of touch involves both sides of the body. Our work in the whisker system of awake mice reveals that neocortical ipsilateral activity, in particular that of deep layer excitatory neurons of secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), contains information about the presence and the velocity of unilateral tactile stimuli, which supports a key role for S2 in integrating tactile information across both body sides.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the principal lipid carrier in the CNS and mainly expressed by astrocytes. The three different APOE alleles (E2, E3, and E4) impose differential risk to Alzheimers disease (AD); E2 is protective, E3 is defined as average risk, while E4 is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. Despite recent advances, the fundamental role of different APOE alleles in brain homeostasis is still poorly understood. To uncover the functional role of APOE in human astrocytes, we differentiated human APOE-isogenic iPSCs (E4, E3, E2 and APOE-knockout (KO)) to functional astrocytes (hereafter \"iAstrocytes\"), with a resting, non-proliferating phenotype. Functional assays indicated that polymorphisms in APOE (APOE4>E3>E2=KO) reduced iAstrocyte metabolic and clearance functions including glutamate uptake and receptor-mediated uptake of {beta}-amyloid aggregates. We performed unlabelled mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of iAstrocytes at baseline and after activation with interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) showing a reduction of cholesterol and lipid metabolic and biosynthetic pathways, and an increase of immunoregulatory pathways at baseline (E4>E3>E2). Cholesterol efflux and biosynthesis were reduced in E4 iAstrocytes, and subcellular localization of cholesterol in lysosomes was increased. In APOE-KO iAstrocytes, APOE-independent mechanisms showed to be proficient in mediating cholesterol biosynthesis and efflux. Proteomic analysis of IL-1{beta}-treated iAstrocytes showed an increase of cholesterol/lipid metabolism and biosynthesis as well as inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, cholesterol efflux, which was reduced in APOE4 iAstrocytes at baseline, was alleviated in activated E4 iAstrocytes. Inflammatory cytokine release was exacerbated upon IL-1{beta} treatment in E4 iAstrocytes (E4>E3>E2>KO), in line with the proteomic data. Taken together, we show that APOE plays a major role in several physiological and metabolic processes in human astrocytes with APOE4 pushing iAstrocytes to a disease-relevant phenotype, causing dysregulated cholesterol/lipid homeostasis, increased inflammatory signalling and reduced {beta}-amyloid uptake while APOE2 iAstrocytes show opposing effects.\n\nOur study provides a new reference for AD-relevant proteomic and metabolic changes, mediated by the three main APOE isoforms in human astrocytes.",

The population density, species and virome of mosquitoes varies according to geography and climate. To investigate the dynamic changes in the species composition and diversity of mosquitoes and their viromes in Wuhan, China, a total of 2,345 adult mosquitoes collected from different habitats including an urban residential area, two hospitals, a scenic area, and a pig farm in a rural region from April to October 2020 were subjected to morphological identification, RT-qPCR and metagenomic sequencing. The results indicated that the dominant presence of Culex mosquitoes was observed in both urban regions (90.32%, 1538/1703) and the pig farm (54.98%, 353/642). Viromes of Culex showed dynamic changes during the collection time. Several viruses, such as Culex flavivirus, Alphamesonivirus 1, Hubei mosquito virus 2 and Hubei mosquito virus 4, had seasonal changes and unimodal increases or declines. Other viruses, such as Wuhan mosquito virus 6, Hubei virga-like virus 2 and Zhejiang mosquito virus 3, were stable in all collected Culex and should be potential members of \"core viromes\". This study improves the understanding of the dynamic composition of mosquitoes and the viromes they carry and provides useful information for informing mosquito control and mosquito-borne disease prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "The processing of mRNA is essential for the maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis. However, the precise regulation of this process in mammalian cells, remains largely unknown. Here we have found that LENG8 represents the mammalian orthologue of the yeast mRNA processing factor Thp3 and Sac3. We go on to demonstrate that LENG8 binds to mRNAs, associates with components of mRNA processing machinery (the TREX complex) and contributes to mRNA nuclear export to the cytoplasm. Loss of LENG8, leads to aberrant accumulation of poly (A)+ RNA in the nucleus, in both Hela cells and murine fibroblasts. Furthermore, the precipitation of LENG8, is associated with an enrichment of both mRNAs and lncRNAs, and approximately half of these are also bound by the TREX component, THOC1. However, LENG8 preferentially binds mRNAs encoding for mitochondrial proteins and depletion of this processing factor, causes a dramatic breakdown in mitochondrial ultrastructure and a reduction in mitochondrial respiratory activity. Conditional deletion of Leng8 in mouse adipose tissues lead to a decreased body weight, and increased adipose thermogenesis. Our work has found an evolutionarily conserved mRNA processing factor that can control mitochondrial activity.",

    "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) provides the intrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with millions of neurons and diverse neuronal subtypes and glial cells. The ENS regulates essential gut functions such as motility, nutrient uptake, and immune response, but basic information about the genes that control ENS neuronal specification and differentiation remains largely unknown. Deficits in ENS neuron numbers and composition cause gut dysfunction with debilitating GI symptoms, and are associated with e.g. Hirschsprung disease, inflammatory gut diseases, autism spectrum disorder, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsons disease. The genetic basis of most of these ENS disorders remains unknown. Recent transcriptomic analyses have identified many candidate genes for regulating ENS neurogenesis. However, functional evaluation of these candidate genes significantly lags because experimental testing of their role in ENS neurogenesis is time-consuming and expensive. Here, we have developed a rapid, scalable F0 CRISPR genome editing screen in zebrafish to functionally determine which candidate genes control neuronal development in the ENS. Proof-of-concept experiments targeting the known ENS regulators sox10 and ret phenocopy stable mutants with high efficiency and precision showing that our approach is reliable to identify regulators ENS neurogenesis using F0 guide RNA-injected larvae (F0 crispants). We then evaluate the role of 10 transcription factor genes for regulating ENS neurogenesis and function. Pools of guide RNAs targeting 2-3 candidate genes are co-injected with Cas9 protein into one-cell stage phox2bb:GFP transgenic zebrafish embryos to directly assess qualitative change in ENS neuron numbers compared to controls in 6-day old F0 crispants. Target genes from crispant pools exhibiting reduced ENS neuronal numbers were then tested individually to identify the responsible gene(s). We identify five transcription factors that show a reduction in ENS neurons indicating an influence on enteric progenitor cell differentiation into ENS neurons. Adding a simple and efficient test to further assess crispant gut motility, we find that loss-of-function of two of the transcription factor genes reduced intestinal transit of fluorescently labeled food through the gut. In summary, our novel, multistep, yet straight-forward CRISPR screening approach in zebrafish enables testing the genetic basis of ENS developmental and disease gene functions that will facilitate high-throughput evaluation of the manifold candidate genes emerging from transcriptomic, genome-wide association or other ENS-omics studies. Such in vivo ENS crispant screens will contribute to a better understanding of ENS neuronal development regulation in vertebrates and what goes awry in ENS disorders.",

    "abstract": "Establishment of a healthy ovarian reserve is contingent upon numerous regulatory pathways during embryogenesis. Previously, mice lacking TBP-associated factor 4b (Taf4b) were shown to exhibit a diminished ovarian reserve. However, potential oocyte-intrinsic functions of TAF4b have not been examined. Here we use a combination of gene expression profiling and chromatin mapping to characterize the TAF4b gene regulatory network in mouse oocytes. We find that Taf4b-deficient oocytes display inappropriate expression of meiotic, chromatin, and X-linked genes, and unexpectedly we found a connection with Turner Syndrome pathways. Using Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), we observed TAF4b enrichment at genes involved in meiosis and DNA repair, some of which are differentially expressed in Taf4b-deficient oocytes. Interestingly, TAF4b target genes were enriched for Sp/KLF family motifs rather than TATA-box, suggesting an alternate mode of promoter interaction. Together, our data connects several gene regulatory nodes that contribute to the ovarian reserve.",

Moreover, infections may cause sub-lethal fitness effects even in species resistant or tolerant to disease. The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is a generalist pathogen which has caused amphibian population declines worldwide. In many species, Bd infection causes the disease chytridiomycosis, often leading to high mortality. We investigated how geographical origin affects tolerance to Bd by exposing newly metamorphosed individuals of two North European amphibians (moor frog Rana arvalis, common toad Bufo bufo) from two latitudinal regions to two different BdGPL strains. Bd exposure strongly lowered survival in B. bufo, and in both species survival was lower in the northern region, this difference being much stronger in B. bufo. Northern individuals were smaller in both species, and the survival difference between the regions was size-mediated with smaller individuals being more sensitive to Bd. In both species, Bd exposure led to sub-lethal effects in terms of reduced growth suggesting that even individuals surviving the infection may have reduced fitness mediated by smaller body size. Bd strain affected size-dependent mortality differently in the two regions. We discuss the possible mechanisms how body size and geographical origin can contribute to the present results.",

    "abstract": "Enhanced soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and organic phosphorus (P) cycling may help sustain plant productivity under elevated CO2 (eCO2) and P-limiting conditions. P-acquisition by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and their impacts on SOM decomposition may become even more relevant in these conditions. Yet, experimental evidence of the interactive effect of AM fungi and P availability influencing altered SOM cycling under eCO2 is scarce and the mechanisms of this control are poorly understood. Here, we performed a pot experiment manipulating P availability, AM fungal presence and atmospheric CO2 levels and assessed their impacts on soil C cycling and plant growth. Plants were grown in chambers with a continuous 13C-input that allowed differentiation between plant- and SOM-derived fractions of respired CO2 (R), dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass (MBC) as relevant C pools in the soil C cycle. We hypothesised that under low P availability, increases in SOM cycling may support sustained plant growth under eCO2 and that AM fungi would intensify this effect. We found the impacts of CO2 enrichment and P availability on soil C cycling were generally independent of each other with higher root biomass and slight increases in soil C cycling under eCO2 occurring regardless of the P treatment. Contrary to our hypotheses, soil C cycling was enhanced with P addition suggesting that low P conditions were limiting soil C cycling. eCO2 conditions increased the fraction of SOM-derived DOC pointing to increased SOM decomposition with eCO2. Finally, AM fungi increased microbial biomass under eCO2 conditions and low-P without enhanced soil C cycling, probably due to competitive interactions with free-living microorganisms over nutrients. Our findings in this plant-soil system suggest that, contrary to what has been reported for N-limited systems, the impacts of eCO2 and P availability on soil C cycling are independent of each other.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of HDAC4 expression and/or subcellular distribution results in impaired neuronal morphogenesis and long-term memory in Drosophila melanogaster. A recent genetic screen for genes that interact in the same molecular pathway as HDAC4 identified the cytoskeletal adapter Ankyrin2 (Ank2). Here we sought to investigate the role of Ank2 in neuronal morphogenesis, learning and memory, and to examine the nature of interaction with HDAC4. We found that Ank2 is expressed widely throughout the Drosophila brain where it localizes predominantly to axon tracts. Pan-neuronal knockdown of Ank2 in the mushroom body, a region critical for memory formation, resulted in defects in axon morphogenesis, and similarly reduction of Ank2 in lobular plate tangential neurons of the optic lobe disrupted dendritic branching and arborization. Conditional knockdown of Ank2 in the mushroom body of adult Drosophila significantly impaired long-term courtship memory, and this requirement for Ank2 was isolated to gamma ({gamma}) neurons of the mushroom body. As overexpression of HDAC4 in {gamma} neurons also impairs the formation of long-term courtship memory, this suggests that any functional relationship between these proteins during LTM likely occurs in {gamma} neurons. We determined that the genetic interaction requires the presence of nuclear HDAC4 and is not dependent on a conserved putative ankyrin-binding motif present in HDAC4. In summary, we provide the first characterization of the expression pattern of Ank2 in the adult Drosophila brain and demonstrate that Ank2 is critical for morphogenesis of the mushroom body and for the molecular processes required in the adult brain for formation of long-term memories.",

    "abstract": "Read mapping and variant calling approaches have been widely used for accurate genotyping and improving consensus quality assembled from noisy long reads. Variant calling accuracy relies heavily on the read quality, the precision of the read mapping algorithm and variant caller, and the criteria adopted to filter the calls. However, it is impossible to define a single set of optimal parameters, as they vary depending on the quality of the read set, the variant caller of choice, and the quality of the unpolished assembly. To overcome this issue, we have devised a new tool called Merfin (k-mer based finishing tool), a k-mer based variant filtering algorithm for improved genotyping and polishing. Merfin evaluates the accuracy of a call based on expected k-mer multiplicity in the reads, independently of the quality of the read alignment and variant callers internal score. Moreover, we introduce novel assembly quality and completeness metrics that account for the expected genomic copy numbers. Merfin significantly increased the precision of a variant call and reduced frameshift errors when applied to PacBio HiFi, PacBio CLR, or Nanopore long read based assemblies. We demonstrate the utility while polishing the first complete human genome, a fully phased human genome, and non-human high-quality genomes.",

    "abstract": "Optical mapping is a method for creating high resolution restriction maps of an entire genome. Optical mapping has been largely automated, and first produces single molecule restriction maps, called Rmaps, which are assembled to generate genome wide optical maps. Since the location and orientation of each Rmap is unknown, the first problem in the analysis of this data is finding related Rmaps, i.e., pairs of Rmaps that share the same orientation and have significant overlap in their genomic location. Although heuristics for identifying related Rmaps exist, they all require quantization of the data which leads to a loss in the precision. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian mixture modelling clustering based method, which we refer to as OMO_SCPLOWCLUSTC_SCPLOW, that finds overlapping Rmaps without quantization. Using both simulated and real datasets, we show that OMO_SCPLOWCLUSTC_SCPLOW substantially improves the precision (from 48.3% to 73.3%) over the state-of-the art methods while also reducing CPU time and memory consumption. Further, we integrated OMO_SCPLOWCLUSTC_SCPLOW into the error correction methods (Elmeri and O_SCPLOWCC_SCPLOWOMO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW) to demonstrate the increase in the performance of these methods. When OMO_SCPLOWCLUSTC_SCPLOW was combined with O_SCPLOWCC_SCPLOWOMO_SCPLOWETC_SCPLOW to error correct Rmap data generated from human DNA, it was able to error correct close to 3x more Rmaps, and reduced the CPU time by more than 35x.

Therefore, understanding the binding characteristics between such substances and biological macromolecules is essential from a toxic-kinetic perspective. The molecular interaction between DR and Human Serum Albumin (HSA) was investigated through spectroscopic techniques and molecular docking approaches. The results indicate that DR quenches HSA fluorescence following a static mechanism (corroborated by UV-Vis studies) with a moderate interaction (Ka~105 M-1), guided by electrostatic interactions ({Delta}S{degrees}> 0 and {Delta}H{degrees}< 0). DR is 5.52 nm distant from fluorophore residue Trp-214 (according to FRET investigations), and the interaction is mainly related to Tyr residues (as revealed by synchronous fluorescence). The Ellman assay identified a decrease in the content of HSA free thiol. The results of the RLS demonstrate that there are HSA alterations, suggesting damage to the confirmation of the protein. Molecular docking suggests the binding site of DR was located in subdomain IIB HSA, corroborating the experimental properties. Finally, the results suggest a high potential for DR toxicity triggered by contact with key proteins, which affects the biomolecule functionalities.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic stress is an important risk factor in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders, but exact pathomechanisms remain to be understood. Mapping individual differences of acute stress-induced neurophysiological changes, especially on the level of neural activation and functional connectivity (FC), could provide important insights in how variation in the individual stress response is linked to disease risk.\n\nMethodsUsing an established psycho-social stress task flanked by two resting-state scans, we measured subjective, physiological, and brain responses to acute stress and recovery in 217 unmedicated participants with and without mood and anxiety disorders. To estimate block-wise changes in stress-induced brain activation and FC, we used hierarchical mixed-effects models based on denoised timeseries within a predefined stress network. We predicted inter- and intra-individual differences in stress phases (anticipation vs. acute stress vs. recovery) and transdiagnostic dimensions of stress reactivity using elastic net and support vector machines.\n\nResultsWe identified four subnetworks showing distinct changes in FC over time. Subnetwork trajectories predicted the stress phase (accuracy: 71%, pperm<.001) and increases in pulse rate (R2=.10, pperm<.001). Critically, individual spatio-temporal trajectories of changes across networks also predicted negative affectivity ({Delta}R2=.08, pperm=.009), but not the presence or absence of a mood and anxiety disorder.\n\nConclusionsSpatio-temporal dynamics of brain network reconfiguration induced by stress reflect individual differences in the psychopathology dimension negative affectivity. These results support the idea that vulnerability for mood and anxiety disorders can be conceptualized best at the level of network dynamics, which may pave the way for improved prediction of individual risk.",

    "abstract": "The combination of optical tissue transparency with immunofluorescence allows the molecular characterization of biological tissues in 3D. However, adult human organs are particularly challenging to become transparent because of the autofluorescence contributions of aged tissues. To meet this challenge, we optimized SHORT (SWITCH - H2O2 - antigen Retrieval - TDE), a procedure based on standard histological treatments in combination with a refined clearing procedure to clear and label portions of the human brain. 3D histological characterization with multiple molecules is performed on cleared samples with a combination of multi-colors and multi-rounds labeling. By performing fast 3D imaging of the samples with a custom-made inverted light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM), we reveal fine details of intact human brain slabs at subcellular resolution. Overall, we proposed a scalable and versatile technology that in combination with LSFM allows mapping the cellular and molecular architecture of the human brain, paving the way to reconstruct the entire organ.",

    "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) populates the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and controls GI function. In contrast to the central nervous system, macrostructure of the ENS has been largely overlooked. Here, we visually and computationally demonstrate that the ENS is organized in circumferential stripes that regionally differ in development and neuronal composition. This characterization provides a blueprint for future understanding of region-specific GI function and identifying ENS structural correlates of GI disorders.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional brain cultures can facilitate the study of central nervous system function and disease, and one of the most important components that they present is neuronal activity on a network level. Here we demonstrate network activity in rodent cortical spheroids while maintaining the networks intact in their 3D state. Networks developed by nine days in culture and became more complex over time. To measure network activity, we imaged neurons in rat and mouse spheroids labelled with a calcium indicator dye, and in mouse spheroids expressing GCaMP. Network activity was evident when we electrically stimulated spheroids, was abolished with glutamatergic blockade, and was altered by GABAergic blockade or partial glutamatergic blockade. We quantified correlations and distances between somas with micron-scale spatial resolution. Spheroids seeded at as few as 4,000 cells gave rise to emergent network events, including oscillations. These results are the first demonstration that self-assembled rat and mouse spheroids exhibit network activity consistent with in vivo network events. These results open the door to experiments on neuronal networks that require fewer animals and enable high throughput experiments on network-perturbing alterations in neurons and glia.",
