    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has infected almost 200 million humans and caused over 4 million deaths worldwide. Evaluating countermeasures and improving our understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology require access to animal models that replicate the hallmarks of human disease. Mouse infection with SARS-CoV-2 is limited by poor affinity between the virus spike protein and its cellular receptor ACE2. We have developed by serial passages the MACo3 virus strain which efficiently replicates in the lungs of standard mouse strains and induces age-dependent lung lesions. Compared to other mouse-adapted strains and severe mouse models, infection with MACo3 results in mild to moderate disease and will be useful to investigate the role of host genetics and other factors modulating COVID-19 severity.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic methane oxidation exerts a key control on greenhouse gas emissions 1, yet factors that modulate the activity of microorganisms performing this function remain little explored. In studying groundwater, sediments, and wetland soil where methane production and oxidation occur, we discovered extraordinarily large, diverse DNA sequences that primarily encode hypothetical proteins. Four curated, complete genomes are linear, up to ~1 Mbp in length and share genome organization, including replicore structure, long inverted terminal repeats, and genome-wide unique perfect tandem direct repeats that are intergenic or generate amino acid repeats. We infer that these are a new type of archaeal extrachromosomal element with a distinct evolutionary origin. Gene sequence similarity, phylogeny, and local divergence of sequence composition indicate that many of their genes were assimilated from methane-oxidizing Methanoperedens archaea. We refer to these elements as \"Borgs\". We identified at least 19 different Borg types coexisting with Methanoperedens in four distinct ecosystems. Borg genes expand redox and respiratory capacity (e.g., clusters of multiheme cytochromes), ability to respond to changing environmental conditions, and likely augment Methanoperedens capacity for methane oxidation (e.g., methyl coenzyme M reductase). By this process, Borgs could play a previously unrecognized role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "The development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is of increasing concern in Ethiopia because of its potential implications for vector control failure. To better elucidate the specificity of resistance mechanisms and to facilitate the design of control strategies that minimize the likelihood of selecting for cross-resistance, a whole transcriptomic approach was used to explore gene expression patterns in a multi-insecticide resistant population of Anopheles arabiensis from Oromia Region, Ethiopia. This field population was resistant to the diagnostic doses of malathion (average mortality of 71.9%) and permethrin (77.4%), with pools of survivors and unexposed individuals analyzed using Illumina RNA-sequencing, alongside insecticide susceptible reference strains. This population also demonstrated deltamethrin resistance but complete susceptibility to alpha-cypermethrin, bendiocarb and propoxur, providing a phenotypic basis for detecting insecticide-specific resistance mechanisms. Transcriptomic data revealed overexpression of genes including cytochrome P450s, glutathione-s-transferases and carboxylesterases (including CYP4C36, CYP6AA1, CYP6M2, CYP6M3, CYP6P4, CYP9K1, CYP9L1, GSTD3, GSTE2, GSTE3, GSTE4, GSTE5, GSTE7 and two carboxylesterases) that were shared between malathion and permethrin survivors. We also identified nineteen highly overexpressed cuticular-associated proteins (including CYP4G16, CYP4G17 and chitinase) and eighteen salivary gland proteins (including D7r4 short form salivary protein), which may be contributing to a non-specific resistance phenotype by either enhancing the cuticular barrier or promoting binding and sequestration of insecticides, respectively. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in this lesser well-characterized major malaria vector species.\n\nImportanceInsecticide-resistant mosquito populations remain a significant challenge to global malaria vector control. While substantial progress has been made unraveling resistance mechanisms in major vector species, such as Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus, comparatively less is known about An. arabiensis populations. Using a whole transcriptomic approach, we investigated genes associated with resistance to insecticides used to control An. arabiensis in Ethiopia. Study findings revealed shared detoxification genes between organophosphate- and pyrethroid-resistant vectors and highly overexpressed cuticular-associated proteins and salivary gland proteins, which may play a role in enhancing insecticide resistance. The whole transcriptomic analysis detected novel resistance-associated genes, which warrant functional validation to determine their specificity to particular insecticides and their potential to confer cross-resistance between different insecticides with the same mode of action. These genes may contribute to the development of diagnostic markers to monitor insecticide resistance dynamics in the field.",

    "abstract": "Conserving biodiversity often requires deciding which sites to prioritise for protection. Predicting the impact of habitat loss is a major challenge, however, since impacts can be distant from the perturbation in both space and time. Here we study the long-term impacts of habitat loss in a mechanistic metacommunity model in terms of both immediate extinctions and secondary species losses. We find that biomass-at-site, closely related to site area, is a poor predictor of long-term regional species losses following site removal. Knowledge of the compositional distinctness (average between-site Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) of the removed community can markedly improve the prediction of impacts at the regional scale, even when biotic responses play out at substantial spatial or temporal distance from the removed site. Fitting our model to empirical species-by-site tables describing Andean diatoms and Brazilian lichen-fungi, we show that compositional distinctness surpasses area as a predictor of long-term species losses in the empirically relevant parameter range. Our results robustly demonstrate that site area alone is not sufficient to gauge conservation priorities; analysis of compositional distinctness permits improved prioritisation at low cost.",

    "abstract": "Mature tRNAs are generated by multiple RNA processing events, which can include the excision of intervening sequences. The tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex is responsible for cleaving these intron-containing pre-tRNA transcripts. In humans, TSEN copurifies with CLP1, an RNA kinase. Despite extensive work on CLP1, its in vivo connection to tRNA splicing remains unclear. Interestingly, mutations in CLP1 or TSEN genes cause neurological diseases in humans that are collectively termed Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia (PCH). In mice, loss of Clp1 kinase activity results in premature death, microcephaly and progressive loss of motor function. To determine if similar phenotypes are observed in Drosophila, we characterized mutations in crowded-by-cid (cbc), the CLP1 ortholog, as well as in the fly ortholog of human TSEN54. Analyses of organismal viability, larval locomotion and brain size revealed that mutations in both cbc and Tsen54 phenocopy those in mammals in several details. In addition to an overall reduction in brain lobe size, we also found increased cell death in mutant larval brains. Ubiquitous or tissue-specific knockdown of cbc in neurons and muscles reduced viability and locomotor function. These findings indicate that we can successfully model PCH in a genetically-tractable invertebrate.",

    "abstract": "Downstream next generation sequencing (NGS) of the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (T. pallidum) is hindered by low bacterial loads and the overwhelming presence of background metagenomic DNA in clinical specimens. In this study, we investigated selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) utilizing multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in conjunction with custom oligonucleotides with an increased specificity for the T. pallidum genome, and the capture and removal of CpG-methylated host DNA using the NEBNext(R) Microbiome DNA Enrichment Kit followed by MDA with the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit as enrichment methods to improve the yields of T. pallidum DNA in isolates and lesion specimens from syphilis patients. Sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq v2 500 cycle or NovaSeq 6000 SP platform. These two enrichment methods led to 93-98% genome coverage at 5 reads/site in 5 clinical specimens from the United States and rabbit propagated isolates, containing >14 T. pallidum genomic copies/l of sample for SWGA and >129 genomic copies/l for CpG methylation capture with MDA. Variant analysis using sequencing data derived from SWGA-enriched specimens, showed that all 5 clinical strains had the A2058G mutation associated with azithromycin resistance. SWGA is a robust method that allows direct whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens containing very low numbers of T. pallidum, which have been challenging until now.\n\nImportanceSyphilis is a sexually transmitted, disseminated acute and chronic infection caused by the bacterial pathogen Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Primary syphilis typically presents as single or multiple mucocutaneous lesions, and if left untreated, can progress through multiple stages with varied clinical manifestations. Molecular studies often rely on direct amplification of DNA sequences from clinical specimens; however, this can be impacted by inadequate samples due to disease progression or timing of patients seeking clinical care. While genotyping has provided important data on circulating strains over the past two decades, WGS data is needed to better understand strain diversity, perform evolutionary tracing, and monitor antimicrobial resistance markers. The significance of our research is the development of a SWGA DNA enrichment method that expands the range of clinical specimens that can be directly sequenced to include samples with low numbers of T. pallidum.",

Here, by using whole-genome single-cell bisulfite sequencing on 87 motile spermatozoa from 8 individuals (4 lean and 4 obese), we found that spermatozoa within single ejaculates are highly heterogeneous and contain subsets of spermatozoa with marked imprinting defects. Comparing lean and obese subjects, we discovered methylation differences across two large CpG dense regions located near PPM1D and LINC01237. These findings confirm that sperm DNA methylation is altered in human obesity and indicate that single ejaculates contain subpopulations of spermatozoa carrying distinct DNA methylation patterns. Distinct epigenetic patterns of spermatozoa within an ejaculate may result in different intergenerational effects and therefore influence strategies aiming to prevent epigenetic-related disorders in the offspring.",

To reduce sample loss and avoid inefficient immunoprecipitation, several chromatin immuno-cleavage-based methods using Tn5 transposase fused with Protein A/G have been developed to profile histone modifications and transcription factor bindings using small number of cells. The Tn5 transposase-based epigenomic profiling methods are featured with simple library construction steps in the same tube, by taking advantage of Tn5 transposases capability of simultaneous DNA fragmentation and adaptor ligation. However, the Tn5 transposase prefers to cut open chromatin regions. Our comparative analysis shows that Tn5 transposase-based profiling methods are prone to open chromatin bias. The high false positive signals due to biased cleavage in open chromatin could cause misinterpretation of signal distributions and dynamics. Rigorous validation is needed when employing and interpreting results from Tn5 transposase-based epigenomic profiling methods.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate to what extent the biomechanics of a collective load carriage is affected when a dyad of individuals is performing a carrying task with an additional accuracy constraint. Ten dyads performed a first condition in which they collectively transported a load (CC), and a second one in which they transported the same load while maintaining a ball in a target position on its top (PC).\n\nThe recovery-rate, amplitude, and period of the center-of-mass (COM) trajectory were computed for the whole system (dyad + table = PACS). We analyzed the forces and moments exerted at each joint of the upper limbs of the subjects. We observed a decrease in the overall performance of the dyads when the Precision task was added, i.e., i) the velocity and amplitude of CoMPACS decreased by 1,7% and 5,8%, respectively, ii) inter-subject variability of the Moment-Cost-Function decreased by 95% and recovery rate decreased by 19,2% during PC. A kinetic synergy analysis showed that the subjects reorganized their coordination in the PC.\n\nOur results demonstrate that adding a precision task affects the economy of collective load carriage. Notwithstanding, the joint moments at the upper-limbs are better balanced and co-vary more across the paired subjects during the precision task.

We also find that the competitive edge derived from being anti-aggregation in colonizing space, which results in a higher  Space Accessibility, neutralizes the disadvantage arising from either lower growth rate or lower initial abundance.

Combining conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for developing universal vaccine. In this study, we constructed a recombinant protein NMHC consisting of influenza viral conserved epitopes and superantigen fragment. NMHC promoted the mature of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into Th1, Th2 and Th17 subtypes. Mice vaccinated with NMHC produced high level of immunoglobulins which cross-bound to HA fragments from six influenza virus subtypes with high antibody titers. Anti-NMHC serum showed potent hemagglutinin inhibition effects to highly divergent group 1 (H1 subtypes) and group 2 (H3 subtype) influenza virus strains. And purified anti-NMHC antibodies could bind to multiple HAs with high affinities. NMHC vaccination effectively protected the mice from infection and lung damage challenged by two subtypes of H1N1 influenza virus. Moreover, NMHC vaccination elicited CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to clear the virus from infected tissue and prevent virus spreading. In conclusion, this study provided proof of concept for triggering both B cells and T cells immune responses against multiple influenza virus infection, and NMHC may be a potential candidate of universal broad-spectrum vaccine for various influenza virus prevention and therapy.",
