    "abstract": "Recombination maps are important resources for epidemiological and evolutionary analyses, however, there are currently no recombination maps representing any African population outside of those with West African ancestry. We inferred the demographic history for the Nama, an indigenous Khoe-San population of southern Africa, and derived a novel, population-specific recombination map from the whole genome sequencing of 54 Nama individuals. We hypothesized that there are no publicly available recombination maps representative of the Nama, considering the deep population divergence and subsequent isolation of the Khoe-San from other African groups. We showed that the recombination landscape of the Nama does not cluster with any continental groups with publicly available representative recombination maps. Finally, we used selection scans as an example of how fine-scale differences between the Nama recombination map and the combined Phase II HapMap recombination map can impact the outcome of selection scans.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin motor domains generate impulses of force and movement that have both translational and rotational components, raising the question of how the rotational component contributes to motor functions. We used a new assay in which kinesin-coated gold nanorods (kinesin-GNRs) move on suspended microtubules, for two plus-end-directed and weakly-processive kinesins: single-headed KIF1A, dimeric ZEN-4. Polarization of the light scattered by two types of kinesin-GNRs periodically oscillated as they orbited the microtubule along a left-handed helical trajectory. Our analyses revealed that each kinesin-GNR unidirectionally rotates about its yaw axis as it translocates, and that the period of this yaw-axis rotation corresponds to two periods of its left-handed helical orbit around the microtubule axis. Theoretical analyses suggest that the yaw-axis rotation enhances biased lateral displacement of the kinesin team. Our study reveals biaxial rotation as a new mode of motility in kinesin teams that may help the team to sidestep roadblocks.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation is associated with increased energy expenditure by inducing non-shivering thermogenesis. Ingestion of a milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) supplement and a high calorie diet are reported gateways into BAT activation. However, little is known about the effect of MFGM and high calorie diets on BAT volume. To gain insight into this, mice were maintained on a high fat (HF) or low-fat (LF) diet in conjunction with either full-cream (FC) or skim bovine dairy milk (BDM). After being maintained on their respective diets for 13 weeks, body composition, including BAT volume, was measured using X-ray microtomography. A high calorie diet resulted in an increase in BAT volume and mice consuming a HF diet in conjunction with FC BDM had significantly greater BAT volume than all other groups. Conversely, mice consuming a HF diet in addition to skim milk had lower BAT volume compared to the HF control. The data presented suggests that consumption of a high calorie diet in conjunction with FC BDM increases BAT volume in wild-type mice. This study may provide valuable insight into future studies investigating BAT volume and BAT activity in relation to environmental factors including diet.",

    "abstract": "The pancreatic islet (islet of Langerhans) is a mini-organ comprising several thousand endocrine cells, functioning jointly to maintain normoglycemia. Cellular networks within an islet were shown to influence its function in health and disease, but there are major gaps in our quantitative understanding of such architecture-function relations. Comprehensive modeling of an islet architecture and function requires the integration of vast amounts of information obtained through different experimental and theoretical approaches. To address this challenge, our lab has recently developed Bayesian metamodeling, a general approach for modeling complex systems by integrating heterogeneous input models. Here, we further developed metamodeling and applied it to construct a metamodel of a pancreatic islet. The metamodel relates islet architecture and function by combining a Monte-Carlo model of architecture trained on islet imaging data; and an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) mathematical model of function trained on calcium imaging, hormone imaging, and electrophysiological data. These input models are converted to a standardized statistical representation relying on Probabilistic Graphical Models; coupled by modeling their mutual relations with the physical world; and finally, harmonized through backpropagation. We validate the metamodel using existing data and use it to derive a testable hypothesis regarding the functional effect of varying intercellular connections. Since metamodeling currently requires substantial expert intervention, we also develop an automation tool for converting models to PGMs (step I) using feedforward neural networks. This automation is a first step towards automating the entire metamodeling process, working towards collaborative science through sharing of expertise, resources, data, and models.",

    "abstract": "Diversity studies on moths in Australia are rare, presenting various shortfalls in knowledge that impedes and understanding of their biodiversity values and their conservation. In particular, the Wet Tropics of Australia deserves attention, given the paucity of systematic moth surveys in the region and its World Heritage Area status. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a study to observe moths on 191 nights over a main one-year survey period at an upland rainforest locality, and uploaded all observations on iNaturalist. We also compiled other incidental observations in the general locality by other observers and observations outside the survey period. In total, we document 4,434 observations of moths represented by 1041 distinct moth morphospecies. Of these, 703 are formally named species of moths, 146 to genus and 255 to higher taxonomic designations above genus level. Despite the rather intensive main survey effort, our results suggest that we have yet to reach a plateau in documenting the moth species richness of the locality. Using this study as a model, we show that the iNaturalist platform serves as an effective means to document and digitally curate biodiversity values at a locality, whilst providing complete data transparency and enabling broader community engagement of citizen scientists. We recommend the use of iNaturalist for future moth inventories, and as a resource for follow up meta-analyses of regional moth diversity and distributions.",

    "abstract": "The ant genus Monomorium is one of the most species-rich but taxonomically problematic groups in the hyperdiverse subfamily Myrmicinae. An East Asian species, M. triviale Wheeler, produces both reproductive queens and sterile workers via obligate thelytokous parthenogenesis. Here, we describe the immature forms of M. triviale based on light and scanning electron microscopy observations, with a note on the striking caste dimorphism in the last larval instar. The last-instar queen larvae were easily recognized by their large size, \"aphaenogastroid\" body shape, and rows of doorknob-like tubercles on the lateral and dorsal body surface. This type of queen-specific structure has not been found in ants in general, let alone congeneric species found in Japan. In stark contrast to the queen larvae, worker larvae showed a \"pheidoloid\" body shape and a body surface similar to other ants. The worker larvae were estimated to have three instars, consistent with previously described congeners. The pupae of both castes had no cocoon, a characteristic commonly described in other Myrmicinae species. In total, the developmental period from egg to adult worker averaged 59 days under 25{degrees}C. We discuss possible functions of the tubercles of queen larvae based on previous studies.",

    "abstract": "Animals integrate external stimuli to shape their physiological responses throughout development. In adverse environments, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae can enter a stress-resistant diapause state with arrested metabolism and reproductive physiology. Amphid sensory neurons feed into both rapid chemotactic and short-term foraging mode decisions, mediated by amphid and premotor interneurons, as well as the long-term diapause decision. We identify amphid interneurons that integrate pheromone cues and propagate this information via a neuropeptidergic pathways to influence larval developmental fate, bypassing the pre-motor system. AIA interneuron-derived FLP-2 neuropeptide signaling promotes reproductive growth and AIA activity is suppressed by pheromone. FLP-2 acts antagonistically to the insulin-like INS-1. FLP-2s growth promoting effects are inhibited by upstream metabotropic glutamatergic signaling and mediated by the broadly-expressed neuropeptide receptor NPR-30. Conversely, the AIB interneurons and their neuropeptide receptor NPR-9/GALR2 promote diapause entry. These neuropeptidergic outputs allow reuse of parts of a sensory system for a decision with a distinct timescale.",

While thymic epithelial cells are well characterized for their role in thymopoiesis, a comparably comprehensive analysis of the non-epithelial thymic stroma is lacking. Here we explore at single cell resolution the complex composition and dynamic changes that occur over time in the non-epithelial stromal compartment. We detail across different developmental stages in human and mouse thymus, and in an experimental model of Di George syndrome, the most common form of human thymic hypoplasia, the separate transcriptomes of mouse mesothelium, fibroblasts, neural crest cells, endothelial and vascular mural cells. The detected gene expression signatures identify novel stromal subtypes and relate their individual molecular profiles to separate differentiation trajectories and functions. Specifically, we demonstrate an abundance and unprecedented heterogeneity of diverse fibroblast subtypes that emerge at discrete developmental stages and vary in their expression of key regulatory signalling circuits and components of the extracellular matrix. Taken together, these findings highlight the dynamic complexity of the non-epithelial thymus stroma and link the cells specific gene expression profiles to separate instructive roles essential for normal thymus organogenesis and tissue maintenance.\n\nTeaserSingle cell profiling of thymic stroma identifies a dynamic contribution from neural crest cells to the thymic mesenchyme.",

We showed previously in multiple species that treatment with a macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF1)-Fc fusion protein initiated hepatocyte proliferation and promoted repair in models of acute hepatic injury in mice. Here we investigated the impact of CSF1-Fc on resolution of advanced fibrosis and liver regeneration, utilizing a non-resolving toxin-induced model of chronic liver injury and fibrosis in C57BL/6J mice. Co-administration of CSF1-Fc with exposure to thioacetamide (TAA) exacerbated inflammation consistent with monocyte contributions to initiation of pathology. After removal of TAA, either acute or chronic CSF1-Fc treatment promoted liver growth, prevented progression and promoted resolution of fibrosis. Acute CSF1-Fc treatment was also anti-fibrotic and pro-regenerative in a model of partial hepatectomy in mice with established fibrosis. The beneficial impacts of CSF1-Fc treatment were associated with monocyte-macrophage recruitment and increased expression of remodeling enzymes and growth factors. These studies indicate that CSF1-dependent macrophages contribute to both initiation and resolution of fibrotic injury and that CSF1-Fc has therapeutic potential in human liver disease.\n\nSummary statementMacrophages contribute to both progression and resolution of chronic tissue injury and fibrogenesis.

However, it remains poorly understood how viruses impact the biochemical processes of activated sludge, for example in terms of treatment efficiency and pollutant removal. Using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic deep sequencing, the present study recovered thousands of viral sequences from activated sludge samples of three conventional wastewater treatment plants. Gene-sharing network indicated that most of viruses could not be assigned to known viral genera, implying activated sludge as an underexplored reservoir for new viruses and viral diversity. in silico Predictions of virus-host linkages demonstrated that infected microbial hosts, mostly belonging to bacteria, were transcriptionally active and able to hydrolyze polymers including starches, celluloses, and proteins. Some viruses encode auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) for resistance to multiple drugs. The former group of virus-encoded genes (i.e. AMGs) may enhance the biodegradation of contaminants like starches and celluloses, suggesting a positive role for viruses in strengthening the performance of activated sludge. However, the latter group (i.e. ARGs) would be disseminated to different microorganisms using viruses as gene shuttles, demonstrating the possibility for viruses to facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment. Collectively, this study highlights the mixed blessing of viruses in wastewater treatment plants, and deciphers how they manipulate the biochemical processes in the activated sludge, with implications for both environmental protection and ecosystem security.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular trafficking regulates the distribution of transmembrane proteins including the key determinants of epithelial polarity and adhesion. The Adaptor Protein 1 (AP-1) complex is the key regulator of vesicle sorting, which binds many specific cargos. We examined roles of the AP-1 complex in epithelial morphogenesis, using the Drosophila wing as a paradigm. We found that AP-1 knockdown leads to ectopic tissue folding, which is consistent with the observed defects in integrin targeting to the basal cell-extracellular matrix adhesion sites. This occurs concurrently with an integrin-independent induction of cell death, which counteracts elevated proliferation and prevents hyperplasia. We discovered a distinct pool of AP-1, which localizes at the subapical Adherens Junctions. Upon AP-1 knockdown, E-cadherin is hyperinternalized from these junctions and becomes enriched at the Golgi and recycling endosomes. We then provide evidence that E-cadherin hyperinternalization acts upstream of cell death in a potential tumour-suppressive mechanism. Simultaneously, cells compensate for elevated internalization of E-cadherin by increasing its expression to maintain cell-cell adhesion.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe epithelium is one of the four types of tissues found in animals and is essential for the normal development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. In this tissue, the adhesion protein E-cadherin helps keep cells together and facilitates the coordination of their behaviours. E-cadherin is highly dynamic and undergoes constant turnover by intracellular trafficking machinery. Here, we describe the contributions of one of the core components of intracellular trafficking, the AP-1 complex to E-cadherin dynamics. Using epithelial cells from Drosophila melanogaster, we discover that the AP-1 complex limits E-cadherin internalization from the plasma membrane, which is consistent with the localization of a distinct pool of the AP-1 complex at the sites of E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion. We also show that increased E-cadherin internalization triggers programmed cell death, preventing the tissue from hyperplastic overgrowth in a potential tumour-suppressive mechanism. At the same time, cells compensate for the reduction in the membrane presentation of E-cadherin by increasing its expression, therefore protecting tissue integrity.",

    "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive disease, characterized by mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex genes (Tsc1 or Tsc2), and hyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The effectiveness of mTORC1 inhibitors is limited by their lack of cytotoxic effects. Here, we report that E26 transformation specific (ETS) Variant Transcription Factor 2 (ETV2) is a critical regulator of Tsc2-deficient cell survival. Nuclear localization of ETV2 in Tsc2-deficient cells is mTORC1-independent and is enhanced by spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibition. In the nucleus, ETV2 transcriptionally regulates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 binding protein (PARPBP), a coregulator of transcription, mRNA and protein expression. Silencing of ETV2 or PARPBP in Tsc2-deficient cells induced ER-stress and increased cell death in vitro and in vivo. We also found ETV2 expression in human cells with loss of heterozygosity for TSC2 lending support to the translational relevance of our findings. In conclusion, we report a novel signaling axis unique to Syk-inhibition is mTORC1-independent and promotes a cytocidal response in Tsc2-deficient cells, and therefore, maybe a potential alternative therapeutic target in LAM.",

    "abstract": "The centromere, defined by the enrichment of CENP-A (a Histone H3 variant)-containing nucleosomes, is a specialised chromosomal locus that acts as a microtubule attachment site. During each round of the cell cycle, CENP-A levels undergo DNA replication-mediated dilution. To maintain centromere identity, CENP-A levels must be restored. A central player mediating this process is the Mis18 complex (composed of Mis18, Mis18{beta} and Mis18BP1), which recruits the CENP-A specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres for CENP-A deposition. Here, using a multipronged approach we provide the structural basis for the assembly of the Mis18 complex. We show that the Mis18/{beta} hetero-trimer (2 Mis18:1 Mis18{beta}) is assembled by the formation of a triple helical bundle with a Mis18/{beta}Yippee hetero-dimer and Mis18Yippee monomer on opposite ends. Two such Mis18/{beta} hetero-trimers, each bound to a Mis18BP1, assemble as a hetero-octamer via Mis18Yippee homo-dimerisation. Evaluation of structure-guided separation of function mutants in cells reveal structural determinants essential for Mis18 complex assembly and function.",

    "abstract": "How organs achieve their final shape is a problem at the interface between physics and developmental biology. Organs often involve multiple interacting tissue layers that must be coordinated to orchestrate the complex shape changes of development. Intense study uncovered genetic, and physical ingredients driving the form of mono layer tissue. Yet, tracing dynamics across tissue layers, and scales - from cell to tissue, to entire organs - remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we study the midgut of Drosophila embryos as a model visceral organ, to reconstruct in toto the dynamics of multi-layer organ formation in vivo. Using light-sheet microscopy, genetics, computer vision, and tissue cartography, we extract individual tissue layers to map the time course of shape across scales from cells to organ. We identify the kinematic mechanism driving the shape change due to tissue layer interactions by linking out-of-plane motion to active contraction patterns, revealing a convergent extension process in which cells deform as they flow into deepening folds. Acute perturbations of contractility in the muscle layer using non-neuronal optogenetics reveals that these contraction patterns are due to muscle activity, which induces cell shape changes in the adjacent endoderm layer. This induction cascade relies on high frequency calcium pulses in the muscle layer, under the control of hox genes. Inhibition of targets of calcium involved in myosin phosphorylation abolishes constrictions. Our study of multi-layer organogenesis reveals how genetic patterning in one layer triggers a dynamic molecular mechanism to control a physical process in the adjacent layer, to orchestrate whole-organ shape change.",

    "abstract": "Aldabrachelys gigantea (Aldabra giant tortoise) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world and survives as a single wild population of over 100,000 individuals on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles. Despite this large current population size, the species faces an uncertain future because of its extremely restricted distribution range and high vulnerability to the projected consequences of climate change. Captive-bred A. gigantea are increasingly used in rewilding programs across the region, where they are introduced to replace extinct giant tortoises in an attempt to functionally resurrect degraded island ecosystems. However, there has been little consideration of the current levels of genetic variation and differentiation within and among the islands on Aldabra. As previous microsatellite studies were inconclusive, we combined low-coverage and double digest restriction associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze samples from 33 tortoises (11 from each main island). Using 5,426 variant sites within the tortoise genome, we detected patterns of population structure within two of the three studied islands, but no differentiation between the islands. These unexpected results highlight the importance of using genome-wide genetic markers to capture higher-resolution genetic structure to inform future management plans, even in a seemingly panmictic population. We show that low-coverage ddRAD sequencing provides an affordable alternative approach to conservation genomic projects of non-model species with large genomes.",

    "abstract": "The Xerces Blue (Glaucopsyche xerces) is considered to be the first butterfly to become extinct at global scale in historical times. It was notable for its chalky lavender wings with conspicuous white spots on the ventral wings. The last individuals were collected in their restricted habitat, in the dunes near the Presidio military base in San Francisco, in 1941. We sequenced the genomes of four 80 to 100-year-old Xerces Blue, and seven historical and one modern specimens of its closest relative, the Silvery Blue (G. lygdamus). We compared these to a novel annotated genome of the Green-Underside Blue (G. alexis). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from complete mitochondrial genomes indicate that Xerces Blue was a distinct species that diverged from the Silvery Blue lineage at least 850,000 years ago. Using nuclear genomes, both species experienced population growth during the Eemian interglacial period, but the Xerces Blue decreased to a very low effective population size subsequently, a trend opposite to that observed in the Silvery Blue. Runs of homozygosity and deleterious load in the Xerces Blue were significantly greater than in the Silvery Blue, suggesting a higher incidence of inbreeding. These signals of population decline observed in Xerces Blue could be used to identify and monitor other insects threatened by human activities, whose extinction patterns are still not well known.",

    "abstract": "Postmating-prezygotic (PMPZ) reproductive isolation is hypothesized to result from divergent coevolutionary trajectories of sexual selection and/or sexual conflict in isolated populations (coevolutionary divergence model). However, the genetic basis of PMPZ incompatibilities between species is poorly understood. Here, we use a comparative framework to test predictions of the coevolutionary divergence model using a large transcriptomic dataset generated from con- and heterospecifically mated Drosophila mojavensis and D. arizonae female reproductive tracts. We found striking divergence between the species in the female postmating transcriptional response to conspecific mating, including differences in differential expression (DE), alternative splicing (AS), and intron retention (IR). As predicted, heterospecific matings produced disrupted transcriptional profiles, but the overall patterns of misregulation were different between the reciprocal crosses. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between postmating transcriptional divergence between species and levels of transcriptional disruption in heterospecific crosses, indicating that mating-responsive genes that have diverged more in expression also have more disrupted transcriptional profiles in heterospecifically mated females. Overall, our results are consistent with predictions of the coevolutionary divergence model and lay the foundation for future studies aimed at identifying specific genes involved in PMPZ incompatibilities and the evolutionary forces that have contributed to their divergence in closely related species.",

    "abstract": "Population bottlenecks can have dramatic consequences for the health and long-term survival of a species. A recent bottleneck event can also largely obscure our understanding of standing variation prior to the contraction. Historic population sizes can be modeled based on extant genomics, however uncertainty increases with the severity of the bottleneck. Integrating ancient genomes provides a powerful complement to retrace the evolution of genetic diversity through population fluctuations. Here, we recover 15 high-quality mitogenomes of the once nearly extinct Alpine ibex spanning 8601 {+/-} 33 BP to 1919 CE and combine these with 60 published modern genomes. Coalescent demography simulations based on modern genomes indicate population fluctuations matching major climatic change over the past millennia. Using ancient genomes, we show that mitochondrial haplotype diversity has been reduced to a fifth of the pre-bottleneck diversity with several highly differentiated mitochondrial lineages having co-existed historically. The main collapse of mitochondrial diversity coincided with human settlement expansions in the Middle Ages. The near extinction severely reduced the mitochondrial diversity. After recovery, one lineage was spread and nearly fixed across the Alps due to recolonization efforts. Contrary to expectations, we show that a second ancestral mitochondrial lineage has survived in an isolated population further south. Our study highlights that a combined approach integrating genomic data of ancient, historic and extant populations unravels major long-term population fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine use disorders (CUD) are devastating for affected individuals and impose a significant burden on society, but there are currently no FDA-approved therapies. The development of novel and effective treatments has been hindered by substantial gaps in our knowledge about the etiology of these disorders. The risk for developing a CUD is influenced by genetics, the environment and complex interactions between the two. Identifying specific genes and environmental risk factors that increase CUD risk would provide an avenue for the development of novel treatments.\n\nRodent models of addiction-relevant behaviors have been a valuable tool for studying the genetics of response to drugs of abuse. Traditional genetic mapping using genetically and phenotypically divergent inbred mice has been successful in identifying numerous chromosomal regions that influence addiction-relevant behaviors, but these strategies rarely result in identification of the causal gene or genetic variant. To overcome this challenge, reduced complexity crosses (RCC) between closely related inbred mouse substrains have been proposed as a method for rapidly identifying and validating functional variants. The RCC approach is dependent on identifying phenotypic differences between substrains. To date, however, the study of addiction-relevant behaviors has been limited to very few sets of substrains, mostly comprising the C57BL/6 lineage.\n\nThe present study expands upon the current literature to assess cocaine-induced locomotor activation in 20 inbred mouse substrains representing six inbred strain lineages (A/J, BALB/c, FVB/N, C3H/He, DBA/2 and NOD) that were either bred in-house or supplied directly by a commercial vendor. To our knowledge, we are the first to identify significant differences in cocaine-induced locomotor response in several of these inbred substrains. The identification of substrain differences allows for the initiation of RCC populations to more rapidly identify specific genetic variants associated with acute cocaine response. The observation of behavioral profiles that differ between mice generated in-house and those that are vendor-supplied also presents an opportunity to investigate the influence of environmental factors on cocaine-induced locomotor activity.",

    "abstract": "Selective attention allows the brain to efficiently process the image projected onto the retina, selectively focusing neural processing resources on behaviorally relevant visual information. While previous studies have documented the crucial role of the action potential rate of single neurons in relaying such information, little is known about how the activity of single neurons relative to their neighboring network contributes to the efficient representation of attended stimuli and transmission of this information to downstream areas. Here, we show in the dorsal visual pathway of monkeys (medial superior temporal (MST) area) that neurons fire spikes preferentially at a specific phase of the ongoing population beta (~20 Hz) oscillations of the surrounding local network. This preferred spiking phase shifts towards a later phase when monkeys selectively attend towards (rather than away from) the receptive field of the neuron. This shift of the locking phase is positively correlated with the speed at which animals report a visual change. Furthermore, our computational modelling suggests that neural networks can manipulate the preferred phase of coupling by imposing differential synaptic delays on postsynaptic potentials. This distinction between the locking phase of neurons activated by the spatially attended stimulus vs. that of neurons activated by the unattended stimulus, may enable the neural system to discriminate relevant from irrelevant sensory inputs and consequently filter out distracting stimuli information by aligning the spikes which convey relevant/irrelevant information to distinct phases linked to periods of better/worse perceptual sensitivity for higher cortices. This strategy may be used to reserve the narrow windows of highest perceptual efficacy to the processing of the most behaviorally relevant information, ensuring highly efficient responses to attended sensory events.",

    "abstract": "The human P4-type ATPase ATP8B1 in complex with the auxiliary noncatalytic protein CDC50A or CDC50B mediates the transport of cell membrane lipids from the outer to the inner membrane leaflet, which is crucial to maintain the asymmetry of membrane lipid. Its dysfunction usually leads to imbalance of bile acid circulation, and eventually causing intrahepatic cholestasis diseases. Here we found that both ATP8B1-CDC50A and ATP8B1-CDC50B possess a higher ATPase activity in the presence of the most favored substrate phosphatidylserine (PS); and moreover, the PS-stimulated activity could be augmented upon the addition of bile acids. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of ATP8B1-CDC50A at 3.36 [A] and ATP8B1-CDC50B at 3.39 [A] enabled us to capture an unprecedented phosphorylated and autoinhibited state, with the N- and C-terminal tails separately inserting into the cytoplasmic inter-domain clefts of ATP8B1. The PS-bound ATP8B1-CDC50A structure at 3.98 [A] indicated the autoinhibited state could be released upon PS binding. Structural analysis combined with mutagenesis revealed the residues that determine the substrate specificity, and a unique positively charged loop in the phosphorylated domain of ATP8B1 for the recruitment of bile acids. Altogether, we updated the Post-Albers transport cycle, with an extra autoinhibited state of ATP8B1, which could be activated upon substrate binding. These findings not only provide structural insights into the ATP8B1-mediated restoration of human membrane lipid asymmetry during bile acid circulation, but also advance our understanding on the molecular mechanism of P-type ATPases.",

    "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have gained traction in transplantation therapy due to their immunomodulatory, paracrine, immune-evasive, and multipotent differentiation potential. Given the heterogeneous nature of hMSCs, therapeutic treatments and robust in vivo and in vitro experiments require additional biomarkers to ensure reproducibility when using these stem cells. In this work, we utilized dielectrophoresis (DEP), a label-free electrokinetic phenomenon, to investigate and quantify the heterogeneity of hMSCs derived from the bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AD). Through computer simulation, we identified that the transient slope of the DEP force spectra can be used as a metric of heterogeneity. The electrical properties of BM-hMSCs were compared to homogeneous mouse fibroblasts (NIH-3T3), human fibroblasts (WS1), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). BM-hMSCs DEP profile was most different from HEK-293 cells. We compared the DEP profiles of BM-hMSCs and AD-hMSCs and found they have similar membrane capacitances, differing cytoplasm conductivity, and transient slopes. Inducing both populations to differentiate into adipocyte and osteocyte cells revealed they behave differently in response to differentiation-inducing cytokines. Histology and RT-qPCR analyses of the differentiation-related genes revealed differences in heterogeneity between BM-hMSCs and AD-hMSCs. The differentiation profiles correlate well with the DEP profiles developed and indicate that these BM-hMSCs have higher differentiation potential than AD-hMSCs. Our results demonstrate using DEP, membrane capacitance, cytoplasm conductivity, and transient slope can uniquely characterize the inherent heterogeneity of hMSCs to guide robust and reproducible stem cell transplantation therapies.",

    "abstract": "The large families of amastins from Leishmania donovani, L. infantum, L. major, L. braziliensis and Trypanosoma cruzi are strongly associated with the evolution of intracellular parasitism of rich cells in human MHC.1 molecules such as the macrophages, dendritic cells, and Langerhans cells by these parasites, recognize the MHC-1 molecules as host receptor. The internalization and transport of the paraste in the cytoplas of infected cell is facilitated by the MHC-1 recycle and endosome formation drag and transport the parasite in the cytoplasm of infected cell. The microbody amastins participate as coreceptor potency the infection, the tropism of L. major and L. braziliensis by the cells from the skin is facilitated by two molecular interactions, the first molecular interaction is faclitated by the amastins interact the human MHC-1 molecules, and the second molecular interaction is facilitated by the numerous microbody amastins; which also participate in the biogenesis of the small prasitophorous vcuole from L. major, and large parasitophorous vacuole from L. braziliensis.\n\nAll amastins from these parasites developed deactivation domains, in different grade L. donovani develop an amastin surface coat specialized in deactivation of infected macrophages heavily glycosylated developed 38 amastins with 38 glycosylation Asp. N-Glycosylation sites and 45 N-glucosamina glycosylation sites, whereas L. infantum, L. major and L. braziliensis developed one half of glycosylated amastins in asparagine N-glycosylation sites, and T. cruzi did not developed none glycosylated amastin.\n\nThe amastins surface coat from L. donovani is rich in phosphorylation sites, developed 45 amastins with 45 casein kinase II phosphorylations sites, and 48 amastins with 48 protein kinase phosphorylation sites. L. infantum, L. braziliensis, and T. cruzi developed 32, 42, and 8 amastins, with 94, 114, 21 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites; in similar way developed 35,38, 11 amastins with 89,78, and 22 protein kinase phosphorylation sites. The family of amastins from L. donovani develop 137 phosphoserines. and 128 phosphothreonine, L. major developed 14 phosphoserine and 4 phosphothreonine; L. infantum 1 phophoserine and 7 phosphothreonine; L. braziliensis did not developed phosphoserine and phosphothreonine and T. cruzi 4 phosphoserine and 4 phosphothreonine. The results show that amastin surface coat is equiped with numerous phosphorylations sites atractive for phosphohrylases from the infected host contribute with the dephosphorylation and deactivation of infectetd host cells.\n\nThe amastins from L. major develop a membrane amastin with laminin G domain, which can interact with the collagen and heparin sulfate proteoglycan sites from the extracellular matrix of the skin tissue. Furthermore develop 14 amastins with tyrosine sulfation site, evade the activation of receptor of chemokines and the activation of the immune response by chemokines.\n\nThere is an alternative mechanism of polarization of the immune response from protective TH1 to non protective TH2.\n\nThe parasite nutrition is mediated by amastins that dissimilate the MHC-1 molecules and other subsets of proteins, the dissimilation products can be translocated through of the parasite cell membrane and employed as nutrient source.",

However, the significance and underlying mechanisms by which aberrant hemidesmosome assembly may modulate tumorigenesis remain elusive. Using an extensive CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic engineering approaches in different prostate cancer cell lines combined with in vivo tumorigenesis studies in mice, bone marrow-on-chip assays and bioinformatics, as well as histological analysis of prostate cancer patient cohorts, we demonstrated that simultaneous loss of PTEN and hemidesmosomes induced several tumorigenic properties including proliferation, migration, resistance to anoikis, apoptosis, and drug treatment in vitro, and increased metastatic capacity in vivo. Our studies showed that these effects were driven by activation of EGFR/PI3K/Akt and FAK/Src-pathways and were abolished by plectin downregulation. Therefore, dual loss of PTEN and hemidesmosomes may have diagnostic value helping to stratify prostate cancer patients with high risk for development of aggressive disease and highlight plectin as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Illuminating the mechanisms of inflorescence architecture of grain crops that feed our world may strengthen the goal towards sustainable agriculture. Lateral spikelet development of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is such an example of a floral architectural trait regulated by VRS1 (Vulgare Row-type Spike 1 or Six-rowed Spike 1, syn. HvHOX1). Its lateral spikelet-specific expression and the quantitative nature of suppressing spikelet development were previously shown in barley. However, the mechanistic function of this gene and its paralog HvHOX2 on spikelet development is still fragmentary.Here, we show that these duplicated transcription factors (TFs) have contrasting nucleotide diversity in various barley genotypes and several Hordeum species. Despite this difference, both proteins retain their basic properties of the homeodomain leucine zipper class I family of TFs. During spikelet development, these genes exhibit similar spatiotemporal expression patterns yet with anticyclic expression levels. A gene co-expression network analysis suggested that both have an ancestral relationship but their functions appear antagonistic to each other, i.e., HvHOX1 suppresses whereas HvHOX2 rather promotes spikelet development. Our transgenic promoter-swap analysis showed that HvHOX2 can restore suppressed lateral spikelets when expression levels are increased; however, at its low endogenous expression level, HvHOX2 appears dispensable for spikelet development. Collectively, this study proposes that the dosage of the two antagonistic TFs, HvHOX1 and HvHOX2, influence spikelet development in barley.",

We previously showed that the transcription factor GLK1 acts downstream of the RS-regulator GUN1 in photodamaging conditions to regulate not only the well-established expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs) but also to regulate seedling morphogenesis. Specifically, the GUN1/GLK1 module inhibits the light-induced PIF-repressed transcriptional network to suppress cotyledon development when chloroplast integrity is compromised, modulating the area exposed to potentially damaging high light. However, how the GUN1/GLK1 module inhibits photomorphogenesis upon chloroplast damage remained undefined.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we report the identification of BBX16 as a novel direct target of GLK1. BBX16 is induced and promotes photomorphogenesis in moderate light and it is repressed via GUN1/GLK1 after chloroplast damage.

    "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well-established model to study numerous cellular processes including cell motility, chemotaxis, and differentiation. As energy metabolism is involved in these processes, mitochondrial genetics and bioenergetics are of interest, though many features of Dictyostelium mitochondria differ from metazoans. A comprehensive inventory of mitochondrial proteins is critical to understanding mitochondrial processes and their involvement in various cellular pathways. Here, we utilized high-throughput multiplexed protein quantitation and homology analyses to generate a high-confidence mitochondrial protein compendium. Our proteomic approach, which utilizes quantitative mass spectrometry in combination with mathematical modeling, was validated through mitochondrial targeting sequence prediction and live-cell imaging. Our final compendium consists of 1082 proteins. Within our D. discoideum mitochondrial proteome, we identify many proteins that are not present in humans, yeasts, or the ancestral alpha-proteobacteria, which can serve as a foundation for future investigations into the unique mitochondria of Dictyostelium. Additionally, we leverage our compendium to highlight the complexity of metabolic reprogramming during starvation-induced development. Our compendium lays a foundation to investigate mitochondrial processes that are unique in protists, as well as for future studies to understand the functions of conserved mitochondrial proteins in health and diseases using D. discoideum as the model.",

    "abstract": "In complex natural environments, sensory systems are constantly exposed to a large stream of inputs. Novel or rare stimuli, which are often associated with behaviorally important events, are typically processed differently than the steady sensory background, which has less relevance. Neural signatures of such differential processing, commonly referred to as novelty detection, have been identified on the level of EEG recordings as mismatch negativity and the level of single neurons as stimulus-specific adaptation. Here, we propose a multi-scale recurrent network with synaptic depression to explain how novelty detection can arise in the whisker-related part of the somatosensory thalamocortical loop. The architecture and dynamics of the model presume that neurons in cortical layer 6 adapt, via synaptic depression, specifically to a frequently presented stimulus, resulting in reduced population activity in the corresponding cortical column when compared with the population activity evoked by a rare stimulus. This difference in population activity is then projected from the cortex to the thalamus and amplified through the interaction between neurons of the primary and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, resulting in spindle-like, rhythmic oscillations. These differentially activated thalamic oscillations are forwarded to cortical layer 4 as a late secondary response that is specific to rare stimuli that violate a particular stimulus pattern. Model results show a strong analogy between this late single neuron activity and EEG-based mismatch negativity in terms of their common sensitivity to presentation context and timescales of response latency, as observed experimentally. Our results indicate that adaptation in L6 can establish the thalamocortical dynamics that produce signatures of SSA and MMN and suggest a mechanistic model of novelty detection that could generalize to other sensory modalities.\n\nAuthor summaryCortical sensory neurons have been shown to be capable of novelty detection, that is they respond more vigorously when a novel, unexpected stimulus is presented, and less so when the stimulus is part of a predictable sequence. However, the neural mechanism underlying this capability is not yet fully understood. Here, we developed a thalamocortical network model that accounts for novelty detection and reproduces physiologically observed neural response patterns in the somatosensory cortex. Specifically, our results demonstrate that the novelty signal arises from the complex recurrent interplay between thalamic neurons and cortical neurons in layers 4 and 6. This work therefore provides a concrete mechanism that can serve as a starting point for further investigating the neural circuit mechanisms underlying novelty detection.",

    "abstract": "The development of antivirals against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been hampered by the lack of efficient cell-based replication systems that are amenable to high-throughput screens in biosafety level 2 laboratories. Here we report that stable cell clones harboring autonomously replicating SARS-CoV-2 RNAs without S, M, E genes can be efficiently derived from the baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell line when a pair of mutations were introduced into the non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) of SARS-CoV-2 to ameliorate cellular toxicity associated with virus replication. In a proof-of-concept experiment we screened a 273-compound library using replicon cells and identified three compounds as novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Altogether, this work establishes a robust, cell-based system for genetic and functional analyses of SARS-CoV-2 replication and for the development of antiviral drugs.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 replicon systems that have been reported up to date were unsuccessful in deriving stable cell lines harboring non-cytopathic replicons. The transient expression of viral sgmRNA or a reporter gene makes it impractical for industry-scale screening of large compound libraries using these systems. Here, for the first time, we derived stable cell clones harboring the SARS-CoV-2 replicon. These clones may now be conveniently cultured in a standard BSL-2 laboratory for high throughput screen of compound libraries. This achievement represents a ground-breaking discovery that will greatly accelerate the pace of developing treatments for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) repair is essential to safeguard genome integrity but the contribution of chromosome folding into this process remains elusive. Here we unveiled basic principles of chromosome dynamics upon DSBs in mammalian cells, controlled by key kinases from the DNA Damage Response. We report that ATM is responsible for the reinforcement of topologically associating domains (TAD) that experience a DSB. ATM further drives the formation of a new chromatin sub-compartment (\"D\" compartment) upon clustering of damaged TADs decorated with {gamma}H2AX and 53BP1. \"D\" compartment formation mostly occurs in G1, is independent of cohesin and is enhanced upon DNA-PK pharmacological inhibition. Importantly, a subset of DNA damage responsive genes that are upregulated following DSBs also physically localize in the D sub-compartment and this ensures their optimal activation, providing a function for DSB clustering in activating the DNA Damage Response. However, these DSB-induced changes in genome organization also come at the expense of an increased translocations rate, which we could also detect on cancer genomes. Overall, our work provides a function for DSB-induced compartmentalization in orchestrating the DNA Damage Response and highlights the critical impact of chromosome architecture in genomic instability.",

    "abstract": "Sexually reproducing animals segregate their germline from their soma. In addition to gamete-producing gonads, planarian and parasitic flatworm reproduction relies on yolk-cell-generating accessory reproductive organs (vitellaria) supporting development of yolkless oocytes. Despite the importance of vitellaria for flatworm reproduction (and parasite transmission), little is known about this unique evolutionary innovation. Here we examine reproductive system development in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, in which pluripotent stem cells generate both somatic and germ cell lineages. We show that a homolog of the pluripotency factor Klf4 is expressed in primordial germ cells, presumptive germline stem cells, and yolk-cell progenitors. klf4 knockdown animals fail to specify or maintain germ cells; surprisingly, they also fail to maintain yolk cells. We find that yolk cells display germ-cell-like attributes and that vitellaria are structurally analogous to gonads. In addition to identifying a new proliferative cell population in planarians (yolk cell progenitors) and defining its niche, our work provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that flatworm germ cells and yolk cells share a common evolutionary origin.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEusocial insects play a central role in many ecosystems, and particularly the important pollinator honeybee (Apis mellifera). One approach to facilitate their study in molecular genetics, is to consider whole colonies as single individuals by combining DNA of multiple individuals in a single pool sequencing experiment. Such a technique comes with the drawback of producing data requiring dedicated analytical methods to be fully exploited. Despite this limitation, pool sequencing data has been shown to be informative and cost-effective when working on random mating populations. Here, we present new statistical methods for exploiting pool sequencing data of eusocial colonies in order to reconstruct the genotype of the colony founder, the queen. This leverages the possibility to monitor genetic diversity, perform genomic-based studies or implement selective breeding.\n\nResultsUsing simulations and honeybee real data, we show that the methods allow for a fast and accurate estimation of the genetic ancestry, with correlations of 0.9 with that obtained from individual genotyping, and for an accurate reconstruction of the queen genotype, with 2% genotyping error. We further validate the inference using experimental data on colonies with both pool sequencing and individual genotyping of drones.\n\nConclusionIn this study we present statistical models to accurately estimate the genetic ancestry and reconstruct the genotype of the queen from pool sequencing data from workers of an eusocial colony. Such information allows to exploit pool sequencing for traditional population genetics, association studies and selective breeding. While validated in Apis mellifera, these methods are applicable to other eusocial hymenoptera species.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), is the most common complex disease affecting bone and constitutes a major societal health problem. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 1100 associations influencing BMD. It has been shown that perturbations to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) influence BMD and the activities of bone cells; however, the extent to which lncRNAs are involved in the genetic regulation of BMD is unknown. Here, we combined the analysis of allelic imbalance (AI) in human acetabular bone fragments with a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) colocalization analysis using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to identify lncRNAs potentially responsible for GWAS associations. We identified 27 lncRNAs in bone that are located in proximity to a BMD GWAS association and harbor SNPs demonstrating AI. Using GTEx data we identified an additional 31 lncRNAs whose expression was associated (FDR correction<0.05) with BMD through TWAS and had a colocalizing eQTL (regional colocalization probability (RCP)>0.1). The 58 lncRNAs are located in 43 BMD associations. To further support a causal role for the identified lncRNAs, we show that 23 of the 58 lncRNAs are differentially expressed as a function of osteoblast differentiation.

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins play essential role in cellular mechanisms. Despite that and the major progress in experimental structure determination, they are still significantly underrepresented in Protein Data Bank. Thus, computational approaches to protein structure determination, which are important in general, are especially valuable in the case of membrane proteins and protein-protein assemblies. Due to a number of reasons, not the least of which is much greater availability of structural data, the main focus of structure prediction techniques has been on soluble proteins. Structure prediction of protein-protein complexes is a well-developed field of study. However, because of the differences in physicochemical environment in the membranes and the spatial constraints of the membranes, the generic protein-protein docking approaches are not optimal for the membrane proteins. Thus, specialized computational methods for docking of the membrane proteins must be developed. Development and benchmarking of such methods requires high-quality datasets of membrane protein-protein complexes. In this study we present a new dataset of 456 non-redundant alpha helical binary complexes. The set is significantly larger and more representative than previously developed ones. In the future, this set will become the basis for the development of docking and scoring benchmarks, similar to the ones developed for soluble proteins in the DOCKGROUND resource http://dockground.compbio.ku.edu.",

    "abstract": "1Osteoarthritis (OA) is a whole joint disease that affects all knee joint tissues. Ligaments, a matrix-rich connective tissue, play an important mechanical function that stabilises the knee joint and yet their role in OA is not well studied. Recent studies have shown that ligament extracellular matrix (ECM) structure is compromised in the early stages of OA, but it remains unclear how this affects ligament function and biomechanics. In this study, the aim was to investigate the structural, cellular and viscoelastic changes in the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a murine non-invasive post-traumatic OA (PTOA) model. Non-invasive mechanical loading of the knee joint of C57BL/6J mice (10-week-old) was used as a PTOA model. Knee joints were analysed for joint space mineralisation and the ACLs were assessed with histology and mechanical testing. PTOA knee joints had a 33-46% increase in joint space mineralisation and PTOA knee joint ACLs exhibited ECM modifications, including collagen birefringence and COL2 and proteoglycan deposition. ECM changes were associated with cells expressing chondrogenic markers (SOX9 and RUNX2) expanding from the tibial enthesis to the ACL midbody. Viscoelastic and mechanical changes in the ACLs from PTOA knee joints included a 20-21% decrease in tangent modulus at 2MPa of stress, and a decrease strain rate sensitivity at higher strain rates and a significant increase in relaxation during stress-relaxation, but no changes to hysteresis and ultimate load to failure. These results demonstrate that ACL pathology and viscoelastic function is compromised in murine PTOA knee joints and provides further evidence of the important role of ligaments in the knee joint organ in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Ovulation is a dramatic remodeling process that includes rupture of blood capillaries and clotting, but coagulation is not thought to directly regulate this process. Herein, we report remarkable increases of coagulation factors V (f5, [~]3145-fold) and tissue factor (f3a, [~]120-fold) in zebrafish ovarian follicle cells during ovulation. This increase was mediated through the nuclear progestin receptor (Pgr), which is essential for ovulation in zebrafish, and was totally abolished in ovarian follicular cells from pgr-/- mutants. In addition, promoter activities of f5 and f3a were significantly enhanced by progestin (DHP) via Pgr. Similar regulation of human F5 promoter activity was induced via human PGRB, suggesting a conserved mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis of the zebrafish f5 promoter further demonstrated a direct regulation of coagulation factors via progestin response elements. Moreover, a stark increase of erythrocytes occurred in capillaries meshed in wildtype preovulatory follicles but was absent in pgr-/- mutants. Interestingly, anticoagulants significantly inhibited ovulation both in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Furthermore, reduced fecundity was observed in f5+/- female zebrafish. Taken together, our study provides plausible evidence for steroid regulation of coagulation factors, and a new hypothesis for blood clotting triggered ovulation in vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Senolytic treatment in aged mice clears senescent cell burden leading to functional improvements. However, less is known regarding the effects of these compounds when administered prior to significant senescent cell accumulation. From 4-13 months of age, C57BL/6 male and female mice received monthly oral dosing of either 100 mg/kg Fisetin or a 5 mg/kg Dasatinib (D) plus 50 mg/kg Quercetin (Q) cocktail. During treatment, several aspects of healthy aging were assayed including glucose metabolism using an insulin and glucose tolerance test, cognitive performance using Morris water maze and novel object recognition, and energy metabolism using indirect calorimetry. Afterwards, mice were euthanized for plasma and tissue specific markers of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and white adipose tissue accumulation (WAT). Sexually dimorphic treatment effects were observed. Fisetin treated male mice had reduced SASP, enhanced glucose and energy metabolism, improved cognitive performance, and increased mRNA expression of adiponectin receptor 1 and glucose transporter 4. D+Q treatment had minimal effects in male C57BL/6 mice, but was detrimental to females causing increased SASP expression along with accumulation of WAT depots. Reduced energy metabolism and cognitive performance were also noted. Fisetin treatment had no effect in female C57BL/6 mice potentially due to a slower rate of biological aging. In summary, the senolytic treatment in young adulthood, has beneficial, negligible, or detrimental effects in C57BL/6 mice dependent upon sex and treatment. These observations should serve as a note of caution in this rapidly evolving and expanding field of investigation.\n\nGraphical AbstractMale and female C57BL/6 mice were treated with once monthly oral doses of either Dasatinib (D) + Quercetin (Q) or Fisetin from 4-13 months of age. Females treated with D+Q had increased adiposity and SASP markers (red spheres) along with decreased metabolism (blue flame) and cognitive performance. Males treated with Fisetin had reduced SASP markers (blue spheres) as well as improved metabolism (red flame) and cognition. No effects were observed in females treated with Fisetin or males treated with D+Q.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467509v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7f450org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8b32forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14be597org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce31af_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Infrared laser stimulation has been studied as an alternative approach to auditory prostheses. This study evaluated the feasibility of infrared laser stimulation of the cochlea from the outer ear bypassing the middle ear function. An optic fiber was inserted into the ear canal and a laser was used to irradiate the cochlea through the tympanic membrane in Mongolian gerbil. A pulsed infrared laser (10.1 mJ/cm2) and clicking sound (70 peak-to-peak equivalent sound pressure level) were presented to the animals. The amplitude of the laser-evoked cochlear response was systematically decreased following insertion of a filter between the tympanic membrane and cochlea; however, the auditory-evoked cochlear response did not decrease. The filter was removed and the laser-evoked response returned to around the original level. The amplitude ratio and the relative change in response amplitude before and during filter insertion significantly decreased as the absorbance of the infrared filter increased. These results indicate that laser irradiation could bypass the function of the middle ear and directly activate the cochlea. Therefore, an auditory prosthesis based on laser stimulation represents a possible noninvasive alternative to conventional auditory prostheses requiring surgical implants.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe autoimmune response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is marked by anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). A remarkable feature of ACPA-IgG is the abundant expression of N-linked glycans in the variable domain. Nonetheless, the presence of ACPA variable domain glycans (VDG) across disease stages and its response to therapy is poorly described. To understand its dynamics, we investigated the abundance of ACPA-IgG VDG in 1574 samples from individuals in different clinical disease stages.\n\nMethodsUsing liquid chromatography, we analyzed ACPA-IgG VDG profiles of 7 different cohorts from Japan, Canada, the Netherlands and Sweden. We assessed 184 healthy, 228 pre-symptomatic, 277 arthralgia, 305 patients at RA-onset and 117 RA-patients 4, 8 and 12 months after disease onset. Additionally, we measured VDG of 234 samples from RA-patients that did or did not achieve long-term drug-free remission (DFR) during up to 16 years follow-up.\n\nResultsOur data show that ACPA-IgG VDG significantly increases (p<0.0001) towards disease-onset and associates with ACPA-levels and epitope spreading pre-diagnosis. A slight increase in VDG was observed in established RA and a moderate influence of treatment. Individuals who later achieved DFR displayed reduced ACPA-IgG VDG already at RA-onset.\n\nConclusionThe abundance of ACPA-IgG VDG rises towards RA-onset and correlates with maturation of the ACPA-response. Although, ACPA-IgG VDG levels are rather stable in established disease, a lower degree at RA-onset correlates with DFR. Even though the underlying biological mechanisms are still elusive, our data support the concept that VDG relates to an expansion of the ACPA-response pre-disease and contributes to disease-development.",

    "abstract": "Memory B cells (MBCs) and plasma antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens are important components of the protective immune response against malaria. To gain understanding of how responses against P. falciparum develop in these two arms of the humoral immune system, we evaluated MBC and antibody responses against the most abundant merozoite antigen, merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), in individuals from a region in Uganda with high P. falciparum transmission. Our results showed that MSP1-specific B cells in adults with immunological protection against malaria were predominantly IgG+ classical MBCs, while children with incomplete protection mainly harbored IgM+ MSP1-specific classical MBCs. In contrast, anti-MSP1 plasma IgM reactivity was minimal in both children and adults. Instead, both groups showed high plasma IgG reactivity against MSP1 and whole merozoites, with broadening of the response against non-3D7 strains in adults. The antibodies encoded by MSP1-specific IgG+ MBCs carried high levels of amino acid substitutions and recognized relatively conserved epitopes on the highly variable MSP1 protein. Proteomics analysis of MSP119-specific IgG in plasma of an adult revealed a limited repertoire of anti-MSP1 antibodies, most of which were IgG1 or IgG3. Similar to MSP1- specific MBCs, anti-MSP1 IgGs had relatively high levels of amino acid substitutions and their sequences were predominantly found in classical MBCs, not atypical MBCs. Collectively, these results showed evolution of the MSP1-specific humoral immune response with cumulative P. falciparum exposure, with a shift from IgM+ to IgG+ B cell memory, diversification of B cells from germline, and stronger recognition of MSP1 variants by the plasma IgG repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common bacterial infections observed in humans. Postmenopausal women are a rapidly growing and underserved demographic group who are severely affected by recurrent UTI (rUTI) with a >50% recurrence rate. In this population, rUTI can persist for years, reducing quality of life and imposing a significant healthcare burden. rUTI is most often treated by antibiotics, but development of antibiotic resistance and allergy limit therapeutic options. The female urinary microbiome (urobiome) has been identified as a key component of the urogenital environment. However, compositional and functional changes in the urobiome underlying rUTI susceptibility in postmenopausal women are not well understood. Here, we used a controlled, cross-sectional cohort of postmenopausal women, to interrogate changes in urobiome structure and function linked to rUTI susceptibility by whole genome metagenomic sequencing (WGMS), advanced urine culture, estrogen metabolite profiling, and antibiotic sensitivity testing. Overall, we detected 276 bacterial, archaeal, and fungal species representing 106 genera. We find a putative commensal population consisting of species known to protect against bacterial vaginosis, such as Lactobacillus crispatus, within the urobiome of postmenopausal women who do not experience UTI. Integration of clinical metadata detected an almost exclusive enrichment of lactobacilli, including L. crispatus and L. vaginalis, in women taking estrogen hormone therapy (EHT). Integrating quantitative metabolite profiling of urinary estrogens with WGMS, we observed robust correlations between urobiome taxa, such as Bifidobacterium breve and L. crispatus, and urinary estrogen conjugate concentrations in women with no history of UTI that were absent in women with rUTI history. We further used functional metagenomic profiling and patient-derived isolate phenotyping to identify microbial metabolic pathways, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance phenotypes enriched between disease-states. Our data indicate that distinct urobiome metabolic and ARG signatures are associated with current rUTI status and history. Importantly, we observed that rUTI history leaves an imprint of enriched ARGs even in women not currently experiencing UTI. Taken together, our data suggests that rUTI history and estrogen strongly shape the functional and taxonomic composition of the urobiome in postmenopausal women.",

In order to prove its versatility, we applied our method to three DNA polymerases commonly used in biotechnology, including the Phi29 (mesophilic), Taq and Pfu polymerases, and one restriction enzyme. Light-start enzymes showed suppressed polymerase, exonuclease and endonuclease activity until they were re-activated by an UV pulse.

    "abstract": "Since prehistoric times, South Central Asia has been at the crossroads of the movement of people, culture, and goods. Today, the Central Asias populations are divided into two cultural and linguistic groups: the Indo-Iranian and the Turko-Mongolian groups. Previous genetic studies unveiled that migrations from East Asia contributed to the spread of Turko-Mongolian populations in Central Asia and the partial replacement of the Indo-Iranian population. However, little is known about the origin of the latter. To shed light on this, we compare the genetic data on two current-day populations- Yaghnobis and Tajiks - with genome-wide data from published ancient individuals. The present Indo-Iranian populations from Central Asia display a strong genetic continuity with Iron Age samples from Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. We model Yaghnobis as a mixture of 93% Iron Age individual from Turkmenistan and 7% from Baikal. For the Tajiks, we observe a higher Baikal ancestry and an additional admixture event with a South Asian population. Our results, therefore, suggest that in addition to a complex history, Central Asia shows a remarkable genetic continuity since the Iron Age, with only limited gene flow.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Smith-Waterman-Gotoh alignment algorithm is the most popular method for comparing biological sequences. Recently, Single Instruction Multiple Data methods have been used to speed up alignment. However, these algorithms have limitations like being optimized for specific scoring schemes, cannot handle large gaps, or require quadratic time computation.\n\nResultsWe propose a new algorithm called block aligner for aligning nucleotide and protein sequences. It greedily shifts and grows a block of computed scores to span large gaps within the aligned sequences. This greedy approach is able to only compute a fraction of the DP matrix. In exchange for these features, there is no guarantee that the computed scores are accurate compared to full DP. However, in our experiments, we show that block aligner performs accurately on various realistic datasets, and it is up to 9 times faster than the popular Farrars algorithm for protein global alignments.\n\nConclusionsOur algorithm has applications in computing global alignments and X-drop alignments on proteins and long reads. It is available as a Rust library at https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/block-aligner.",

    "abstract": "Tumor cell extensions called tumor microtubes (TMs) in glioma resemble neurites during neurodevelopment and connect glioma cells to a network that has considerable relevance for tumor progression and therapy resistance. The determination of interconnectivity in individual tumors has been challenging and the impact of tumor cell connectivity on patient survival remained unresolved so far. Here, a connectivity signature from single-cell RNA-sequenced (scRNA-Seq) xenografted primary glioblastoma (GB) cells was established and clinically validated. Thirty-four of 40 connectivity genes were related to neurogenesis, neural tube development or glioma progression, including the TM-network-relevant GAP43 gene. Astrocytic-like and mesenchymal-like GB cells had the highest connectivity signature scores in scRNA-Seq data of patient-derived xenografts and patient samples. In 230 human GBs, high connectivity correlated with the mesenchymal expression subtype, TP53 wildtype, and with dismal patient survival. CHI3L1 was identified as a robust molecular marker of connectivity. Thus, the connectivity signature allows novel insights into brain tumor biology, provides a proof-of-principle that tumor cell connectivity is relevant for patients prognosis, and serves as a robust biomarker that can be used for future clinical trials.\n\nStatement of significanceIntegration of GB cells into functional networks drives tumor progression and resistance. Here, we established and validated a novel connectivity gene expression signature of single GB cells and whole tumors that can be easily applied to clinical and preclinical samples. It is shown that connectivity is determining prognosis combining molecular, functional and clinical insights into the disease.",

One of the most important related factors is the idea of making research output freely available: the so-called Open Access (OA) option. OA is considered very important in spreading of knowledge, breaking down barriers in benefit of research, and increasing the impact of research outputs within the scientific community.\n\nHere, we carried out a comparison between Non-Open Access (NOA) and OA medical Journals in terms of growing rate, geographical distribution, and the impact on scientific community.\n\nWe collected the bibliometric data on the scientific Journals indexed in Scopus starting from 2001 to 2016 published either as NOA or OA. Then, we analysed the number of Journals, their geolocalization, their impact on the scientific community, and the parameters as SJR, H index, and cites for document (2 years).\n\nAs a result, we found that while the number of NOA Journals is virtually stable, that of OA is dramatically increasing, with a growing rate higher than 400% in 2016. Then, the majority of OA Journals are published in developing Countries (Brazil, India, South Africa, South Korea, New Zealand, Serbia, and Poland) and their impact within researchers is lower compared to the NOA Journals.\n\nIn conclusion, our data provide an updated and unprecedented picture of OA adoption in medical field, with its lights and shadows.\n\nArticle HighlightsO_LIWe are seeing in medicine a huge increase in the number of Journals that use OA;\nC_LIO_LIThis trend is mainly due to the increase in publishing Journals in Countries with emergent economies;\nC_LIO_LIThe use of OA for Journals in the medical field, did not guarantee a vantage in term of bibliometric parameters.\nC_LI\n\nMCS92C99\n\nJELI30",

    "abstract": "Vaccines are among the most cost-effective public health interventions for preventing infection-induced morbidity and mortality, yet much remains to be learned regarding the mechanisms by which vaccines protect. Systems immunology combines traditional immunology with modern  omic profiling techniques and computational modeling to promote rapid and transformative advances in vaccinology and vaccine discovery. The NIH/NIAID Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) has leveraged systems immunology approaches to identify molecular signatures associated with the immunogenicity of many vaccines, including those targeting seasonal influenza, yellow fever, and hepatitis B. These data are made available to the broader scientific community through the ImmuneSpace data portal and analysis engine leveraging the NIH/NIAID ImmPort repository1,2. However, a barrier to progress in this area is that comparative analyses have been limited by the distributed nature of some data, potential batch effects across studies, and the absence of multiple relevant studies from non-HIPC groups in ImmPort. To support comparative analyses across different vaccines, we have created the Immune Signatures Data Resource, a compendium of standardized systems vaccinology datasets. This data resource is available through ImmuneSpace, along with code to reproduce the processing and batch normalization starting from the underlying study data in ImmPort and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The current release comprises 1405 participants from 53 cohorts profiling the response to 24 different vaccines and includes transcriptional profiles and antibody response measurements. This novel systems vaccinology data release represents a valuable resource for comparative and meta-analyses that will accelerate our understanding of mechanisms underlying vaccine responses.\n\n\n[Table 1]",

Successful SRI was defined as either the absence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration after phosphate buffer saline injection and the presence of RPE degeneration after Alu RNA injection. Multivariable survival-time regression models were used to evaluate the association between surgeon experience and success rate, with adjustment for injection agents, and to calculate an approximate case number to achieve a 95% success rate. A Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) analysis was performed and plotted individually to monitor each surgeons simultaneous performance.\n\nRO_SCPLOWESULTSC_SCPLOWDespite prior microsurgery experience, the combined average success rate of the first 50 cases in mice was only 27%. The predicted SRI success rate did not reach a plateau above 95% until approximately 364 prior cases.

A multidimensional analysis technique demonstrated that for radio-speech sound files, a brain network matching known auditory perception networks emerged, and importantly, displayed speech-duration-dependent hemodynamic responses (HDRs), confirming fMRI detection of these speech events. In the hallucination-capture data, although a sensorimotor (response) network emerged, it did not show hallucination-duration-dependent HDRs.

    "abstract": "As ribosomes translate the genetic code, they can encounter a variety of obstacles that hinder their progress. If ribosomes stall for prolonged times, cells suffer due to the loss of translating ribosomes and the accumulation of aberrant protein products. Thus to protect cells, stalled ribosomes experience a series of reactions to relieve the stall and degrade the offending mRNA, a process known as No-Go mRNA Decay (NGD). While much of the machinery for NGD is known, the precise ordering of events and factors along this pathway has not been tested. Here, we deploy C. elegans to unravel the coordinated events comprising NGD. Utilizing a novel reporter and forward and reverse genetics, we identify the machinery required for NGD. Our subsequent molecular analyses define a functional requirement for ubiquitination on at least two ribosomal proteins (eS10 and uS10), and we show that ribosomes lacking ubiquitination sites on eS10 and uS10 fail to perform NGD in vivo. We show that the nuclease NONU-1 acts after the ubiquitin ligase ZNF-598, and discover a novel requirement for the ribosome rescue factors HBS-1/PELO-1 in mRNA decay via NONU-1. Taken together, our work demonstrates mechanisms by which ribosomes signal to effectors of mRNA repression, and we delineate links between repressive factors working toward a well-defined NGD pathway.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRibosomes are large molecular machines entrusted with the essential task of reading mRNAs and building proteins. It is critical that ribosomes proceed with their work undeterred, so as to avoid traffic jams between ribosomes on mRNAs; however, they sometimes experience challenges which make traffic jams unavoidable. In these cases, cells have evolved machinery to clean up stalled ribosomes and remove offending mRNAs. Much of this machinery is now identified, but the relationships between factors has yet to be tested. Here, in C. elegans we identify the machinery that responds to stalls, and we order factors relative to one another. We find that ribosomes must be tagged by ubiquitin to signal mRNA decay, as ribosomes lacking ubiquitin sites fail to elicit mRNA decay. Furthermore, we find that these ubiquitin signals recruit an enzyme which cuts mRNA, and we present evidence that ribosome rescue factors are required for the mRNA decay reaction as well. Overall, our work provides new connections between factors orchestrating the elimination of problematic mRNAs that stall ribosomes.",

    "abstract": "The strength of pairing of homologous chromosomes differs in a locus-specific manner and is correlated to gene expression states. However, the functional impact of homolog pairing on local transcriptional activity is still unclear. Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs) constantly divide asymmetrically to produce one GSC and one differentiating gonialblast (GB). The GB then enters the differentiation program in which stem cell specific genes are quickly downregulated. Here we demonstrate that a change in local pairing state of the Stat92E locus is required for the downregulation of the Stat92E gene during differentiation. Using OligoPaint fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), we show that the interaction between homologous regions of Stat92E is always tight in GSCs and immediately loosened in GBs. When one of the Stat92E locus was absent or relocated to another chromosome, Stat92E did not pair and failed to downregulate, suggesting that the pairing is required for switching of transcriptional activity. The defect in downregulation of Stat92E was also observed upon knockdown of global pairing or anti-pairing factors. Moreover, the Stat92E enhancer element, but not cis-transcription, is required for the change in pairing state, indicating that it is not a consequence of transcriptional changes. GSCs are known to inherit pre-existing histones H3 and H4, while newly synthesized histones are distributed in GBs. When this histone inheritance was compromised, the change in Stat92E pairing did not occur, suggesting that it is an intrinsically programmed process during asymmetric stem cell division. We propose that the change of local pairing state may be a common process to reprogram gene activity during cell-differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The testis is a key male reproductive organ that produces gametes through the process of spermatogenesis. Testis morphologies and spermatogenesis evolve rapidly in mammals, presumably due to the evolutionary pressure on males to be reproductively successful1,2. The rapid evolution of the testis was shown to be reflected at the molecular level based on bulk-tissue work3-8, but the molecular evolution of individual spermatogenic cell types across mammalian lineages remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report evolutionary analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome data for testes from eleven species that cover the three major mammalian lineages (eutherians, marsupials, egg-laying monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), and include seven key primates. Our analyses reveal that the rapid evolution of the testis is driven by accelerated fixation rates of gene expression changes, amino acid altering substitutions, and newly emerged genes in late spermatogenic stages - likely facilitated by reduced pleiotropic constraints, haploid selection, and a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. We identify temporal expression changes of individual genes across species, which may have contributed to the emergence of species-specific phenotypes, but also conserved expression programs underlying ancestral spermatogenic processes. Sex chromosome analyses show that genes predominantly expressed in spermatogonia (i.e., germ cells fueling spermatogenesis) and Sertoli cells (i.e., somatic supporting cells) independently accumulated on X chromosomes across mammals during evolution, presumably due to male-beneficial selective forces. Further work uncovered that the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) also occurs in monotremes and hence is common to the different mammalian sex chromosome systems, contrary to previous inferences9. Thus, the general mechanism of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which underlies MSCI, represents an ancestral mammalian feature. Together, our study illuminates the cellular and molecular evolution of mammalian spermatogenesis and associated selective forces, and provides a resource for investigating the biology of the testis across mammals.",

Based on RNA-seq data from 15 CM and 15 uncomplicated malaria (UM) children from Benin, we identified an increased ring stage signature in CM parasites. Reduced circulating time may result from a higher adherence ability of CM isolates and consistent with this hypothesis, we measured an overexpression of var genes in CM. var genes domains expression was more restricted in CM isolates compared to UM, reflecting the specific binding to receptors in host brain endothelium capillaries. However, ICAM-1 binding motif was found expressed in both CM and UM, questioning its role in PfEMP1 adhesion to ICAM-1 receptor. UM isolates increased circulation time may also be modulated by a more efficient immune response against infected erythrocytes surface proteins, which we could not demonstrate on our cohort. Identification of deregulated genes involved in adhesion, excluding variant surface antigens, also supports the hypothesis of an increased CM adhesion capacity. Finally, numerous upregulated genes involved in entry into host pathway were found, reflecting a greater erythrocytes invasion capacity of CM parasites.",

    "abstract": "During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus underwent mutation and recombination events that altered its genome compositional structure, thus providing an unprecedented opportunity to search for adaptive evolutionary trends in real-time. The mutation rate in coronavirus is known to be lower than expected for neutral evolution, thus suggesting a role for natural selection. We summarize the compositional heterogeneity of each viral genome by computing its Sequence Compositional Complexity (SCC). To study the full range of SCC diversity, random samples of high-quality coronavirus genomes covering pandemic time span were analyzed. We then search for evolutionary trends that could inform on the adaptive process of the virus to its human host by computing the phylogenetic ridge regression of SCC against time (i.e., the collection date of each viral isolate). In early samples, we find no statistical support for any trend in SCC, although the viral genome appears to evolve faster than Brownian Motion (BM) expectation. However, in samples taken after the emergence of high fitness variants, and despite the brief time span elapsed, a driven decreasing trend for SCC, and an increasing one for its absolute evolutionary rate, are detected, pointing to a role for selection in the evolution of SCC in coronavirus genomes. We conclude that the higher fitness of variant genomes leads to adaptive trends of SCC over pandemic time in the coronavirus.",

    "abstract": "A fascinating class of familial paraganglioma (PGL) neuroendocrine tumors is driven by loss of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) resulting in succinate accumulation as an oncometabolite, and other metabolic derangements. Here we exploit a S. cerevisiae yeast model of SDH loss where accumulating succinate, and possibly reactive oxygen species, poison a dioxygenase enzyme required for sulfur scavenging. Using this model we performed a chemical suppression screen for compounds that relieve dioxygenase inhibition. After testing 1280 pharmaceutically-active compounds we identified meclofenoxate HCL, and its hydrolysis product, dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), as suppressors of dioxygenase intoxication in SDH-loss cells. We show that DMAE acts to alter metabolism so as to normalize the succinate:2-ketoglutarate ratio, improving dioxygenase function. This work raises the possibility that oncometabolite effects might be therapeutically suppressed by drugs that rewire metabolism to reduce the flux of carbon into pathological metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division is coordinated by the Z-ring, a cytoskeletal structure of treadmilling filaments of FtsZ and their membrane anchors, FtsA and ZipA. For divisome maturation and initiation of constriction, the widely conserved actin-homolog FtsA plays a central role, as it links downstream cell division proteins in the membrane to the Z-ring in the cytoplasm. According to the current model, FtsA initiates cell constriction by switching from an inactive polymeric conformation to an active monomeric form, which then stabilizes the Z-ring and recruits downstream proteins such as FtsN. However, direct biochemical evidence for this mechanism is missing so far. Here, we used biochemical reconstitution experiments in combination with quantitative fluorescence microscopy to study the mechanism of divisome activation in vitro. By comparing the properties of wildtype FtsA and FtsA R286W, a gain-of-function mutant thought to mimic its active state, we found that active FtsA outperforms the wildtype protein in replicating FtsZ treadmilling dynamics, filament stabilization and FtsN recruitment. We could attribute these differences to a faster membrane exchange of FtsA R286W as well as its higher packing density below FtsZ filaments. Using FRET microscopy, we also show that binding of FtsN does not compete with, but promotes FtsA self-interaction. Together, our findings shed new light on the assembly and activation of the bacterial cell division machinery and the mechanism of how FtsA initiates cell constriction.",

The limited correlations between corresponding transcript and protein abundance suggest that regulatory processes tightly govern information flow surrounding transcription and translation, and beyond. In this study we adopt an approach which expands the feature scope that models the human proteome: we develop machine learning models that incorporate sequence-derived features (SDFs), sometimes in conjunction with corresponding mRNA levels. We develop a large resource of sequence-derived features which cover a significant proportion of the H. sapiens proteome, demonstrate which of these features are significant in prediction on multiple cell lines, and suggest insights into which biological processes can be explained using these features. We reveal that (a) SDFs are significantly better at protein abundance prediction across multiple cell lines both in steady-state and dynamic contexts, (b) that SDFs can cover the domain of translation with relative efficiency but struggle with cell-line specific pathways and (c) provide a resource which can be plugged into many subsequent protein-centric analyses.",

    "abstract": "The high mutation rate of COVID-19 and the prevalence of multiple variants strongly support the need for pharmacological options to complement vaccine strategies. One region that appears highly conserved among different genus of coronaviruses is the substrate binding site of the main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro), making it an attractive target for the development of broad-spectrum drugs for multiple coronaviruses. PF-07321332 developed by Pfizer is the first orally administered inhibitor targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which also has shown potency against other coronaviruses. Here we report three crystal structures of main protease of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV bound to the inhibitor PF-07321332. The structures reveal a ligand-binding site that is conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, providing insights into the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication. The long and narrow cavity in the cleft between domains I and II of main protease harbors multiple inhibitor binding sites, where PF-07321332 occupies subsites S1, S2 and S4 and appears more restricted compared with other inhibitors. A detailed analysis of these structures illuminated key structural determinants essential for inhibition and elucidated the binding mode of action of main proteases from different coronaviruses. Given the importance of main protease for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, insights derived from this study should accelerate the design of safer and more effective antivirals.",

Here we show, in a murine model of T-ALL, that the developmental timing of Lef1 mutation impacts its ability to function as a cooperative tumor suppressor or oncogene. T cell transformation in the presence of LEF1 allows leukemic cells to become addicted to its presence. In contrast, deletion prior to transformation both accelerates leukemogenesis and results in leukemic cells with altered expression of genes controlling receptor signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, including vascular calcification, leading to higher mortality. Release of calcifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) promotes the ectopic mineralization of vessel walls. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) protein plays a key role in genesis of calcifying EVs in VSMCs. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) co-localizes with and influences the intracellular trafficking of CAV1. Using a diet-induced mouse model of CKD, we measured serum EGFR and assessed the potential of EGFR inhibition to prevent vascular calcification. Mice with CKD developed widespread vascular calcification, which associated with increased serum levels of EGFR. We computationally analyzed 7651 individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Framingham cohorts to assess potential correlations between coronary artery calcium and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with elevated serum levels of EGFR. Individuals in the MESA and Framingham cohorts with SNPs associated with increased serum EGFR exhibit elevated coronary artery calcium. In both the CKD mice and human VSMC culture, EGFR inhibition significantly reduced vascular calcification by mitigating the release of CAV1-positive calcifying EVs. EGFR inhibition also increased bone mineral density in CKD mice. Given that EGFR inhibitors exhibit clinical safety and efficacy in other pathologies, the current data suggest that EGFR may be an ideal target to prevent pathological vascular calcification.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental physiological process conserved across most species. As such, deficits in sleep can result in a myriad of psychological and physical health issues. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of sleep are relatively unknown. Interestingly, general anesthetics cause unconsciousness by positively modulating GABA-A receptors (GABAARs). Based on this observation, it is hypothesized that GABAARs play a critical role in modulating circuits involved in sleep to promote unconsciousness. Recently, the lateral habenula (LHb) has been demonstrated to play a role in sleep physiology and sedation. Specifically, propofol has been shown to excite LHb neurons to promote sedation. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here, we utilize whole-cell voltage and current clamp recordings from LHb neurons obtained from 8-10 week old male mice to determine the physiological mechanisms for this phenomenon. We show that bath application of 1.5M propofol is sufficient to increase LHb neuronal excitability involving synaptic transmission, but not through modulation of intrinsic properties. Additionally, although there is increased LHb neuronal excitability, GABAARs localized postsynaptically on LHb neurons are still responsive to propofol, as indicated by an increase in the decay time. Lastly, we find that propofol increases the synaptic drive onto LHb neurons involving enhanced presynaptic release of both glutamate and GABA. However, the greatest contributor to the potentiated synaptic drive is the increased release of glutamate which shifts the balance of synaptic transmission towards greater excitation. Taken together, this study is the first to identify the physiological basis for why LHb neurons are excited by propofol, rather than inhibited, and as a result promote sedation.",

The spike proteins of B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 variants have several substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD), including L452R+E484Q, L452R+T478K, and K417N+L452R+T478K, respectively, that could potentially reduce effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies and current vaccines. Here we compared B.1.617 variants, and their single and double RBD substitutions for resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Pseudoviruses with the B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 spike showed a modest 1.5 to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for pseudoviruses with C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 spikes, but seven- and sixteen-fold reduction for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, was seen for pseudoviruses with the B.1.351 spike. Four of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses due to the L452R substitution, whereas six of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 pseudoviruses due to either the E484Q or L452R substitution. Against AY.1 pseudoviruses, the L452R and K417N substitutions accounted for the loss of neutralization by four antibodies and one antibody, respectively, whereas one antibody lost potency that could not be fully accounted for by a single RBD substitution. The modest resistance of B.1.617 variants to vaccine-elicited sera suggest that current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants, but the therapeutic antibodies need to be carefully selected based on their resistance profiles. Finally, the spike proteins of B.1.617 variants are more efficiently cleaved due to the P681R substitution, and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.",

    "abstract": "The inability to protect stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation drives genome instability and is associated with chemosensitivity in BRCA-deficient tumors. An emerging hallmark of BRCA deficiency is the inability to suppress replication-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps. Here, we report that ssDNA gaps on the lagging strand interfere with the ASF1-CAF-1 pathway of nucleosome assembly, and drive fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells. We show that CAF-1 function at replication forks is lost in BRCA-deficient cells, due to its sequestration at inactive replication factories during replication stress. This CAF-1 recycling defect is caused by the accumulation of Pol-dependent lagging strand gaps, which preclude PCNA unloading, causing sequestration of PCNA-CAF-1 complexes on chromatin. Importantly, correcting PCNA unloading defects in BRCA-deficient cells restores fork stability in a CAF-1-dependent manner. We also show that the activation of a HIRA-dependent compensatory histone deposition pathway restores fork stability to BRCA-deficient cells upon CAF-1 loss. We thus define nucleosome assembly as a critical determinant of BRCA-mediated fork stability. We further reveal lagging strand ssDNA gaps as drivers of fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells, which operate by inhibiting PCNA unloading and CAF-1-dependent nucleosome assembly.",

    "abstract": "The precise molecular mechanisms behind life-threatening lung abnormalities during severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are still unclear. To address this challenge, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of lung autopsies from 31 patients suffering from severe COVID-19 related complications and 10 uninfected controls. Using a metatranscriptome analysis of lung tissue samples we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant \"classical\" signature (n=23) showed upregulation of unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) potentially representing \"Cytokine Release Syndrome\" (CRS) showed upregulation of cytokines such IL1 and CCL19 but absence of complement activation and muted inflammation. Further, dissecting expression of individual genes within enriched pathways for patient signature suggests heterogeneity in host response to the primary infection. We found that the majority of patients cleared the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but all suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus cohnii in \"classical\" patients and Pasteurella multocida in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients that can be identified through the status of the complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. This information can be used to design personalized therapy to treat COVID-19 related complications corresponding to patient signature such as using the identified drug molecules or mitigating specific secondary infections.",

We analyze several markers of the distal sheath, which is best visualized with endogenously tagged membrane proteins, as overexpressed fluorescent proteins fail to localize to distal membrane processes and can cause gonad morphology defects.

    "abstract": "Among the estimated ~23,000 protein encoding human genes, the class of  druggable genes- defined by their ability to bind drug-like compounds- represents an enticing collection of targets for clinical intervention. Yet many if not most of these genes remain poorly understood and understudied. Here we evaluate three major classes of druggable genes (GPCRs, ion channels, and kinases) and found that a third of these remain largely ignored yet display significant mouse phenotypes upon genetic ablation. We show that both well-studied and understudied druggable genes share a similar number and spectrum of phenotypes. Moreover, many of the mouse phenotypes arising from the ablation of both well-studied and understudied druggable genes show similarities with symptoms in rare human diseases. Collectively these data diminish the notion that most poorly studied genes may not be especially  important and highlight therapeutic opportunities and potential disease models among poorly characterized druggable genes.",

The amino acid asparagine is the limiting substrate in the Maillard reaction that produces acrylamide, so developing wheat varieties with low free asparagine concentrations in the grain is a promising approach to reduce dietary acrylamide exposure. A candidate gene approach was used to identify chemically-induced genetic variation in ASPARAGINE SYNTHETASE 2 (ASN2) genes that exhibit a grain-specific expression profile. In field trials, durum and common wheat lines carrying asn-a2 null alleles exhibited reductions in free asparagine concentration in their grains of between 9 and 34% compared to wild-type sister lines.

    "abstract": "The malfunction of the Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is associated to the Rett syndrome, one of the most common causes of cognitive impairment in females. MeCP2 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), making its experimental characterization a challenge. There is currently no structure available for the full-length MeCP2 in any of the databases, and only the structure of its MBD domain has been solved. We used this structure to build a full-length model of MeCP2 by completing the rest of the protein via ab initio modelling. Using a combination of all-atom and coarse-grained simulations, we characterized its structure and dynamics as well as the conformational space sampled by the ID and TRD domains in the absence of the rest of the protein. The present work is the first computational study of the full-length protein. Two main conformations were sampled in the coarse-grained simulations: a globular structure similar to the one observed in the all-atom force field and a two-globule conformation. Our all-atom model is in good agreement with the available experimental data, predicting amino acid W104 to be buried, amino acids R111 and R133 to be solvent accessible, and having 4.1% of -helix content, compared to the 4% found experimentally. Finally, we compared the model predicted by AlphaFold to our Modeller model. The model was not stable in water and underwent further folding. Together, these simulations provide a detailed (if perhaps incomplete) conformational ensemble of the full-length MeCP2, which is compatible with experimental data and can be the basis of further studies, e.g., on mutants of the protein or its interactions with its biological partners.",

    "abstract": "In-silico saturation mutagenesis (ISM) is a popular approach in computational genomics for calculating feature attributions on biological sequences that proceeds by systematically perturbing each position in a sequence and recording the difference in model output. However, this method can be slow because systematically perturbing each position requires performing a number of forward passes proportional to the length of the sequence being examined. In this work, we propose a modification of ISM that leverages the principles of compressed sensing to require only a constant number of forward passes, regardless of sequence length, when applied to models that contain operations with a limited receptive field, such as convolutions. Our method, named Yuzu, can reduce the time that ISM spends in convolution operations by several orders of magnitude and, consequently, Yuzu can speed up ISM on several commonly used architectures in genomics by over an order of magnitude. Notably, we found that Yuzu provides speedups that increase with the complexity of the convolution operation and the length of the sequence being analyzed, suggesting that Yuzu provides large benefits in realistic settings.

    "abstract": "In living cells the 3D structure of gene loci is dynamic, but this is not revealed by 3C and FISH experiments in fixed samples, leaving a significant gap in our understanding. To overcome these limitations we applied the \"highly predictive heteromorphic polymer\" (HiP-HoP) model, validated by experiments, to determine chromatin fibre mobility at the Pax6 locus in three mouse cell lines with different transcription states. While transcriptional activity minimally affects the movement of 40 kbp regions, we observed that the motion of smaller 1 kbp regions depends strongly on local disruption to chromatin fibre structure marked by H3K27 acetylation. This also significantly influenced locus configuration dynamics by modulating promoter-enhancer loops associated with protein bridging. Importantly these simulations indicate that chromatin dynamics are sufficiently fast to sample all possible conformations of loci within minutes, generating wide dynamic variability of gene loci structure within single cells. Experiments inhibiting transcription change chromatin fibre structure subtly, yet we predict they should substantially affect mobility. This combination of simulation and experimental validation provide a novel insight and mechanistic model to explain how transcriptional activity influences chromatin structure and gene dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) in bone induces bone-forming lesions that enhance PCa progression. How tumor-induced bone formation enhances PCa progression is not known. We have previously shown that PCa-induced bone originates from endothelial cells (EC) that have undergone endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition by tumor-secreted BMP4. Here, we show that EC-to-OSB transition leads to changes in the tumor microenvironment that increases the metastatic potential of PCa cells. We found that conditioned medium (CM) from EC-OSB hybrid cells increases the migration, invasion and survival of PC3-mm2 and C4-2B4 PCa cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry (iTRAQ) identified Tenascin C (TNC) as one of the major proteins secreted from EC-OSB hybrid cells. TNC expression in tumor-induced osteoblasts was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of MDA-PCa118b xenograft and human bone metastasis specimens. Mechanistically, BMP4 increases TNC expression in EC-OSB cells through the Smad1-Notch/Hey1 pathway. How TNC promotes PCa metastasis was next interrogated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies showed that a TNC neutralizing antibody inhibits EC-OSB-CM-mediated PCa cell migration and survival. TNC knockdown decreased, while addition of recombinant TNC or TNC overexpression increased migration and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 or C4-2b cells. When injected orthotopically, PC3-mm2-shTNC clones decreased metastasis to bone, while C4-2b-TNC overexpressing cells increased metastasis to lymph nodes. TNC enhances PCa cell migration through 5{beta}1 integrin-mediated YAP/TAZ inhibition. These studies elucidate that tumor-induced stromal reprogramming generates TNC that enhances PCa metastasis and suggest that TNC may be a target for PCa therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are involved in many aspects of cancer progression and correlate with poor clinical outcomes in many cancer types, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). Previous studies have shown that TAMs can populate PDAC tumors not only by monocyte recruitment but also by local proliferation. However, the impact local proliferation might have on macrophage phenotype and cancer progression is unknown. Here, we utilized genetically engineered cancer models, single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and in vitro systems to show that proliferation of TAMs was driven by colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts. CSF1 induced high levels of p21 in macrophages, which regulated both TAM proliferation and phenotype. TAMs in human and mouse PDACs with high levels of p21 had more inflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotypes. The p21 expression in TAMs was induced by both stromal interaction and/or chemotherapy treatment. Finally, by modeling p21 expression levels in TAMs, we found that p21-driven macrophage immunosuppression in vivo drove tumor progression. Serendipitously, the same p21-driven pathways that drive tumor progression, also drive response to CD40 agonist. These data suggest that stromal or therapy-induced regulation of cell cycle machinery can regulate both macrophage-mediated immune suppression and susceptibility to innate immunotherapy.\n\nSummaryTAMs are indicative of poor clinical outcomes and in PDAC their number is sustained in part by local proliferation. This study shows that stromal desmoplasia drives local proliferation of TAMs, and induces their immunosuppressive ability through altering cell cycle machinery, including p21 expression. Serendipitously, these changes in p21 in TAMs also potentially render tumors more sensitive to CD40 agonist therapy.",

    "abstract": "Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors constitute a superfamily in eukaryotes but their roles in plant immunity remain largely uncharacterized. We found that the transcript abundance in tomato leaves of one bHLH transcription factor-encoding gene, Nrd1 (negative regulator of resistance to DC3000 1), was significantly increased after treatment with the immunity-inducing flgII-28 peptide. Plants carrying a loss-of-function mutation in Nrd1 ({Lambda}nrd1) showed enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 although early pattern-triggered immunity responses such as generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases after treatment with flagellin-derived flg22 and flgII-28 peptides were unaltered compared to wild-type plants. An RNA-Seq analysis identified a gene, Agp1, whose expression is strongly suppressed in an Nrd1-dependent manner. Agp1 encodes an arabinogalactan protein and overexpression of the Agp1 gene in Nicotiana benthamiana led to [~]10-fold less Pst growth compared to the control. These results suggest that the Nrd1 protein promotes tomato susceptibility to Pst by suppressing the defense gene Agp1. RNA-Seq also revealed that loss of Nrd1 function has no effect on the transcript abundance of immunity-associated genes including Bti9, Core, Fls2, Fls3 and Wak1 upon Pst inoculation, suggesting that the enhanced immunity observed in the {Delta}nrd1 mutants is due to the activation of key PRR signaling components as well as loss of Nrd1-regulated suppression of Agp1.",

    "abstract": "Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key enzyme responsible for the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium into the amino acid glutamine. The genes encoding GS are among the oldest existing genes in living organisms. In plants, two groups of functional GS enzymes are found: eubacterial GSIIb (GLN2) and eukaryotic GSIIe (GLN1/GS). Phylogenetic analyses have shown that the GLN2 group originated from bacteria following horizontal gene transfer. Only GLN1/GS genes are found in vascular plants, which suggests that they are involved in the final adaptation of plants to terrestrial life. The present phylogenetic study reclassifies the different GS of seed plants into three clusters: GS1a, GS1b and GS2. The presence of genes encoding GS2 has been expanded to Cycadopsida gymnosperms, which suggests the origin of this gene in a common ancestor of Cycadopsida, Ginkgoopsida and angiosperms. GS1a genes have been identified in all gymnosperms, basal angiosperms and some Magnoliidae species. Previous studies in conifers and the gene expression profiles obtained in ginkgo and magnolia in the present work could explain the absence of GS1a in more recent angiosperm species (e.g., monocots and eudicots) due to the redundant roles of GS1a and GS2 in photosynthetic cells. Altogether, the results provide a better understanding of the evolution of plant GS isoenzymes and their physiological roles, which is valuable for improving crop nitrogen use efficiency and productivity.",

    "abstract": "Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) promotes the intracellular assembly of protein complexes formed through phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain linkages. These interactions are weak and reversible, and the dephosphorylation of uncomplexed phosphorylated proteins can be rapid enough to reduce the time and length scales of protein complex persistence distal from the receptor. This limitation may be overcome by cytosolic kinases that rephosphorylate constituent complex proteins as they diffuse. To develop quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of these processes, we generated a reaction-diffusion model describing how membrane-bound epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activates the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 by assembling SHP2 complexes with the adaptor GRB2-associated binder 1 (GAB1). Src family kinases (SFKs) were included as a diffusible EGFR-activated intermediary kinase for GAB1. Contrary to the textbook picture of EGFR-mediated SHP2 activation, the model predicts that GAB1-SHP2 complexes can remain intact distal from membrane-retained EGFR at [~]80% of their plasma membrane concentration over the entire intracellular length scale. Parameter sensitivity analysis identified SFK inactivation as one of the most important kinetic processes controlling GAB1-SHP2 spatial persistence, revealing the key role of repeated adaptor phosphorylation in maintaining SHP2 activity. A simple order of magnitude analysis of the controlling rate processes supports the predictions of the coupled differential equation model. Furthermore, proximity ligation assays and immunofluorescence microscopy in carcinoma cells demonstrate that GAB1-SHP2 complexes are increasingly cytoplasmic and distal from EGFR as time proceeds after acute EGFR activation, consistent with model predictions. These results provide quantitative insight into a mechanism that may be alternately tuned for different receptors and downstream effector complexes to enable receptor control of signaling at a distance.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe textbook understanding of receptor-mediated signaling involves the assembly of protein complexes at the receptor cytosolic tail and complex movement within the cell by protein trafficking. However, reaction-diffusion processes can also play an important role in distributing signaling proteins throughout the cell, potentially quite distal from signal-initiating receptors. Indeed, receptors can activate cytosolic kinases that may maintain the phosphorylation-dependent complexation of downstream effector complexes through many rounds of complex dissociation and protein dephosphorylation. Here, we develop quantitative understanding of this mode of signal regulation through development of a mechanistic computational model and demonstrate, with experimental validation, that membrane-bound receptors can regulate signaling through downstream effector complexes over the entire intracellular length scale.",

Conversely, haplo-insufficiency of PMP22 leads to focal myelin overgrowth in hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP). However, the molecular mechanisms of myelin growth regulation by PMP22 remain obscure. Here, we found that the major inhibitor of the myelin growth signaling pathway PI3K/Akt/mTOR, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is increased in abundance in CMT1A and decreased in HNPP rodent models. Indeed, treatment of DRG co-cultures from HNPP mice with PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors reduced focal hypermyelination and, importantly, treatment of HNPP mice with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin improved motor behavior, increased compound muscle amplitudes (CMAP) and reduced tomacula formation in the peripheral nerve. In Pmp22tg CMT1A mice, we uncovered that the differentiation defect of Schwann cells is independent from PI3K/Akt/mTOR activity, rendering the pathway insufficient as a therapy target on its own. Thus, while CMT1A pathogenesis is governed by dys-differentiation uncoupled from PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, targeting the pathway provides novel proof-of-principle for a therapeutic approach to HNPP.",

    "abstract": "Calcium imaging with protein-based indicators is widely used to follow neural activity in intact nervous systems. The popular GCaMP indicators are based on the calcium-binding protein calmodulin and the RS20 peptide. These sensors report neural activity at timescales much slower than electrical signaling, limited by their biophysical properties and trade-offs between sensitivity and speed. We used large-scale screening and structure-guided mutagenesis to develop and optimize several fast and sensitive GCaMP-type indicators. The resulting  jGCaMP8 sensors, based on calmodulin and a fragment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, have ultra-fast kinetics (rise times, 2 ms) and still feature the highest sensitivity for neural activity reported for any protein-based sensor. jGCaMP8 sensors will allow tracking of larger populations of neurons on timescales relevant to neural computation.",

    "abstract": "Cell growth and division of walled bacteria depend on the synthesis and remodelling of peptidoglycan (PG). These activities are carried out by two multiprotein complexes, the elongasome and the divisome during cell elongation and division, respectively. Filaments of tubulin-like FtsZ form the cytoplasmic scaffold for divisome assembly, the Z-ring. In E. coli, the actin homologue FtsA anchors the Z-ring to the membrane and recruits downstream divisome components, including bitopic FtsN. FtsN is recruited late and activates the periplasmic PG synthase FtsWI. To start unravelling the activation mechanism involving FtsA and FtsN, we showed that E. coli FtsA forms antiparallel double filaments on lipid monolayers when also binding FtsNs cytoplasmic tail, and that Vibrio maritimus FtsA crystallised as an equivalent double filament. We structurally located the FtsA-FtsN interaction site in FtsAs IA-IC interdomain cleft and confirmed FtsA double filament formation in vivo using site-specific cysteine cross-linking. FtsA-FtsN double filaments reconstituted on and in liposomes preferred negative Gaussian curvature, as was previously shown for the elongasomes actin, MreB. MreB filaments serve as curvature-sensing \"rudders\", orienting insertion of PG around the cells circumference. We propose that curved antiparallel FtsA double filaments function similarly in the divisome: FtsA filaments, together with dynamic FtsZ filaments orient and concentrate cell-constricting septal PG synthesis in the division plane.",

    "abstract": "Peptidergic intercellular communication occurs throughout the eukaryotes, and regulates a wide range of physiological and behavioral responses. Cilia are sensory and secretory organelles that both receive information from the environment and transmit signals. Cilia derived vesicles (ectosomes), formed by outward budding of the ciliary membrane, carry enzymes and other bioactive products; this process represents an ancient mode of regulated secretion. Our previous study revealed the presence of the peptide amidating enzyme, peptidylglycine -amidating monooxygenase (PAM), in cilia and its key role in ciliogenesis. Furthermore, PAM and its amidated products are released in ciliary ectosomes from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. One amidated product (GATI-amide) serves as a chemotactic modulator for C. reinhardtii gametes, attracting minus gametes while repelling plus gametes. Here we dissect the complex processing pathway that leads to formation of this amidated peptidergic sexual signal specifically on the ectosomes of plus gametes. We also identify a potential prohormone convertase that undergoes domain rearrangement during ectosomal secretion as a substrate for PAM. Analysis of this pathway affords insight into how single-celled organisms lacking dense core vesicles engage in regulated secretion, and provides a paradigm for understanding how amidated peptides that transmit sexual and other signals through cilia are generated.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) is the primary analytical tool used to characterize proteins within the biopharmaceutical industry. Electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to liquid chromatography (LC) is the current gold standard for intact protein analysis. However, inherent speed limitations of LC/MS prevent analysis of large sample numbers (>1000) in a day. Infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI-MS), an ambient ionization MS technology, has recently been established as a platform for high throughput small molecule analysis. Here we report the applications of such a system for the analysis of intact proteins commonly performed within the drug discovery process. A wide molecular weight range of proteins 10 - 150 kDa was detected on the system with improved tolerance to salts and buffers compared to ESI. With high concentrations and model proteins, a sample rate up to 22 Hz was obtained. For proteins at low concentrations and in buffers used in commonly employed assays, robust data at a sample rate of 1.5 Hz was achieved, which is [~] 22x faster than current technologies used for high throughput ESI-MS-based protein assays. In addition, two multiplexed plate-based high throughput sample cleanup methods were coupled to IR-MALDESI-MS to enable analysis of samples containing excessive amounts of salts and buffers without fully compromising productivity. Example experiments, which leverage the speed of the IR-MALDESI-MS system to monitor NISTmAb reduction, protein autophosphorylation and compound binding kinetics in near real-time, are demonstrated.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467755v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (13K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@afa091org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@56b6ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1034f83org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5949fb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Anti-TNF antibodies are effective for treating patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but many patients fail to respond to anti-TNF therapy, highlighting the importance of TNF-independent disease. We previously demonstrated that acute deletion of two IBD susceptibility genes, A20 (Tnfaip3) and Abin-1 (Tnip1), in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) sensitizes mice to both TNF-dependent and TNF-independent death. Here we show that TNF-independent IEC death after A20 and Abin-1 deletion is rescued by germ-free derivation or deletion of MyD88, while deletion of Trif provides only partial protection. Combined deletion of Ripk3 and Casp8, which inhibits both apoptotic and necroptotic death, completely protects against death after acute deletion of A20 and Abin-1 in IECs. A20 and Abin-1-deficient IECs are sensitized to TNF-independent, TNFR-1-mediated death in response to lymphotoxin alpha (LT) homotrimers. Blockade of LT in vivo reduces weight loss and improves survival when combined with partial deletion of MyD88. These data show that microbial signals, MyD88, and LT all contribute to TNF-independent intestinal injury.\n\nSUMMARYHere we show that germ-free derivation, MyD88 deletion, combined Ripk3 and Casp8 deletion, or anti-LT, all reduce TNF-independent intestinal injury after A20 and Abin-1 deletion.",

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by loss of the SMN1 gene. Although lower motor neurons are a primary target, there is evidence that peripheral organ defects contribute to SMA. Current SMA gene therapy uses a single, high titre intravenous bolus of AAV9-SMN resulting in impressive, yet limited amelioration of the clinical phenotype. However, risks of this treatment include liver toxicity. Intrathecal administration is under clinical trial but was interrupted due to safety concerns in a concomitant animal study. As there is no direct comparison between the different delivery strategies while avoiding high dose toxicity, we injected SMA mice with low dose scAAV9-cba-SMN either intravenously (IV) for peripheral SMN restoration or intracerebroventricularly (ICV) for CNS-focused SMN restoration. Here, IV injections restored SMN in peripheral tissues but not CNS, while ICV injections mildly increased SMN in the periphery and the CNS. Consequently, only ICV treatment rescued motor neuron degeneration. Surprisingly, both treatments resulted in an impressive rescue of survival, weight, motor function, and peripheral phenotypes including liver and pancreas pathology. Our work highlights independent contributions of peripheral organs to SMA pathology and suggests that treatments should not be restricted to the motor neuron.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=148 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/467795v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e4e882org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15ccf93org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fe393org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@75cc20_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The new coronavirus species, SARS-CoV-2, caused an unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19 disease since late December 2019. A comprehensive characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between SARS-CoV-2 and human cells is a key to understanding the infection and preventing the disease. Here we present a novel approach to predict virus-host PPIs by multi-label machine learning classifiers of random forests and XGBoost using amino acid composition profiles of virus and human proteins. Our models harness a large-scale database of Viruses.STRING with >80,000 virus-host PPIs along with evidence scores for multi-level evidence prediction, which is distinct from predicting binary interactions in previous studies. Our multi-label classifiers are based on 5 evidence levels binned from evidence scores. Our best model of XGBoost achieves 74% AUC and 68% accuracy on average in 10-fold cross validation. The most important amino acids are cysteine and histidine. In addition, our model predicts experimental PPIs with higher accuracy than text mining-based PPIs by 4% despite their smaller data size by more than 6-fold. We then predict evidence levels of [~]2,000 SARS-CoV-2 virus-human PPIs from public experimental proteomics data. Interactions with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7b show high evidence. We also predict evidence levels of all pairwise PPIs of [~]550,000 between the SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes to provide a draft virus-host interactome landscape for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans in a comprehensive and unbiased way in silico. Most human proteins from 140 highest evidence predictions interact with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7, Nsp1, and ORF14, with significant enrichment in the top 2 pathways of vascular smooth muscle contraction (CALD1, NPR2, CALML3) and Myc targets (CBX3, PES1). Our prediction also suggests that histone H2A components are targeted by multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins.",
