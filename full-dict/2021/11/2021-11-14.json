    "abstract": "In colonies of the filamentous multicellular bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor, a sub-population of cells arise that hyper-produce metabolically costly antibiotics, resulting in division of labor that maximizes colony fitness. Because these cells contain large genomic deletions that cause massive reductions to individual fitness, their behavior is altruistic, much like worker castes in social insects or somatic cells in multicellular organisms. To understand the reproductive and genomic fate of these mutant cells after their emergence, we use experimental evolution by serially transferring populations via spore-to-spore transfer for 25 cycles, reflective of the natural mode of bottlenecked transmission for these spore-forming bacteria. We show that, in contrast to wild-type cells, altruistic mutant cells continue to significantly decline in fitness during transfer while they delete larger and larger fragments from their chromosome ends. In addition, altruistic mutants acquire a roughly 10-fold increase in their base-substitution rates possibly due to mutations in genes for DNA replication and repair. Ecological damage, caused by reduced sporulation, coupled with irreversible DNA damage due to point mutations and deletions, leads to an inevitable and irreversible type of mutational meltdown in these cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the altruistic cells arising in this division of labor are analogous to reproductively sterile castes of social insects.",

    "abstract": "In this report, we investigate the evolution of transcription factor NF-{kappa}B by examining its structure, activity, and regulation in two protists using phylogenetic, cellular, and biochemical techniques. In Capsaspora owczarzaki (Co), we find that full-length NF-{kappa}B has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal Ankyrin (ANK) repeat inhibitory domain, and its DNA-binding activity is more similar to metazoan NF-{kappa}B rather than Rel proteins. As with mammalian NF-{kappa}B proteins, removal of the ANK repeats is required for Co-NF-{kappa}B to enter the nucleus, bind DNA, and activate transcription. However, C-terminal processing of Co-NF-{kappa}B is not induced by co-expression of IKK in human cells. Exogenously expressed Co-NF-{kappa}B localizes to the nucleus in Co cells. NF-{kappa}B mRNA and DNA-binding levels differ across three life stages of Capsaspora, suggesting distinct roles for NF-{kappa}B in these life stages. RNA-seq and GO analyses identify possible gene targets and biological functions of Co-NF-{kappa}B. We also show that three NF-{kappa}B-like proteins from the choanoflagellate Acanthoeca spectabilis (As) all consist of primarily the N-terminal conserved Rel Homology domain sequences of NF-{kappa}B, and lack C-terminal ANK repeats. All three As-NF-{kappa}B proteins constitutively enter the nucleus of human and Co cells, but differ in their DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activities. Furthermore, all three As-NF-{kappa}B proteins can form heterodimers, indicating that NF-{kappa}B diversified into multi-subunit families at least two times during evolution. Overall, these results present the first functional characterization of NF-{kappa}B in a taxonomic kingdom other than Animalia and provide information about the evolution and diversification of this biologically important transcription factor.\n\nSignificanceThese results represent the first functional characterization of the biologically important transcription factor NF-{kappa}B in a taxonomic kingdom other than Animalia. As such, they provide information on the evolutionary origins and basal diversification of NF-{kappa}B outside of metazoans. These results suggest that NF-{kappa}B plays life stage-specific roles in Capsaspora, the closest unicellular ancestor to all metazoans. Finally, the analysis of three NF-{kappa}B proteins in a single choanoflagellate indicates that choanoflagellates have subclasses of NF-{kappa}Bs, which can form heterodimers, suggesting that NF-{kappa}B subunit expansion and diversification has occurred at least twice in evolution.",

    "abstract": "Brain signatures of functional activity have shown promising results in both decoding brain states, meaning distinguishing between different tasks, and fingerprinting, that is identifying individuals within a large group. Importantly, these brain signatures do not account for the underlying brain anatomy on which brain function takes place. Structure-function coupling based on graph signal processing (GSP) has recently revealed a meaningful spatial gradient from unimodal to transmodal regions, on average in healthy subjects during resting-state. Here, we explore the potential of GSP to introduce new imaging-based biomarkers to characterize tasks and individuals. We used multimodal magnetic resonance imaging of 100 unrelated healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project both during rest and seven different tasks and adopted a support vector machine classification approach for both decoding and fingerprinting, with various cross-validation settings. We found that structurefunction coupling measures allow accurate classifications for both task decoding and fingerprinting. In particular, key information for fingerprinting is found in the more liberal portion of functional signals, that is the one decoupled from structure. A network mainly involving cortico-subcortical connections showed the strongest correlation with cognitive traits, assessed with partial least square analysis, corroborating its relevance for fingerprinting. By introducing a new perspective on GSP-based signal filtering and FC decomposition, these results show that brain structure-function coupling provides a new class of signatures of cognition and individual brain organization at rest and during tasks. Further, they provide insights on clarifying the role of low and high spatial frequencies of the structural connectome, leading to new understanding of where key structure-function information for characterizing individuals can be found across the structural connectome graph spectrum.\n\nHighlights- The relation of brain function with the underlying structural wiring is complex\n- We propose new structure-informed graph signal processing (GSP) of functional data\n- GSP-derived features allow accurate task decoding and individual fingerprinting\n- Functional connectivity from filtered data is more unique to subject and cognition\n- The role of structurally aligned and liberal graph frequencies is elucidated",

    "abstract": "Regulated recruitment and activity of motor proteins is essential for intracellular transport of cargoes, including messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). Here we show that orchestration of oskar RNP transport in the Drosophila germline relies on the interplay of two double-stranded RNA binding proteins, Staufen and the dynein adaptor Egalitarian (Egl). We find that Staufen antagonizes Egl-mediated transport of oskar mRNA by dynein both in vitro and in vivo. Following delivery of nurse cell-synthesized oskar mRNA into the oocyte by dynein, recruitment of Staufen to the RNPs results in dissociation of Egl and a switch to kinesin-1-mediated translocation of the mRNA to its final destination at the posterior pole of the oocyte. We additionally show that Egl associates with staufen (stau) mRNA in the nurse cells, mediating its enrichment and translation in the ooplasm. Our observations identify a novel feed-forward mechanism, whereby dynein-dependent accumulation of stau mRNA, and thus protein, in the oocyte enables motor switching on oskar RNPs by downregulating dynein activity.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWState-of-the-art methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) often rely on strong distributional assumptions that are difficult to verify in practice. Furthermore, while the increasing complexity of clinical and biological single-cell studies calls for greater tool versatility, the majority of existing methods only tackle the comparison between two conditions. We propose a novel, distribution-free, and flexible approach to DEA for single-cell RNA-seq data. This new method, called ccdf, tests the association of each gene expression with one or many variables of interest (that can be either continuous or discrete), while potentially adjusting for additional covariates. To test such complex hypotheses, ccdf uses a conditional independence test relying on the conditional cumulative distribution function, estimated through multiple regressions. We provide the asymptotic distribution of the ccdf test statistic as well as a permutation test (when the number of observed cells is not sufficiently large). ccdf substantially expands the possibilities for scRNA-seq DEA studies: it obtains good statistical performance in various simulation scenarios considering complex experimental designs (i.e. beyond the two condition comparison), while retaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in a two-condition benchmark. We apply ccdf to a large publicly available scRNA-seq dataset of 84,140 SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8+ T cells, in order to identify the diffentially expressed genes across 3 groups of COVID-19 severity (mild, hospitalized, and ICU) while accounting for seven different cellular subpopulations.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate sialic acids (Sias) display much diversity in modifications, linkages and underlying glycans. Slide microarrays allow high-throughput explorations of sialoglycan-protein interactions. A microarray presenting [~]150 structurally-defined sialyltrisaccharides with various Sias linkages and modifications still poses challenges in planning, data sorting, visualization and analysis. To address these issues, we devised a simple 9-digit code for sialyltrisaccharides with terminal Sias and underlying two monosaccharides assigned from the non-reducing end, with three digits assigning a monosaccharide, its modifications, and linkage. Calculations based on the encoding system reveals >113,000 likely linear sialyltrisaccharides in nature. Notably a biantennary N-glycan with two terminal sialyltrisaccharides could thus have >1010 potential combinations and a triantennary N-glycan with three terminal sequences, >1015 potential combinations. While all possibilities likely do not exist in nature, sialoglycans encode enormous diversity. While glycomic approaches are used to probe such diverse sialomes, naturally-occurring bacterial AB5 toxin B subunits are simpler tools to track the dynamic sialome in biological systems. Sialoglycan microarray was utilized to compare sialoglycan-recognizing bacterial toxin B subunits. Unlike the poor correlation between B subunits and species phylogeny, there is stronger correlation with Sia-epitope preferences. Further supporting this pattern, we report a B subunit (YenB) from Yersinia enterocolitica (broad host range) recognizing almost all sialoglycans in the microarray, including 4-O-acetylated-Sias not recognized by a Y. pestis orthologue (YpeB). Differential Sia-binding patterns were also observed with phylogenetically-related B subunits from Escherichia coli (SubB), Salmonella Typhi (PltB), S. Typhimurium (ArtB), extra-intestinal E.coli (EcPltB), Vibrio cholera (CtxB), and cholera family homologue of E. coli (EcxB).",

The timing of extinctions of these three taxa and of their component lineages supports the idea that the biological crisis in the late Kungurian/early Roadian consisted of a progressive decline in biodiversity throughout the Kungurian.",

While substantial progress has been made in discerning how the microbiota influences host functions post birth and beyond, little is known about how key members of the maternal gut microbiota can influence feto-placental growth. Notably, in pregnant women, Bifidobacterium represents a key beneficial microbiota genus, with levels observed to increase across pregnancy. Here, using germ-free and specific-pathogen-free mice, we demonstrate that the bacterium Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 modulates maternal body adaptations, placental structure and nutrient transporter capacity, with implications for fetal metabolism and growth. Maternal and placental metabolome were affected by maternal gut microbiota (i.e. acetate, formate and carnitine). Histological analysis of the placenta confirmed that Bifidobacterium modifies placental structure via changes in Igf2P0, Dlk1, Mapk1 and Mapk14 expression. Additionally, B. breve UCC2003, acting through Slc2a1 and Fatp1-4 transporters, was shown to restore fetal glycaemia and fetal growth in association with changes in the fetal hepatic transcriptome. Our work emphasizes the importance of the maternal gut microbiota on feto-placental development and sets a foundation for future research towards the use of probiotics during pregnancy.",

An unbiased, high throughput gene expression profiling of tissue-resident memory T cells at their precise anatomical locations within the lung is fundamental to understanding lung immunity, but such spatial information has yet to be characterized. In this study, using a well-established Klebsiella pneumoniae infection model, we performed an integrative analysis of spatial transcriptome with single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq on lung cells from mice after immunization using the 10x Genomics Chromium and Visium platform. We employed several deconvolution algorithms and established an optimized deconvolution pipeline to accurately decipher specific cell-type composition by anatomic location. We identified and located 12 major cell types by scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic analysis. Integrating scATAC-seq data from the same cells processed in parallel with scRNA-seq, we found epigenomic profiles provide more robust cell type identification, especially for lineage-specific T helper cells. When combining all three data modalities, we observed a dynamic change in the location of T helper cells as well as their corresponding chemokines for chemotaxis. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis of spatial transcriptome provided evidence of lineage-specific T helper cells receiving designated cytokine signaling. In summary, our first-in-class study demonstrated the power of multi-omics analysis to uncover intrinsic spatial- and cell-type-dependent molecular mechanisms of lung immunity. Our data provides a rich research resource of single cell multi-omics data as a reference for understanding spatial dynamics of lung immunization.",

    "abstract": "Rising rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs threatens the effective treatment of infections across the globe. Drug resistance has been established to emerge from non-genetic mechanisms, such as \"persistence\" in quiescent microbes and fluctuations in gene expression in actively replicating cells, as well as from genetic mutations. However, it is still unclear how non-genetic drug resistance affects the evolution of genetic drug resistance. We develop deterministic and stochastic population models that incorporate resource competition to quantitatively investigate the transition from non-genetic to genetic resistance during the exposure to static and cidal drugs. We find that non-genetic resistance facilitates the survival of cell populations during drug treatment, but that it hinders the development of genetic resistance due to the competition between the non-genetically and genetically resistant subpopulations. Non-genetic drug resistance in the presence of subpopulation competition is found to increase the first-appearance and fixation times of drug resistance mutations, while increasing the probability of mutation before population extinction during cidal drug treatment. Intense intraspecific competition during drug treatment leads to extinction of the susceptible and non-genetically resistant subpopulations. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of the evolution of drug resistance and may guide novel treatment strategies for patients with drug-resistant infections.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDrug resistance is predicted to kill as many as 10 million people per year and cost over 100 trillion USD in cumulative lost production globally by 2050. To mitigate these socio-economic costs, we need to fundamentally understand the drug resistance process. We investigate the effect that different forms of resistance have on the evolution of drug resistance using mathematical modeling and computer simulations. We find that the presence of non-genetically drug-resistant cells (whose resistance is temporary and not encoded in a genetic mutation) allows the population to survive drug treatment, while competition between these subpopoulations simultaneously slows down the evolution of permanent genetic drug resistance and in some cases drives them extinct. These findings have important implications for advancing evolutionary theory and for developing effective \"resistance-proof\" treatments.",

    "abstract": "We analyze a cooperative decision-making model that is based on individual aspiration levels using the framework of a public goods game in static and dynamic networks. Sensitivity to differences in payoff and dynamic aspiration levels modulate individual satisfaction and affects subsequent behavior. The collective outcome of such strategy changes depends on the efficiency with which aspiration levels are updated. Below a threshold learning efficiency, cooperators dominate despite short-term fluctuations in strategy fractions. Categorizing players based on their satisfaction level and the resulting strategy reveal periodic cycling between the different categories. We explain the distinct dynamics in the two phases in terms of differences in the dominant cyclic transitions between different categories of cooperators and defectors. Allowing even a small fraction of nodes to restructure their connections can promote cooperation across almost the entire range of values of learning efficiency. Our work reinforces the usefulness of an internal criterion for strategy updates, together with network restructuring, in ensuring the dominance of altruistic strategies over long time-scales.\n\nMaintaining a public resource requires sustained cooperation through contributions by community members who benefit from it. Yet, a selfish individual who refuses to contribute can enjoy the benefits without paying the cost of sustaining the public good. If however, too many members of the community act selfishly, the public resource collapses to the detriment of all. The public goods game highlights such a social dilemma and provides a framework for exploring different mechanisms of strategic decision-making that allow cooperation and consequently the public good to be sustained. Among many mechanisms, the reorganization of social ties has been shown to be effective in promoting cooperation in PGG. However, the efficacy of most mechanisms in sustaining cooperation rely on individuals updating their strategy on the basis of information about the contributions of other members of the community. Often such information is either not forthcoming or cannot be effectively utilized. An alternative low-information model of behavioral updating relies on a comparison between the actual benefit received and the benefit aspired for. Individuals tend to retain their strategy if they are satisfied with the benefit received and change their strategy if they are unsatisfied. We show that such a simple reinforcement learning model along with modest restructuring of social ties over time can allow cooperation to be sustained. Our work shows that a low-information strategy-update model can be very effective in ensuring dominance of cooperators in social dilemmas.",

Such datasets scale to thousands of samples across dozens of experimental conditions, exhibit increased variability compared to biological replicates, and involve thousands of unannotated splice variants resulting in increased transcriptome complexity. We describe here a suite of algorithms and tools implemented in the MAJIQ v2 package to address challenges in detection, quantification, and visualization of splicing variations from such datasets. Using both large scale synthetic data and GTEx v8 as benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the approaches in MAJIQ v2 outperform existing methods. We then apply MAJIQ v2 package to analyze differential splicing across 2,335 samples from 13 brain subregions, demonstrating its ability to offer new insights into brain subregion-specific splicing regulation.",

    "abstract": "An influential account of neuronal responses in primary visual cortex is the normalized energy model. This model is often implemented as a two-stage computation. The first stage is the extraction of contrast energy, whereby a complex cell computes the squared and summed outputs of a pair of linear filters in quadrature phase. The second stage is normalization, in which a local population of complex cells mutually inhibit one another. Because the population includes cells tuned to a range of orientations and spatial frequencies, the result is that the responses are effectively normalized by the local stimulus contrast. Here, using evidence from human functional MRI, we show that the classical model fails to account for the relative responses to two classes of stimuli: straight, parallel, band-passed contours (gratings), and curved, band-passed contours (snakes). The snakes elicit fMRI responses that are about twice as large as the gratings, yet a traditional divisive normalization model predicts responses that are about the same. Here, motivated by these observations and others from the literature, we implement a divisive normalization model, in which there is a preferential inhibition between cells matched in orientation tuning (\"tuned normalization\"). We first show that this model accounts for differential responses to these two classes of stimuli. We then show that the model successfully generalizes to other band-pass textures, both in V1 and in extrastriate cortex (V2 and V3). We conclude that even in primary visual cortex, complex features of images such as the degree of heterogeneity, can have large effects on neural responses.",

    "abstract": "Microridges are evolutionarily conserved actin-rich protrusions present on the apical surface of the squamous epithelial cells. In zebrafish epidermal cells, microridges form self-evolving patterns due to the underlying actomyosin network dynamics. However, their morphological and dynamic characteristics have remained poorly understood owing to lack of automated segmentation methods. We achieved ~97% pixel-level accuracy with the deep learning microridge segmentation strategy enabling quantitative insights into their bio-physical-mechanical characteristics. From the segmented images, we estimated an effective microridge persistence length as ~0.61m. We discovered the presence of mechanical fluctuations and found relatively greater stresses stored within patterns of yolk than flank, indicating distinct regulation of their actomyosin networks. Furthermore, spontaneous formations and positional fluctuations of actin clusters within microridge influenced pattern rearrangements over short length/time-scales. Our framework allows large-scale spatiotemporal analysis of microridges during epithelial development and probing of their responses to chemical and genetic perturbations to unravel the underlying patterning mechanisms.",

While both F0 and F1 have pseudo-symmetric structures, their symmetries do not match. How the symmetry mismatch is solved remains elusive due to missing intermediate structures of rotational steps. Here, for ATP synthases with 3- and 10-fold symmetries in F1 and F0, respectively, we uncovered the mechanical couplings between F0 and F1 at every 36{degrees} rotation step via molecular dynamics simulations and comparison of cryo-electron microscopy structures from three species. We found that the frustration is shared by several elements. The F1 stator partially rotates relative to the F0 stator via elastic distortion of the b-subunits. The rotor can be distorted. The c-ring rotary angles can be deviated from symmetric ones. Additionally, the F1 motor may take non-canonical structures relieving stronger frustration. Together, we provide comprehensive understanding to solve the symmetry mismatch.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen is the major glucose reserve in eukaryotes, and defects in glycogen metabolism and structure lead to disease. Glycogenesis involves interaction of glycogenin (GN) with glycogen synthase (GS), where GS is activated by glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and inactivated by phosphorylation. We describe the 2.6 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of phosphorylated human GS revealing an autoinhibited GS tetramer flanked by two GN dimers. Phosphorylated N- and C-termini from two GS protomers converge near the G6P-binding pocket and buttress against GS regulatory helices. This keeps GS in an inactive conformation mediated by phospho-Ser641 interactions with a composite \"arginine cradle\". Structure-guided mutagenesis perturbing interactions with phosphorylated tails led to increased basal/unstimulated GS activity. We propose that multivalent phosphorylation supports GS autoinhibition through interactions from a dynamic \"spike\" region, allowing a tuneable rheostat for regulating GS activity. This work therefore provides new insights into glycogen synthesis regulation and facilitates studies of glycogen-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Grapevine is a woody temperate perennial plant and one of the most important fruit crops with global relevance in both the fresh fruit and winemaking industries. Unfortunately, global warming is affecting viticulture by altering developmental transitions and fruit maturation processes. In this context, uncovering the molecular mechanisms controlling the onset and progression of ripening could prove essential to maintain high-quality grapes and wines. Through a deep inspection of previously published transcriptomic data we identified the NAC family member VviCARPO (Controlled Adjustment of Ripening and maturation of Plant Organs) as a key regulator of grapevine maturation whose induction precedes the expression of well-known ripening associated genes. We explored VviCARPO binding landscapes through DAP-seq and overlapped its bound genes with transcriptomics datasets from stable and transient VviCARPO overexpressing grapevine plants to define a set of high-confidence targets. Among these, we identified key molecular ripening markers. Physiological, metabolic and promoter activation analyses showed that VviCARPO induces chlorophyll degradation and anthocyanin accumulation through the up-regulation of VviSGR1 and VviMYBA1, respectively, with the latter being up-regulated through a VviCARPO-VviNAC03 regulatory complex. Despite showing a closer phylogenetic relationship to senescent-related AtNAP homologues, VviCARPO complemented the nor mutant phenotype in tomato, suggesting it may have acquired a dual role as an orchestrator of both ripening- and senescence-related processes. Our data supports CARPO as a master regulator of the grapevine vegetative-to-mature phase organ transition and therefore an essential target for insuring fruit quality and environmental resilience.\n\nSIGNIFICANT STATEMENTCARPO is a grape NAC transcription factor central to fruit ripening and tissue senescence. This regulator influences multiple biological pathways common to both processes including cell wall metabolism, chlorophyll degradation, pigment production and hormone synthesis/signaling through regulation of their key genes. As various external stresses and changing climatic conditions influence vegetative growth and berry ripening, CARPO could prove a useful genetic and breeding target towards maintaining necessary crop performance and fruit-quality characteristics.",

Currently, large-scale color analysis of elongate animals requires time-consuming manual landmarking, which reduces their representation in coloration research despite their ecological importance.\nC_LIO_LIWe present Batch-Mask: an automated and customizable workflow to facilitate the analysis of large photographic data sets of non-standard biological subjects. First, we present a user guide to run an open-source region-based convolutional neural network with fine-tuned weights for identifying and isolating a biological subject from a background (masking).

By using these tools, biologists will be able to compare color, pattern, and shape differences in large data sets that include significant morphological variation in elongate body forms.

    "abstract": "Certain atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) used in the treatment of schizophrenia have been hypothesized to show reduced extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), due to their ability to promote nigrostriatal dopamine release through 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) blockade. The strength of this hypothesis is currently limited to a consideration of the relative receptor affinities of APDs for the 5-HT2AR and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). Here we measure the 5-HT2AR kinetic binding properties of a series of typical and atypical APDs in a novel time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and correlate these properties with their observed EPS at therapeutic doses. For compounds with negligible affinity for 5-HT2AR, EPS is robustly predicted by a D2R specific rebinding model that integrates D2R association and dissociation rates to calculate the net rate of reversal of receptor blockade (kr). However, we show that for compounds with significant affinity for the 5-HT2AR, such as sertindole, higher relative 5-HT2A occupancy over time is an indicator for a reduced propensity to cause EPS.\n\nThis study suggests that there is room for the development of novel kinetically optimised antipsychotic agents that modulate both serotonergic and dopamine function in a manner beneficial in the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease.",

We find that innate immune responses to gut derived bacteria are as strong as responses towards pathogenic bacteria, and vary from phylum to strain. Myeloid cells differentially rely upon TLR2 or TLR4 to sense particular taxa, an observation that predicts in vivo function. These innate immune responses can be modeled using combinations of up to 8 TLR agonists. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of strains is stable over time and following transplantation into new humans.

    "abstract": "Microbial interactions govern marine biogeochemistry. These interactions are generally considered to rely on exchange of organic molecules. Here we report on a novel inorganic route of microbial communication, showing that algal-bacterial interactions are mediated through inorganic nitrogen exchange. Under oxygen-rich conditions, aerobic bacteria reduce algal-secreted nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) through denitrification, a well-studied anaerobic respiration mechanism. Bacteria secrete NO, triggering a cascade in algae akin to programmed cell death. During death, algae further generate NO, thereby propagating the signal in the algal population. Eventually, the algal population collapses, similar to the sudden demise of oceanic algal blooms. Our study suggests that the exchange of denitrification intermediates, particularly in oxygenated environments, is an overlooked yet ecologically significant route of microbial communication within and across kingdoms.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAerobic bacteria activate denitrification in oxygenated conditions and produce nitric oxide that kills their algal partners",

    "abstract": "The concept of bioremediation is quickly becoming the norm in the resolution of environmental issues. The steady increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, as documented by NASA, inspired scientists to engineer plants to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Here, we have explored the consequences of the uptake of excess CO2 by select plants. Carbon dioxide dissolves in H2O to produce H2CO3, which dissociates to yield H+ ions. We hypothesized that increased CO2 absorption results in decrease in pH of plant sap. Three plants (Byophyllum pinnatum, Romaine Lettuce and Nevada Lettuce), exposed to increased CO2 concentrations (15%), demonstrated a consistent increase in pH towards alkalinity compared to control plants. Based on the outcome being opposite of what we have hypothesized, our results suggest Byophyllum pinnatum, Romaine lettuce and Nevada lettuce, all have a unique homeostatic system to prevent over-absorption of CO2 in a CO2-rich environment.",

Here we used computer simulations to examine host-parasite coevolution in 20 simi-isolated clonal populations across a broad range of values for both parasite virulence and parasite fecundity. We found that the correlation between host genetic diversity and infection prevalence can be significantly positive for intermediate values of parasite virulence and fecundity. But the correlation can also be weak and statistically non-significant, even when parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection is the sole force maintaining host diversity.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntegrating transcriptional profiles results in the identification of gene expression signatures that are more robust than those obtained for individual datasets. However, direct comparison of datasets derived from heterogeneous experimental conditions is not possible and their integration requires the application of specific meta-analysis techniques. The transcriptional response to hypoxia has been the focus of intense research due to its central role in tissue homeostasis and in prevalent diseases. Accordingly, a large number of studies have determined the gene expression profile of hypoxic cells. Yet, in spite of this wealth of information, little effort have been done to integrate these dataset to produce a robust hypoxic signature.\n\nResultsWe applied a formal meta-analysis procedure to a dataset comprising 425 RNAseq samples derived from 42 individual studies including 33 different cell types, to derive a pooled estimate of the effect of hypoxia on gene expression. This approach revealed that a large proportion of the transcriptome (8556 genes out of 20888) is significantly regulated by hypoxia. However, only a small fraction of the differentially expressed genes (1265 genes, 15%) show an effect size that, according to comparisons to gene pathways known to be regulated by hypoxia, is likely to be biologically relevant. By focusing on genes ubiquitously expressed we identified a signature of 291 genes robustly and consistently regulated by hypoxia. Finally, by a applying a moderator analysis we found that endothelial cells show a characteristic gene expression pattern that is significantly different from other cell types.\n\nConclusionBy the application of a formal meta-analysis to hypoxic gene profiles, we have developed a robust gene signature that characterizes the transcriptomic response to low oxygen. In addition to identifying a universal set of hypoxia-responsive genes, we found a set of genes whose regulation is cell-type specific and suggest a unique metabolic response of endothelial cells to reduced oxygen tension.",

    "abstract": "Human breast milk is a dynamic fluid that contains millions of cells, but their identities and phenotypic properties are poorly understood. We used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to characterize the transcriptomes of cells from human breast milk (hBM) across lactational time from 3 to 632 days postpartum in 15 donors. We find that the majority of cells in human breast milk are lactocytes, a specialized epithelial subset, and cell type frequencies shift over the course of lactation yielding greater epithelial diversity at later points. Analysis of lactocytes reveals a continuum of cell states characterized by transcriptional changes in hormone, growth factor, and milk production related pathways. Generalized additive models suggest that one sub-cluster, LALBAlow epithelial cells, increase as a function of time postpartum, daycare attendance, and the use of hormonal birth control. We identify several sub-clusters of macrophages in hBM that are enriched for tolerogenic functions, possibly playing a role in protecting the mammary gland during lactation. Our description of the cellular components of breast milk, their association with maternal-infant dyad metadata and quantification of alterations at the gene and pathways levels provides the first detailed longitudinal picture of human breast milk cells across lactational time. This work paves the way for future investigations of how a potential division of cellular labor and differential hormone regulation might be leveraged therapeutically to support healthy lactation and potentially aid in milk production.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPaternal genome elimination (PGE) - a type of reproduction in which males inherit but fail to pass on their fathers genome - evolved independently in six to eight arthropod clades. Thousands of species, including several important for agriculture, reproduce via this mode of reproduction. While PGE is well established in some of the clades, the evidence in globular springtails (Symphypleona) remains elusive, even though they represent the oldest and most species rich clade putatively reproducing via PGE. We sequenced genomic DNA from whole bodies of Allacma fusca males with high fractions (>27.5%) of sperm to conclusively confirm that all the sperm carry one parental haplotype only. Although it is suggestive that the single haplotype present in sperm is maternally inherited, definitive genetic proof of the parent of origin is still needed. The genomic approach we developed allows for detection of genotypic differences between germline and soma in all species with sufficiently high fraction of germline in their bodies. This opens new opportunities for scans of reproductive modes in small organisms.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations are an inevitable component of ageing and the most important cause of cancer. The rates and types of somatic mutation vary across individuals, but relatively few inherited influences on mutation processes are known. We performed a comprehensive gene-based rare variant association study with diverse mutational processes, using human cancer genomes from over 11,000 individuals of European ancestry. By combining burden and variance tests, we identify 207 associations involving 15 somatic mutational phenotypes and 42 genes that replicated in an independent data set at a FDR of 1%. We associated rare inherited deleterious variants in novel genes such as MSH3, EXO1, SETD2, and MTOR with two different forms of DNA mismatch repair deficiency, and variants in genes such as EXO1, PAXIP1, and WRN with deficiency in homologous recombination repair. In addition, we identified associations with other mutational processes, such as APEX1 with APOBEC-signature mutagenesis. Many of the novel genes interact with each other and with known mutator genes within cellular sub-networks. Considered collectively, damaging variants in the newly-identified genes are prevalent in the population. We suggest that rare germline variation in diverse genes commonly impacts mutational processes in somatic cells.",

The formation of the complexes significantly enhances electron transfer rates, and that the single TM of cyt b5 and b5R mediated assembly of the complexes.

    "abstract": "The biopharmaceutical industry is transitioning towards adoption of continuous biomanufacturing practices that are often more flexible and efficient than traditional batch processes. Regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are further urging use of advanced PAT to analyze the design space to increase process knowledge and enable high quality biologics production. Post-translational modification of proteins, such as N-linked glycosylation are often critical quality attributes known to affect biologics safety and efficacy hence requiring close monitoring during manufacturing. Here, we developed an online sequential-injection based PAT system, called N-GLYcanyzer, that can rapidly monitor mAb glycosylation during upstream biomanufacturing. The key innovation includes design of an integrated mAb sampling and derivation system for antibody titer and glycoform analysis in under 2 hours. The N-GLYcanyzer process includes mAb capture, deglycosylation, fluorescent glycan labeling, and glycan enrichment for direct injection and analysis on an integrated high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Different fluorescent tags and reductants were tested to maximize glycan labeling efficiency under aqueous conditions, while porous graphitized carbon (PGC) was studied for optimum glycan recovery and enrichment. We find that 2-AB labeling of glycans with 2-picoline borane as a reducing agent, using the N-GLYcanyzer workflow, gives higher glycan labeling efficiency under aqueous conditions leading to upwards of a 5-fold increase in fluorescent products intensity. Finally, we showcase how the N-GLYcanyzer platform can be implemented at/on-line to an upstream bioreactor for automated and near real-time glycosylation monitoring of a Trastuzumab biosimilar produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/468439v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fbb698org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@90da13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dd45e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17fadd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG N-GLYcanyzer is an automated PAT toolkit for rapid sample processing for mAb N-linked glycans analysis to enable advanced biologics manufacturing\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic liquid biopsies using affinity-based capture of extracellular vesicles (EVs) have demonstrated great potential for providing rapid disease diagnosis and monitoring. However, little effort has been devoted to optimising the geometry of the microfluidic channels for maximum EV capture due to the inherent challenges of physically testing many geometric designs. To address this, we developed an automated parallel pattern search (PPS) optimiser by combining a Python optimiser, COMSOL Multiphysics, and high performance computing. This unique approach was applied to a triangular micropillar array geometry by parameterising repeating unit cells, making several assumptions, and optimising for maximum particle capture efficiency. We successfully optimised the triangular pillar arrays and surprisingly found that simply maximising the total number of pillars and effective surface area did not result in maximum EV capture, as devices with slightly larger pillars and more spacing between pillars allowed contact with slower moving EVs that followed the pillar contours more closely. We then experimentally validated this finding using bioreactor-produced EVs in the best and worst channel designs that were functionalised with an antibody against CD63. Captured EVs were quantified using a fluorescent plate reader, followed by an established elution method and nanoparticle tracking analysis. These results demonstrate the power of automated microfluidic geometry optimisations for EV liquid biopsies and will support further development of this rapidly growing field.",

However, whether ceRNAs contribute to the oncogenic effects of CNAs is unknown. We report that chromosome 1q gains promote melanoma progression and metastasis at least in part through overexpression of three mRNAs with ceRNA activity: CEP170, NUCKS1, and ZC3H11A. Genetic studies reveal that these ceRNAs enhance melanoma metastasis by sequestering tumor suppressor miRNAs, thereby alleviating the repression of several pro-metastatic target genes. This regulatory RNA network is evident in other cancer types, suggesting that chromosome 1q ceRNA deregulation is a common driver of cancer progression. Taken together, our work demonstrates that ceRNAs mediate the oncogenicity of somatic CNAs.",

The plant hormone, ethylene, and its precursor, 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), induce formation and elongation of root hairs.

In two ethylene-insensitive mutants, etr1-3 and ein3/eil1, there was no increase in root hair number or ROS accumulation. Conversely, etr1-7, a constitutive ethylene signaling receptor mutant, has increased root hair formation and ROS accumulation like ethylene-treated Col-0 seedlings. The caprice and werewolf transcription factor mutants have decreased and elevated ROS levels, which are correlated with levels of root hair initiation. The rhd2-6 mutant, with a defect in the gene encoding a ROS synthesizing Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog C (RBOHC) and the prx44-2 mutant defective in a class III peroxidase, showed impaired ethylene-dependent ROS synthesis and root hair formation and EIN3/EIL1 dependent transcriptional regulation.

    "abstract": "Extracellular signaling proteins serve as neuronal growth cone guidance molecules during development and are well positioned to be involved in neuronal regeneration and recovery from injury. Semaphorins and their receptors, the plexins, are a family of conserved proteins involved in development that, in the nervous system, are axonal guidance cues mediating axon pathfinding and synapse formation. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes for three semaphorins and two plexin receptors: the transmembrane semaphorins, SMP-1 and SMP-2, signal through their receptor, PLX-1, while the secreted semaphorin, MAB-20, signals through PLX-2. Here, we evaluate the locomotion behavior of knockout animals missing each of the semaphorins and plexins and the neuronal morphology of plexin knockout animals; we described the cellular expression pattern of the promoters of all plexins in the nervous system of C. elegans; and we evaluated their effect on the regrowth and reconnection of motoneuron neurites and the recovery of locomotion behavior following precise laser microsurgery. Regrowth and reconnection were more prevalent in the absence of each plexin, while recovery of locomotion surpassed regeneration in all genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Scientific AbstractEmotional learning and memory are affected in numerous psychiatric disorders. At a systems level, however, the underlying neural circuitry is not well defined. Rodent fear conditioning (FC) provides a translational model to study the networks underlying associative memory retrieval. In the current study, functional connectivity among regions related to the cue associative fear network were investigated using functional ultrasound (fUS), a novel imaging technique with great potential for detecting regional neural activity through cerebral blood flow. Behavioral fear expression and fUS imaging were performed one and thirty-one days after FC to assess recent and remote memory recall. Cue-evoked increases in functional connectivity were detected throughout the amygdala, with the lateral (LA) and central (CeA) amygdalar nuclei emerging as major hubs of connectivity, though CeA connectivity was reduced during remote recall. The hippocampus and sensory cortical regions displayed heightened connectivity with the LA during remote recall, whereas interconnectivity between the primary auditory cortex and temporal association areas was reduced. Subregions of the prefrontal cortex exhibited variable connectivity changes, where prelimbic connectivity with the amygdala was refined while specific connections between the infralimbic cortex and amygdalar subregions emerged during remote memory retrieval. Moreover, freezing behavior positively correlated with functional connectivity between hubs of the associative fear network, suggesting that emotional response intensity reflected the strength of the cue-evoked functional network. Overall, our data provide evidence of the functionality of fUS imaging to investigate the neural dynamics of memory encoding and retrieval, applicable in the development of innovative treatments for affective disorders.\n\nHighlightsFunctional ultrasound imaging can elucidate fear associated neural networks\n\nFreezing behavior correlates with cue-evoked functional connectivity changes\n\nThe lateral and central amygdalar nuclei are major hubs in the fear network\n\nThe hippocampus is active during recent and remote cued fear memory retrieval\n\nConnectivity profiles of the prelimbic and infralimbic areas vary in remote recall",

    "abstract": "The division of labour among DNA polymerase underlies the accuracy and efficiency of replication. However, the roles of replicative polymerases have not been directly established in human cells. We developed polymerase usage sequence (Pu-seq) in HCT116 cells and mapped Pol{varepsilon} and Pol usage genome wide. The polymerase usage profiles show Pol{varepsilon} synthesises the leading strand and Pol contributes mainly to lagging strand synthesis. Combining the Pol{varepsilon} and Pol profiles, we accurately predict the genome-wide pattern of fork directionality plus zones of replication initiation and termination. We confirm that transcriptional activity contributes to the pattern of initiation and termination and, by separately analysing the effect of transcription on both co-directional and converging forks, demonstrate that coupled DNA synthesis of leading and lagging strands in both co- directional and convergent forks is compromised by transcription. Polymerase uncoupling is particularly evident in the vicinity of large genes, including the two most unstable common fragile sites, FRA3B and FRA3D, thus linking transcription-induced polymerase uncoupling to chromosomal instability.",

    "abstract": "Why would a pathogen evolve to kill its hosts when killing a host ends a pathogens own opportunity for transmission? A vast body of scientific literature has attempted to answer this question using \"trade-off theory,\" which posits that host mortality persists due to its cost being balanced by benefits of other traits that correlate with host mortality. The most commonly invoked trade-off is the mortality-transmission trade-off, where increasingly harmful pathogens are assumed to transmit at higher rates from hosts while the hosts are alive, but the pathogens truncate their infectious period by killing their hosts. Here I show that costs of mortality are too small to plausibly constrain the evolution of disease severity except in systems where survival is rare. I alternatively propose that disease severity can be much more readily constrained by a cost of behavioral change due to the detection of infection, whereby increasingly harmful pathogens have increasing likelihood of detection and behavioral change following detection, thereby limiting opportunities for transmission. Using a mathematical model, I show the conditions under which detection can limit disease severity. Ultimately, this argument may explain why empirical support for trade-off theory has been limited and mixed.",

    "abstract": "Subspace clustering identifies multiple feature subspaces embedded in a dataset together with the underlying sample clusters. When applied to omic data, subspace clustering is a challenging task, as additional problems have to be addressed: the curse of dimensionality, the imperfect data quality and cluster separation, the presence of multiple subspaces representative of divergent views of the dataset, and the lack of consensus on the best clustering method.\n\nFirst, we propose a computational method (discover) to perform subspace clustering on tabular high dimensional data by maximizing the internal clustering score (i.e. cluster compactness) of feature subspaces. Our algorithm can be used in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Secondly, by applying our method to a large set of omic datasets (i.e. microarray, bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq), we show that the subspace corresponding to the provided ground truth annotations is rarely the most compact one, as assumed by the methods maximizing the internal quality of clusters. Our results highlight the difficulty of fully validating subspace clusters (justified by the lack of feature annotations). Tested on identifying the ground-truth subspace, our method compared favorably with competing techniques on all datasets. Finally, we propose a suite of techniques to interpret the clustering results biologically in the absence of annotations. We demonstrate that subspace clustering can provide biologically meaningful sample-wise and feature-wise information, typically missed by traditional methods.\n\nCCS Concepts: * Computing methodologies [-&gt;] Genetic algorithms; Mixture models; Cluster analysis.\n\nACM Reference FormatMadalina Ciortan and Matthieu Defrance. 2021.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecently in Japan, six workers at a chemical plant that manufactures resins developed interstitial lung diseases after being involved in loading and packing cross-linked water-soluble acrylic acid polymers (CWAAPs). Since CWAAPs are not on the list of occupational diseases, the present study examined the lung damage potential of two CWAAPs (CWAAP-A and CWAAP-B) in rats, investigated pathological mechanisms, and established a method to rapidly evaluate the harmfulness of CWAAPs.\n\nMethodsUsing a whole-body inhalation exposure system, male F344 rats were exposed once to 40 or 100 mg/m3 of CWAAP-A for 4 hours or to 15 or 40 mg/m3 of CWAAP-A for 4 hours per day once per week for 2 months (a total of 9 exposures). In a separate set of experiments, male F344 rats were administered 1 mg/kg CWAAP-A or CWAAP-B by intratracheal instillation once every two weeks for 2 months (a total of five doses). Lung tissues, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were collected and subjected to biological and histopathological analyses.\n\nResultsA single 4-hour exposure to CWAAP caused alveolar injury, and repeated exposures resulted in regenerative changes in the alveolar epithelium with activation of TGF{beta} signaling. During the recovery period after the last exposure, some alveolar lesions were partially healed, but other lesions developed into alveolitis with fibrous thickening of the alveolar septum. Rats administered CWAAP-A by intratracheal instillation developed qualitatively similar pulmonary pathology as rats exposed to CWAAP-A by inhalation. At 2 weeks after intratracheal instillation, rats administered CWAAP-B appeared to have a slightly higher degree of lung lesions compared to rats administered CWAAP-A, however, there was no difference in these lesions of CWAAP-A and CWAAP-B in rats examined 18 weeks after administration of these materials.\n\nConclusionsThe present study provides evidence of rat lung pathogenesis after inhalation exposure to CWAAP-A. This study also demonstrates that the lung pathology of rats exposed to CWAAP-A by systemic inhalation was qualitatively similar to that of rats administered CWAAP-A by intratracheal instillation. The use of intratracheal instillation as an adjunct to systemic inhalation is expected to significantly accelerate the risk assessment for a variety of CWAAPs.",
