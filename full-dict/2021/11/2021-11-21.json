    "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been the first-line standard of care for the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) since 2005. Though initially beneficial, TMZ- resistance is universal and second-line interventions are an unmet clinical need. Here we took advantage the mechanism of action of TMZ to target guanines (G) and investigated G-rich g- quadruplex (G4) and splice site changes that occur upon TMZ-resistance. We report TMZ-resistant GBM has guanine mutations that disrupt the G-rich DNA G4s and splice sites that lead to deregulated alternative splicing. These alterations create vulnerabilities, which are selectively targeted by either the G4 stabilizing drug TMPyP4 or a novel splicing kinase inhibitor of cdc2- like kinase. Finally, we show that the G4 and RNA-binding protein EWSR1 aggregates in the cytoplasm in TMZ-resistant GBM cells and patient samples. Together, our findings provide insight into targetable vulnerabilities of TMZ-resistant GBM and present cytoplasmic EWSR1 as a putative biomarker.\n\nTeaserTargeting temozolomide mutations in drug resistant glioma via g-quadruplex and splicing modulators with a putative biomarker.",

    "abstract": "To analyse large corpora using machine learning and other Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, the corpora need to be standardised. The BioC format is a community-driven simple data structure for sharing text and annotations, however there is limited access to biomedical literature in BioC format and a lack of bioinformatics tools to convert online publication HTML formats to BioC. We present Auto-CORPus (Automated pipeline for Consistent Outputs from Research Publications), a novel NLP tool for the standardisation and conversion of publication HTML and table image files to three convenient machine-interpretable outputs to support biomedical text analytics. Firstly, Auto-CORPus can be configured to convert HTML from various publication sources to BioC. To standardise the description of heterogenous publication sections, the Information Artifact Ontology is used to annotate each section within the BioC output. Secondly, Auto-CORPus transforms publication tables to a JSON format to store, exchange and annotate table data between text analytics systems. The BioC specification does not include a data structure for representing publication table data, so we present a JSON format for sharing table content and metadata. Inline tables within full-text HTML files and linked tables within separate HTML files are processed and converted to machine-interpretable table JSON format. Finally, Auto-CORPus extracts abbreviations declared within publication text and provides an abbreviations JSON output that relates an abbreviation with the full definition. This abbreviation collection supports text mining tasks such as named entity recognition by including abbreviations unique to individual publications that are not contained within standard bio-ontologies and dictionaries.\n\nAvailabilityThe Auto-CORPus package is freely available with detailed instructions from Github at https://github.com/omicsNLP/Auto-CORPus/.",

    "abstract": "How signaling proteins generate a multitude of information to organize tissue patterns is critical to understanding morphogenesis. In Drosophila, FGF produced in wing-disc cells regulates the development of the disc-associated air-sac-primordium (ASP). Here, we show that FGF is Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored to the producing cell surface and that this modification both inhibits free FGF secretion and activates target-specific bidirectional FGF-FGFR signaling through cytonemes. FGF-source and recipient ASP cells extend cytonemes that present FGF and FGFR on their surfaces and reciprocally recognize each other over distance by contacting through CAM-like FGF-FGFR binding. Contact-mediated FGF-FGFR binding induces bidirectional signaling, which, in turn, promotes ASP and source cells to polarize cytonemes toward each other and reinforce signaling contacts. Subsequent un-anchoring of FGFR-bound-FGF from the source cell membrane dissociates cytoneme contacts and delivers FGF target-specifically to ASP cytonemes for paracrine functions. Thus, GPI-anchored FGF organizes both source and recipient cells and self-regulates its cytoneme-mediated tissue-specific dispersion and signaling.",

    "abstract": "Despite fluctuations in embryo size within a species, the spatial gene expression pattern and hence the embryonic structure develop in proportion with embryo size, known as the scaling phenomenon. For morphogen induced patterning of gene expression, the positional information encoded in the morphogen profile is decoded by the downstream genetic network (the decoder). In this paper, we show that the requirement of scaling sets severe constraints on the geometric structure of the decoder, which in turn enables deduction of mutants behavior and extraction of regulation information without going into any molecular details. We demonstrate that the Drosophila gap gene system achieves scaling in the way consistent with our theory - the decoder geometry required by scaling correctly accounts for the observed gap gene expression pattern in nearly all maternal morphogen mutants. Furthermore, the regulation logic and the coding/decoding strategy of the gap gene system can also be revealed from the decoder geometry. Our work provides a general theoretical framework on a large class of problems where scaling output is induced by non-scaling input, as well as a unified understanding of scaling, mutants behavior and gene regulation for the Drosophila gap gene system.",

Mechanisms for direct invasion of neighboring host cells have been discovered in cell culture, but we lack an understanding of how bacteria directly spread from cell-to-cell in vivo. Here, we describe the discovery of a bacterial species that uses filamentation as an in vivo mechanism for intracellular spreading between the intestinal epithelial cells of its host, the rhabditid nematode Oscheius tipulae. In vitro and in vivo filamentation by this bacterium, Bordetella atropi, requires a highly conserved nutrient-sensing pathway used by divergent bacteria to detect rich conditions and inhibit the divisome. Thus, B. atropi uses a distinct mechanism for cell-to-cell spreading by coopting a pathway that normally regulates bacterial cell size to trigger filamentation inside host cells.",

    "abstract": "Neural responses are variable: even under identical experimental conditions, single neuron and population responses typically differ from trial to trial and across time. Recent work has demonstrated that this variability has predictable structure, can be modulated by sensory input and behaviour, and bears critical signatures of the underlying network dynamics and computations. However, current methods for characterising neural variability are primarily geared towards sensory coding in the laboratory: they require trials with repeatable experimental stimuli and behavioural covariates. In addition, they make strong assumptions about the parametric form of variability, rely on assumption-free but data-inefficient histogram-based approaches, or are altogether ill-suited for capturing variability modulation by covariates. Here we present a universal probabilistic spike count model that eliminates these shortcomings. Our method builds on sparse Gaussian processes and can model arbitrary spike count distributions (SCDs) with flexible dependence on observed as well as latent covariates, using scalable variational inference to jointly infer the covariate-to-SCD mappings and latent trajectories in a data efficient way. Without requiring repeatable trials, it can flexibly capture covariate-dependent joint SCDs, and provide interpretable latent causes underlying the statistical dependencies between neurons. We apply the model to recordings from a canonical non-sensory neural population: head direction cells in the mouse. We find that variability in these cells defies a simple parametric relationship with mean spike count as assumed in standard models, its modulation by external covariates can be comparably strong to that of the mean firing rate, and slow low-dimensional latent factors explain away neural correlations. Our approach paves the way to understanding the mechanisms and computations underlying neural variability under naturalistic conditions, beyond the realm of sensory coding with repeatable stimuli.",

However, due to large variations in the organizational principles of individual brains, many challenges remain in clinical applications. Brain atlas individualization network (BAI-Net) is an algorithm that subdivides individual cerebral cortex into segregated areas using brain morphology and connectomes. BAI-Net integrates topological priors derived from a group atlas, adjusts the areal probability using the connectivity context derived from diffusion tractography, and provides reliable and explainable individualized brain parcels across multiple sessions and scanners. We demonstrate that BAI-Net outperforms the conventional iterative clustering approach by capturing significantly heritable topographic variations in individualized cartographies. The topographic variability of BAI-Net cartographies shows strong associations with individual variability in brain morphology, connectivity fingerprints and cognitive behaviors. This study provides a new framework for individualized brain cartography and paves the way of atlas-based precision medicine in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Several software tools for the simulation and analysis of biochemical reaction networks have been developed in the last decades; however, assessing and comparing their computational performance in executing the typical tasks of Computational Systems Biology can be limited by the lack of a standardized benchmarking approach. To overcome these limitations, we propose here a novel tool, named SMGen, designed to automatically generate synthetic models of reaction networks that, by construction, are characterized by both features (e.g., system connectivity, reaction discreteness) and non trivial emergent dynamics of real biochemical networks. The generation of synthetic models in SMGen is based on the definition of an undirected graph consisting of a single connected component, which generally results in a computationally demanding task. To avoid any burden in the execution time, SMGen exploits a Main-Worker paradigm to speed up the overall process. SMGen is also provided with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface that allows the user to easily set up all the parameters required to generate a set of synthetic models with any user-defined number of reactions and species. We analysed the computational performance of SMGen by generating batches of symmetric and asymmetric Reaction-based Models (RBMs) of increasing size, showing how a different number of reactions and/or species affects the generation time. Our results show that when the number of reactions is higher than the number of species, SMGen has to identify and correct high numbers of errors during the creation process of the RBMs, a circumstance that increases the overall running time. Still, SMGen can create synthetic models with 512 species and reactions in less than 7 seconds. The open-source code of SMGen is available on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/sgr34/smgen.",

With the emergence of multiplexed single-cell proteomics, studies increasingly present single-cell measurements in conjunction with an abundant congruent carrier to improve precursor selection and enhance identifications. While these extreme carrier spikes are often >100-times more abundant than the investigated samples, undoubtedly the total ion current increases, but quantitative accuracy possibly is affected. We here focus on narrowly titrated carrier spikes (i.e., <20x) and assess their elimination for comparable sensitivity at superior accuracy. We find that subtle changes in the carrier ratio can severely impact measurement variability and describe alternative multiplexing strategies to evaluate data quality. Lastly, we demonstrate elevated replicate overlap while preserving acquisition throughput at improved quantitative accuracy with DIA-TMT and discuss optimized experimental designs for multiplexed proteomics of trace samples. This comprehensive benchmarking gives an overview of currently available techniques and guides conceptualizing the optimal single-cell proteomics experiment.",

The knowledge about their status may help in future avifauna conservation plans. Hence, we examined the avian haemosporidians status, in selected bird groups (Old world Flycatchers, Warblers, Babblers, and Thrushes) of India, and their phylogenetic relationships with other known lineages of the world. We used the common genetic marker (Cytochrome b gene fragment of 479 bp) with information on the geographic distribution of parasite and host species available at MalAvi database. The prevalence of avian haemosporidians, from northern, eastern, and southern parts of India and phylogenetic genetic analysis of lineages was carried out to know the genetic relatedness among them at local and world level. The MCC tree revealed six Haemosporidian lineages in which one was common (H_MSP01) and five were unique (H_CYOPOL01, H_CHD01, H_CYORUB01, H_EUMTHA01, and P_GEOCIT01). The avian host richness Index was 2.0852. 9.9%, prevalence of Haemosporidian infection was found in 111 DNA samples belonging to 6 host species. The Haemoproteus prevalence was found to be 9.0 % across five host species (Phylloscopus trochiloides, Cyornis poliogenys, C. hainanus dialilaemus, C. rubeculoides, Eumiyas thalassinus) and Plasmodium prevalence was 0.9% in Geokichla citrina. Spatial phylogeny at global level showed H_MSP01 lineage, found in different host species in India, was genetically related to H. pallidus lineages (COLL2 and PFC1) in parts of Africa, Europe, North America, Malaysia, and Philippines. The Plasmodium lineage (P_GEOCIT01) was related to PADOM16 in Egypt with poor sequence similarity (93.89%). The statistical analysis suggested that the haemosporidians host species distribution range was directly and significantly associated with the altitude, minimum temperature, and relative humidity.

The large scale exploration of environmental microbial diversity through metabarcoding approaches have been focused mainly on the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rDNA gene. The accurate interpretation of such environmental surveys is hampered by technical (e.g., PCR and sequencing errors) and biological biases (e.g., intra-genomic variability). Here we explored the intra-genomic diversity of Nassellaria and Spumellaria specimens (Radiolaria) by comparing Sanger sequencing with Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (MinION). Our analysis determined that intra-genomic variability of Nassellaria and Spumellaria is generally low, yet some Spumellaria specimens showed two different copies of the V4 with <97% similarity. From the different sequencing methods, Illumina showed the highest number of contaminations (i.e., environmental DNA, cross-contamination, tag-jumping), revealed by its high sequencing depth; and MinION showed the highest sequencing rate error (~14%). Yet the long reads produced by MinION (~2900 bp) allowed accurate phylogenetic reconstruction studies. These results highlight the requirement for a careful interpretation of Illumina based metabarcoding studies, in particular regarding low abundant amplicons, and open future perspectives towards full environmental rDNA metabarcoding surveys.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli (CP-Ec) represent a major public health threat with a risk of dissemination in the community as it has occurred for lineages producing extended spectrum {beta}-lactamases. To characterize the extend of CP-Ec spread in France, isolates from screening and infection samples received at the French National Reference Centre laboratory (F-NRC) for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales were investigated. Six hundred and ninety one CP-Ec isolates collected between 2012 and 2015 and 22 before were fully sequenced. Analysis of their genome sequences revealed some disseminating multidrug resistant (MDR) lineages frequently acquiring diverse carbapenemase genes mainly belonging to clonal complex (CC) 23 (ST 410) and CC10 (ST10, ST167) and sporadic isolates including rare ST131 isolates (n=17). However, the most represented ST was ST38 (n=92) with four disseminated lineages carrying blaOXA-48-like genes inserted in the chromosome. Globally, the most frequent carbapenemase gene (n=457) was blaOXA-48. It was also less frequently associated with MDR isolates being the only resistance gene in 119 isolates. Thus, outside the ST38 clades, its acquisition was frequently sporadic with no sign of dissemination, reflecting the circulation of the IncL plasmid pOXA-48 in France and its high frequency of conjugation. In contrast blaOXA-181 or blaNDM genes were often associated with the evolution of MDR E. coli lineages characterized by mutations in ftsI and ompC.\n\nIMPORTANCECarbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli (CP-Ec) might be difficult to detect, as minimal inhibitory concentrations can be very low. However, their absolute number and their proportion among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales have been increasing, as reported by WHO and national surveillance programs. This suggests a still largely uncharacterized community spread of these isolates. Here we have characterized the diversity and evolution of CP-Ec isolated in France before 2016. We show that carbapenemase genes are associated with a wide variety of E. coli genomic backgrounds and a small number of dominant phylogenetic lineages. In a significant proportion of CP-Ec, the most frequent carbapenemase gene blaOXA-48, was detected in isolates lacking any other resistance gene, reflecting the dissemination of pOXA-48 plasmids, likely in the absence of any antibiotic pressure. In contrast carbapenemase gene transfer may also occur in multi-drug resistant E. coli, ultimately giving rise to at-risk lineages encoding carbapenemases with a high potential of dissemination.",

    "abstract": "O_LIHumans have long sought to restore species, but little attention has been directed at how to best select a subset of foundation species for maintaining rich assemblages that support ecosystems, like coral reefs and rainforests that are increasingly threatened by environmental change.\nC_LIO_LIWe propose a two-part hedging approach that selects optimized sets of species for restoration. The first part acknowledges that biodiversity supports ecosystem functions and services, and so it takes precaution against loss by ensuring an even spread of phenotypic traits. The second part maximizes species and ecosystem persistence by weighting species based on characteristics that are known to improve ecological persistence--e.g., abundance, species range and tolerance to environmental change.\nC_LIO_LIUsing existing phenotypic trait and ecological characteristic data for reef building corals, we identified sets of ecologically persistent species by examining marginal returns in occupancy of phenotypic trait space. We compared optimal sets of species with those from the worlds southern-most coral reef which naturally harbors low coral diversity to show these occupy much of the trait space. Comparison with an existing coral restoration program indicated that current corals used for restoration only cover part of the desired trait space and may be improved by including species with different traits.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. While there are many possible criteria for selecting species for restoration, the approach proposed here addresses the need to insure against unpredictable losses of ecosystem services by focusing on a wide range of phenotypic traits and ecological characteristics. Furthermore, the flexibility of the approach enables the functional goals of restoration to vary depending on environmental context, stakeholder values, and the spatial and temporal scales at which meaningful impacts can be achieved.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by immune activation, vasculopathy, and unresolving fibrosis in the skin, lungs, and other organs. We performed RNA-Seq analysis on skin biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SSc patients and controls to better understand SSc pathogenesis. We analyzed these data to 1) test for case-control differences, and 2) identify genes whose expression levels correlate with SSc severity as measured by local skin score, modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS), forced vital capacity (FVC), or diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). We found that PBMCs from SSc patients showed a strong type 1 interferon signature. This signal replicated in the skin, with additional signals for increased extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, classical complement pathway activation, and the presence of B cells. Notably, we observed a marked decrease in the expression of SPAG17, a cilia component, in SSc skin. We identified genes that correlated with MRSS, DLCO, and FVC in SSc PBMCs and skin using weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA). These genes were largely distinct from the case/control differentially expressed genes. In PBMCs, type 1 interferon signatures negatively correlated with DLCO. In SSc skin, ECM gene expression positively correlated with MRSS. Network analysis of SSc skin genes correlated with clinical features identified the non-coding RNAs SOX9-AS1 and ROCR, both near the SOX9 locus, as highly connected, \"hub-like\" genes in the network. These results identify non-coding RNAs and SPAG17 as novel factors potentially implicated in SSc pathogenesis.",

However, some studies report divergent gamma effects across single participants.\n\nMethodsIn two repeated sessions we recorded gamma responses to pain and touch stimuli using EEG. Individual gamma responses were extracted from EEG channels and from ICA components that contain a strong gamma amplitude.\n\nResultsWe observed gamma responses in the majority of the participants. If present, gamma synchronisation was always bound to a component that contained a laser-evoked response. We found a broad variety of individual cortical processing: some participants showed a clear gamma effect, others did not exhibit any gamma. For both modalities, the effect was reproducible between sessions. In addition, participants with a strong gamma response showed a similar time-frequency pattern across sessions.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that current measures of reproducibility of research results do not reflect the complex reality of the diverse individual processing pattern of applied pain and touch.

    "abstract": "Axons are the long and slender processes of neurons constituting the biological cables that wire the nervous system. The growth and maintenance of axons require bundles of microtubules that extend through their entire length. Understanding microtubule regulation is therefore an essential aspect of axon biology. Key regulators of neuronal microtubules are the spectraplakins, a well-conserved family of cytoskeletal cross-linkers that underlie neuropathies in mouse and humans. Spectraplakin deficiency in mouse or Drosophila causes severe decay of microtubule bundles and axon growth inhibition. The underlying mechanisms are best understood for Drosophila Short stop (Shot) and believed to involve cytoskeletal cross-linkage: the N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domains bind to F-actin, and the C-terminus to microtubules and Eb1. Here we have gained new understanding by showing that the F-actin interaction must be finely balanced: altering the properties of F-actin networks or deleting/exchanging Shots CH domains induces changes in Shot function - with a Lifeact-containing Shot variant causing remarkable remodelling of neuronal microtubules. In addition to actin-MT cross-linkage, we find strong indications that Shot executes redundant MT bundle-promoting roles that are F-actin-independent. We argue that these likely involve the neuronal Shot-PH isoform, which is characterised by a large, unexplored central plakin repeat region (PRR). Work on PRRs might therefore pave the way towards important new mechanisms of axon biology and architecture that might similarly apply to central PRRs in mammalian spectraplakins.",

    "abstract": "Excessive inflammatory responses can cause collateral tissue damage or autoimmune inflammation, sometimes with severe morbidity or mortality. During host defense responses, numerous negative feedback mechanisms are established to prevent excessive unchecked inflammation. However, this restraint can sometimes come at the cost of suboptimal infection control, and we do not fully understand how this balance is maintained during different infection settings. The endoribonuclease Regnase-1 (Reg1, Zc3h12a, MCPIP1) is an RNA binding protein (RBP) that binds and degrades many target mRNA transcripts. Reg1 is a potent feedback regulator of IL-17 and LPS signal transduction, among other stimuli. Consequently, Reg1 deficiency exacerbates autoimmune inflammation in multiple mouse models, but on the other hand, reduced Reg1 improves immunity to fungal infection. To date, the role of Reg1 in bacterial immunity is poorly defined. Here, we show that mice deficient in Reg1 are more resistant to pulmonary Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infection. Unexpectedly, effects of Reg1 deficiency were not due to accelerated eradication of bacteria or increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Rather, alveolar macrophages from Reg1-deficient mice showed enrichment of Type I IFN-related genes upon KP infection, accompanied by increased Ifnb1 expression. Surprisingly, the stability of Ifnb1 mRNA was not altered by Reg1-deficiency; rather, mRNA encoding its upstream regulator IRF7 appeared to be a more prominent target. Blockade of IFNR during KP infection reversed disease improvement. Thus, impaired Reg1 induces Type I IFN and enhances resistance to KP, raising the possibility that Reg1 could be a potential clinical target in acute bacterial infections.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/469389v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8c3235org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@345086org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92bec2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29b7fa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus has evolved a unique strategy to evade host immune response by coding for two non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2. Recently it was shown that in infected cells, nuclear NS1 could be involved in transcription regulation of host genes linked to innate immune response, via an interaction with chromatin and the Mediator complex. Here we identified the MED25 Mediator subunit as an NS1 interactor in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We demonstrate that NS1 directly interacts with MED25 in vitro and in cellula, and that this interaction involves the C-terminal 3 helix of NS1 and the MED25 ACID domain. More specifically we showed by NMR that the NS1 3 sequence primarily binds to the MED25 ACID H2 face, which is a transactivation domain (TAD) binding site for transcription regulators such as ATF6, a master regulator of ER stress response activated upon viral infection. Moreover, we found out that the NS1 3 helix could compete with ATF6 TAD binding to MED25. This finding points to a mechanism of NS1 interfering with innate immune response by impairing recruitment by cellular TADs of the Mediator via MED25 and hence transcription of specific genes by RNA polymerase II.\n\nImportanceHuman RSV is the leading cause of infantile bronchiolitis in the world and one of the major causes of childhood deaths in resource-poor settings. It is a major unmet target for vaccines and anti-viral drugs. RSV non-structural protein NS1 is known to antagonize the cellular immune response and was recently shown to be involved in transcription regulation of infected cells. However, the exact mechanism of this regulation is not well defined. Here we show that nuclear NS1 interacts directly with the Mediator subunit MED25 and is able to compete with a cellular transcription activator, which is activated during viral infection. We hypothesize that this interaction may underlie regulation of the expression of genes involved in the innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding speciation has long been a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. It is widely accepted that speciation requires an interruption of gene flow to generate strong reproductive isolation between species, in which sexual selection may play an important role by generating and maintaining sexual dimorphism. The mechanism of how sexual selection operated in speciation with gene flow remains an open question and the subject of many research. Two species in genus Chrysolophus, Golden pheasant (C. pictus) and Lady Amhersts pheasant (C. amherstiae), which both exhibit significant plumage dichromatism, are currently parapatric in the southwest China with several hybrid recordings in field.\n\nMethodsIn this research, we estimated the pattern of gene flow during the speciation of two pheasants using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method based on the multiple genes data. With a new assembled de novo genome of Lady Amhersts pheasant and resequencing of widely distributed individuals, we reconstructed the demographic history of the two pheasants by pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC).\n\nResultsThe results provide clear evidence that the gene flow between the two pheasants were consistent with the prediction of isolation with migration model for allopatric populations, indicating that there was long-term gene flow after the initially divergence (ca. 2.2 million years ago), and further support the secondary contact when included the parapatric populations since around 30 ka ongoing gene flow to now, which might be induced by the population expansion of the Golden pheasant in late Pleistocene.\n\nConclusionsThe results of the study support the scenario of speciation between Golden pheasant (C. pictus) and Lady Amhersts pheasant (C. amherstiae) with cycles of mixing-isolation-mixing due to the dynamics of natural selection and sexual selection in late Pleistocene that provide a good research system as evolutionary model to test reinforcement selection in speciation.",

We also develop a novel, versatile technique to retrieve cells embedded in extracellular matrix from the microfluidic device for downstream transcriptomic analysis, and uncover growth factor and cytokine expression profiles associated with improved vasculature growth. Paired receptor-ligand analysis further reveals paracrine signaling molecules that could be supplemented into the medium for vasculatures models where fibroblast co-culture is undesirable or infeasible.

While a number of supervised methods have been developed for this, in most cases such assignment is performed by first clustering cells in low-dimensional space and then assigning cell types to different clusters. To overcome noise and to improve cell type assignments we developed UNIFAN, a neural network method that simultaneously clusters and annotates cells using known gene sets. UNIFAN combines both, low-dimensional representation for all genes and cell specific gene set activity scores to determine the clustering. We applied UNIFAN to human and mouse scRNA-Seq datasets from several different organs. As we show, by using knowledge on gene sets, UNIFAN greatly outperforms prior methods developed for clustering scRNA-Seq data. The gene sets assigned by UNIFAN to different clusters provide strong evidence for the cell type that is represented by this cluster making annotations easier.\n\nSoftwarehttps://github.com/doraadong/UNIFAN",

    "abstract": "The journey by which proteins navigate their energy landscapes to their native structures is complex, involving (and sometimes requiring) many cellular factors and processes operating in partnership with a given polypeptide chains intrinsic energy landscape. The cytosolic environment and its complement of chaperones play critical roles in granting proteins safe passage to their native states; however, the complexity of this medium has generally precluded biophysical techniques from interrogating protein folding under cellular-like conditions for single proteins, let alone entire proteomes. Here, we develop a limited-proteolysis mass spectrometry approach paired with an isotope-labeling strategy to globally monitor the structures of refolding E. coli proteins in the cytosolic medium and with the chaperones, GroEL/ES (Hsp60) and DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE (Hsp70/40). GroEL can refold the majority (85%) of the E. coli proteins for which we have data, and is particularly important for restoring acidic proteins and proteins with three to five domains, trends that come to light because our assay measures the structural outcome of the refolding process itself, rather than indirect measures like binding or aggregation. For the most part, DnaK and GroEL refold a similar set of proteins, supporting the view that despite their vastly different structures, these two chaperones both unfold misfolded states, as one mechanism in common. Finally, we identify a cohort of proteins that are intransigent to being refolded with either chaperone. The data support a model in which chaperone-nonrefolders have evolved to fold efficiently once and only once, co-translationally, and remain kinetically trapped in their native conformations.",

    "abstract": "The genome of a eukaryotic cell is often vulnerable to both intrinsic and extrinsic threats due to its constant exposure to a myriad of heterogeneous compounds. Despite the availability of innate DNA damage response pathways, some genomic lesions trigger cells for malignant transformation. Accurate prediction of carcinogens is an ever-challenging task due to the limited information about bona fide (non)carcinogens. We developed Metabokiller, an ensemble classifier that accurately recognizes carcinogens by quantitatively assessing their electrophilicity as well as their potential to induce proliferation, oxidative stress, genomic instability, alterations in the epigenome, and anti-apoptotic response. Concomitant with the carcinogenicity prediction, Metabokiller is fully interpretable since it reveals the contribution of the aforementioned biochemical properties in imparting carcinogenicity. Metabokiller outperforms existing best-practice methods for carcinogenicity prediction. We used Metabokiller to unravel cells endogenous metabolic threats by screening a large pool of human metabolites and predicted a subset of these metabolites that could potentially trigger malignancy in normal cells. To cross-validate Metabokiller predictions, we performed a range of functional assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells with two Metabokiller-flagged human metabolites namely 4-Nitrocatechol and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and observed high synergy between Metabokiller predictions and experimental validations.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) receive excitation and inhibition from distinct parallel pathways processing lightness (ON) and darkness (OFF). V1 neurons overall respond more strongly to dark than light stimuli, consistent with a preponderance of darker regions in natural images, as well as human psychophysics. However, it has been unclear whether this \"dark-dominance\" is due to more excitation from the OFF pathway or more inhibition from the ON pathway. To understand the mechanisms behind dark-dominance, we record electrophysiological responses of individual simple-type V1 neurons to natural image stimuli and then train biologically inspired convolutional neural networks to predict the neurons responses. Analyzing a sample of 74 neurons (in anesthetized, paralyzed cats) has revealed their responses to be more driven by dark than light stimuli, consistent with previous investigations. We show that this asymmetry is predominantly due to slower inhibition to dark stimuli rather than to stronger excitation from the thalamocortical OFF pathway. Consistent with dark-dominant neurons having faster responses than light-dominant neurons, we find dark-dominance to solely occur in the early latencies of neurons responses. Neurons that are strongly dark-dominated also tend to be less orientation selective. This novel approach gives us new insight into the dark-dominance phenomenon and provides an avenue to address new questions about excitatory and inhibitory integration in cortical neurons.\n\nSignificanceNeurons in the early visual cortex respond on average more strongly to dark than to light stimuli, but the mechanisms behind this bias have been unclear. Here we address this issue by combining single-unit electrophysiology with a novel machine learning model to analyze neurons responses to natural image stimuli in primary visual cortex. Using these techniques, we find slower inhibition to light than to dark stimuli to be the leading mechanism behind stronger dark responses. This slower inhibition to light might help explain other empirical findings, such as why orientation selectivity is weaker at earlier response latencies. These results demonstrate how imbalances in excitation vs. inhibition can give rise to response asymmetries in cortical neuron responses.",

    "abstract": "Normative development in adolescence indicates that the prefrontal cortex is still under development thereby unable to exert efficient top-down inhibitory control on subcortical regions such as the basolateral amygdala and the nucleus accumbens. This imbalance in the developmental trajectory between cortical and subcortical regions is implicated in expression of the prototypical impulsive, compulsive, reward seeking and risk-taking adolescent behavior. Here we demonstrate that a chronic mild unpredictable stress procedure during adolescence in male Wistar rats arrests the normal behavioral maturation such that they continue to express adolescent-like impulsive, hyperactive, and compulsive behaviors into late adulthood. This arrest in behavioral maturation is associated with the hypoexcitability of prelimbic cortex (PLC) pyramidal neurons and reduced PLC-mediated synaptic glutamatergic control of BLA and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) neurons that lasts late into adulthood. At the same time stress exposure in adolescence results in the hyperexcitability of the BLA pyramidal neurons sending stronger glutamatergic projections to the NAcC. Chemogenetic reversal of the PLC hypoexcitability decreased compulsivity and improved the expression of goal-directed behavior in rats exposed to stress during adolescence, suggesting a causal role for PLC hypoexcitability in this stress-induced arrested behavioral development.",

    "abstract": "When faced with multiple potential movement options, individuals either reach directly to one of the options, or initiate a reach intermediate between the options. It remains unclear why people generate these two types of behaviors. Using the go-before-you-know task (commonly used to study behavior under choice uncertainty), we examined two key questions. First, do these two types of responses reflect distinct movement strategies, or are they simply examples of a more general response to choice uncertainty? If the former, the relative desirability (i.e., weighing the likelihood of successfully hitting the target versus the attainable reward) of the two target options might be computed differently for direct versus intermediate reaches. We showed that indeed, when exogenous reward and success likelihood (i.e., endogenous reward) differ between the two options, direct reaches were more strongly biased by likelihood whereas intermediate movements were more strongly biased by reward. Second, what drives individual differences in how people respond under uncertainty? We found that risk/reward-seeking individuals generated a larger proportion of intermediate reaches and were more sensitive to trial-to-trial changes in reward, suggesting these movements reflect a strategy to maximize reward. In contrast, risk-adverse individuals tended to generate more direct reaches in an attempt to maximize success. Together, these findings suggest that when faced with choice uncertainty, individuals adopt movement strategies consistent with their risk/reward-seeking tendency, preferentially biasing behavior toward exogenous rewards or endogenous success and consequently modulating the relative desirability of the available options.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a widely used noninvasive brain stimulation technique with mixed results and no FDA-approved therapeutic indication to date. So far, thousands of published tDCS studies have placed large scalp electrodes directly over the intended brain target and delivered the same stimulation intensity to each person. Inconsistent therapeutic results may be due to insufficient cortical activation in some individuals and the inability to determine an optimal dose. Here, we computed 3000 MRI-based electric field models in 200 Human Connectome Project (HCP) participants, finding that the largely unexamined variables of electrode position, size, and between-electrode distance significantly impact the delivered cortical electric field magnitude. At the same scalp stimulation intensity, smaller electrodes surrounding the neural target deliver more than double the on-target cortical electric field while stimulating only a fraction of the off-target brain regions. This new optimized tDCS method can ensure sufficient cortical activation in each person and could produce larger and more consistent behavioral effects in every prospective research and transdiagnostic clinical application of tDCS.",

    "abstract": "Dental caries is caused by dental plaque, a community of micro-organisms embedded in an extracellular polymer matrix as a biofilm on the tooth surface. Natural products that are widely available could be used as an alternative or adjunctive anti-caries therapy. Sometimes, when two products are used together, they yield a more powerful antimicrobial effect than the anticipated additive effect. These synergistic combinations are often better treatment options because individual agents may not have sufficient antimicrobial action to be effective when used alone. Cranberries contain phenolic compounds like proanthocyanidins (PAC) that disrupt biofilm formation. Manuka honey has high concentrations of the agent methylglyoxal, which is cariostatic. Because these agents have varied modes of antimicrobial action, they show potential for possible synergistic effects when paired.\n\nVarious cranberry extracts were tested pairwise with manuka honey or methylglyoxal by well-diffusion assays and 96-well checkerboard assays in the presence of Streptococcus mutans to test for synergy. Synergy was demonstrated in two of the cranberry extracts paired with manuka honey. The synergistic combinations found in this research thus can be considered as candidates for the formulation of a dentifrice that could be used to inhibit the formation of dental plaque and thereby avoid the development of caries.\n\nSignificance and ImpactThe emergence of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents has led to a shortage of options when choosing effective treatment agents. Further, some antibiotics used at therapeutic doses can produce undesired side effects. However, by utilizing synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents, the desired antimicrobial effects can often be produced without subjecting the patient to toxic or irritating doses of individual agents. Streptococcus mutans growth and biofilm formation is a major contributor towards dental caries. In this study, a synergistic combination of Manuka honey and cranberry extracts gives evidence that it can be used as an alternative or adjunctive anti-caries therapy.",

Yet, the principles governing the boundaries of such regulatory elements are still poorly characterized. Alu elements are good candidates for a boundary function, being highly abundant in gene-rich regions, while essentially excluded from regulatory elements. Here, we show that the interval from the TSS to the first upstream Alu accommodates all H3K4me3 and most H3K27ac marks, while excluding DNA methylation. Remarkably, the average length of this intervals greatly varies in-between tissues, being longer in stem-and shorter in immune-cells. The very shortest TSS-to-Alu intervals were observed at promoters active in T cells, particularly at immune genes, correlating with RNA polymerase II transcription through the first Alu and accumulation of H3K4me1 signal on this first Alu. Finally, DNA methylation at first-Alus was found to evolved with age, regressing from young to middle-aged, then recovering later in life. Thus, the first Alus upstream of TSSs appear as dynamic boundaries marking the transition from DNA methylation to active histone modifications at regulatory elements, while also participating in the recording of immune gene transcriptional events by positioning H3K4me1-modified nucleosomes.",

Additionally, the mats have shown to be functionally stable throughout time, and could be differentiated between dry and rainy seasonal states.

    "abstract": "Oxygenic phototrophs perform carbon fixation through the Calvin-Benson cycle. Different mechanisms adjust the cycle and the light-harvesting reactions to rapid environmental changes. Photosynthetic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme of the cycle. In land plants, different photosynthetic GAPDHs exist: the most abundant formed by hetero-tetramers of A and B-subunits, and the homo-tetramer A4. Regardless of the subunit composition, GAPDH is the major consumer of photosynthetic NADPH and for this reason is strictly regulated. While A4-GAPDH is regulated by CP12, AB-GAPDH is autonomously regulated through the C-terminal extension (CTE) of B-subunits. Reversible inactivation of AB-GAPDH occurs via oxidation of a cysteine pair located in the CTE, and substitution of NADP(H) with NAD(H) in the cofactor binding domain. These combined conditions lead to a change in the oligomerization state and enzyme inactivation. SEC-SAXS and single-particle cryoEM analysis disclosed the structural basis of this regulatory mechanism. Both approaches revealed that (A2B2)n-GAPDH oligomers with n=1, 2, 4 and 5 co-exist in a dynamic system. B-subunits mediate the contacts between adjacent A2B2 tetramers in A4B4 and A8B8 oligomers. The CTE of each B-subunit penetrates into the active site of a B-subunit of the adjacent tetramer, while the CTE of this subunit moves in the opposite direction, effectively preventing the binding of the substrate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in the B-subunits. The whole mechanism is made possible, and eventually controlled, by pyridine nucleotides. In fact, NAD(H) by removing NADP(H) from A-subunits allows the entrance of the CTE in B-subunits active sites and hence inactive oligomer stabilization.\n\nSignificance StatementIn land plants, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) unique sink of reducing power of the entire Calvin-Benson cycle, is finely regulated. Based on the redox state and substrates concentration, its heteromeric form AB-GAPDH oscillates between a fully active heterotetramer (A2B2) and inactive oligomers. Experimental evidence demonstrates that GAPDH inactivation depends on the formation of dimers, tetramers or pentamers of A2B2-modules, linked together by C-terminal extensions (CTE) of B-subunits that extrude from one modular tetramer and occupy two active sites of the adjacent one. This molecular mechanism along with the unexpected observed dynamism of the system, shed light on how the Calvin-Benson cycle is modulated in function of the light environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "The identification of xenobiotics in nontargeted metabolomic analyses is a vital step in understanding human exposure. Xenobiotic metabolism, excretion, and co-existence with other endogenous molecules however greatly complicate nontargeted studies. While mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms are commonly used in metabolomic measurements, deconvoluting endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics is often challenged by the lack of xenobiotic parent and metabolite standards as well as the numerous isomers possible for each small molecule m/z feature. Here, we evaluate the use of ion mobility spectrometry coupled with MS (IMS-MS) and mass defect filtering in a xenobiotic structural annotation workflow to reduce large metabolomic feature lists and uncover potential xenobiotic classes and species detected in the metabolomic studies. To evaluate the workflow, xenobiotics having known high toxicities including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were examined. Initially, to address the lack of available IMS collision cross section (CCS) values for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 88 PFAS standards were evaluated with IMS-MS to both develop a targeted PFAS CCS library and for use in machine learning predictions. The CCS values for biomolecules and xenobiotics were then plotted versus m/z, clearly distinguishing the biomolecules and halogenated xenobiotics. The xenobiotic structural annotation workflow was then used to annotate potential PFAS features in NIST human serum. The workflow reduced the 2,423 detected LC-IMS-MS features to 80 possible PFAS with 17 confidently identified through targeted analyses and 48 additional features correlating with possible CompTox entries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLigaments work to stabilize the human knee joint and prevent excessive movement. Whilst ligaments are known to decline in structure and function with aging, there has been no systematic effort to study changes in gross mechanical properties in the four major human knee ligaments due to osteoarthritis (OA). This study aims to collate material properties for the anterior (ACL) and posterior (PCL) cruciate ligaments, medial (MCL) and lateral (LCL) collateral ligaments. Our cadaveric samples come from a diverse demographic from which the effects of aging and OA on bone and cartilage material properties have already been quantified. Therefore, by combining our previous bone and cartilage data with the new ligament data from this study we are facilitating subject-specific whole-joint modelling studies.\n\nMethodsThe demographics of the collected cadaveric knee joints were diverse with age range between 31 to 88 years old, and OA International Cartilage Repair Society grade 0 to 4. Twelve cadaveric human knee joints were dissected, and bone-ligament-bone specimens were extracted for mechanical loading to failure. Ligament material properties were determined from the load-extension curves, namely: linear and ultimate (failure) stress and strain, secant modulus, tangent modulus, and stiffness.\n\nResultsThere were significant negative correlations between age and ACL linear force (p=0.01), stress (p=0.03) and extension (p=0.05), ACL failure force (p=0.02), stress (p=0.02) and extension (p=0.02), PCL secant (p=0.02) and tangent (p=0.02) modulus, and LCL stiffness (p=0.05). Significant negative correlations were also found between OA grades and ACL linear force (p=0.05), stress (p=0.02), extension (p=0.01) and strain (p=0.03), and LCL failure stress (p=0.05). However, changes in age or OA grade did not show a statistically significant correlation with the MCL tensile parameters. Trends showed that almost all the tensile parameters of the ACL and PCLs decreased with increasing age and progression of OA. Due to small sample size, the combined effect of age and presence of OA could not be statistically derived.\n\nConclusionsThis research is the first to correlate changes in tensile properties of the four major human knee ligaments to aging and OA. The current ligament study when combined with our previous findings on bone and cartilage for the same twelve knee cadavers, supports conceptualization of OA as a whole-joint disease that impairs the integrity of many peri-articular tissues within the knee. The subject-specific data pool consisting of the material properties of the four major knee ligaments, subchondral and trabecular bones and articular cartilage will aid reconstruction and graft replacements and advance knee joint finite element models, whilst knowledge of aged or diseased mechanics may direct future therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "We developed pISA-tree, a straightforward and flexible data management solution for organisation of life science project-associated research data and metadata. pISA-tree was initiated by end-user requirements thus its strong points are practicality and low maintenance cost. It enables on-the-fly creation of enriched directory tree structure (project/Investigation/Study/Assay) based on the ISA model, in a standardised manner via consecutive batch files. Templates-based metadata is generated in parallel at each level enabling guided submission of experiment metadata. pISA-tree is complemented by two R packages, pisar and seekr. pisar facilitates integration of pISA-tree datasets into bioinformatic pipelines and generation of ISA-Tab exports. seekr enables synchronisation with the FAIRDOMHub repository. Applicability of pISA-tree was demonstrated in several national and international multi-partner projects. The system thus supports findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) research and is in accordance with the Open Science initiative. Source code and documentation of pISA-tree are available at https://github.com/NIB-SI/pISA-tree.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence recently achieved the breakthrough of predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins. The next frontier is presented by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which, representing 30% to 50% of proteomes, readily access vast conformational space. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are promising in sampling IDP conformations, but only at extremely high computational cost. Here, we developed generative autoencoders that learn from short MD simulations and generate full conformational ensembles. An encoder represents IDP conformations as vectors in a reduced-dimensional latent space. The mean vector and covariance matrix of the training dataset are calculated to define a multivariate Gaussian distribution, from which vectors are sampled and fed to a decoder to generate new conformations. The ensembles of generated conformations cover those sampled by long MD simulations and are validated by small-angle X-ray scattering profile and NMR chemical shifts. This work illustrates the vast potential of artificial intelligence in conformational mining of IDPs.",

    "abstract": "In many brain areas, neural populations act as a coordinated network whose state is tied to behavior on a moment-by-moment basis and millisecond timescale. Two-photon (2p) calcium imaging is a powerful tool to probe network-scale computation, as it can measure the activity of many individual neurons, monitor multiple cortical layers simultaneously, and sample from identified cell types. However, estimating network state and dynamics from 2p measurements has proven challenging because of noise, inherent nonlinearities, and limitations on temporal resolution. Here we describe RADICaL, a deep learning method to overcome these limitations at the population level. RADICaL extends methods that exploit dynamics in spiking activity for application to deconvolved calcium signals, whose statistics and temporal dynamics are quite distinct from electrophysiologically-recorded spikes. It incorporates a novel network training strategy that capitalizes on the timing of 2p sampling to recover network dynamics with high temporal precision. In synthetic tests, RADICaL infers network state more accurately than previous methods, particularly for high-frequency components. In real 2p recordings from sensorimotor areas in mice performing a \"water grab\" task, RADICaL infers network state with close correspondence to single-trial variations in behavior, and maintains high-quality inference even when neuronal populations are substantially reduced.",

    "abstract": "The prediction of protein mutations that affect function may be exploited for multiple uses. In the context of disease variants, the prediction of compensatory mutations that reestablish functional phenotypes could aid in the development of genetic therapies. In this work, we present an integrated approach that combines coevolutionary analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to discover functional compensatory mutations. This approach is employed to investigate possible rescue mutations of a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) variant, PARP1 V762A, associated with lung cancer and follicular lymphoma. MD simulations show PARP1 V762A exhibits noticeable changes in structural and dynamical behavior compared with wild type PARP1. Our integrated approach predicts A755E as a possible compensatory mutation based on coevolutionary information, and molecular simulations indicate that the PARP1 A755E/V762A double mutant exhibits similar structural and dynamical behavior to WT PARP1. Our methodology can be broadly applied to a large number of systems where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified as connected to disease and can shed light on the biophysical effects of such changes as well as provide a way to discover potential mutants that could restore wild type-like functionality. This can in turn be further utilized in the design of molecular therapeutics that aim to mimic such compensatory effect.\n\nSignificance StatementDiscovering protein mutations with desired phenotypes can be challenging due to its combinatorial nature. Herein we employ a methodology combining gene SNP association to disease, direct coupling analysis and molecular dynamics simulations to systematically predict rescue mutations. Our workflow identifies A755E as a potential rescue for the PARP1 V762A mutation, which has been associated with cancer. This methodology is general and can be applied broadly.",

    "abstract": "In the interest of advocating for the postdoctoral community in the United States, we present results from survey data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic on the same population of postdocs. In 2019, 5,929 postdocs in the US completed a comprehensive survey, and in 2020, a subset completed a follow-up survey several months into the pandemic. The results show that the pandemic has substantially impacted postdocs mental health and wellness irrespective of gender, race, citizenship, or other identities. Postdocs also reported a significant impact on their career trajectories and progression, reduced confidence in achieving career goals, and negative perceptions of the job market compared to pre-COVID-19. International postdocs also reported experiencing distinct stressors due to the changes in immigration policy. Notably, having access to Postdoctoral Associations and Postdoctoral Offices positively impacted postdocs overall well-being and helped mitigate the personal and professional stresses and career uncertainties caused by the pandemic.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/468693v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (56K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@174d7e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9893dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114470org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a4278f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract of survey responses to: Why or how has your research been disrupted or not disrupted due to the pandemic?

    "abstract": "T cell development in the thymus undergoes the process of differentiation, selective proliferation and survival from CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) stage to CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) stage prior to the formation of CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytolytic T cells ready for circulation. Each developmental stage is tightly regulated by sequentially-operating molecular networks, of which only limited numbers of transcription regulators have been deciphered. Here we identified Zfp335 transcription factor as a new player in the regulatory network controlling thymocyte development. We demonstrate that Zfp335 intrinsically controls DN to DP transition, as T cell-specific deficiency in Zfp335 leads to a substantial accumulation of DN3 along with reduction of DP, CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes. This developmental blockade at DN stage results from the impaired intracellular TCR{beta} expression as well as increased susceptibility to apoptosis in thymocytes. Transcriptomic and ChIP-seq analyses revealed a direct regulation of transcription factors Bcl6 and Rorc by Zfp335. Importantly, enhanced expression of TCR{beta} and Bcl6/Ror{gamma}T restores the developmental defect during DN3 to DN4 transition and improves thymocytes survival, respectively. These findings identify a critical role of Zfp335 in controlling T cell development by maintaining intracellular TCR{beta} expression-mediated {beta}- selection and independently activating cell survival signaling.",
