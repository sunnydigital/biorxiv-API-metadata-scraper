    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne pathogen, and other Listeria spp. are present in natural environments. Isolating and characterizing strains from natural reservoirs can provide insight into the prevalence and diversity of Listeria spp. in these environments, elucidate their contribution to contamination of agricultural and food processing environments and food products, and lead to the discovery of novel species. In this study, we evaluated the diversity of Listeria spp. isolated from soil samples in a small region of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP), which is the most biodiverse national park in the United States National Park system. Of the 17 Listeria isolates that were recovered, whole-genome sequencing revealed that 14 were unique strains. The unique strains were shown to represent a diversity of Listeria spp., including L. monocytogenes (n=9), L. cossartiae subsp. cossartiae (n=1), L. marthii (n=1), L. booriae (n=1), and a novel Listeria sp. (n=2). The Listeria isolated in this study were collected from high elevation sites near a creek that drains into a series of rivers ultimately leading to the Mississippi River; thus, the Listeria present in this natural environment could potentially travel downstream to a large region that includes portions of nine southeastern and midwestern states in the U.S. The Listeria spp. isolated and described in this study provide insight into the diversity of Listeria spp. found in the Great Smoky Mountains and indicate that this environment is a reservoir of novel Listeria spp.\n\nIMPORTANCEListeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that can cause serious systemic illness that, although rare, usually results in hospitalization and has a relatively high mortality rate compared to other foodborne pathogens. Identification of novel and diverse Listeria spp. provides insight into the genomic evolution, ecology, and evolution and variance of pathogenicity of this genus, especially in natural environments. Comparing L. monocytogenes and Listeria spp. isolates from natural environments, such as those recovered in this study, to contamination and/or outbreak strains may provide more information about the original natural sources of these strains and the pathways and mechanisms that lead to contamination of food products and agricultural or food processing environments.",

    "abstract": "Acidophilic Archaea thrive in anaerobic and aerobic low pH environments (<pH 5) rich in dissolved heavy metals that exacerbate stress caused by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (*OH) and superoxide (O2 *-). ROS react with lipids, proteins and nucleic acids causing oxidative stress and damage that can lead to cell death. Herein, genes and mechanisms potentially involved in ROS mitigation are predicted in over 200 genomes of acidophilic Archaea with sequenced genomes. These organisms can be subjected to simultaneous multiple stresses such as high temperature, high salinity, low pH and high heavy metal loads. Some of the topics addressed include: (1) the phylogenomic distribution of these genes and what can this tell us about the evolution of these mechanisms in acidophilic Archaea; (2) key differences in genes and mechanisms used by acidophilic versus non-acidophilic Archaea and between acidophilic Archaea and acidophilic Bacteria and (3) how comparative genomic analysis predicts novel genes or pathways involved in oxidative stress responses in Archaea and possible Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) events.",

    "abstract": "Optimal lung repair and regeneration is essential for recovery from viral infections such as that induced by influenza A virus (IAV). We have previously demonstrated that lung inflammation induced by IAV is under circadian control. However, it is not known if the circadian clock exerts its influence on lung repair and regenerative processes independent of acute inflammation from IAV. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that lung organoids have a functional clock as they mature and that the absence of an intact circadian clock impairs regenerative capacity. Using several models of circadian disruption, we show that with the absence of an intact clock lung proliferation is disrupted. Further, we find that the circadian clock acts through direct control of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway. We speculate, that adding the circadian dimension to the critical process of lung repair and regeneration will lead to novel therapies and improve outcomes. Finally, we use data from UK Biobank to demonstrate at the population level, the role of poor circadian rhythms in mediating negative outcomes following lung infection.",

    "abstract": "The initial colonization of a host by symbionts, ranging from parasites to mutualists, can generate priority effects that alter within-host interactions and the trajectory of parasite community assembly. At the same time, variation in parasite communities among hosts can also stem from stochastic processes. Community ecology theory posits that multiple processes (e.g. dispersal, selection and drift) interact to generate variation in community structure, but these processes are rarely considered simultaneously during community assembly. To test the role of these processes in a parasite community, we experimentally simulated dispersal of three symbionts by factorially inoculating individual plants of tall fescue with two foliar fungal parasites, Colletotrichum cereale and Rhizoctonia solani, and a hypothesized mutualist endophyte, Epichloe coenophiala. We then tracked parasite infections longitudinally in the field. After the initial inoculations, hosts were exposed to a common pool of parasites in the field, which we expected to cause parasite communities to converge towards a similar community state. To test for convergence, we analyzed individual hosts parasite community trajectories in multivariate space. In contrast to our expectation, there was no signal of convergence. Instead, parasite community trajectories generally diverged over time between treatment groups and the magnitude of divergence depended on the symbiont species inoculated. Parasite communities of hosts that were inoculated with only the mutualist, Epichloe, showed significant trends of divergence relative to all other symbiont inoculation treatments. In contrast, hosts inoculated with only Rhizoctonia did not exhibit clear trends of divergence when compared to other parasite inoculations. Further, co-inoculation with both parasite species resulted in faster rates of divergence and greater temporal change in parasite communities relative to hosts inoculated with only the parasite Colletotrichum. As predicted by existing theory, parasite communities showed evidence of drift during the beginning of the experiment, which contributed to among-host divergence in parasite community structure. Overall, these data provide evidence that initial dispersal of symbionts produced persistent changes in parasite community structure via ecological selection, that drift was important during the early stages of parasite community assembly, and together, dispersal, selection and drift resulted in parasite community divergence.\n\nOpen Research statementThe data and code that support the findings of this study are available through Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5714452",

    "abstract": "Mendels Law of Segregation states that the offspring of a diploid, heterozygous parent will inherit either allele with equal probability. While the vast majority of loci adhere to this rule, research in model and non-model organisms has uncovered numerous exceptions whereby \"selfish\" alleles are disproportionately transmitted to the next generation. Evidence of such \"transmission distortion\" (TD) in humans remains equivocal in part because scans of human pedigrees have been under-powered to detect small effects. Recently published single-cell sequencing data from individual human sperm (n = 41,189; 969-3,377 cells from each of 25 donors) offer an opportunity to revisit this question with unprecedented statistical power, but require new methods tailored to extremely low-coverage data ([~]0.01 x per cell). To this end, we developed a method, named rhapsodi, that leverages sparse gamete genotype data to phase the diploid genomes of the donor individuals, impute missing gamete genotypes, and discover meiotic recombination breakpoints, benchmarking its performance across a wide range of study designs. After applying rhapsodi to the sperm sequencing data, we then scanned the gametes for evidence of TD. Our results exhibited close concordance with binomial expectations under balanced transmission, in contrast to tenuous signals of TD that were previously reported in pedigree-based studies. Together, our work excludes the existence of even weak TD in this sample, while offering a powerful quantitative framework for testing this and related hypotheses in other cohorts and study systems.",

    "abstract": "Solute carrier (SLC) proteins represent the largest superfamily of transmembrane transporters. While many of them play key biological roles, their systematic analysis has been hampered by their functional and structural heterogeneity. Based on available nomenclature systems, we hypothesized that many as yet unidentified SLC transporters exist in the human genome, which await further systematic analysis. Here, we present criteria for defining \"SLC-likeness\" to curate a set of \"SLC-like\" protein families from the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) and Protein families (Pfam) databases. Computational sequence similarity searches surprisingly identified [~]120 more proteins in human with potential SLC-like properties compared to previous annotations. Interestingly, several of these have documented transport activity in the scientific literature. To complete the overview of the \"SLC-ome\", we present an algorithm to classify SLC-like proteins into protein families, investigating their known functions and evolutionary relationships to similar proteins from 6 other clinically relevant experimental organisms, and pinpoint structural orphans. We envision that our work will serve as a stepping stone for future studies of the biological function and the identification of the natural substrates of the many under-explored SLC transporters, as well as for the development of new therapeutic applications, including strategies for personalized medicine and drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic-di-nucleotide based secondary messengers regulate various physiological processes including the stress responses in bacteria. In the past decade, cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) has emerged as a crucial second messenger, implicated in fatty acid metabolism, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, virulence, DNA repair, ion homeostasis, sporulation etc. The level of c-di-AMP is maintained in the cell by the action of two opposing enzymes, namely diadenylate cyclase (DAC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE). In mycobacteria, this molecule is essential for its regulatory role in bacterial physiology and host-pathogen interactions. However, such modulation of c-di-AMP remains to be explored in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Here, we systematically characterised the c-di-AMP synthase (MsDisA) and a hydrolase (MsPDE) from M. smegmatis at different pH and osmolytic conditions in vitro. Our biochemical assays show that the MsDisA activity is enhanced during the alkaline stress and c-di-AMP is readily produced without any intermediates. At pH 9.4, the MsDisA promoter activity in vivo increases significantly, strengthening this observation. However, under physiological conditions, the activity of MsDisA was moderate with the formation of intermediates. To get further insights into the structural characteristics, we determined the cryo-EM structure of the MsDisA, revealing some interesting features. Biochemical analysis of individual domains shows that the N-terminal minimal region alone can form a functional octamer. Altogether, our results reveal the biochemical and structural regulation of mycobacterial c-di-AMP in response to various environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in biology concerns how molecular and cellular processes become integrated during morphogenesis. In plants, characterization of 3D digital representations of organs at single-cell resolution represents a promising approach to addressing this problem. A major challenge is to provide organ-centric spatial context to cells of an organ. We developed several general rules for the annotation of cell position and embodied them in 3DCoordX, a user-interactive computer toolbox implemented in the open-source software MorphoGraphX. It enables rapid spatial annotation of cells even in highly curved biological shapes. With the help of 3DCoordX we obtained new insight by analyzing cellular growth patterns in organs of several species. For example, the data indicated the presence of a basal cell proliferation zone in the ovule primordium of Arabidopsis thaliana. Proof-of-concept analyses suggested a preferential increase in cell length associated with neck elongation in the archegonium of Marchantia polymorpha and variations in cell volume linked to central morphogenetic features of a trap of the carnivorous plant Utricularia gibba. Our work demonstrates the broad applicability of the developed strategies as they provide organ-centric spatial context to cellular features in plant organs of diverse shape complexity.",

Using a library of commercially available bioactive compounds, we identified 75 confident hits that modified the response of a circadian luciferase reporter to sucrose in dark-adapted seedlings. We validated the transcriptional effect on a subset of the hits and measured their effects on a range of sugar-dependent phenotypes for 13 of these chemicals. Chemicals were identified that appear to influence known and unknown sugar signalling pathways. Pentamidine isethionate (PI) was identified as a modifier of a sugar-activated Ca2+ signal that acts downstream of superoxide in a metabolic signalling pathway affecting circadian rhythms, primary metabolism and plant growth.

In this paper, we performed numerical simulations in a finite island population genetics model to investigate how population subdivision affects the diversification process at a S-locus, given that the two-genes architecture typical of S-loci involves the crossing of a fitness valley. We show that population structure slightly reduces the parameter range allowing for the diversification of self-incompatibility haplotypes (S-haplotypes), but at the same time also increases the number of these haplotypes maintained in the whole metapopulation. This increase is partly due to a higher rate of diversification and replacement of S-haplotypes within and among demes. We also show that the two-genes architecture leads to a higher diversity in structured populations compared with a simpler genetic architecture where new S-haplotypes appear in a single mutation step. Overall, our results suggest that population subdivision can act in two opposite directions: it renders S-haplotypes diversification easier, although it also increases the risk that the self-incompatibility system is lost.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers using many different approaches have attempted to find features discriminating between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically control (TC) subjects. In this study, this attempt has been continued by analyzing global metrics of functional graphs and metrics of functional triadic interactions of the brain in the low, middle, and high-frequency bands (LFB, MFB, and HFB) of the structural graph. The graph signal processing (GSP) provided the combinatorial usage of the functional graph of resting-state fMRI and structural graph of DTI. In comparison to TCs, ASDs had significantly higher clustering coefficients in the MFB, higher efficiencies and strengths in the MFB and HFB, and lower small-world propensity in the HFB. These results show over-connectivity, more global integration, and probably decreased local specialization in ASDs compared to TCs. Triadic analysis showed that the numbers of unbalanced triads were significantly lower for ASDs in the MFB. This finding may show the reason for restricted and repetitive behavior in ASDs. Also, in the MFB and HFB, the numbers of balanced triads and the energies of triadic interactions were significantly higher and lower for ASDs, respectively. These findings may reflect the disruption of the optimum balance between functional integration and specialization. All of these results demonstrated that the significant differences between ASDs and TCs existed in the MFB and HFB of the structural graph when analyzing the global metrics of the functional graph and triadic interaction metrics. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the promising perspective of GSP for attaining discriminative features and new knowledge, especially in the case of ASD.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/469268v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100df67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b2455org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e51d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e789c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social processes, interactions, and communication. Yet, the neurocognitive bases underlying these difficulties are unclear. Here, we triangulated the  trans-diagnostic approach to personality, social trait judgments of faces, and neurophysiology to investigate (1) the relative position of autistic traits in a comprehensive social-affective personality space and (2) the distinct associations between the social-affective personality dimensions and social trait judgment from faces in individuals with ASD and neurotypical individuals. We collected personality and facial judgment data from a large sample of online participants (N = 89 self-identified ASD; N = 308 neurotypical controls). Factor analysis with 33 sub-scales of 10 social-affective personality questionnaires identified a 4-dimensional personality space. This analysis revealed that ASD and control participants did not differ significantly along the personality dimensions of empathy and prosociality, antisociality, or social agreeableness. However, the associations between these dimensions and judgments of facial trustworthiness and warmth differed across groups. Neurophysiological data also indicated that ASD and control participants might rely on distinct neuronal representations for judging trustworthiness and warmth from faces. These results suggest that the atypical association between social-affective personality and social trait judgment from faces may contribute to the social and affective difficulties associated with ASD.",

    "abstract": "Heat activation at a sublethal temperature is widely applied to promote Bacillus species spore germination. This treatment also has potential to be employed in food processing to eliminate undesired bacterial spores by enhancing their germination, and then inactivating the less heat resistant germinated spores at a milder temperature. However, incorrect heat treatment could also generate heat damage in spores, and lead to more heterogeneous spore germination. Here, the heat activation and heat damage profile of Bacillus subtilis spores was determined by testing spore germination and outgrowth at both population and single spore levels. The heat treatments used were 40-80{degrees}C, and for 0-300 min. The results were as follows. 1) Heat activation at 40-70{degrees}C promoted L-valine and L-asparagine-glucose-fructose-potassium (AGFK) induced germination in a time dependent manner. 2) The optimal heat activation temperatures for AGFK and L-valine germination via the GerB plus GerK or GerA germinant receptors were 65 and 50-65{degrees}C, respectively. 3) Heat inactivation of dormant spores appeared at 70{degrees}C, and the heat damage of molecules essential for germination and growth began at 70 and 65{degrees}C, respectively. 4) Heat treatment at 75{degrees}C resulted in both activation of germination and damage to the germination apparatus, and 80{degrees}C treatment caused more pronounced heat damage. 5) For the spores that should withstand adverse environmental temperatures in nature, heat activation seems functional for a subsequent optimal germination process, while heat damage affected both germination and outgrowth.",

    "abstract": "Centrioles are non-membrane bound organelles that participate in fundamental cellular processes through their ability to form physical contacts with other structures. During interphase, two mature centrioles can associate to form a single centrosome - a phenomenon known as centrosome cohesion. Centrosome cohesion is important for processes such as cell migration, and yet how it is maintained is unclear. Current models indicate that pericentriolar fibres termed rootlets, also known as the centrosome linker, entangle to maintain centriole proximity. Here, I uncover a new centriole-centriole contact site and mechanism of centrosome cohesion, based on coalescence of the proximal centriole component cNap1. Using live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged cNap1, I show that proximal centrioles form dynamic contacts in response to physical force from the cytoskeleton. Expansion microscopy reveals that cNap1 bridges between these contact sites, physically linking proximal centrioles on the nanoscale. When ectopically tethered to organelles such as lysosomes, cNap1 forms viscous and cohesive condensates that promote organelle spatial proximity. Conversely, cNap1 mutants with reduced viscosity are unable to maintain centrosome cohesion. These results define a previously unrecognised mechanism of centrosome cohesion by cNap1 assemblies at the proximal centriole and illustrate how a non-membrane bound organelle forms dynamic organelle contact sites.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we bring together our efforts in identifying and understanding nonequilibrium phase segregation driven by active processes in the living cell, with special focus on the segregation of cell membrane components driven by active contractile stresses arising from cortical actomyosin. This also has implications for active segregation dynamics in membraneless regions within the cytoplasm and nucleus (3d). We formulate an active version of the Flory-Huggins theory that incorporates a contribution from fluctuating active stresses. Apart from knitting together some of our past theoretical work in a comprehensive narrative, we highlight some new results, and establish a correspondence with recent studies on Active Model B/B+. We point to the many unusual aspects of the dynamics of active phase segregation, such as (i) anomalous growth dynamics, (ii) coarsening accompanied by propulsion and coalescence of domains that exhibit nonreciprocal effects, (iii) segregation into mesoscale domains, (iv) emergence of a nonequilibrium phase segregated steady state characterised by strong macroscopic fluctuations (fluctuation dominated phase ordering (FDPO)), and (v) mesoscale segregation even above the equilibrium Tc. Apart from its implications for actively driven segregation of binary fluids, these ideas are at the heart of an Active Emulsion description of the lateral organisation of molecules on the plasma membrane of living cells, whose full molecular elaboration appears elsewhere.",

The recently developed imaging technique, hierarchical phase-contrast tomography, is a comprehensive approach to address the challenge of organ-scale (up to tens of centimeters) soft tissue imaging with resolution and sensitivity down to the cellular level. Using this technique, we imaged ex vivo an entire human left lung at an isotropic voxel size of 25.08 m along with local zooms down to 6.05 - 6.5 m and 2.45 - 2.5 m in voxel size. The high tissue contrast offered by the fourth-generation synchrotron source at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility reveals complex multiscale anatomical constitution of the human lung from the macroscopic (centimeter) down to the microscopic (micrometer) scale. The dataset provides complete organ-scale 3D information of the secondary pulmonary lobules and delineates the microstructure of lung nodules with unprecedented detail.",

    "abstract": "Pattern separation and pattern completion are generally studied in humans using mnemonic discrimination tasks such as the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) where participants identify similar lures and repeated items from a series of images. Failures to correctly discriminate lures are thought to reflect a failure of pattern separation and a propensity toward pattern completion. Recent research has challenged this perspective, suggesting that poor encoding rather than pattern completion accounts for the occurrence of false alarm responses to similar lures. In two experiments, participants completed a continuous recognition task version of the MST while eye movement (Experiments 1 and 2) and fMRI data (Experiment 2) were collected. In Experiment 1, we replicated the result that fixation counts at study predicted accuracy on lure trials (consistent with poor encoding predicting mnemonic discrimination performance), but this effect was not observed in our fMRI task. In both experiments we found that target-lure similarity was a strong predictor of accuracy on lure trials. Further, we found that fMRI activation changes in the hippocampus were significantly correlated with the number of fixations at study for correct but not incorrect mnemonic discrimination judgments when controlling for target-lure similarity. Our findings indicate that while eye movements during encoding predict subsequent hippocampal activation changes for correct mnemonic discriminations, the predictive power of eye movements for activation changes for incorrect mnemonic discrimination trials was modest at best.",

    "abstract": "Despite being biologically unrealistic, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully trained to perform a wide range of sensory-motor behaviors. In contrast, the performance of more biologically realistic spiking neuronal network (SNN) models trained to perform similar behaviors remains relatively suboptimal. In this work, we aimed at pushing the field of SNNs forward by exploring the potential of different learning mechanisms to achieve optimal performance. Inspired by biological learning mechanisms operating at multiple timescales, we used spike-timing-dependent reinforcement learning (STDP-RL) and evolutionary strategy (EVOL) with SNNs to solve the CartPole reinforcement learning (RL) control problem. Though the role of STDP-RL in biological systems is well established, several other mechanisms, though not fully understood, work in concert during learning in vivo. Recreating accurate models that capture the interaction of STDP-RL with these diverse learning mechanisms is extremely difficult. EVOL is an alternative method, and has been successfully used in many studies to fit model neural responsiveness to electrophysiological recordings and in some cases for classification problems. One advantage of EVOL is that it may not need to capture all interacting components of synaptic plasticity, and thus provides a better alternative to STDP-RL. Here, we compared the performance of each algorithm after training, which revealed EVOL as a powerful method to training SNNs to perform sensory-motor behaviors. Our modeling opens up new capabilities for SNNs in RL and could serve as a testbed for neurobiologists aiming to understand multi-timescale learning mechanisms and dynamics in neuronal circuits.",

Here we assessed the transcriptional and active enhancer profile of monocytes derived from the inflamed joints of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients, a model well-suited for studying autoimmune diseases. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated that synovial-derived monocytes display an activated phenotype, characterized by increased expression of surface activation markers and multiple chemokines and cytokines. This increased expression is regulated on the epigenetic level, as ChIP-sequencing indicated increased H3K27 acetylation of genes upregulated in synovial monocytes. IFN signaling-associated genes are increased and epigenetically altered in synovial monocytes, suggesting a role for IFN in establishing the inflammatory phenotype. Treatment of human synovial monocytes with the Janus-associated kinase (JAK) inhibitor Ruxolitinib, which inhibits IFN signaling, transformed the activated enhancer landscape and reduced disease-associated gene expression, thereby inhibiting the inflammatory phenotype. Taken together, these data provide novel insight into epigenetic regulation of autoimmune disease-patient derived monocytes and suggest that altering the epigenetic profile can be a therapeutic approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "The SpoVA proteins make up a channel in the inner membrane (IM) of B. subtilis spore. This channel responds to signals from activated germinant receptors (GRs), and allows release of Ca2+-DPA from the spore core during germination. In the current work, we studied the location and dynamics of SpoVAEa in dormant spores. Notably, the SpoVAEa-SGFP2 proteins were present in a single spot in spores, similar to the complex formed by all GRs. However, while the GRs spot remains in one location, the SpoVAEa-SGFP2 spot in the IM moved randomly with high frequency. The dynamics of the SpoVAEa-SGFP2 and its surrounding IM region as stained by fluorescent dyes were also tracked during spore germination, as the dormant spore IM appeared to have an immobile germination related functional microdomain. This microdomain disappeared around the time of appearance of a germinated spore, the loss of fluorescence of the IM by fluorescent dyes, as well as the appearance of SpoVAEa-SGFP2 peak fluorescent intensity occurred in parallel. These observed events were highly related to the rapid phase darkening, which is considered as the Ca2+DPA rapid release. We also tested the response of SpoVAEa and the IM to thermal treatments at 40-80{degrees}C. Heat treatment triggered an increase of green autofluorescence, which is speculated to be due to coat protein denaturation, and 80{degrees}C treatments induce the appearance of phase-grey-like spores. These spores presumably have a similar intracellular physical state as the phase grey spores detected in the germination but lack the functional proteins for further germination events.",

We now examined in inducible {beta}-cell specific G3PP-KO (BKO) mice, the role of G3PP in the control of insulin secretion in vivo, {beta}-cell function and glucotoxicity. BKO mice, compared to MCre controls, showed increased body weight, adiposity, fed insulinemia, GSIS, reduced plasma triglycerides and mildly altered glucose tolerance. Isolated BKO mouse islets at high (16.7 mM) but not low or intermediate glucose (3-8 mM) showed elevated GSIS, Gro3P, metabolites reflecting {beta}-cell activation, O2 consumption, ATP production and reduced glycerol release. BKO islets chronically exposed to elevated glucose showed increased apoptosis, reduced insulin content and expression of Pdx-1, MafA and Ins-2 genes. As G3PP channels glucose carbons towards glycerol formation and release, the results demonstrate that {beta}-cell are endowed with a \"glycerol shunt\" acting as a glucose excess security valve. We propose that the glycerol shunt plays a role in glucodetoxification, the prevention of insulin hypersecretion, acts as a defense against excess body weight gain and contributes to {beta}-cell mass preservation in the face of hyperglycemia.",

We show that a slightly modified inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion equation yields a single-channel permeability consistent with the mean first passage time (MFPT)-based method. For milestoning, applying cylindrical and spherical bulk boundary conditions yield consistent MFPT if factoring in the effective bulk concentration. The sensitivity of the MFPT to the output frequency of collective variables is highlighted using the convergence and symmetricity of the inward and outward MFPT profiles. The consistent transport kinetic results from all three methods demonstrated the robustness of MD-based methods in computing ion channel permeation. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed, focusing on the future applications of milestoning in more complex systems.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock employs a transcriptional/translational negative feedback loop (TTFL) to anticipate environmental changes due to the Earths diurnal cycle, with regulation of organismal physiology believed to stem from temporal transcriptional activation by the positive arm. However, up to 80% of oscillating proteins do not have rhythmic mRNA, establishing circadian post-transcriptional regulation through unknown mechanisms. Given the pervasive conservation of the intrinsically disordered nature of negative-arm clock proteins, we hypothesized that post-transcriptional regulation may stem from conformational shifts in negative-arm proteins that time vacillations in the constituents of negative-arm macromolecular complexes to time cellular physiology. Our investigation of the negative arm clock protein in Neurospora crassa, FREQUENCY (FRQ), demonstrated temporal conformational fluidity correlated with daily changes in physiologically diverse macromolecular complex components. A parallel investigation of the macromolecular complexes centered around Drosophila melanogaster PERIOD (dPER) and human PERIOD (hPER2) found a similar number and physiological diversity of interacting partners in higher eukaryotes. Short linear motifs (SLiMs) associated with the interactors localized to disordered and phosphorylated regions on the PERs and FRQ, with disordered interactors oscillating in the macromolecular complexes over circadian time. This oscillation correlated with oscillations in post-transcriptionally regulated proteins, suggesting the negative arm may tune cellular physiology and proteostasis post-transcriptionally via vacillations in the circadian negative-arm macromolecular protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "All social groups require organization to function optimally. Group organization is often shaped by social  rules, which function to manage conflict, discourage cheating, or promote cooperation1-5. If social rules promote effective social living, then the ability to learn and follow these rules may be expected to influence individual and group-level fitness. However, such links can rarely be tested, due to the complexity of the factors mediating social systems and the difficulty of gathering data across multiple groups. Songbirds offer an opportunity to investigate the link between social rules and reproductive output because most of their social interactions are mediated by song, a well-studied and readily quantifiable behavior6,7. Using observations from 19 groups of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) studied across 15 years, we find evidence for a previously undocumented social rule: cohesive group transitions between dominance- and courtship-related singing. Comparing across groups, the degree of cohesion in male singing behavior predicts the reproductive output of their group. Experimental manipulation of group structure via the introduction of juvenile males to captive flocks reduced group cohesion and adult male reproductive success. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cohesion in group behavioral states can affect both individual and group-level reproductive success, suggesting that selection can act not only on individual-level traits, but also on an individuals ability and opportunity to participate effectively in organized social interactions. Social cohesion could therefore be an unappreciated force affecting social evolution in many diverse systems.",
