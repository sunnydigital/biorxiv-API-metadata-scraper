    "abstract": "Vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatases (V-ATPases) are proton pumps found in almost all eukaryotic cells. These enzymes consist of a soluble catalytic V1 region that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane-embedded VO region responsible for proton translocation. V-ATPase activity leads to acidification of endosomes, phagosomes, lysosomes, secretory vesicles, and the trans-Golgi network, with extracellular acidification occurring in some specialized cells. Small molecule inhibitors of V-ATPase have played a crucial role in elucidating numerous aspects of cell biology by blocking acidification of intracellular compartments, while therapeutic use of V-ATPase inhibitors has been proposed for treatment of cancer, osteoporosis, and some infections. Here, we determine structures of the isolated VO complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae bound to two well-known macrolide inhibitors: bafilomycin A1 and archazolid A. The structures reveal different binding sites for the inhibitors on the surface of the proton-carrying c ring, with only a small amount of overlap between the two sites. Binding of both inhibitors is mediated primarily through van der Waals interactions in shallow pockets and suggests that the inhibitors block rotation of the ring. Together, these structures indicate the existence of a large chemical space available for V-ATPase inhibitors that block acidification by binding the c ring.",

    "abstract": "Environmental change, especially frequent droughts, is predicted to detrimentally impact the North American perennial grasslands. Consistent dry spells will affect plant communities as well as their associated rhizobiomes, possibly altering the plant host performance under environmental stress. Therefore, there is a need to understand the impact of drought on the rhizobiome, and how the rhizobiome may modulate host performance and ameliorate its response to drought stress. In this study, we analyzed bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizospheres of three ecotypes (dry, mesic, and wet) of a dominant prairie grass, Andropogon gerardii. The ecotypes were established in 2010 in a common garden design and grown for a decade under persistent dry conditions at the arid margin of the species range in Colby Kansas. The experiment aimed to answer whether and to what extent do the different ecotypes maintain or recruit distinct rhizobiomes after ten years in an arid climate. In order to answer this question, we screened the bacterial and fungal rhizobiome profiles of the ecotypes under the arid conditions of western KS as a surrogate for future climate environmental stress using 16S rRNA and ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing. Under these conditions, bacterial communities differed compositionally among the A. gerardii ecotypes, whereas the fungal communities did not. The ecotypes were instrumental in driving the differences among bacterial rhizobiomes, as the ecotypes maintained distinct bacterial rhizobiomes even after ten years at the edge of the host species range. This study will aid us to optimize plant productivity through the use of different ecotypes under future abiotic environmental stress, especially drought.",

    "abstract": "The spread of antibiotic resistance genes on plasmids is a threat to human and animal health. Phylogenies of bacteria and their plasmids contain clues regarding the frequency of plasmid transfer events, as well as the co-evolution of plasmids and their hosts. However, whole genome sequencing data from diverse ecological or clinical bacterial samples is rarely used to study plasmid phylogenies and resistance gene transfer. This is partially due to the difficulty to extract plasmids from short-read sequencing data. Here, we use both short- and long-read sequencing data of 24 clinical extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase producing Escherichia coli to estimate chromosomal and plasmid phylogenies. We compare the impact of different sequencing and assembly methodologies on these phylogenies and on the inference of horizontal gene transfer. We find chromosomal phylogenies can be estimated robustly with all methods, whereas plasmid phylogenies have more variable topology and branch lengths across the methods used. Specifically, hybrid methods that use long reads to resolve short-read assemblies (HybridSPAdes and Unicycler) perform better than those that started from long-reads during assembly graph generation (Canu). In contrast, the inference of plasmid and antibiotic resistance gene transfer using a parsimony-based criterion is mostly robust to the choice of sequencing and assembly method.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial calcium uniporter imports cytoplasmic Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix to regulate cell bioenergetics, Ca2+ signaling, and apoptosis. The uniporter contains the pore-forming MCU subunit, an EMRE protein that binds to MCU, and the regulatory MICU1/MICU2 subunits. Structural and biochemical studies have suggested that MICU1 gates MCU by blocking and unblocking the Ca2+ pore. However, mitoplast patch-clamp experiments argue that MICU1 does not block Ca2+ transport but instead potentiates MCU. To address this direct clash of proposed MICU1 function, we applied purified MICU1 to Ca2+-conducting MCU-EMRE subcomplexes in outside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes. MICU1 strongly inhibits Ca2+ currents, and the inhibition is abolished by mutating an MCU-interacting K126 residue in MICU1. Further experiments show that MICU1 block was not observed in mitoplasts because MICU1 dissociates from the uniporter complex. These results firmly establish that MICU1 shuts the uniporter in resting cellular conditions.",

We have previously demonstrated the ease with which genetically engineered Xenopus models (GEXM) can be generated. This included the induction of autochthonous tumour formation by injection of early embryos with Cas9 recombinant protein loaded with sgRNAs targeting multiple tumour suppressor genes. What has been lacking so far is the possibility to propagate the induced cancers via transplantation. In this paper we describe the generation of a rag2-/- knock-out line in Xenopus tropicalis that is deficient in functional T- and B-cells. This line was validated by means of an allografting experiment with a primary tp53-/- donor tumour. In addition, we optimized available protocols for sub-lethal gamma irradiation of X. tropicalis froglets. Irradiated animals also allowed stable, albeit transient, engraftment of transplanted tp53-/- tumour cells. The novel X. tropicalis rag2-/- line and the irradiated wild type froglets will further expand the experimental toolbox in this diploid amphibian, and help to establish it as a versatile and relevant model for exploring human cancer.",

    "abstract": "AimThe role of platelets in atherosclerosis remains incompletely understood. Variants in genes encoding the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in platelets are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Here we sought to investigate the contribution of platelet sGC to atherosclerosis and the therapeutic potential of targeting sGC in atherosclerosis.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe genetically deleted sGC in platelets of atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr-/- mice. By intravital fluorescence microscopy such Pf4-Cre+Gucy1b1flox/floxLdlr-/- mice displayed enhanced leukocyte adhesion to atherosclerotic plaques in comparison with their litter mates. Moreover, histological and flow cytometry analyses revealed more numerous inflammatory leukocytes and larger plaque sizes in aortic tissue of Ldlr-/- mice lacking sGC in platelets. In vitro, supernatant from activated platelets lacking sGC promoted leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (EC) via enhanced EC activation. Using cytokine profiling, we identified reduced angiopoietin-1 release by Pf4-Cre+Gucy1b1flox/flox and human GUCY1A1 risk allele carrier platelets to be responsible for enhanced activation of EC and subsequent leukocyte adhesion. Pharmacological sGC stimulation increased platelet angiopoietin-1 release in vitro and reduced recruitment of adoptively transferred leukocytes in Ldlr-/- mice fed a Western diet. Pharmacological sGC stimulation further reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation and vascular inflammation.\n\nConclusionLoss of sGC in platelets contributes to atherosclerotic plaque formation via reduced release of the soluble factor angiopoietin-1 and, subsequently, enhanced leukocyte recruitment. Pharmacological sGC stimulation might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat CAD.\n\nTranslational perspectiveReduced platelet soluble guanylyl cyclase activity contributes to atherosclerotic plaque formation and vascular inflammation. Stimulators of the soluble guanylyl cyclase, an emerging class of drugs already used in pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, are able to reduce atherosclerosis and inflammation in this preclinical model. Together with evidence from human genetics, our findings suggest a promising role of soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulation to prevent coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Carboxysomes are a class of bacterial microcompartments that form proteinaceous organelles within the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria and play a central role in photosynthetic metabolism by defining a cellular microenvironment permissive to CO2 fixation. Critical aspects of the assembly of the carboxysomes remain relatively unknown, especially with regard to the dynamics of this microcompartment. We have recently expressed an exogenous protease as a way of gaining control over endogenous protein levels, including carboxysomal components, in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcous elongatus PCC 7942. By utilizing this system, proteins that compose the carboxysome can be tuned in real-time as a method to examine carboxysome dynamics. Yet, analysis of subtle changes in carboxysome morphology with microscopy remains a low-throughput and subjective process. Here we use deep learning techniques, specifically a Rotationally Invariant Variational Autoencoder (rVAE), to analyze the fluorescence microscopy images and quantitatively evaluate how carboxysome shell remodelling impacts trends in the morphology of the microcompartment over time. We find that rVAEs are able to assist in the quantitative evaluation of changes in carboxysome location, shape, and size over time. We propose that rVAEs may be a useful tool to accelerate the analysis of carboxysome assembly and dynamics in response to genetic or environmental perturbation, and may be more generally useful to probe regulatory processes involving a broader array of bacterial microcompartments.",

    "abstract": "Biological wastewater treatment plants (BWWTP) are considered to be hotspots of evolution and subsequent spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) promote the mobilization and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and are thereby critical mediators of AMR within the BWWTP microbial community. At present, it is unclear whether specific AMR categories are differentially disseminated via bacteriophages (phages) or plasmids. To understand the segregation of AMR in relation to MGEs, we analyzed meta-omic (metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic) data systematically collected over 1.5 years from a BWWTP. Our results showed a core group of fifteen AMR categories which were found across all timepoints. Some of these AMR categories were disseminated exclusively (bacitracin) or primarily (aminoglycoside, MLS, sulfonamide) via plasmids or phages (fosfomycin and peptide), whereas others were disseminated equally by both MGEs. Subsequent expression- and protein-level analyses further demonstrated that aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were expressed more by plasmids, in contrast to fosfomycin and peptide AMR expression by phages, thereby validating our genomic findings. Longitudinal assessment further underlined these findings whereby the log2-fold changes of aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were increased in plasmids, while fosfomycin and peptide resistance showed similar trends in phages. In the analyzed communities, the dominant taxon Candidatus Microthrix parvicella was a major contributor to several AMR categories whereby its plasmids primarily mediated aminoglycoside resistance. Importantly, we also found AMR associated with ESKAPEE pathogens within the BWWTP, for which MGEs also contributed differentially to the dissemination of ARGs. Collectively our findings pave the way towards understanding the segmentation of AMR within MGEs, thereby shedding new light on resistome populations and their mediators, essential elements that are of immediate relevance to human health.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is a genus of obligate bacterial endosymbionts that infect a diverse range of arthropod species as well as filarial nematodes, with its single described species, Wolbachia pipientis, divided into several  supergroups based on multilocus sequence typing. Wolbachia strains in mosquitoes have been shown to inhibit the transmission of human pathogens including Plasmodium malaria parasites and arboviruses. Despite their large host range, Wolbachia strains within the major malaria vectors of the Anopheles (A.) gambiae and A. funestus complexes appear at low density based solely on PCR-based methods. Questions have been raised as to whether this represents a true endosymbiotic relationship. However, recent definitive evidence for two distinct, high-density strains of supergroup B Wolbachia within A. demeilloni and A. moucheti has opened exciting possibilities to explore naturally occurring Wolbachia endosymbionts in Anopheles for biocontrol strategies to block Plasmodium transmission. Here we utilise genomic analyses to demonstrate that both Wolbachia strains have retained all key metabolic and transport pathways despite their smaller genome size. We further confirm the presence of cytoplasmic incompatibility factor genes, despite noticeably few prophage regions. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis indicates that these Wolbachia strains may have been introduced into these two Anopheles species via horizontal transmission events, and unlikely to be by ancestral acquisition and subsequent loss events in the Anopheles gambiae species complex. These are the first Wolbachia genomes that enable us to study the relationship between natural strains Plasmodium malaria parasites and their Anopheline hosts.\n\nImpact statementWolbachia naturally infects a wide range of arthropod species, including insect vectors of human pathogens, where they may play a role in inhibiting their replication. These bacteria have been commonly found within Aedes (Ae.) albopictus and Culex pipiens mosquitoes but have been noticeably absent in the Anopheles mosquito genera, which includes all species responsible for malaria transmission. Recent PCR-based methods have suggested the potential for natural Wolbachia strains within the A. gambiae species complex, which includes major malaria vector species including A. gambiae s.s., A. coluzzii and A. arabiensis. We recently reported the presence of stable Wolbachia strains naturally occurring within two different Anopheles species (A. demeilloni and A. moucheti). In this study, we perform comparative genomic analysis of these two Wolbachia genomes against each other and published Wolbachia strains. The current assemblies are some of the smallest sequenced Wolbachia strains of insects, although their metabolic pathway repertoire is comparable to other strains. Interestingly, prophage fragments were identified within only one of the two strains. The findings of this study will be of significant interest to researchers investigating Wolbachia as a potential malaria biocontrol strategy, giving greater insight into the evolution and diversity of this obligate intracellular endosymbiont.\n\nData summarySequence data generated and used for this analysis are available in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive (NCBI SRA bioproject number PRJNA642000). The two assembled Wolbachia genomes are available with genome accession numbers GCA_018491735.2 and GCA_018491625.2.

    "abstract": "Spermatozoal morphology is highly variable both among and within species and in ways that can significantly impact fertilization success. In Drosophila melanogaster, paternity success depends on sperm length of both competing males and length of the females primary sperm storage organ. We found that genes upregulated in long sperm testes are enriched for lncRNAs and seminal fluid proteins (Sfps). Transferred in seminal fluid to the female during mating, Sfps are secreted by the male accessory glands (AG) and affect female remating rate, physiology, and behavior with concomitant advantages for male reproductive success. Despite being upregulated in long sperm testes, they have no known function in testis tissue. We found that Sex Peptide and ovulin (Acp26Aa) knockouts resulted in shorter sperm, suggesting that Sfps may regulate sperm length during spermatogenesis. However, knockout of AG function did not affect sperm length, suggesting that AG expression has no influence on spermatogenic processes. We also found that long sperm males are better able to delay female remating, suggesting higher Sfp expression in AG. These results might suggest that long sperm males have a double advantage in sperm competition by both delaying female remating, likely through transfer of more Sfps, and by resisting sperm displacement. However, we also found that this extra advantage does not necessarily translate to more progeny or higher paternity success. Thus, we found that multiple components of the ejaculate coordinate to promote male reproductive success at different stages of reproduction, but the realized fitness advantages in sperm competition are uncertain.\n\nSignificance StatementThe ejaculate is comprised of sperm produced in the testis and seminal fluid primarily produced in the male accessory glands (AG). These complementary components are both critical for male reproductive success, but they are largely considered to be functionally, genetically, and developmentally independent. In a quest to understand genetic mechanisms of sperm length variation, we found that genes upregulated in long sperm testes are enriched for lncRNAs and seminal fluid proteins (Sfps). Knockout of two Sfps, Sex Peptide and ovulin, results in shorter sperm, though knockout of AG function has no effect. Moreover, long sperm males delay female remating longer. These results suggest sophisticated testis-AG coordination that amplifies male reproductive success, with implications for evolutionary integration of sexually selected traits.",

How these two functions are achieved remains elusive despite the identification of several boundary-specific genes. Here, we show using morphometrics at the organ and cellular levels that leaf boundary domain development requires SPINDLY (SPY), an O-fucosyltransferase, to act as cell growth repressor. Further we show that SPY acts redundantly with the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON transcription factors (CUC2 and CUC3), which are major determinants of boundaries development. Accordingly at the molecular level, CUC2 and SPY repress a common set of genes involved in cell wall loosening providing a molecular framework for the growth repression associated with boundary domains. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed that young leaf boundary domain cells have stiffer cell walls than marginal outgrowth. This differential cell wall stiffness was reduced in spy mutant. Taken together our data reveal a concealed CUC2 cell wall associated gene network linking tissue patterning with cell growth and mechanics.\n\nSummary statementDecreased cell-wall loosening gene expression contributes to the coordination of cell growth and mechanics with tissue patterning thus driving boundary development.",

    "abstract": "A pandemic isolate of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3) has devastated kiwifruit orchards growing cultivars of Actinidia chinensis. In contrast, A. arguta (kiwiberry) is resistant to Psa3. This resistance is mediated via effector-triggered immunity, as demonstrated by induction of the hypersensitive response in infected A. arguta leaves, observed by microscopy and quantified by ion-leakage assays. Isolates of Psa3 that cause disease in A. arguta have been isolated and analyzed, revealing a 49 kb deletion in the exchangeable effector locus (EEL). This natural EEL-mutant isolate and strains with synthetic knockouts of the EEL were more virulent in A. arguta plantlets than wild-type Psa3. Screening of a complete library of Psa3 effector knockout strains identified increased growth in planta for knockouts of four effectors - AvrRpm1a, HopF1c, HopZ5a, and the EEL effector HopAW1a - suggesting a resistance response in A. arguta. Hypersensitive response (HR) assays indicate that three of these effectors trigger a host species-specific HR. A Psa3 strain with all four effectors knocked out escaped host recognition, but a cumulative increase in bacterial pathogenicity and virulence was not observed. These avirulence effectors can be used in turn to identify the first cognate resistance genes in Actinidia for breeding durable resistance into future kiwifruit cultivars.",

    "abstract": "The NRC immune receptor network has evolved in asterid plants from a pair of linked genes into a genetically dispersed and phylogenetically structured network of sensor and helper NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing) proteins. In some species, such as the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and other Solanaceae, the NRC network forms up to half of the NLRome, and NRCs are scattered throughout the genome in gene clusters of varying complexities. Here, we describe NRCX, an atypical, but essential member of the NRC family that lacks canonical features of these NLR helper proteins, such as a functional N-terminal MADA motif and the capacity to trigger autoimmunity. In contrast to other NRCs, systemic gene silencing of NRCX markedly impairs plant growth resulting in a dwarf phenotype. Remarkably, dwarfism of NRCX silenced plants is partially dependent on NRCX paralogs NRC2 and NRC3, but not NRC4. Despite its negative impact on plant growth when silenced systemically, transient RNA interference of NRCX in mature N. benthamiana leaves doesnt result in visible cell death phenotypes. However, alteration of NRCX expression modulates the hypersensitive response mediated by NRC2 and NRC3 in a manner consistent with a negative role for NRCX in the NRC network. We conclude that NRCX is an atypical member of the NRC network that has evolved to contribute to the homeostasis of this genetically unlinked NLR network.",

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation is one of the most crucial and common post-translational modifications. It plays a fate-determining role and can alter many properties of proteins, making it an interesting for many biotechnology applications. The discovery of bacterial glycosylation mechanisms, opened a new perspective and transfer of C.jejuni N-linked glycosylation into laboratory work-horse E. coli increased research pace in the field exponentially. It has been previously showed that utilizing N-Linked Glycosylation, certain recombinant proteins have been furnished with improved features, such as stability and solubility. In this study, we utilized N-linked Glycosylation to glycosylate alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme in E. coli and investigate the effects of glycosylation on an enzyme. Considering the glycosylation mechanism is highly dependent on the acceptor protein, ALP constructs carrying glycosylation tag at different locations of the gene has been created and glycosylation rates have been calculated. The most glycosylated construct has been selected for comparison with the native enzyme. We investigated the performance of glycosylated ALP in terms of its thermostability, proteolytic stability, tolerance to suboptimal pH and under denaturing conditions. Studies showed that glycosylated ALP performed remarkably better at optimal and harsh conditions Therefore, N-linked Glycosylation mechanism can be employed for enzyme engineering purposes and is a useful tool for industrial applications that require enzymatic activity.",

    "abstract": "Although the essential proteins that drive bacterial cytokinesis have been identified and reconstituted in vitro, the precise mechanisms by which they dynamically interact to enable symmetrical division are largely unknown. In Escherichia coli, cell division begins with the formation of a proto-ring composed of FtsZ and its membrane-tethering proteins FtsA and ZipA. In the broadly proposed molecular scenario for ring positioning, Min waves composed of MinD and MinE distribute the FtsZ-polymerization inhibitor MinC away from mid-cell, where the Z-ring can form. Therefore, MinC is believed to be an essential element connecting the Min and FtsZ systems. Here, by using cell-free gene expression on planar lipid membranes, we demonstrate that MinDE drive the formation of dynamic, antiphase patterns of FtsZ-FtsA co-filaments even in the absence of MinC. This behavior is also observed when the proteins are compartmentalized inside microdroplets. These results suggest that Z-ring positioning may be achieved with a more minimal set of proteins than previously envisaged, providing a fresh perspective about the role of MinC. Moreover, we propose that MinDE oscillations may constitute the minimal localization mechanism of an FtsA-FtsZ constricting ring in a prospective synthetic cell.",

    "abstract": "MLL1 (KMT2A) and MLL2 (KMT2B) are homologous members of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases involved in epigenomic transcriptional regulation. Their sequence variants have been associated with neurological and psychological disorders, but little is known about their roles and mechanism of action in CNS development. Using mouse retina as a model, we previously reported MLL1s role in retinal neurogenesis and horizontal cell maintenance. Here we determine roles of MLL2 and MLL1/MLL2 together in retinal development using conditional knockout (CKO) mice. Deleting Mll2 from Chx10+ retinal progenitors resulted in a similar phenotype as Mll1 CKO, but removal of both alleles produced much more severe deficits than each single CKO: 1-month double CKO mutants displayed null light responses in electroretinogram; thin retinal layers, including shorter photoreceptor outer segments with impaired phototransduction gene expression; and reduced numbers of M-cones, horizontal and amacrine neurons, followed by fast retinal degeneration. Despite moderately reduced progenitor cell proliferation at P0, the neurogenic capacity was largely maintained in double CKO mutants. However, upregulated apoptosis and reactive gliosis were detected during postnatal retinal development. Finally, the removal of both MLLs in fated rods produced a normal phenotype, but the CKO in M-cones impaired M-cone function and survival, indicating both cell non-autonomous and autonomous mechanisms. Altogether, our results suggest that MLL1/MLL2 play redundant roles in maintaining specific retinal neurons after cell fate specification and are essential for establishing functional neural networks.",

    "abstract": "TLR7 and TLR8 are key members of the Toll-like receptor family, playing crucial roles in the signaling pathways of innate immunity, and thus become attractive therapeutic targets of many diseases including infections and cancer. Although TLR7 and TLR8 show a highly degree of sequence homology, their biological response to small molecule binding is very different. Aiming to understand the mechanism of selective profiles of small molecule modulators against TLR7 and TLR8, we carried out molecular dynamic simulations on three imidazoquinoline derivatives bound to the receptors separately. They are Resiquimod (R), Hybrid-2 (H), and Gardiquimod (G), selective agonists of TLR7 and TLR8. Our MD trajectories indicated that in the complex of TLR7-R and TLR7-G, the two chains forming the TLR7 dimer tended to remain \"open\" conformation, while the rest systems maintained in the closed format. The agonists R, H, and G developed conformational deviation mainly on the aliphatic tail. Furthermore, we attempted to quantify the selectivity between TLR7 and TLR8 by binding free energies via MM-GBSA method. It showed that the three selected modulators were more favorable for TLR7 than TLR8, and the ranking from the strongest to the weakest was H, R and G, aligning well with experiment data. In the TLR7, the flexible and hydrophobic aliphatic side chain of H has stronger van der Waals interactions with Val381 and Phe351 but only pick up interaction with one amino acid residue i.e. Tyr353 of TLR8. Unsurprisingly, the positively charged side chain of G has less favor interaction with Ile585 of TLR7 and Val573 of TLR8 explaining G is weak agonist in both TLR7 and TLR8. All three imidazoquinolines can form stable hydrogen bonds with Asp555 of TLR7 and the corresponding Asp543 of TLR8. In brief, the set of total 400ns MD studies sheds light on the potential selective mechanisms of agonists towards TLR7 and TLR8, indicating the van der Waals interaction as the driving force for the agonists binding, thus provides us insights for more potent and selective modulators to cooperate with the hydrophobic nature of the binding pocket.",

    "abstract": "RationaleMycobacterium avium complex, is the most common nontuberculous mycobacterial respiratory pathogen in humans. Disease mechanisms are poorly understood due to the absence of a reliable animal model for M. avium complex pulmonary disease.\n\nObjectiveAssess the susceptibility, immunologic and histopathologic responses of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to M. avium complex pulmonary infection.\n\nMethods7 adult female marmosets underwent endobronchial inoculation with 108 colony-forming units of M. intracellulare and were monitored for 30 or 60 days. Prior to infection, chest radiograph and serum cytokines were assessed; serum cytokines were also monitored weekly for 30 days. At sacrifice 30 days (3 animals) or 60 days (4 animals) after infection, chest radiograph, serum and bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines, histopathology, and cultures of the bronchoalveolar lavage, lungs, liver, and kidney were analyzed.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsFive of seven animals (two at 30 days and three at 60 days of infection) had positive lung cultures for M. intracellulare. Extra-pulmonary cultures were positive in three animals. All animals appeared healthy throughout the study. All five animals with positive lung cultures had radiographic changes consistent with pneumonitis. At 30 days, those with M. intracellulare lung infection showed granulomatous inflammation while at 60 days there was less inflammatory change, but bronchiectasis was noted. The cytokine response in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was uniformly greater in the animals with positive M. intracellulare cultures than those without a productive infection with greater levels at 30-days compared to 60-days. Similarly, serum cytokines were more elevated in the animals that had positive M. intracellulare cultures compared to those without a productive infection, peaking 14-21 days after inoculation.\n\nConclusionEndobronchial instillation of M. intracellulare resulted in pulmonary mycobacterial infection in marmosets with a differential immune response, radiographic and histopathologic abnormalities, and an indolent course consistent with M. avium complex lung infection in humans.",

In this paper, we fit a discrete time mosquito model developed by Gong et al. in 2011, which considers the immature and adult stages, and weather dependent model parameters, to the Breteau Index and Bite Index data for Aedes aegypti in Guangzhou city, China in 2014, as well as the weather data for average temperature, precipitation, evaporation and daylight for the same period. We estimated the model parameters using the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method. We find that many parameters are not identifiable. We revise and simplify the model so that the parameters of our new model are identifiable. Our results indicate that the model predicted mosquito prevalence agrees well with data. We then use the fitted parameter values against the Breteau Index and Bite Index data for Guangzhou city in 2017 and 2018, and show that the estimated parameter values are applicable for other seasons.",
