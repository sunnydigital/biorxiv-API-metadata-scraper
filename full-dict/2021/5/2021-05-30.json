    "abstract": "Motif identification is among the most common and essential computational tasks for bioinformatics and genomics. Here we proposed a novel convolutional layer for deep neural network, named Variable Convolutional (vConv) layer, for effective motif identification in high-throughput omics data by learning kernel length from data adaptively. Empirical evaluations on DNA-protein binding and DNase footprinting cases well demonstrated that vConv-based networks have superior performance to their convolutional counterparts regardless of model complexity. Meanwhile, vConv could be readily integrated into multi-layer neural networks as an \"in-place replacement\" of canonical convolutional layer.

    "abstract": "Actin polymerizes to form filaments/cables for motility, transport, and structural framework in a cell. Recent studies show that actin polymers are present not only in cytoplasm, but also in nuclei of vertebrate cells, and their formation is induced in response to stress. Here, by electron microscopic observation with rapid freezing and high-pressure freezing, we found a unique bundled structure containing actin in nuclei of budding yeast cells undergoing meiosis. The nuclear bundle/cable during meiosis consists of multiple filaments with a rectangular lattice arrangement often showing \"feather-like\" appearance. The bundle is immuno-labeled with anti-actin antibody and sensitive to an actin-depolymerizing drug. Like cytoplasmic bundles, nuclear bundles with actin are rarely seen in pre-meiotic cells and spores, and are induced during meiotic prophase-I. The formation of the nuclear bundles/cables is independent of meiotic DNA double-stranded breaks. We speculate that nuclear bundles/cables containing actin play a role in nuclear events during meiotic prophase I.",

However, while mutations affecting RNA binding have been described, neither the precise RNA binding site has been identified nor which domains are involved. Here, we present biophysical evidence for the presence of RNA binding sites on both TRIM25 PRY/SPRY and coiled-coil domains, and map the binding site on the PRY/SPRY with residue resolution. Cooperative RNA-binding of both domains enhances their otherwise transient interaction in solution and increases the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25.

    "abstract": "Pathogen-specific CD8 T cells face the problem of finding rare cells that present their cognate antigen either in the lymph node or infected tissue. While quantitative details of T cell movement strategies in some tissues such lymph nodes or skin have been relatively well characterized, we still lack quantitative understanding of T cell movement in many other important tissues such as the spleen, lung, liver, and gut. Furthermore, how environmental constraints influence movement patterns of T cells in tissues remains incompletely characterized. Liver is one of the major organs in mice and humans and is the target site for many pathogens such as hepatitis B and C viruses in humans and Plasmodium parasites in multiple mammalian species. We developed a protocol to generate stable numbers of liver-located CD8 T cells, used intravital microscopy to record movement patterns of CD8 T cells in livers of live mice, and analyzed these and previously published data using well-established statistical and computational methods. We show that in most of our experiments Plasmodium-specific liver-localized CD8 T cells perform correlated random walks characterized by transiently superdiffusive displacement with persistence times of 10-15 min that exceed those observed for T cells in lymph nodes. Liver-localized CD8 T cells typically crawl on the lumenal side of liver sinusoids (i.e., are in the blood); simulating T cell movement in digital structures derived from the liver sinusoids illustrates that liver structure alone is sufficient to explain the relatively long superdiffusive displacement of T cells. In experiments when CD8 T cells in the liver poorly attach to the sinusoids (e.g., one week post immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium sporozoites) T cells also undergo Levy flights - large displacements occurring due to cell deattaching from the endothelium, floating with the blood flow, and re-attaching at another location. Our analysis, thus, provides quantitative details of movement patterns of liver-localized CD8 T cells and illustrates how structural and physiological details of the tissue may impact T cell movement patterns.",

Metabolomics is a powerful and sensitive approach for investigating low molecular weight metabolite profiles present in rumen biofluids.

The rumen is a strictly anaerobic environment enriched with a complex community of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, archaea and bacteriophages. Here, we present a metabolomic dataset generated using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and semi-polar (C18) chromatography methods coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), collected in both positive and negative ionization modes, of ovine rumen samples that were fractionated based on molecular weight (20 kDa, 8-10 kDa and 100 Da). This study highlights the potential of HILIC and C18 chromatography combined with non-targeted mass spectrometric methods to detect the polar and semi-polar metabolite species of the ruminal fluid metabolome.",

    "abstract": "Colobine monkeys are known for the anatomical complexity of their stomachs, making them distinct within the primate order. Amongst foregut fermenters, they appear peculiar because of the occurrence of two different stomach types, having either three ( tripartite) or four ( quadripartite, adding the praesaccus) chambers. The functional differences between tri and quadripartite stomachs largely remain to be explained. In this study, we aim to compare the apparent digestibility (aD) in tripartite and quadripartite colobines. Hence, we measured the aD in two colobine species, Nasalis larvatus (quadripartite) and Trachypithecus cristatus (tripartite), in two zoos. We also included existing colobine literature data on the aD and analysed whether the aD of fibre components is different between the stomach types to test the hypothesis of whether quadripartite colobines show higher aD of fibre components than tripartite colobines did. Our captive N. larvatus specimen had a more distinctively varying nutrient intake across seasons with a larger seasonal variation in aD than that of a pair of T. cristatus, which mostly consumed commercial foods with a lower proportion of browse and less seasonal variation. We observed higher aD of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) in the N. larvatus specimen, suggesting a higher gut capacity of N. larvatus provided by the additional praesaccus forestomach chamber. Based on the analysis of literature data for aD, we also found that quadripartite species achieved higher fibre digestibility at similar dietary fibre levels compared with tripartite species, supporting the hypothesis that the additional gut capacity offered by the praesaccus facilitates a longer retention and hence more thorough microbial fermentation of plant fibre.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe potential of normative modeling to make individualized predictions from neuroimaging data has enabled inferences that go beyond the case-control approach. However, site effects are often confounded with variables of interest in a complex manner and can bias estimates of normative models, which has impeded the application of normative models to large multi-site neuroimaging data sets. In this study, we suggest accommodating for these site effects by including them as random effects in a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared the performance of a linear and a non-linear hierarchical Bayesian model in modeling the effect of age on cortical thickness. We used data of 570 healthy individuals from the ABIDE (autism brain imaging data exchange) data set in our experiments. In addition, we used data from individuals with autism to test whether our models are able to retain clinically useful information while removing site effects. We compared the proposed single stage hierarchical Bayesian method to several harmonization techniques commonly used to deal with additive and multiplicative site effects using a two stage regression, including regressing out site and harmonizing for site with ComBat, both with and without explicitly preserving variance related to age and sex as biological variation of interest. In addition, we made predictions from raw data, in which site has not been accommodated for. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian method showed the best predictive performance according to multiple metrics. Beyond that, the resulting z-scores showed little to no residual site effects, yet still retained clinically useful information. In contrast, performance was particularly poor for the regression model and the ComBat model in which age and sex were not explicitly modeled. In all two stage harmonization models, predictions were poorly scaled, suffering from a loss of more than 90 % of the original variance. Our results show the value of hierarchical Bayesian regression methods for accommodating site variation in neuroimaging data, which provides an alternative to harmonization techniques. While the approach we propose may have broad utility, our approach is particularly well suited to normative modelling where the primary interest is in accurate modelling of inter-subject variation and statistical quantification of deviations from a reference model.\n\n1 HighlightsO_LIDevelopment and presentation of normative modeling approach based on hierarchical Bayesian modeling that can be applied to large multi-site neuroimaging data sets.\nC_LIO_LIComparison of performance of Hierarchical Bayesian model including site as predictor to several common ways to harmonize for multi-site effects.\nC_LIO_LIPresentation of normative modeling as site correction tool.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Terrestrial animals must self-right when overturned on the ground, but this locomotor task is strenuous. To do so, the discoid cockroach often pushes its wings against the ground to begin a somersault which rarely succeeds. As it repeatedly attempts this, the animal probabilistically rolls to the side to self- right. During winged self-righting, the animal flails its legs vigorously. Here, we studied whether wing opening and leg flailing together facilitate strenuous ground self-righting. Adding mass to increase hind leg flailing kinetic energy increased the animals self-righting probability. We then developed a robot with similar strenuous self-righting behavior and used it as a physical model for systematic experiments. The robots self-righting probability increased with wing opening and leg flailing amplitudes. A potential energy landscape model revealed that, although wing opening did not generate sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the high pitch potential energy barrier to somersault, it reduced the barrier for rolling, facilitating the small kinetic energy from leg flailing to probabilistically overcome it to self-right. The model also revealed that the stereotyped body motion during self-righting emerged from physical interaction of the body and appendages with the ground. Our work demonstrated the usefulness of potential energy landscape for modeling self-righting transitions.\n\nImpact statementAnimals can, and robots should, use different types of appendages together to propel and perturb themselves to self-right when overturned, a strenuous yet crucial locomotor task.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes that can decompose synthetic plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are urgently needed. However, a bottleneck remains due to a lack of techniques for detecting and sorting environmental microorganisms with vast diversity and abundance. Here, we developed a fluorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) pipeline for high-throughput screening of PET-degrading microorganisms or enzymes (PETases). The pipeline comprises three steps: generation and incubation of droplets encapsulating single cells, picoinjection of fluorescein dibenzoate (FDBz) as the fluorogenic probe, and screening of droplets to obtain PET-degrading cells. We characterized critical factors associated with this method, including specificity and sensitivity for discriminating PETase from other enzymes. We then optimized its performance and compatibility with environmental samples. The system was used to screen a wastewater sample from a PET textile mill. We successfully obtained PET-degrading species from nine different genera. Moreover, two putative PETases from isolates Kineococcus endophyticus Un-5 and Staphylococcus epidermidis Un-C2-8 were genetically derived, heterologously expressed, and preliminarily validated for PET-degrading activities. We speculate that the FADS pipeline can be widely adopted to discover new PET-degrading microorganisms and enzymes in various environments and may be utilized in the directed evolution of PETases using synthetic biology.",

Our data revealed a strong genetic basis for the precise coordinates of transcription initiation and promoter proximal pause, allowing us to redefine molecular models of core transcriptional processes. Our results implicate the strength of base pairing between A-T or G-C dinucleotides as key determinants to the position of Pol II initiation and pause. We report evidence that initiation site selection follows a stochastic process similar to brownian motion along the DNA template. We found widespread differences in the position of transcription termination, which impact the primary structure and stability of mature mRNA. Finally, we report evidence that allelic changes in transcription often affect mRNA and ncRNA expression across broad genomic domains.

To gain a better understanding of how the unique biology of the Solanaceae relates to the familys small RNA genomic landscape, we downloaded over 255 publicly available small RNA datasets that comprise over 2.6 billion reads of sequence data. We applied a suite of computational tools to predict and annotate two major small RNA classes: (1) microRNAs (miRNAs), typically 20-22 nt RNAs generated from a hairpin precursor and functioning in gene silencing, and (2) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), including 24-nt heterochromatic siRNAs (hc-siRNAs) typically functioning to repress repetitive regions of the genome via RNA-directed DNA methylation, as well as secondary phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) and trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs) generated via miRNA-directed cleavage of a Pol II-derived RNA precursor. Our analyses described thousands of small RNA loci, including poorly-understood clusters of 22-nt siRNAs that accumulate during viral infection. The birth, death, expansion, and contraction of these small RNA loci are dynamic evolutionary processes that characterize the Solanaceae family. These analyses indicate that individuals within the same genus share similar small RNA landscapes, whereas comparisons between distinct genera within the Solanaceae reveal relatively few commonalities.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYWe use over 255 publicly-available small RNA datasets to characterize the small RNA landscape for the Solanaceae family.",

All five of the remaining nine patients analyzed by paired whole exome sequencing showed TRM which are not included in the reference targets.

    "abstract": "Aldosterone, the main physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, first appears in lungfish, which are lobe-finned fish that are forerunners of terrestrial vertebrates. Aldosterone activation of the MR regulates internal homeostasis of water, sodium and potassium, which was critical in the conquest of land by vertebrates. We studied transcriptional activation of the slender African lungfish MR by aldosterone, other corticosteroids and progesterone and find that aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone have half-maximal responses (EC50s) below 1 nM and are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. In contrast, EC50s for corticosterone and cortisol were 23 nM and 66 nM, respectively. Unexpectedly, truncated lungfish MR, consisting of the DNA-binding, hinge and steroid-binding domains, had a stronger response to corticosteroids and progesterone than full-length lungfish MR, indicating that the N-terminal domain represses steroid activation of lungfish MR, unlike human MR in which the N-terminal domain contains an activation function. BLAST searches of GenBank did not retrieve a GR ortholog, leading us to test dexamethasone and triamcinolone for activation of lungfish MR. At 10 nM, both synthetic glucocorticoids are about 4-fold stronger than 10 nM aldosterone in activating full-length lungfish MR, leading us to propose that lungfish MR also functions as a GR.",

    "abstract": "As global life expectancy continues to climb, maintaining skeletal muscle function is increasingly essential to ensure a good life quality for aging populations. Calorie restriction (CR) is the most potent and reproducible intervention to extend health and lifespan, but is largely unachievable in humans. Therefore, identification of \"CR mimetics\" has received much attention. CR targets nutrient-sensing pathways centering on mTORC1. The mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, has been proposed as a potential CR mimetic and is proven to counteract age-related muscle loss. Therefore, we tested whether rapamycin acts via similar mechanisms as CR to slow muscle aging. Contrary to our expectation, long-term CR and rapamycin-treated geriatric mice display distinct skeletal muscle gene expression profiles despite both conferring benefits to aging skeletal muscle. Furthermore, CR improved muscle integrity in a mouse with nutrient-insensitive sustained muscle mTORC1 activity and rapamycin provided additive benefits to CR in aging mouse muscles. Therefore, RM and CR exert distinct, compounding effects in aging skeletal muscle, opening the possibility of parallel interventions to counteract muscle aging.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome of an animal has a strong influence on the health, fitness, and behavior of its host, and is thus a critical component of the animal itself. Most research in the microbiome field has focused on human populations and commercially important species. However, researchers are now considering the link between endangered species conservation and the microbiome. In Hawai i, several threats have caused widespread population declines of Hawaiian honeycreepers (subfamily Carduelinae). These threats, and the environmental changes that result, can have a significant effect on the avian gut microbiome and may even lead to disruption of microbial function. However, no previous study has explored the natural patterns of the gut microbiome of a honeycreeper species in the wild. This project used amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the gut microbiome of two critically endangered species of Hawaiian honeycreepers. The two species differed significantly in both alpha and beta diversity. Intraspecific variation of the gut microbiome among individual birds was a major factor. However, small but significant differences also exist between sampling location and sexes. This baseline knowledge will help inform management decisions for these honeycreeper species both in their native habitats and in captivity.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new species is poorly understood in marine plankton, where the lack of physical barriers and homogeneous environmental conditions limit spatial and ecological segregation. Here we combine molecular and ecological information from a long term time series and propose Pseudo-nitzschia allochrona, a new cryptic diatom, as a possible case of speciation by temporal segregation. The new species differs in several genetic markers (18S, LSU and ITS rDNA fragments and rbcL) and is reproductively isolated from its closest relative, which is morphologically identical. Data from a long term plankton time series show Pseudo-nitzschia allochrona invariably occurring in summer-autumn in the Gulf of Naples, where its sister species are instead found in winter-spring. Temperature and nutrients are the main factors associated with the occurrence of P. allochrona, which could have evolved in sympatry by switching its phenology and occupying a new ecological niche. This case of possible speciation by time shows the relevance of combining ecological time series with molecular information to shed light on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of marine microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "The genus Dichaetophora is currently comprised of 67 formally described species assigned into five species groups, i.e., agbo, tenuicauda, acutissima, sinensis and trilobita. In the present study, we challenged to delimit species from a huge amount of samples of Dichaetophora and allied taxa (the genus Mulgravea and the subgenus Dudaica of Drosophila) collected from a wide range of the Oriental and east Palearctic regions. We first sorted all specimens into morpho-species, which were tentatively classified into the species groups of Dichaetophora, Mulgravea and Dudaica based on the morphological diagnoses for these supraspecific taxa. Then, we selected representative specimen(s) for each morpho-species and subjected them to barcoding of COI (the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) sequences. The applied ABGD (automatic barcode gap discovery) algorithm estimated a total of 222 MOTUs (molecular operational taxonomic units). Although most of the morpho-species were recognized as individual MOTUs, some others were divided into multiple MOTUs or combined into a single MOTU, suggesting the existence of cryptic sibling species, subspecies or intraspecific genetic varieties. Out of the 222 MOTUs, 88 representing the supraspecific taxa of Dichaetophora, Mulgravea and Dudaica were selected, along with 33 species from major genera and subgenera of Drosophila in the tribe Drosophilini, as in-group (four species from the tribe Colocasiomyini as out-group) for phylogenetic reconstruction. We analyzed a dataset of concatenated nucleotide sequences of 12 nuclear gene markers by the maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. As a result, the three focal taxa (i.e., Dichaetophora, Mulgravea and Dudaica) formed a clade, which we called the \"pan-Dichaetophora\". Within this large clade, the agbo, tenuicauda, sinensis and trilobita groups of Dichaetophora, Mulgravea and Dudaica were recovered as monophyletic groups, but Dichaetophora and its acutissima group were regarded as paraphyletic. In addition, two clusters were recognized among ungrouped MOTUs of Dichaetophora. Thus, the present study has uncovered some problems in the taxonomy of the pan-Dichaetophora. Solving such problems will be challenged in Part II of this serial work.",

    "abstract": "Classical views suggest that experienced affect is related to a specific bodily response (Fingerprint hypothesis), whereas recent perspectives challenge this view postulating that similar affective experiences rather evoke different physiological responses. To further advance this debate in the field, we used representational similarity analysis (N= 64) to investigate the correspondence between subjective affect (arousal and valence ratings) and physiological reactions (skin conductance response [SCR], startle blink response, heart rate and corrugator activity) across various emotion induction contexts (picture viewing task, sound listening task and imagery task). Significant similarities were exclusively observed between SCR and arousal in the picture viewing task. However, none of the other physiological measures showed a significant relation with valence and arousal ratings in any of the tasks. These findings tend to support the populations hypothesis, suggesting that there is no clear match between the evoked physiological responses and the experienced subjective affect between individuals.\n\nStatement of relevanceThe subjective affective experience evoked by an event is accompanied by physiological responses. The correspondence between physiological response patterns and the experienced affect, however, is still under debate. Classical views (Fingerprint hypothesis) suggest that affect is related to a specific physiological response, whereas recent perspectives (Populations hypothesis) challenge this view, postulating rather different physiological responses. In the current study, we used representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine the relation between affective experience, assessed using valence and arousal ratings, and the evoked physiological reactivity across three affect-inducing contexts. Results showed significant similarities exclusively between SCR and arousal in the passive picture viewing task. However, none of the other physiological measures showed a significant relation with valence and arousal ratings in any of the tasks, supporting the populations hypothesis. These findings invite to reframe the relation between physiology and affect from invariant and homogeneous to variant and context-dependent.",

    "abstract": "We acquired a rapidly preserved human surgical sample from the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. We stained a 1 mm3 volume with heavy metals, embedded it in resin, cut more than 5000 slices at [~]30 nm and imaged these sections using a high-speed multibeam scanning electron microscope. We used computational methods to render the three-dimensional structure containing 57,216 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites and 133.7 million synaptic connections. The 1.4 petabyte electron microscopy volume, the segmented cells, cell parts, blood vessels, myelin, inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and 104 manually proofread cells are available to peruse online. Many interesting and unusual features were evident in this dataset. Glia outnumbered neurons 2:1 and oligodendrocytes were the most common cell type in the volume. Excitatory spiny neurons comprised 69% of the neuronal population, and excitatory synapses also were in the majority (76%). The synaptic drive onto spiny neurons was biased more strongly toward excitation (70%) than was the case for inhibitory interneurons (48%). Despite incompleteness of the automated segmentation caused by split and merge errors, we could automatically generate (and then validate) connections between most of the excitatory and inhibitory neuron types both within and between layers. In studying these neurons we found that deep layer excitatory cell types can be classified into new subsets, based on structural and connectivity differences, and that chandelier interneurons not only innervate excitatory neuron initial segments as previously described, but also each others initial segments. Furthermore, among the thousands of weak connections established on each neuron, there exist rarer highly powerful axonal inputs that establish multi-synaptic contacts (up to [~]20 synapses) with target neurons. Our analysis indicates that these strong inputs are specific, and allow small numbers of axons to have an outsized role in the activity of some of their postsynaptic partners.",

Years of molecular neurobiology indicate that neurotransmission depends on such optimization strategies, yet the molecular topography of the presynaptic Active Zone (AZ) where transmitter is released upon synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion remains to be visualized. Therefore, we implemented MINFLUX optical nanoscopy to resolve the AZ of rod photoreceptors.

Here fresh retinal slices are directly stamped onto glass coverslips yielding a single layer of rod AZs.

    "abstract": "The hidden Markov model (HMM) is widely used to analyze biophysical chronological data with discrete states, such as binding/detachment of biomolecules, protein/nucleotide conformational changes and step-like movement of single proteins. Despite its usefulness, classical HMM fitting has practical drawbacks that it requires the determination of the number of hidden states and fine initialization of many parameters before fitting. To overcome these drawbacks, several HMM pre-analyses have been reported, but do not provide enough accuracy when data have unknown kinetics and/or low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, in many cases, HMM fitting needs trial-and-error manual process that can impair the objectivity of the analysis. Moreover, for data composed of numerous hidden states, such as stepping data of cytoskeletal motors, there has been difficulty in HMM analysis because the large number of parameters were hardly properly initialized. Here, by combining a statistical step-finding method and the Gaussian mixture model clustering, we developed a new algorithm for more objective HMM analysis. Our algorithm can execute accurate state number estimation and parameter optimization with fully automated way. Simulation analysis demonstrated that our algorithm accurately fit both fast- and slow-transition trajectories. Compared with the previous method, the speed of our algorithm was 10-20 times faster for standard size data. Our algorithm also showed the accurate fit of the simulated motor-stepping data with more than 10 transition states, suggesting the applicability of the method to the data with numerous states. Furthermore, the algorithm is flexible enough to cope with cases where some kinetics are known in advance. Some available prior information, such as the dwell time of each state, can be integrated into the algorithm via two user-tunable parameters. In summary, our method enables fast, accurate and objective HMM analysis, and broadens the application range of HMM fitting that can provide more accurate interpretation of a wide variety of biophysical data.",

    "abstract": "By capturing various patterns of the structuring of genetic variation across populations, f -statistics have proved highly effective for the inference of demographic history. Such statistics are defined as covariance of SNP allele frequency differences among sets of populations without requiring haplotype information and are hence particularly relevant for the analysis of pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data. We here propose a reinterpretation of the F (and D) parameters in terms of probability of gene identity and derive from this unified definition unbiased estimators for both Pool-Seq and standard allele count data obtained from individual genotypes. We implemented these estimators in a new version of the R package poolfstat, which now includes a wide range of inference methods: (i) three-population test of admixture; (ii) four-population test of treeness; (iii) F4-ratio estimation of admixture rates; and (iv) fitting, visualization and (semi-automatic) construction of admixture graphs. A comprehensive evaluation of the methods implemented in poolfstat on both simulated Pool-Seq (with various sequencing coverages and error rates) and allele count data confirmed the accuracy of these approaches, even for the most cost-effective Pool-Seq design involving low sequencing coverages. We further analyzed a real Pool-Seq data made of 14 populations of the invasive species Drosophila suzukii which allowed refining both the demographic history of native populations and the invasion routes followed by this emblematic pest. Our new package poolfstat provides the community with a user-friendly and efficient all-in-one tool to unravel complex population genetic histories from large-size Pool-Seq or allele count SNP data.",

When combined with programmable toehold switch-based RNA sensors, these systems can be used to detect arbitrary RNAs and freeze-dried for room temperature transport to the point-of-need. These sensors, however, have been implemented using reconstituted PURE cell-free protein expression systems that are difficult to source in the Global South due to their high commercial cost and cold-chain shipping requirements. Here, we describe the implementation of RNA toehold switch-based sensors using E. coli cell lysate-based cell-free protein expression systems, which can be produced locally and reduce the cost of sensors by two orders of magnitude. We then demonstrate that these in-house cell lysates provide sensor performance comparable to commercial PURE cell-free systems. We further optimize use of these lysates with a CRISPRi strategy to enhance the stability of linear DNAs, enabling the direct use of PCR products for fast screening of new designs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop novel toehold sensors for the plant pathogen Potato Virus Y (PVY), which dramatically reduces the yield of this important staple crop. The local implementation of low-cost cell-free toehold sensors could enable biosensing capacity at the regional level and lead to more decentralized models for global surveillance of infectious disease.",

There are two main types of SCs associated with vis-OCT systems and eye conditions, respectively. Their negative influence on sO2 accuracy is amplified in human eyes due to stringent laser power requirements, eye motions, and varying eye anatomies. We developed an adaptive spectroscopic vis-OCT (Ads-vis-OCT) method to iteratively remove both types of SCs. We validated Ads-vis-OCT in ex vivo bovine blood samples against a blood-gas analyzer. We further validated Ads-vis-OCT in 125 unique retinal vessels from 18 healthy subjects against pulse-oximeter readings, setting the stage for clinical adoption of vis-OCT.",

    "abstract": "Precision oncology relies on the use of treatments targeting specific genetic variants. However, identifying clinically actionable variants as well as relevant information likely to be used to treat a patient with a given cancer is a labor-intensive task, which includes searching the literature for a large set of variants. The lack of universally adopted standard nomenclature for variants requires the development of variant-specific literature search engines. We develop a system to perform triage of publications relevant to support an evidence-based decision. Together with providing a ranked list of articles for a given variant, the system is also able to prioritize variants, as found in a Variant Calling Format, assuming that the clinical actionability of a genetic variant is correlated with the volume of literature published about the variant. Our system searches within three pre-annotated document collections: MEDLINE abstracts, PubMed Central full-text articles and ClinicalTrials.gov clinical trials. A variant synonym generator is used to increase the comprehensiveness of the set of retrieved documents. We then apply different strategies to rank the publications. We assess the search effectiveness of the system using different experimental settings. Experimental setting 1: The literature retrieval task is tuned and evaluated using the TREC Precision Medicine 2018 and 2019 benchmarks consisting respectively in 50 and 40 topics. Almost two thirds (62%) of the publications returned in the top-5 are relevant for clinical decision-support. Experimental setting 2: The evaluation of the variant prioritization task is based on a manually-created benchmark composed of eight patients for a total of 756 variants. For each patient, we used both their complete set of variants and tumor board reports. Our approach enabled identifying 81.8% of clinically actionable variants in the top-3. Experimental setting 3: A comparison of Variomes with LitVar, a well-known search engine for genetic variants is performed. Variomes was able to retrieve on average 90.8% of the content, while LitVar retrieved on average 58.6%. Out of the 9.2% articles, which are \"missed\" by Variomes, a per error analysis suggests that they are artefacts. To conclude, we are proposing here a competitive system to facilitate the curation of variants for personalized medicine.",

Open access to the data behind scientific discoveries has become critical to validate published findings and develop new computational tools. Here, we present ppx, a Python package that provides easy, programmatic access to the data stored in ProteomeXchange repositories, such as PRIDE and MassIVE. The ppx package can either be used as a command line tool or a Python package to retrieve the files and metadata associated with a project when provided its identifier. To demonstrate how ppx enhances reproducible research, we used ppx within a Snakemake workflow to reanalyze a published dataset with the open modification search tool ANN-SoLo and compared our reanalysis to the original results. We show that ppx readily integrates into workflows and our reanalysis produced results consistent with the original analysis. We envision that ppx will be a valuable tool for creating reproducible analyses, providing tool developers easy access to data for development, testing, and benchmarking, and enabling the use of mass spectrometry data in data-intensive analyses.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWClinical neuroimaging data availability has grown substantially in the last decade, providing the potential for studying heterogeneity in clinical cohorts on a previously unprecedented scale. Normative modeling is an emerging statistical tool for dissecting heterogeneity in complex brain disorders. However, its application remains technically challenging due to medical data privacy issues and difficulties in dealing with nuisance variation, such as the variability in the image acquisition process. Here, we introduce a federated probabilistic framework using hierarchical Bayesian regression (HBR) for multi-site normative modeling. The proposed method completes the life-cycle of normative modeling by providing the possibilities to learn, update, and adapt the model parameters on decentralized neuroimaging data. Our experimental results confirm the superiority of HBR in deriving more accurate normative ranges on large multi-site neuroimaging datasets compared to the current standard methods. In addition, our approach provides the possibility to recalibrate and reuse the learned model on local datasets and even on datasets with very small sample sizes. The proposed federated framework closes the technical loop for applying normative modeling across multiple sites in a decentralized manner. This will facilitate applications of normative modeling as a medical tool for screening the biological deviations in individuals affected by complex illnesses such as mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, transfusion, and organ transplantation build on a fundamental understanding of glycan-protein interactions. To aid this, we developed GlyNet, a model that accurately predicts interactions (relative binding strengths) between mammalian glycans and 352 glycan-binding proteins, many at multiple concentrations. For each glycan input, our model produces 1257 outputs, each representing the relative interaction strength between the input glycan and a particular protein sample. GlyNet learns these continuous values using relative fluorescence units (RFUs) measured on 599 glycans in the Consortium for Functional Glycomics glycan arrays and extrapolates these to RFUs from additional, untested glycans. GlyNets output of continuous values provides more detailed results than classification models. Such continuous outputs are easily converted by a following classifier, and in this form GlyNet outperforms reported classifiers. GlyNet is the first multi-output regression model for protein-glycan interactions and will serve as an important benchmark, facilitating development of quantitative computational glycobiology.",

    "abstract": "The tight junction outlines the apicolateral border of epithelial cells like a belt, sealing the paracellular space when cells form contacts with each other. The permeability and morphology of tight junction are regulated by actomyosin contractility, which has been conventionally thought from the purse-string-like circumferential actomyosin belt along tight junction. Spatially, the tight junction is close to the apical actin network, which exerts inward contractions orthogonal to the tight junction. To test the contributions from apical actin network, we laser-ablated spots on the apical surface of polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells. Laser ablation severed the apical cytoskeleton network, decreased in-plane tension, increased the apical surface area, and rendered the tight junction less tortuous in shape. Consistent with these observations, changes in MDCK cell sheet morphology due to cell proliferation, or perturbation with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 increased the density of the apical actin network and decreased tight junction tortuosity. The morphological analysis revealed scutoids in flat MDCK cell sheets, contrary to predictions from a previous model that only considered cell-cell interactions as line tension. Additional cell-cell interactions from apical in-plane tension provides probable cause for the occurrence of scutoids on flat geometry. Taken together, our findings identify the importance of the apical actin network exerting in-plane apical tension to regulate tight-junction mechanobiology and epithelial cell shape.\n\nSignificance StatementThe tight junction is located at the apicolateral cell border and regulates paracellular diffusion. Adjacent to the tight junction, the actin cytoskeleton forms a dense network beneath the apical surface and an actomyosin belt that circumscribes the lateral surface of the cell. Tight junctions are connected to the actin cytoskeleton which regulates paracellular transport, but the role of tension-mediated regulation of the tight junction by various actin structures is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that tension on the tight junction is mediated by the apical actin network. Our results provide a reinterpretion of past reports and broaden our understanding the mechanobiology of tight junctions.",

    "abstract": "The lateral preoptic area is implicated in numerous aspects of substance use disorder. In particular, the lateral preoptic area is highly sensitive to the pharmacological properties of psychomotor stimulants, and its activity promotes drug-seeking in the face of punishment and reinstatement during abstinence. Despite the lateral preoptic areas complicity in substance use disorder, how precisely lateral preoptic area neurons encode the individual components of drug self-administration has not been ascertained. To bridge this gap, we examined how the firing of single lateral preoptic area neurons correlates with three discrete elements of cocaine self-administration: 1) drug-seeking (pre-response), 2) drug-taking (response), and 3) receipt of the cocaine infusion. A significant subset of lateral preoptic area neurons responded to each component with a mix of increases and decreases in firing-rate. A majority of these neurons encoded the operant response with increases in spiking, though responses during the drug-seeking, taking, and reciept windows were highly correlated.",

Autistic traits exist in a continuum across the general population, whilst the extreme end of this distribution is diagnosed as clinical ASD. While many studies have investigated brain structure in autism using a case-control design, few have used a dimensional approach. To add to this growing body of literature, we investigated the structural brain correlates of autistic traits in a mixed sample of adults (N=91) with and without a clinical diagnosis of autism. We examined regional brain volumes (using voxel-based morphometry and surface-based morphometry) and white matter microstructure properties (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging). Our findings show widespread grey matter differences, including in the social brain regions, and some evidence for white matter microstructure differences related to higher autistic traits. These grey matter and white matter microstructure findings from our study are consistent with previous reports and support the brain structural differences in ASD. These findings provide further support for shared aetiology for autistic traits across the diagnostic divide.",

It is well-documented that people with agrammatism (PWA) have difficulty with production of verbs and verb morphology, but it is unknown whether these deficits occur at the single word-level, or are the result of a sentence-level impairment. The first aim of this paper is to determine the linguistic level that verb morphology impairments exist at by using magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanning to analyze neural response to two language tasks (one word-level, and one sentence-level). It has also been demonstrated that PWA benefit from a morphosemantic intervention for verb morphology deficits, but it is unknown if this therapy induces neuroplastic changes in the brain. The second aim of this paper is to determine whether or not neuroplastic changes occur after treatment, and explore the neural mechanisms by which this improvement occurs.",

    "abstract": "Identifying biomarkers that predict mental states with large effect sizes and high test-retest reliability is a growing priority for fMRI research. We examined a well-established multivariate brain measure that tracks pain induced by nociceptive input, the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS). In N = 295 participants across eight studies, NPS responses showed a very large effect size in predicting within-person single-trial pain reports (d = 1.45) and medium effect size in predicting individual differences in pain reports (d = 0.49). The NPS showed excellent shortterm (within-day) test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.84, with average 69.5 trials/person). Reliability scaled with the number of trials within-person, with [&ge;]60 trials required for excellent test-retest reliability. Reliability was tested in two additional studies across 5-day (N = 29, ICC = 0.74, 30 trials/person) and 1-month (N = 40, ICC = 0.46, 5 trials/person) test-retest intervals. The combination of strong within-person correlations and only modest between-person correlations between the NPS and pain reports indicate that the two measures have different sources of between-person variance. The NPS is not a surrogate for individual differences in pain reports but can serve as a reliable measure of pain-related physiology and mechanistic target for interventions.\n\nSignificance statementCurrent efforts towards translating brain biomarkers require identifying brain measures that can strongly and reliably predict outcomes of interest. We systematically examined the performance of a well-established brain activity pattern, the Neurological Pain Signature (NPS), in a large and diverse sample of participants. The NPS showed excellent reliability, and the reliability scaled with the number of trials within-person. The NPS responses showed strong correlations with pain reports at the within-person level but only modest correlations at the between-person level. The findings suggest that the NPS is not a surrogate for individual differences in pain reports but can serve as a reliable measure of a pain-related physiological target.\n\nAuthor NoteThis project was supported by grants R01MH076136 (T.D.W.), R01DA046064, R01EB026549, and R01DA035484.

    "abstract": "Our previous research highlighted a systematic bias in a spatial memory task, with participants correctly detecting object movements in the same direction as the perspective shift, whilst misjudging the direction of object movements if those were in the opposite direction to the perspective shift. The aim of the current study was to investigate if the introduction of perspective shifts results in systematic biases in object location estimations. To do so, we asked participants to encode the position of an object in a virtual room and to then estimate the objects position following a perspective shift. In addition, by manipulating memory load (perception and memory condition) we investigated if the bias in object position estimates results from systematic distortions introduced in spatial memory. Overall, our results show that participants make systematic errors in estimating object positions in the same direction as the perspective shift. This bias was present in both the memory and the perception condition. We propose that the systematic bias in the same direction as the perspective shift is driven by difficulties in understanding the perspective shifts that may lead participants to use an egocentric representation of object positions as an anchor when estimating the object location following a perspective shift, thereby giving rise to a systematic shift in errors in the same direction as the perspective shift.",

In behavioral studies, these beautiful insects have been extensively used for understanding time-space learning, landmark use and concept of learning etc. Highly organized behaviors such as social interaction and communication are systematically well organized behavioral components of honeybee foraging. Over the last two decades, understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying honey bee foraging at the cellular and molecular levels has been increasingly interested to several researchers. Upon the search of regulatory genes of brain and behavior, immediate early (IE) genes are considered as tool to begin the investigation. Our two recent studies, have demonstrated three IE genes namely Egr-1, Hr38 and kakusei having a role in the daily foraging of bees and their association with learning and memory during the foraging. These studies further evidence that IE genes can be used as a tool in finding the specific molecular/cellular players of foraging in honey bees and its behavioral components such as learning, memory, social interaction, social communication etc. In this article we provide the details of the method of sample collection at different times during foraging to investigate the foraging regulatory molecules.",

We used a spherical phantom, two 7-channel TMS-dedicated surface coils, and a multiband (MB) sequence (factor=2) with interslice gaps of 100ms and 40ms, on a Siemens 3T Prisma-fit scanner. For comparison we repeated a subset of parameters with a more standard single-channel TxRx (birdcage) coil, and with a human participant and surface coil set up. We found that, even at 100% stimulator output, pulses applied at least - 40ms/+50ms from the onset of slice readout avoid incurring artifacts. This was the case for all three setups. Thus, an interslice protocol can be achieved with a frequency of up to ~10 Hz, using a standard EPI sequence (slice acquisition time: 62.5ms, interslice gap: 40ms). Faster stimulation frequencies would require shorter slice acquisition times, for example using in-plane acceleration. Interslice TMS-fMRI protocols provide a promising avenue for retaining flexible timing of stimulus delivery without incurring TMS artifacts.",

    "abstract": "Object stabilization while grasping is a common topic of research in motor control and robotics. Forces produced by the peripheral fingers (index and little) play a crucial role in sustaining the rotational equilibrium of a handheld object. In this study, we examined the contribution of the peripheral fingers towards object stabilization when the rotational equilibrium is disturbed. For this purpose, the thumb was placed over an unsteady platform and vertically translated. The task was to trace a trapezoid or an inverted trapezoid pattern by moving the thumb platform in the vertical direction. The thumb displacement data served as visual feedback to trace the pattern displayed. Participants were instructed to maintain the handle in static equilibrium at all times. We observed that the change in the normal force of the little finger due to the downward translation of the thumb was significantly greater than the change in the normal force of the index finger due to the upward translation. We speculate that morphological correlations (between thumb and little finger) during the displacement of the thumb might be a reason for such large increases in the little finger forces.",

    "abstract": "Anterior regions of the ventral visual stream have substantial information about object categories, prompting theories that category-level forces are critical for shaping visual representation. The strong correspondence between category-supervised deep neural networks and ventral stream representation supports this view, but does not provide a viable learning model, as these deepnets rely upon millions of labeled examples. Here we present a fully self-supervised model which instead learns to represent individual images, where views of the same image are embedded nearby in a low-dimensional feature space, distinctly from other recently encountered views. We find category information implicitly emerges in the feature space, and critically that these models achieve parity with category-supervised models in predicting the hierarchical structure of brain responses across the human ventral visual stream. These results provide computational support for learning instance-level representation as a viable goal of the ventral stream, offering an alternative to the category-based framework that has been dominant in visual cognitive neuroscience.",

However, quantifying such dynamic impacts of species abundances on beta diversity has remained a methodological challenge.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we develop a numerical method to additively partition the temporal changes in beta diversity into distinct components that reflect the losses and gains in local species abundances. Our method is based on Ru[z]i[c]ka and Bray-Curtis indices and the normalized abundance-based Whittakers beta diversity. The temporal changes in these measures are partitioned into components that represent biotic homogenization and differentiation driven by abundance losses and gains at both species and community levels.\nC_LIO_LIApplication of the method to a Swedish fish community dataset revealed decreases in beta diversity between 1990 and 2018. The homogenization of fish communities was explained by gains, but not losses, in species abundances across sites. Species-level partitioning further showed that the homogenization was largely caused by the increased population sizes of a particular species in sites where it was already present.\nC_LIO_LIThe results highlight that our partitioning method effectively identifies local population and community processes embedded in regional biodiversity patterns. We believe that explicit analyses of the losses and gains in species abundances should bring deeper insights into the dynamics of beta diversity.\nC_LI",

The database is dynamic and will be updated regularly. It has a provision to incorporate user submitted data, which will allow increasing the resolution of the database as well as the expansion of its capacity.\n\n4) The database is envisaged to become a nationwide collaborative platform for a wide spectrum of stakeholders.

We evaluated the sustainability of their agricultural systems and did some recommendations. We applied the Framework for the Evaluation of Management Systems using Indicators (MESMIS, Spanish acronym), thirty-one indicators were identified, and the quantitative indexes were established to assess sustainability. The results showed that adaptability was a critical factor for irrigated and rainfed systems, the main problem identified was youth migration. Additionally, the access to water and economic resources, as well as environmental resources management, are imperious needs to increase the yield of agriculture crops. Therefore, a holistic approach taking into account the organization of small producers and synergy between indigenous knowledge and modern technologies, are required for the territorial development of the communities.",

    "abstract": "In addition to the compound eyes insects possess simple eyes known as ocelli. Input from the ocelli modulates optomotor responses, flight-time initiation and phototactic responses, behaviours that are predominantly mediated by the compound eyes. In this study, using pattern electroretinography (pERG), we investigated the contribution of the compound eyes to ocellar spatial vision in the diurnal Australian bull ant, Myrmecia tarsata by measuring the contrast sensitivity and spatial resolving power of the ocellar second-order neurons under various occlusion conditions. Furthermore, in four species of Myrmecia ants active at different times of the day and in European honeybee, Apis mellifera, we characterized the ocellar visual properties when both visual systems were available. Among the ants, we found that the time of activity had no significant effect on ocellar spatial vision. Comparing day-active ants and the honeybee we did not find any significant effect of locomotion on ocellar spatial vision. In M. tarsata, when the compound eyes were occluded, the amplitude of the pERG signal from the ocelli reduced by three times compared to conditions when the compound eyes were available. The signals from the compound eyes maintained the maximum contrast sensitivity of the ocelli as 13 (7.7%), and the spatial resolving power as 0.29 cpd. We conclude that ocellar spatial vison improves significantly with input from the compound eyes, with a noticeably larger improvement in contrast sensitivity than in spatial resolving power.",

    "abstract": "The breeding of resistant hosts based on the gene-for-gene interaction is crucial to address epidemics of plant pathogens in agroecosystems. Resistant host deployment strategies are developed and studied worldwide to decrease the probability of resistance breakdown and increase the resistance durability in various pathosystems. A major component of deployment strategies is the proportion of resistant hosts in the landscape. However, the impact of this proportion on resistance durability remains unclear for diploid pathogens with complex life cycles. In this study, we modelled pathogen population dynamics and genetic evolution at the virulence locus to assess the impact of the ploidy (haploid or diploid) and the pathogens life cycle (with or without host alternation) on resistance durability. Ploidy has a strong impact on evolutionary trajectories, with much greater stochasticity and delayed times of resistance breakdown for diploids. This result emphasises the importance of genetic drift in this system: as the virulent allele is recessive, positive selection on resistant hosts only applies to homozygous (virulent) individuals, which may lead to population collapse at low frequencies of the virulent allele. We also observed differences in the effect of host deployment depending on the pathogens life cycle. With host alternation, the probability that the pathogen population collapses strongly increases with the proportion of resistant hosts in the landscape. Therefore, resistance breakdown events occurring at high proportions of resistant hosts frequently amount to evolutionary rescue. Last, life cycles correspond to two selection regimes: without host alternation (soft selection) the resistance breakdown is mainly driven by the migration rate. Conversely, host alternation (hard selection) resembles an all-or-nothing game, with stochastic trajectories caused by the recurrent allele redistributions on the alternate host.",

However, well-characterized genetic architectures of such traits in wild populations remain uncommon. In this study, we used haplotype-based and multi-SNP Bayesian association methods with sequencing data for 313 individuals from wild populations to further characterize known candidate regions for sea age at maturation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). We detected an association at five loci (on chromosomes ssa06, ssa09, ssa21, and ssa25) out of 116 candidates previously identified in an aquaculture strain with maturation timing in wild Atlantic salmon. We found that at each of these five loci, variation explained by the locus was predominantly driven by a single SNP suggesting the genetic architecture of Atlantic salmon maturation includes multiple loci with simple, non-clustered alleles. This highlights the diversity of genetic architectures that can exist for fitness-related traits. Furthermore, this study provides a useful multi-SNP framework for future work using sequencing data to characterize genetic variation underlying phenotypes in wild populations.",

    "abstract": "Introgression from wild relatives have a great potential to broaden beneficial allelic diversity available for crop improvement in breeding programs. Here, we assessed the impact of introgression from 21 diverse accessions of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, into six hard red winter wheat cultivars on yield and yield component traits. We used 5.2 million imputed D genome SNPs identified by whole-genome sequencing of parental lines and the sequence-based genotyping of introgression population including 351 BC1F3:5 lines. Phenotyping data collected from the irrigated and non-irrigated field trials revealed that up to 23% of the introgression lines produce more grain than the parents and check cultivars. Based on sixteen yield stability statistics, the yield of twelve introgression lines (3.4%) was stable across treatments, years and locations; five of these lines were also high yielding, producing 9.8% more grain than the average yield of check cultivars. The most significant SNP-trait and haplotype-trait associations were identified on chromosome arms 2DS and 6DL for spikelet number per spike (SNS), on chromosome arms 2DS, 3DS, 5DS and 7DS for grain length and on chromosome arms 1DL, 2DS, 6DL and 7DS for grain width. Introgression of haplotypes from Ae. tauschii parents was associated with increase in SNS, which positively correlated with heading date, whereas haplotypes from hexaploid wheat parents were associated with increased grain width. We show that haplotypes on 2DS associated with increased spikelet number and heading date are linked with multiple introgressed alleles of Ppd-D1 identified by the whole-genome sequencing of the Ae. tauschii parents. While some introgressed haplotypes exhibited significant pleiotropic effects with the direction of effects on the yield component traits being largely consistent with the previously reported trade-offs, there were haplotype combinations associated with the positive trends in yield. The characterized repertoire of the introgressed haplotypes derived from Ae. tauschii accessions with the combined positive effects on yield and yield components traits in elite germplasm provides a valuable source of alleles for improving the productivity of winter wheat by optimizing the contribution of component traits to yield.",

    "abstract": "Homing gene drives hold great promise for the genetic control of natural populations. However, current homing systems are capable of spreading uncontrollably between populations connected by even marginal levels of migration. This could represent a substantial sociopolitical barrier to the testing or deployment of such drives and may generally be undesirable when the objective is only local population control, such as suppression of an invasive species outside of its native range. Tethered drive systems, in which a locally confined gene drive provides the CRISPR nuclease needed for a homing drive, could provide a solution to this problem, offering the power of a homing drive and confinement of the supporting drive. Here, we demonstrate the engineering of a tethered drive system in Drosophila, using a regionally confined CRISPR Toxin-Antidote Recessive Embryo (TARE) drive to support modification and suppression homing drives. Each drive was able to bias inheritance in its favor, and the TARE drive was shown to spread only when released above a threshold frequency in experimental cage populations. After the TARE drive had established in the population, it facilitated the spread of a subsequently released split homing modification drive (to all individuals in the cage) and of a homing suppression drive (to its equilibrium frequency). Our results show that the tethered drive strategy is a viable and easily engineered option for providing confinement of homing drives to target populations.",

For the non-invasive PTOA mouse model, cyclic comprehensive loading (9 N) was applied on the left knee joint of each mouse. Biochemical and molecular changes induced by mechanical loading were analyzed after loading was completed. Blood and cartilage were collected and further examined using gene expression analysis. Grading of the tissue sections was completed using the osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) scale. Biomechanical features of mechanically loaded knee joints were determined after 24 hours (Trauma) and three weeks (PTOA) post-mechanical loading sessions to examine the development of PTOA, respectively.\n\nResultsThe loaded left knee joint showed a greater ROS/RNS signal than the right knee that was not loaded. There was an increase in cartilage damage and MMP activity in the affected knee as the intensity of MabCII680 and MMP750 signal increased in the mechanical loaded joints as compared to unloaded control knee joints. There was also an increase in the difference of viscoelastic energy dissipation ability (tan {delta}) in PTOA. The OA score increased significantly in mechanically loaded knee joints.\n\nConclusionThis study showed that biomechanical, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics of the murine PTOA groups are significantly different from the control group. These results validate that the current mouse model can be used for translational studies to examine PTOA.",

Our genetics network uses hierarchical graph convolution and pooling operations to embed subject-level data onto a low-dimensional latent space. The hierarchical network implicitly tracks the convergence of genetic risk across well-established biological pathways, while an attention mechanism automatically identifies the salient edges of this network at the subject level. In parallel, our imaging network projects multimodal data onto a set of latent embeddings. For interpretability, we implement a Bayesian feature selection strategy to extract the discriminative imaging biomarkers; these feature weights are optimized alongside the other model parameters. We couple the imaging and genetic embeddings with a predictor network, to ensure that the learned representations are linked to phenotype. We evaluate our framework on a schizophrenia dataset that includes two functional MRI paradigms and gene scores derived from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism data. Using repeated 10-fold cross-validation, we show that our imaging-genetics fusion achieves the better classification performance than state-of-the-art baselines. In an exploratory analysis, we further show that the biomarkers identified by our model are reproducible and closely associated with deficits in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong-read sequencing has enabled unprecedented surveys of structural variation across the entire human genome. To maximize the potential of long-read sequencing in this context, novel mapping methods have emerged that have primarily focused on either speed or accuracy. Various heuristics and scoring schemas have been implemented in widely used read mappers (minimap2 and NGMLR) to optimize for speed or accuracy, which have variable performance across different genomic regions and for specific structural variants. Our hypothesis is that constraining read mapping to the use of a single gap penalty across distinct mutational hotspots reduces read alignment accuracy and impedes structural variant detection.\n\nFindingsWe tested our hypothesis by implementing a read mapping pipeline called Vulcan that uses two distinct gap penalty modes, which we refer to as dual-mode alignment. The high-level idea is that Vulcan leverages the computed normalized edit distance of the mapped reads via e.g. minimap2 to identify poorly aligned reads and realigns them using the more accurate yet computationally more expensive long read mapper (NGMLR). In support of our hypothesis, we show Vulcan improves the alignments for Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) long-reads for both simulated and real datasets. These improvements, in turn, lead to improved accuracy for structural variant calling performance on human genome datasets compared to either of the read mapping methods alone.\n\nConclusionsVulcan is the first long-read mapping framework that combines two distinct gap penalty modes, resulting in improved structural variant recall and precision.

    "abstract": "The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a revolutionary technology to detect and characterize distinct cell populations under different biological conditions. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, the expression of genes from scRNA-seq is highly sparse due to limited sequencing depth per cell. This is worsened by tossing away a significant portion of reads that cannot be mapped during gene quantification. To overcome data sparsity and fully utilize original sequences, we propose scSimClassify, a reference-free and alignment-free approach to classify cell types with k-mer level features derived from raw reads in a scRNA-seq experiment. The major contribution of scSimClassify is the simhash method compressing k-mers with similar abundance profiles into groups. The compressed k-mer groups (CKGs) serve as the aggregated k-mer level features for cell type classification. We evaluate the performance of CKG features for predicting cell types in four scRNA-seq datasets comparing four state-of-the-art classification methods as well as two scRNA-seq specific algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that the CKG features lend themselves to better performance than traditional gene expression features in scRNA-seq classification accuracy in the majority of cases. Because CKG features can be efficiently derived from raw reads without a resource-intensive alignment process, scSimClassify offers an efficient alternative to help scientists rapidly classify cell types without relying on reference sequences. The current version of scSimClassify is implemented in python and can be found at https://github.com/digi2002/scSimClassify.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of protein aggregation is associated with a wide range of human diseases. Our knowledge on the aggregation behaviour of viral proteins, however, is still rather limited. Here, we investigated this behaviour in the the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteomes. An initial analysis using a panel of sequence-based predictors suggested the presence of multiple aggregation-prone regions in these proteomes, and revealed an enhanced aggregation propensity in some SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We then studied the in vitro aggregation of predicted aggregation-prone SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the signal sequence peptide and fusion peptide 1 of the spike protein, a peptide from the NSP6 protein (NSP6-p), the ORF10 protein, and the NSP11 protein. Our results show that these peptides and proteins form aggregates via a nucleation-dependent mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrated that the aggregates of NSP11 are toxic to mammalian cell cultures. These findings provide evidence about the aggregation of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.\n\nSignificanceThe aggregation of proteins is linked with human disease in a variety of ways. In the case of viral infections, one could expect that the aberrant aggregation of viral proteins may damage the host cells, and also that viral particles may trigger the misfolding and aggregation of host proteins, resulting in damage to the host organism. Here we investigate the aggregation propensity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and show that many of them can form aggregates that are potentially cytotoxic. In perspective, these results suggest that a better understanding of the effects of viruses on the human protein homeostasis system could help future therapeutic efforts.",

    "abstract": "The flexible and sophisticated movement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract implies the involvement of mechanisms other than enteric neural circuits, to coordinate excitation in microregions. We thus performed microimaging of pacemaker dynamics in the small intestine of mice since it contains typical network-forming pacemaker cells. A dialysis membrane-reinforced low-impedance microelectrode array (MEA) enabled field potentials over a wide frequency range to be stably measured in microregions. The pacemaker dynamics were classified into basic patterns despite large variations. In the developmental process, pacemaker activity was categorized as either an  expanding or a  migrating pattern that was initiated in or propagated to the MEA sensing area, respectively. The intercellular current of the volume conductor complicated the waveform of both activities. The existence of  expanding and  migrating patterns was attributable to duplicated pacemaker systems such as intracellular Ca2+ oscillation-activated and voltage-gated mechanisms. Additionally, from the spatio-temporal feature during the period of pacemaker events, the  bumpy/aberrant pattern was defined by aberrant, incoherent propagation, and associated with local impairment of excitability, while the  colliding/converging pattern involved the interaction of multiple activities in the MEA area. Interconversion between the four micro-coordination patterns occurred in the same microregion. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) promoted  migrating activity, implying an improvement or restoration of spatial conductivity. These results agree well with the action of 5-HT to change GI movement toward propulsion. In conclusion, our MEA method of microimaging classification enables the quantitative assessment of spatio-temporal electric coordination underlying GI motility, suggesting its application to small model animals.",

In humans, few studies have investigated whether FGF21 may act to suppress sugar intake and influence eating behavior, and the effects of adiposity on post-ingestive FGF21 regulation of appetite are unknown. Here, we demonstrate among two cohorts of healthy, young adults that acute oral fructose and sucrose compared to glucose lead to greater circulating FGF21. Moreover, high compared to low dietary added sugar intake is associated with greater sucrose-stimulated FGF21 among participants with healthy weight but attenuated in people with overweight and obesity. In addition, our study is the first to demonstrate associations between circulating FGF21 and neural signaling following an acute sucrose load among humans with healthy weight. Collectively, our results suggest that these potential compensatory relationships between sucrose-stimulated circulating FGF21, habitual sugar intake, and post-ingestive brain responses may be altered among adults with overweight and obesity.\n\nSignificance StatementAnimal models have established FGF21 as an autoregulator of sweet consumption, but few studies have examined post-ingestive FGF21 effects in humans. In this report, we demonstrate a compensatory relationship between sucrose-stimulated FGF21 and high dietary added sugar intake through a potential liver-to-brain negative-feedback cycle among healthy, young adults.

    "abstract": "MotivationMachine learning models for predicting cell-type-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites have become increasingly more accurate thanks to the increased availability of next-generation sequencing data and more standardized model evaluation criteria. However, knowledge transfer from data-rich to data-limited TFs and cell types remains crucial for improving TF binding prediction models because available binding labels are highly skewed towards a small collection of TFs and cell types. Transfer prediction of TF binding sites can potentially benefit from a multitask learning approach; however, existing methods typically use shallow single-task models to generate low-resolution predictions. Here we propose NetTIME, a multitask learning framework for predicting cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites with base-pair resolution.\n\nResultsWe show that the multitask learning strategy for TF binding prediction is more efficient than the single-task approach due to the increased data availability. NetTIME trains high-dimensional embedding vectors to distinguish TF and cell-type identities. We show that this approach is critical for the success of the multitask learning strategy and allows our model to make accurate transfer predictions within and beyond the training panels of TFs and cell types. We additionally train a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) to classify binding predictions and show that this CRF eliminates the need for setting a probability threshold and reduces classification noise. We compare our methods predictive performance with two state-of-the-art methods, Catchitt and Leopard, and show that our method outperforms previous methods under both supervised and transfer learning settings.\n\nAvailabilityNetTIME is freely available at https://github.com/ryi06/NetTIME and the code is also archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6994897\n\nContactrb133@nyu.edu",

Surprisingly little is known of the behavioural effect of SSRI discontinuation in animals.\n\nAimHere, the effect of SSRI discontinuation on anxiety-like behaviour was systematically investigated in mice.\n\nMethodsExperiments were based on a 3-arm experimental design comprising saline, continued SSRI and discontinued SSRI. Mice were assessed 2 days after SSRI discontinuation over a 5 day period using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and other anxiety tests.\n\nResultsAn exploratory experiment found cessation of paroxetine (12 days) was associated with decreased open arm exploration and reduced total distance travelled, in male but not female mice. Follow-up studies confirmed a discontinuation effect on the EPM in male mice after paroxetine (12 days) and also citalopram (12 days). Mice receiving continued paroxetine (but not citalopram) also showed decreased open arm exploration but this was dissociable from effects of discontinuation. The discontinuation response to paroxetine did not strengthen after 28 days treatment but was absent after 7 days treatment. A discontinuation response was not decernable in other anxiety and fear-learning tests applied 3-5 days after treatment cessation. Finally, discontinuation effects on the EPM were typically associated with decreased locomotion on the test. However, separate locomotor testing implicated anxiety-provoked behavioural inhibition rather than a general reduction in motor activity.\n\nConclusionOverall, the current study provides evidence for a short-lasting behavioural discontinuation response to cessation of SSRI treatment in mice.",

    "abstract": "Developing accurate subcortical volumetric quantification tools is crucial for neurodevelopmental studies, as they could reduce the need for challenging and time-consuming manual segmentation. In this study the accuracy of two automated segmentation tools, FSL-FIRST (with three different boundary correction settings) and FreeSurfer were compared against manual segmentation of subcortical nuclei, including the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, putamen, globus pallidus, caudate and nucleus accumbens, using volumetric and correlation analyses in 80 5-year-olds.\n\nBoth FSL-FIRST and FreeSurfer overestimated the volume on all structures except the caudate, and the accuracy varied depending on the structure. Small structures such as the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, which are visually difficult to distinguish, produced significant overestimations and weaker correlations with all automated methods. Larger and more readily distinguishable structures such as the caudate and putamen produced notably lower overestimations and stronger correlations. Overall, the segmentations performed by FSL-FIRSTs Default pipeline were the most accurate, while FreeSurfers results were weaker across the structures.\n\nIn line with prior studies, the accuracy of automated segmentation tools was imperfect with respect to manually defined structures. However, apart from amygdala and nucleus accumbens, FSL-FIRSTs agreement could be considered satisfactory (Pearson correlation > 0.74, Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.68 and Dice Score coefficient (DSC) > 0.87) with highest values for the striatal structures (putamen, globus pallidus and caudate) (Pearson correlation > 0.77, ICC > 0.87 and DSC > 0.88, respectively). Overall, automated segmentation tools do not always provide satisfactory results, and careful visual inspection of the automated segmentations is strongly advised.",

    "abstract": "We introduce DeepSPEC, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) -based approach for frequency-and-phase correction (FPC) of MRS spectra to achieve fast and accurate FPC of single-voxel PRESS MRS and MEGA-PRESS data. In DeepSPEC, two neural networks, including one for frequency correction and one for phase correction were trained and validated using published simulated and in vivo PRESS and MEGA-PRESS MRS dataset with wide-range artificial frequency and phase offsets applied. DeepSPEC was subsequently tested and compared to the current deep learning solution - a \"vanilla\" neural network approach using multilayer perceptrons (MLP). Furthermore, random noise was added to the original simulated dataset to further investigate the model performance with noise at varied signal-to-noise (SNR) levels (i.e., 6 dB, 3 dB, and 1.5 dB). The testing showed that DeepSPEC is more robust to noise compared to the MLP-based approach due to having a smaller absolute error in both frequency and phase offset prediction. The DeepSPEC framework was capable of correcting frequency offset with 0.01{+/-}0.01 Hz and phase offset with 0.12{+/-}0.09{degrees} absolute errors on average for unseen simulated data at a high SNR (12 dB) and correcting frequency offset with 0.01{+/-}0.02 Hz and phase offset within -0.07{+/-}0.44{degrees} absolute errors on average at very low SNR (1.5 dB). Furthermore, additional frequency and phase offsets (i.e., small, moderate, large) were applied to the in vivo dataset, and DeepSPEC demonstrated better performance for FPC when compared to the MLP-based approach. Results also show DeepSPEC has superior performance than the model-based SR implementation (mSR) in FPC by having higher accuracy in a wider range of additional offsets. These results represent a proof of concept for the use of CNNs for preprocessing MRS data and demonstrate that DeepSPEC accurately predicts frequency and phase offsets at varying noise levels with state-of-the-art performance.",

The dataset includes a range of state and trait self-report questionnaires, as well as behavioural tasks assessing individual differences in cognitive ability. The DMCC project is on-going and features additional components (e.g., related participants, manipulations of cognitive control mode, resting state fMRI, longitudinal testing) that will be publicly released following study completion. This DMCC55B subset is released early with the aim of encouraging wider use and greater benefit to the scientific community.

To date, well-established electrochemical techniques that detect neurotransmission in high magnetic field environments are limited. Here, we propose an experimental setting enabling simultaneous fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and blood oxygenation-dependent functional magnetic imaging (BOLD fMRI) to measure both local tissue oxygen and dopamine responses, and global BOLD changes, respectively. By using MR-compatible materials and the proposed data acquisition schemes, FSCV detected physiological analyte concentrations with high spatiotemporal resolution inside of a 9.4 T MRI bore. We found that tissue oxygen and BOLD correlate strongly, and brain regions that encode dopamine amplitude differences can be identified via modeling simultaneously acquired dopamine FSCV and BOLD fMRI time-courses. This technique provides complementary neurochemical and hemodynamic information and expands the scope of studying the influence of local neurotransmitter release over the entire brain.",

Yet, for the vast diversity of arthropods, their associated viruses remain unexplored. Here, we mined meta-transcriptomes from 711 arthropod species, including insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans, and uncovered more than 1400 previously unknown RNA viruses, representing 822 novel evolutionary groups at a level between species and genus. These newly found viral groups fill major evolutionary gaps within the five branches of RNA viruses, bridging the evolution of viruses infecting early and later diverging eukaryotes. Additionally, co-phylogenetic analysis implies that RNA viruses of arthropods commonly co-evolved with their hosts. Our analyses indicate that arthropods have played a central role in the macroevolution of RNA viruses by serving as reservoirs in which viruses co-evolved with arthropods while being exchanged with a vast diversity of organisms.",

Here we demonstrate that S. pombe Lem2, an NE protein, regulates nuclear exosome-mediated RNA degradation. Lem2 deletion causes accumulation of non-coding RNAs and meiotic transcripts. Indeed, an engineered exosome substrate RNA shows Lem2-dependent localization to the nuclear periphery. Lem2 does not directly bind RNA, but instead physically interacts with the exosome-targeting MTREC complex and promotes RNA recruitment. The Lem2-assisted pathway acts independently of nuclear bodies where exosome factors assemble, revealing that multiple spatially distinct degradation pathways exist. The Lem2 pathway is environmentally responsive: nutrient availability modulates Lem2 regulation of meiotic transcripts. Our data indicate that Lem2 recruits exosome co-factors to the nuclear periphery to coordinate RNA surveillance and regulates transcripts during the mitosis-to-meiosis switch.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) is used for error-free targeted knock-in of foreign donor DNA. However, the low efficiency of HDR-mediated knock-in hinders establishment of knock-in clones. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by CRISPR/Cas9 are preferentially repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) before HDR can occur, thereby preventing HDR-mediated knock-in. NHEJ/MMEJ also cause random integrations, which give rise to false-positive knock-in events, or silently disrupt the genome. In this study, we optimized an HDR-mediated knock-in method for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We succeeded in improving efficiency of HDR-mediated knock-in of a plasmid donor while almost completely suppressing NHEJ/MMEJ-based integration by combining in vivo-linearization of the donor plasmid, transient knockdown of DNA Polymerase {theta}, and chemical inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) by M3814. This method also dramatically improved the efficiency of biallelic knock-in; at the Rosa26a locus, 95% of HDR-mediated knock-in clones were biallelic. We designate this method BiPoD (Biallelic knock-in assisted by Pol {theta} and DNA-PK inhibition). BiPoD achieved simultaneous efficient biallelic knock-in into two loci. BiPoD, therefore, enables rapid and easy establishment of biallelic knock-in mESC lines.",

Here we showcase how the geo-tectonic and climatic evolution in South Asia and surrounding landmasses have shaped the biogeographic history of Indoplanorbis exustus, a tropical Asian, freshwater, pulmonated snail. We amplified partial COI gene fragment from all over India and combined this with a larger dataset from South and Southeast Asia to carry out phylogenetic reconstruction, species delimitation analysis, and population genetic analyses. Two nuclear genes were also amplified from one individual per putative species to carry out divergence dating and ancestral area reconstruction analyses. The results suggest that Indoplanorbis dispersed out of Africa into India during Eocene. Furthermore, molecular data suggests Indoplanorbis is a species complex consisting of multiple putative species. The primary diversification took place in Northern Indian plains or the Northeast India. The speciation events appear to be primarily allopatric caused by a series of aridification events starting from late Miocene to early Pleistocene. None of the species seemed to have any underlying genetic structure suggestive of high vagility. All the species underwent population fluctuations during the Pleistocene likely driven by the Quaternary climatic fluctuations.",

In a pilot analysis, we apply MAGAR on data in four tissues (ileum, rectum, T-cells, B-cells) from healthy individuals and demonstrate the discrimination of common from cell-type-specific methQTLs. We experimentally validate both types of methQTLs in an independent dataset comprising additional cell types and tissues. Finally, we validate selected methQTLs (PON1, ZNF155, NRG2) by ultra-deep local sequencing. In line with previous reports, we find cell-type-specific methQTLs to be preferentially located in enhancer elements.\n\nConclusionsOur analysis demonstrates that a systematic analysis of methQTLs provides important new insights on the influences of genetic variants to cell-type-specific epigenomic variation.",

Although over 150 million people around the world have recovered from this disease, the long term effects of the disease are still under study. A year after the start of the pandemic, data from COVID-19 recovered patients shows multiple organs affected with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes fatigue, chest pain, cellular damage, and robust innate immune response with inflammatory cytokine production. More clinical studies and clinical trials are needed to not only document, but also to understand and determine the factors that predispose certain people to the long term side effects of his infection.\n\nIn this manuscript, our goal was to explore the multidimensional landscape of infected lung tissue microenvironment to better understand complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, immune response and the lungs microbiome of COVID-19 patients. Each sample was analyzed with several machine learning tools allowing simultaneous detection and quantification of viral RNA amount at genome and gene level; human gene expression and fractions of major types of immune cells, as well as metagenomic analysis of bacterial and viral abundance. To contrast and compare specific viral response to SARS-COV-2 we have analyzed deep sequencing data from additional cohort of patients infected with NL63 strain of corona virus.\n\nOur correlation analysis of three types of measurements in patients i.e. fraction of viral RNA (at genome and gene level), Human RNA (transcripts and gene level) and bacterial RNA (metagenomic analysis), showed significant correlation between viral load as well as level of specific viral gene expression with the fractions of immune cells present in lung lavage as well as with abundance of major fractions of lung microbiome in COVID-19 patients.\n\nOur exploratory study has provided novel insights into complex regulatory signaling interactions and correlative patterns between the viral infection, inhibition of innate and adaptive immune response as well as microbiome landscape of the lung tissue. These initial findings could provide better understanding of the diverse dynamics of immune response and the side effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

However, we still lack methods with nucleotide resolution that are tractable at the scale of whole genomes and that can achieve high predictive accuracy either in theory or practice. In this article we propose a new generative sequence model, the Bayesian embedded autoregressive (BEAR) model, which uses a parametric autoregressive model to specify a conjugate prior over a nonparametric Bayesian Markov model. We explore, theoretically and empirically, applications of BEAR models to a variety of statistical problems including density estimation, robust parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit tests, and two-sample tests. We prove rigorous asymptotic consistency results including nonparametric posterior concentration rates. We scale inference in BEAR models to datasets containing tens of billions of nucleotides. On genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic sequence data we show that BEAR models provide large increases in predictive performance as compared to parametric autoregressive models, among other results. BEAR models offer a flexible and scalable framework, with theoretical guarantees, for building and critiquing generative models at the whole genome scale.",

    "abstract": "What makes cognition  advanced is an open and not precisely defined question. One perspective involves increasing the complexity of associative learning, from conditioning to learning sequences of events ( chaining) to representing various cue combinations as  chunks. Here we develop a weighted-graph model to study the conditions for the evolution of chunking ability, based on the ecology of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. Cleaners must learn to serve visitor clients before resident clients, because a visitor leaves if not attended while a resident waits for service. This challenge has been captured in various versions of the ephemeral-reward task, which has been proven difficult for a range of cognitively capable species. We show that chaining is the minimal requirement for solving the laboratory task, that involves repeated simultaneous exposure to an ephemeral and permanent food source. Adding ephemeral-ephemeral and permanent-permanent combinations, as cleaners face in the wild, requires individuals to have chunking abilities to solve the task. Importantly, chunking parameters need to be calibrated to ecological conditions in order to produce adaptive decisions. Thus, it is the fine tuning of this ability which may be the major target of selection during the evolution of advanced associative learning.",

However, frequent treatment is not viable for devices with a continuous blood flow such as a wearable or implantable dialyzer. In this study, the biofouling characteristics of a highly hemocompatible graphene oxide (GO) membrane developed through a novel self-assembly process is studied in a protein-rich environment and compared with performance of a state-of-the-art commercial polymer membrane dialyzer. The studies are conducted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) environment using human serum albumin (HSA), which represents 60% of the blood protein, at the nominal blood protein concentration of 1 g L-1. Protein aggregation on the membrane surface is evaluated by monitoring the change in the membrane flux and SEM imaging. The GO membrane water flux declined only ~10% over a week-long test whereas the polymer membrane flux declined by 50% during the same period. The SEM images show that HSA primarily aggerates over the graphitic regions of nanoplatelets, away from the charged hydrophilic edges. This phenomenon leaves the open areas of the membrane formed between the nanoplatelets edges, through which the species pass, relatively intact. In contrast, HSA completely plugs the polymer membrane pores resulting in a steady decline in membrane permeability.",

To investigate the microenvironment of Randalls plaque, we analyzed single-cell RNA data of 3 Randalls plaque and 3 normal renal papillae tissue and identified 11 different cell types. We screened differentially expressed genes among all cell types between Randalls plaque and normal renal papillae. The microenvironment showed two cell types with multiple stone formation-associated transcriptomic programs. Contrary to previous studies, we did not observe macrophage M1/M2 imbalance. Notably, we detected ossification-associated macrophage is enriched in Randalls plaque and validated GPNMB and ACP5 were potential biomarkers on the ossification-associated macrophage. We also identified an endothelial subset harboring active communication (COL15A1+ PCDH17+ endothelial, DPECs) with other cells. Together with Immunofluorescence, we validated ossification-associated macrophage and DPECs are enriched in Randalls plaque tissue. Finally, cell-to-cell communication revealed that Loop of Henle, DPECs, and osteoblasts-associated macrophages was the main source of SPP1 signaling.

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions make up a substantial fraction of many proteomes where they play a wide variety of essential roles. A critical first step in understanding the role of disordered protein regions in biological function is to identify those disordered regions correctly. Computational methods for disorder prediction have emerged as a core set of tools to guide experiments, interpret results, and develop hypotheses. Given the multiple different predictors available, consensus scores have emerged as a popular approach to mitigate biases or limitations of any single method. Consensus scores integrate the outcome of multiple independent disorder predictors and provide a per-residue value that reflects the number of tools that predict a residue to be disordered. Although consensus scores help mitigate the inherent problems of using any single disorder predictor, they are computationally expensive to generate. They also necessitate the installation of multiple different software tools, which can be prohibitively difficult. To address this challenge, we developed a deep-learning-based predictor of consensus disorder scores. Our predictor, metapredict, utilizes a bidirectional recurrent neural network trained on the consensus disorder scores from 12 proteomes. By benchmarking metapredict using two orthogonal approaches, we found that metapredict is among the most accurate disorder predictors currently available. Metapredict is also remarkably fast, enabling proteome-scale disorder prediction in minutes. Importantly, metapredict is fully open source and is distributed as a Python package, a collection of command-line tools, and a web server, maximizing the potential practical utility of the predictor. We believe metapredict offers a convenient, accessible, accurate, and high-performance predictor for single-proteins and proteomes alike.\n\nStatement of SignificanceIntrinsically disordered regions are found across all kingdoms of life where they play a variety of essential roles. Being able to accurately and quickly identify disordered regions in proteins using just the amino acid sequence is critical for the appropriate design and interpretation of experiments. Despite this, performing large-scale disorder prediction on thousands of sequences is challenging using extant disorder predictors due to various difficulties including general installation and computational requirements. We have developed an accurate, high-performance and easy-to-use predictor of protein disorder and structure. Our predictor, metapredict, was designed for both proteome-scale analysis and individual sequence predictions alike. Metapredict is implemented as a collection of local tools and an online web server, and is appropriate for both seasoned computational biologists and novices alike.",

In this paper, we have utilized the Matrix Factorization (MF) as a modality for high dimensionality reduction in systems pharmacology.

We have applied these techniques as well as three other matrix factorization methods to analyze eight different gene expression datasets to investigate and compare their performance for feature selection. Our results show that these methods are capable of reducing the feature spaces and find predictive features in terms of phenotype determination.

However, the regulatory mechanisms for tonic inhibition remain largely unknown. Here we report distinct actions of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing subtypes of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) on tonic inhibition in hippocampal neurons. Mechanistically, GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs play differential roles in 5-GABAAR internalization. Additionally, GluN2A-, but not GluN2B-, containing receptors are required for the homeostatic potentiation of tonic inhibition. In an acute seizure model induced by kainic acid, tonic inhibition is decreased during acute seizures, while it is increased 24 h later, and these alterations are dependent on the distinct GluN2-containing NMDARs. Collectively, these data reveal a critical link between NMDARs and extrasynaptic GABAARs in both physiological and pathological conditions.",

Whether these pathways are rapidly activated within the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 by estrogens and across the anatomical longitudinal axis has been overlooked.\n\nMethodsGonadally-intact female and male rats were given either vehicle or physiological systemic low (1.1{micro}g/kg) or high (37.3{micro}g/kg) doses of 17{beta}-estradiol thirty minutes prior to tissue collection. To control for the effects of circulating estrogens, an additional group of female rats was ovariectomized (OVX) and administered 17{beta}-estradiol. Brains were extracted and tissue punches of the CA1 and DG were taken along the longitudinal hippocampal axis (dorsal and ventral) and analyzed for key MAPK and Akt cascade phosphoproteins.\n\nResultsIntact females had higher Akt pathway phosphoproteins (pAkt, pGSK-3{beta}, pp70S6K) than males in the DG (dorsal, ventral) and lower pERK1/2 in the dorsal DG. Most effects of 17{beta}-estradiol on cell signalling occurred in OVX animals. In OVX animals, 17{beta}-estradiol increased cell signalling of MAPK and Akt phosphoproteins (pERK1/2, pJNK, pAkt, pGSK-3{beta}) in the CA1 and pERK1/2 and pJNK DG.\n\nDiscussion/ConclusionsSystemic 17{beta}-estradiol treatment rapidly alters phosphoprotein levels in the hippocampus dependent on reproductive status and intact females have greater expression of Akt phosphoproteins than intact males across the hippocampus. These findings shed light on underlying mechanisms of sex differences in hippocampal function and response to interventions that affect MAPK or Akt signaling.",

We find striking similarity, albeit with greater variability in the timing of clock arrest in culture. Our simple physical description of a clock controlled by a noisy cell-intrinsic timer captures these dynamics. We propose the segmentation clock integrates an intrinsic, timer-driven oscillatory program, which underlies the waves and arrest, with extrinsic cues regulating the intrinsic timers duration and precision.\n\nOne-sentence SummarySegmentation clock and wavefront activities underlying tissue-level wave patterns are cell-autonomous properties in the PSM.",

We employed phylogenetic, morphometric, population genetic and niche modelling technique to address these questions. We found out that both species complexes consist of several genetically and ecologically distinct putative species. The speciation was primarily driven by allopatric isolation into different river basins. A combination of paleoclimatic and paleohydrological changes during the Miocene have shaped the speciation events. Local climatic adaptation also could have contributed towards some of the speciation events.

CENH3 preferentially occupies satellites with least divergence and greatest higher-order repetition. The centromeres are invaded by ATHILA retrotransposons, which disrupt genetic and epigenetic organization of the centromeres.

    "abstract": "Mouse models are a tool for studying the mechanisms underlying complex diseases; however, differences between species pose a significant challenge for translating findings to patients. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics and orthogonal validation approaches to provide cross-species taxonomies, identifying shared broad cell classes and unique granular cellular states, between mouse and human kidney. We generated cell atlases of the diabetic and obese kidney using two different mouse models, a high-fat diet (HFD) model and a genetic model (BTBR ob/ob), at multiple time points along disease progression. Importantly, we identified a previously unrecognized, expanding Trem2high macrophage population in kidneys of HFD mice that matched human TREM2high macrophages in obese patients. Taken together, our cross-species comparison highlights shared immune and metabolic cell-state changes.",

    "abstract": "Vision and olfaction are expensive to maintain, and in many taxa there appears to be a trade-off in investment between the two sensory systems. Previous work has suggested that guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) may differ in the relative importance they place on these two senses in social interactions. In this study, we directly examined this issue by experimentally contrasting olfactory and visual information in social situations. In the first experiment, we found that guppies spent more time where conspecifics were visible than where they could smell them. On the contrary, zebrafish spent significantly more time in an empty compartment containing smell of conspecifics than in a compartment in which they only saw them. The difference was not large, suggesting that both species integrate various types of information to locate a nearby shoal. In two subsequent experiments, we studied the role of vision and smell in the discrimination of the quality of the social group, namely the number and the familiarity of its members. Zebrafish and guppies were confirmed to rely on different senses to estimate the size of a social group, whereas they did not differ in the discrimination of familiar and non-familiar conspecifics which appears to be based equally on the two senses. Similarly to what happens in other vertebrate clades, we suggest that, among teleosts, there are large differences in the relative importance of the different senses in the perception of the external world.",

However, datasets differ in repeat composition, heterozygosity, read lengths and error profiles. The assembly parameters that provide the best results could thus differ across datasets. By integrating four complementary and biologically meaningful metrics, we show that simple fine-tuning of assembly parameters can substantially improve the quality of long-read genome assemblies. In particular, modifying estimates of sequencing error rates improves some metrics more than two-fold.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWNovel experimental assays now simultaneously measure lineage relationships and transcriptomic states from single cells, thanks to CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering. These multimodal measurements allow researchers not only to build comprehensive phylogenetic models relating all cells but also infer transcriptomic determinants of consequential subclonal behavior. The gene expression data, however, is limited to cells that are currently present (\"leaves\" of the phylogeny). As a consequence, researchers cannot form hypotheses about unobserved, or \"ancestral\", states that gave rise to the observed population. To address this, we introduce TreeVAE: a probabilistic framework for estimating ancestral transcriptional states. TreeVAE uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model the observed transcriptomic data while accounting for the phylogenetic relationships between cells. Using simulations, we demonstrate that TreeVAE outperforms benchmarks in reconstructing ancestral states on several metrics. TreeVAE also provides a measure of uncertainty, which we demonstrate to correlate well with its prediction accuracy. This estimate therefore potentially provides a data-driven way to estimate how far back in the ancestor chain predictions could be made. Finally, using real data from lung cancer metastasis, we show that accounting for phylogenetic relationship between cells improves goodness of fit. Together, TreeVAE provides a principled framework for reconstructing unobserved cellular states from single cell lineage tracing data.",

    "abstract": "Ankyrin protein repeats bind to a wide range of substrates and are one of the most common protein motifs in nature. Here, we collate a high-quality alignment of 7,407 ankyrin repeats and examine for the first time, the distribution of human population variants from large-scale sequencing of healthy individuals across this family. Population variants are not randomly distributed across the genome but are constrained by gene essentiality and function. Accordingly, we interpret the population variants in context with evolutionary constraint and structural features including secondary structure, accessibility and protein-protein interactions across 383 three-dimensional structures of ankyrin repeats. We find five positions that are highly conserved across homologs and also depleted in missense variants within the human population. These positions are significantly enriched in intra-domain contacts and so likely to be key for repeat packing. In contrast, a group of evolutionarily divergent positions are found to be depleted in missense variants in human but significantly enriched in protein-protein interactions. Our analysis also suggests the domain has three, not two surfaces, each with different patterns of enrichment in protein-substrate interactions and missense variants. Our findings will be of interest to those studying or engineering ankyrin-repeat containing proteins as well as those interpreting the significance of disease variants.\n\nAuthor SummaryComparison of variation at each position of the amino acid sequence for a protein across different species is a powerful way to identify parts of the protein that are important for its structure and function. Large-scale DNA sequencing of healthy people has recently made it possible to study normal genetic variation within just one species. Our work combines information on genetic differences between over 100,000 people with in-depth analysis of all available three-dimensional structures for Ankyrin repeats which are a widespread family of binding proteins formed by units with similar amino acid sequence that are found in tandem. Our combined analysis identifies sites critical for ankyrin stability as well as the positions most important for substrate interactions and hence function. Although focused only on the Ankyrins, the principles developed in our work are general and can be applied to any protein family.",

    "abstract": "RNF43 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is recurrently mutated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and precursor cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. The impact of RNF43 mutations on PDAC is poorly understood and autochthonous models have not been sufficiently characterized. In this study we describe a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of PDAC with conditional expression of oncogenic Kras and deletion of the catalytic domain of Rnf43 (KRC) in exocrine cells. We demonstrate that Rnf43 loss results in an increased incidence of high-grade cystic lesions of the pancreas and PDAC. Importantly, KRC mice have a significantly decreased survival compared to mice containing only an oncogenic Kras mutation. By use of single cell RNA sequencing we demonstrated that KRC tumor progression is accompanied by a decrease in macrophages, as well as an increase in T and B lymphocytes with evidence of increased immune checkpoint molecule expression and affinity maturation, respectively. This was in stark contrast to the tumor immune microenvironment observed in the Kras/Tp53 driven PDAC GEMM. Furthermore, expression of the chemokine, CXCL5, was found to be specifically decreased in KRC cancer cells by means of epigenetic regulation and emerged as a putative candidate for mediating the unique KRC immune landscape. This GEMM establishes RNF43 as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene in PDAC and puts forth a rationale for an immunotherapy approach in this subset of PDAC cases.",

    "abstract": "Inferotemporal cortex (IT) in humans and other primates is topo-graphically organized, containing multiple hierarchically-organized areas selective for particular domains, such as faces and scenes. This organization is commonly viewed in terms of evolved domain-specific visual mechanisms. Here, we develop an alternative, domain-general and developmental account of IT cortical organization. The account is instantiated as an Interactive Topographic Network (ITN), a form of computational model in which a hierarchy of model IT areas, subject to connectivity-based constraints, learns high-level visual representations optimized for multiple domains. We find that minimizing a wiring cost on spatially organized feedforward and lateral connections within IT, combined with constraining the feedforward processing to be strictly excitatory, results in a hierarchical, topographic organization. This organization replicates a number of key properties of primate IT cortex, including the presence of domain-selective spatial clusters preferentially involved in the representation of faces, objects, and scenes, columnar responses across separate excitatory and inhibitory units, and generic spatial organization whereby the response correlation of pairs of units falls off with their distance. We thus argue that domain-selectivity is an emergent property of a visual system optimized to maximize behavioral performance while minimizing wiring costs.\n\nSignificance StatementWe introduce the Interactive Topographic Network, a framework for modeling high-level vision, to demonstrate in computational simulations that the spatial clustering of domains in late stages of the primate visual system may arise from the demands of visual recognition under the constraints of minimal wiring costs and excitatory between-area neuronal communication. The learned organization of the model is highly specialized but not fully modular, capturing many of the properties of organization in primates. Our work is significant for cognitive neuroscience, by providing a domain-general developmental account of topo-graphic functional specialization, and for computational neuroscience, by demonstrating how well-known biological details can be successfully incorporated into neural network models in order to account for critical empirical findings.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDC-reactive protein (CRP) in peripheral inflammation is associated with increased Alzheimers disease (AD) risk in Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), but not ApoE3 or E2, humans. It remains unknown whether peripheral monomeric CRP (mCRP) induces AD pathogenesis through some receptor of blood-facing endothelia in the brain in an ApoE genotype dependent fashion.\n\nMETHODSWe used human samples, ApoE knock-in and deficient mouse models, and primary brain endothelia. Different ApoE mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with mCRP. The characterizations by immunostaining, proximity ligation assay (PLA) and siRNA were conducted to identify the receptor for mCRP. Brain microvessel and endothelia were isolated for RNA sequencing to explore the molecular pathway.\n\nRESULTSWe demonstrate that CD31 (PECAM-1), a blood-facing endothelial receptor in brain, is a competitive target of both mCRP and ApoE protein. ApoE2 competes more strongly with mCRP for CD31 than ApoE4 does, and expressing ApoE4 or knocking out ApoE gene results in higher levels of mCRP-CD31 binding, leading to a decrease of CD31 expression but an increase in CD31 phosphorylation, along with greater cerebrovascular damage and AD pathology. This competitive binding mediates differential endothelial molecular responses depending on ApoE genotype, increasing cerebrovascular inflammation and mitochondria impairment in ApoE4 mice, while inducing vasculogenesis and protective changes in the presence of ApoE2.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur study reveals a novel and dynamic endothelial ApoE-mCRP-CD31 pathway for AD pathogenesis during chronic inflammation and provides some insight into the opposing ApoE4-neurodegenerative and ApoE2-neuroprotective effects in AD.\n\nClinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWHAT IS NEW?C_ST_ABSO_LICD31 is a competitive target of both mCRP and ApoE in brain endothelia in an ApoE-allele dependent pattern\nC_LIO_LImCRP increases CD31 phosphorylation in the brain endothelia and damages cerebrovasculature in ApoE4 carriers and AD brains\nC_LIO_LImCRP expression results in neuroprotective or neurodegenerative pathway activation in an ApoE-dependent manner\nC_LI\n\nWHAT ARE THE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS?O_LIAlthough ApoE4 is a major genetic risk factor of AD, some ApoE4 carriers do not develop AD by the age of 90.\nC_LIO_LIElderly people often experience peripheral inflammatory attacks and develop chronic low-grade inflammation, which results in the formation and release of mCRP.
