    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple common breast cancer susceptibility variants. Many of these variants have differential associations by estrogen receptor (ER), but how these variants relate with other tumor features and intrinsic molecular subtypes is unclear.\n\nMethodsAmong 106,571 invasive breast cancer cases and 95,762 controls of European ancestry with data on 173 breast cancer variants identified in previous GWAS, we used novel two-stage polytomous logistic regression models to evaluate variants in relation to multiple tumor features (ER, progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and grade) adjusting for each other, and to intrinsic-like subtypes.\n\nResultsEighty-five of 173 variants were associated with at least one tumor feature (false discovery rate <5%), most commonly ER and grade, followed by PR and HER2. Models for intrinsic-like subtypes found nearly all of these variants (83 of 85) associated at P<0.05 with risk for at least one luminal-like subtype, and approximately half (41 of 85) of the variants were associated with risk of at least one non-luminal subtype, including 32 variants associated with triple-negative (TN) disease. Ten variants were associated with risk of all subtypes in different magnitude. Five variants were associated with risk of luminal A-like and TN subtypes in opposite directions.\n\nConclusionThis report demonstrates a high level of complexity in the etiology heterogeneity of breast cancer susceptibility variants and can inform investigations of subtype-specific risk prediction.",

    "abstract": "Early after-depolarizations (EADs) are action potential (AP) repolarization abnormalities that can trigger lethal arrhythmias. Simulations using biophysically-detailed cardiac myocyte models can reveal how model parameters influence the probability of these cellular arrhythmias, however such analyses can pose a huge computational burden. We have previously developed a highly simplified approach in which logistic regression models (LRMs) map parameters of complex cell models to the probability of ectopic beats (EBs). Here, we extend this approach to predict the probability of early after-depolarizations (P(EAD)). We use the LRM to investigate how changes in parameters of the slow-activating delayed rectifier current (IKs) affect P(EAD) for 17 different Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQTS1) mutations. We compare P(EAD) for these 17 LQTS1 mutations with two other recently proposed model-based arrhythmia risk metrics. These three model-based risk metrics yield similar prediction performance; however, they all fail to predict relative clinical risk for a significant number of the 17 studied LQTS1 mutations. The consistent successes and failures of all three risk metrics suggest that important functional characteristics of LQTS1 mutations may not yet be fully known.\n\nAuthor summaryAn early after-depolarization (EAD) is an abnormal cellular electrical event which can trigger dangerous arrhythmias in the heart. We use our previously developed method to build a simple logistic regression model (LRM) that estimates the probability of EAD (P(EAD)) as a function of myocyte model parameters. Using this LRM along with two other recently published model-based arrhythmia risk predictors, we estimate risk of arrhythmia for 17 Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQTS1) mutations. Results show that all approaches have similar prediction performance in that there are a set of mutations whose relative clinical risk for arrhythmia are well estimated using these metrics, but that relative risk is consistently over- or under-estimated across all approaches for a significant number of other mutations. We believe this indicates that the functional characterization of the LQTS1 phenotype is incomplete.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces serious chronic infections in hospitalized patients and immunocompromised individuals, including patients with cystic fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa responds to antibiotics and other stresses to promote persistent infections may provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Azithromycin (AZM), an antibiotic frequently used in cystic fibrosis treatment, is thought to improve clinical outcomes through a number of mechanisms including impaired biofilm growth and quorum sensing (QS). The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response to AZM remain unclear. Here, we interrogated the P. aeruginosa transcriptional response to AZM using a fast, cost-effective genome-wide approach to quantitate RNA 3 ends (3pMap). We also identified hundreds of P. aeruginosa genes with high incidence of premature 3 end formation indicative of riboregulation in their transcript leaders using 3pMap. AZM treatment of planktonic and biofilm cultures alters the expression of hundreds of genes, including those involved in QS, biofilm formation, and virulence. Strikingly, most genes downregulated by AZM in biofilms had increased levels of intragenic 3 ends indicating premature transcription termination, transcriptional pausing, or accumulation of stable intermediates resulting from the action of nucleases. Reciprocally, AZM reduced premature intragenic 3 end termini in many upregulated genes. Most notably, reduced termination accompanied robust induction of obgE, a GTPase involved in persister formation in P. aeruginosa. Our results support a model in which AZM-induced changes in 3 end formation alter the expression of central regulators which in turn impairs the expression of QS, biofilm formation and stress response genes, while upregulating genes associated with persistence.",

    "abstract": "The process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is required for the progression of renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF). Ubiquitin-specific protease 4 (USP4) can facilitate development of transforming growth factor, beta 1 (TGF-{beta}1) induced EMT in some cancer cells. However, the role of USP4 in EMT during RIF remains unknown. We aimed to explore the effect of USP4 on the EMT induced by TGF-{beta}1 of renal tubular epithelial cells and involved mechanism in RIF. In vivo, on the 7th and 14th day after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), the expression of USP4 protein in the obstructed kidneys was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot assay. In vitro, NRK-52E cells were stimulated with TGF-{beta}1 10ng/ml. The protein expressions of USP4, E-cadherin and alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA) were detected at different time points by Western blot. After transfected with USP4 siRNA, the cells were cultured with TGF-{beta}1 for additional 24 hours. The expressions of E-cadherin, -SMA, and TGF{beta} receptor type I (T{beta}RI) were detected by immunofluorescence. And the protein expressions of USP4, E-cadherin, -SMA and T{beta}RI were detected by Western blot assay. Compared with sham operation group, the expression of USP4 in UUO model group increased significantly with the prolongation of obstruction time. After NRK-52E was stimulated by TGF-{beta}1, the expression of USP4 protein increased gradually. At 6h, 12h, and 24h, the difference between the experimental group and the control group was statistically significant. At the same time, E-cadherin decreased significantly, while -SMA increased significantly. Compared with the TGF-{beta}1 group, the cells in USP4 siRNA transfection group restored E-cadherin and weakened -SMA expression. At the same time, protein expressions of USP4 and T{beta}RI were also significantly decreased. These data imply that USP4 is a harmful molecule induced by TGF-{beta}1, which plays an important role by upregulating the expression of T{beta}RI and promoting EMT of renal tubular epithelial cells, thereby facilitating renal interstitial fibrosis.",

In particular, non-invasive imaging of iron and myelin, which are involved in normal brain functions and are histopathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative diseases, has practical utilities in neuroscience and medicine. Here, we propose a biophysical model that describes the individual contribution of paramagnetic (e.g., iron) and diamagnetic (e.g., myelin) susceptibility sources to the frequency shift and transverse relaxation of MRI signals. Using this model, we develop a method,{chi} -separation, that generates the voxel-wise distributions of the two sources. The method is validated using computer simulation and phantom experiments, and applied to ex-vivo and in-vivo brains. The results delineate the well-known histological features of iron and myelin in the specimen, healthy volunteers, and multiple sclerosis patients.

    "abstract": "The survival and reproductive success of animals depends on the ability to harmonize their external behaviors with their internal states. For example, females conduct numerous social programs that are distinctive to virgins, compared to post-mated and/or pregnant individuals. In Drosophila, the fact that this post-mating switch is initiated by seminal factors implies that the default state is virgin. However, we recently showed that loss of miR-iab-4/8-mediated repression of the transcription factor Homothorax (Hth) within the abdominal ventral nerve cord (VNC) causes virgin females to execute mated behaviors. To elucidate new components of this post-transcriptional regulatory circuit, we used genomic analysis of mir-iab-4/8 deletion and hth-miRNA binding site mutants (hth[BSmut]) to elucidate doublesex (dsx) as a critical downstream factor. While Dsx has mostly been studied during sex-specific differentiation, its activities in neurons are little known. We find that accumulation of Dsx in the CNS is highly complementary to Hth, and downregulated in miRNA/hth[BSmut] mutants. Moreover, virgin behavior is highly dose-sensitive to developmental dsx function. Strikingly, depletion of Dsx in SAG-1 cells, a highly restricted set of abdominal neurons, abrogates female virgin conducts in favor of mated behavioral programs. Thus, a double negative post-transcriptional pathway in the VNC (miR-iab-4/8 -| Hth -| Dsx) specifies the virgin behavioral state.",

Estimating observed and expected heterozygosities from genome-wide sequence data has become increasingly common, and these estimates are often derived directly from genotypes at single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. While many SNP markers can provide precise estimates of genetic processes, the results of  downstream analysis with these markers may depend heavily on  upstream filtering decisions.\nC_LIO_LIHere we explore the downstream consequences of sample size, rare allele filtering, missing data thresholds and known population structure on estimates of observed and expected heterozygosity using two reduced-representation sequencing datasets, one from the mosquito Aedes aegypti (ddRADseq) and the other from a threatened grasshopper, Keyacris scurra (DArTseq).\nC_LIO_LIWe show that estimates based on polymorphic markers only (i.e. SNP heterozygosity) are always biased by global sample size (N), with smaller N producing larger estimates. By contrast, results are unbiased by sample size when calculations consider monomorphic as well as polymorphic sequence information (i.e. genome-wide or autosomal heterozygosity). SNP heterozygosity is also biased when differentiated populations are analysed together, while autosomal heterozygosity remains unbiased. We also show that when nucleotide sites with missing genotypes are included, observed and expected heterozygosity estimates diverge in proportion to the amount of missing data permitted at each site.\nC_LIO_LIWe make three recommendations for estimating genome-wide heterozygosity: (i) autosomal heterozygosity should be reported instead of (or in addition to) SNP heterozygosity; (ii) sites with any missing data should be omitted; (iii) populations should be analysed in independent runs. This should facilitate comparisons within and across studies and between observed and expected measures of heterozygosity.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Invasive candidiasis, often caused by Candida albicans, is an important healthcare-associated fungal infection that results in a high mortality rate of up to 40%. Neutrophils are the first line of defense during Candida infections. They can initiate various killing mechanisms and release cytokines to attract further immune cells to the site of infection. These responses are tightly controlled, since they can also lead to severe tissue/organ damage. We hypothesized that the regulation of C. albicans-specific neutrophil functions by the immunoregulatory C. albicans receptors CEACAM1, CEACAM3, and CEACAM6 are involved in the immune pathology of candidemia. Here, we analyzed the effects of the specific antibodies B3-17, 308/3-3, and 1H7-4B, respectively, targeting the three CEACAM receptors on C. albicans-induced neutrophil responses. We show that ligation of CEACAM6 significantly enhanced the response to C. albicans, as evidenced by the increased CXCL8/IL-8 secretion. By assessing the transcriptional responses, we found that CEACAM6 ligation and to some extent CEACAM1 ligation, but not CEACAM3 ligation, resulted in altered gene regulation of the C. albicans-stimulated neutrophils. Genes that were differentially regulated by the different CEACAM-targeting antibodies were analyzed for affected cellular processes and signaling pathways using various bioinformatics methods, including integrated network analyses and dynamic simulations of signaling cascades. Predicted changes in cellular pathways and cellular functions included CEACAM-specific alterations in apoptosis and cytokine secretion. In particular, we verified predicted changes in IL-1{beta}/IL-6 expression in response to the antibody ligation of all three targeted CEACAMs and apoptosis induction by anti-CEACAM6 antibody treatment in presence of C. albicans stimulation. Specifically, CEACAM6 ligation by 1H7-4B enhanced neutrophil apoptosis and increased immediate and long-term cytokine release in responses to C. albicans. CEACAM1 ligation by B3-17 mainly enhanced the immediate secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and CEACAM3 ligation by 308/3-3 increased the long-term release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, we demonstrated for the first time that CEACAM receptors have an important and differential impact on the regulation of C. albicans-induced immune functions in human neutrophils.",

Using filter cake as co-substrate may allow the reactor to operate throughout the year, as it is available in the sugarcane off-season, unlike vinasse. A comparison was made from the microbial community of the seed sludge and the reactor sludge when CH4 production stabilized. Lactate, butyrate and propionate fermentation routes were denoted at the start-up of the s-CSTR, characterizing the acidogenic phase: the Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) values ranged from -800 to -100 mV. Once the methanogenesis was initiated, alkalizing addition was no longer needed as its demand by the microrganisms was supplied by the alkali-characteriscs of the deacetylation liquor. The gradual increase of the applied Organic Load Rates (OLR) allowed stabilization of the methanogenesis from 3.20 gVS L-1 day-1: the highest CH4 yield (230 NmLCH4 gSV-1) and average organic matter removal efficiency (83% {+/-} 13) was achieved at ORL of 4.16 gVS L-1day-1. The microbial community changed along the reactor operation, presenting different metabolic routes mainly due to the used lignocellulosic substrates. Bacteria from the syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) process coupled to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis were predominant ([~] 2% Methanoculleus) during the CH4 production stability. The overall results are useful as preliminary drivers in terms of visualizing the co-AD process in a sugarcane biorefinery integrated to scale.\n\nKeypoitnsIntegration of 1G2G sugarcane ethanol biorefinery from co-digestion of its residues Biogas production from vinasse, filter cake and deacetylation liquor in a semi-CSTR Lignicellulosic substrates affected the biochemical routes and microbial community Biomol confirmed the stablismenht of thermophilic community from mesophilic sludge",

    "abstract": "Self-incompatibility (SI) is a genetic mechanism preventing self-pollination in approximately 40% of plant species. Two multiallelic loci, called S and Z, control the gametophytic SI system of the grass family (Poaceae), which contains all major forage grasses. Loci independent from S and Z have been reported to disrupt SI and lead to self-compatibility (SC). A locus causing SC in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was previously mapped on linkage group (LG) 5 in a F2 population segregating for SC. Using a subset of the same population (n=68), we first performed low-resolution quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to exclude the presence of additional, previously undetected contributors to SC. The previously reported QTL on LG 5 explained 38.4% of the phenotypic variation, and no significant contribution from other genomic regions was found. This was verified by the presence of significantly distorted markers in the region overlapping with the QTL. Second, we fine mapped the QTL to 0.26 cM using additional 2,056 plants and 23 novel sequence-based markers. Using an Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) genome assembly as reference, the markers flanking SC were estimated to span a ~3 Mb region encoding for 57 predicted genes. Among these, seven genes were proposed as relevant candidate genes based on their annotation and function described in previous studies. Our work is a step forward to identify SC genes in forage grasses and provides diagnostic markers for marker-assisted introgression of SC into elite germplasm.\n\nKey messageA previously reported QTL conferring self-compatibility to perennial ryegrass was fine mapped to a 0.26 cM locus, corresponding to an estimated ~ 3 Mb physical region containing 57 predicted protein-encoding genes.",

    "abstract": "The ability to comprehend phrases is an essential integrative property of the brain. Here we evaluate the neural processes that enable the transition from single word processing to a minimal compositional scheme. Previous research has reported conflicting timing effects of composition, and disagreement persists with respect to inferior frontal and posterior temporal contributions. To address these issues, 19 patients (10 male, 19 female) implanted with penetrating depth or surface subdural intracranial electrodes heard auditory recordings of adjective-noun, pseudoword-noun and adjective-pseudoword phrases and judged whether the phrase matched a picture. Stimulus-dependent alterations in broadband gamma activity, low frequency power and phase-locking values across the language-dominant left hemisphere were derived. This revealed a mosaic located in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), in which closely neighboring cortical sites displayed exclusive sensitivity to either lexicality or phrase structure, but not both. Distinct timings were found for effects of phrase composition (210-300 ms) and pseudoword processing (approximately 300-700 ms), and these were localized to neighboring electrodes in pSTS. The pars triangularis and temporal pole encode anticipation of composition in broadband low frequencies, and both regions exhibit greater functional connectivity with pSTS during phrase composition. Our results suggest that the pSTS is a highly specialized region comprised of sparsely interwoven heterogeneous constituents that encodes both lower and higher level linguistic features. This hub in pSTS for minimal phrase processing may form the neural basis for the human-specific computational capacity for forming hierarchically organized linguistic structures.\n\nSignificanceLinguists have claimed that the integration of multiple words into a phrase demands a computational procedure distinct from single word processing. Here, we provide intracranial recordings from a large patient cohort, with high spatiotemporal resolution, to track the cortical dynamics of phrase composition. Epileptic patients volunteered to participate in a task in which they listened to phrases (\"red boat\"), word-pseudoword or pseudoword-word pairs (e.g., \"red fulg\"). At the onset of the second word in phrases, greater broadband high gamma activity was found in posterior superior temporal sulcus in electrodes that exclusively indexed phrasal meaning, and not lexical meaning. These results provide direct, high-resolution signatures of minimal phrase composition in humans, a potentially species-specific computational capacity.",

    "abstract": "New, rapid, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective species discovery and delimitation methods are needed for tackling \"dark taxa\", that we here define as clades for which <10% of all species are described and the estimated diversity exceeds 1000 species. Species delimitation for these taxa should be based on multiple data sources (\"integrative taxonomy\") but collecting multiple types of data risks impeding a discovery process that is already too slow. We here develop explicit methods to avoid this by applying Large-scale Integrative Taxonomy (LIT). Preliminary species hypotheses are generated based on inexpensive data that are obtained quickly and cost-effectively in a technical exercise. The validation step is then based on a more expensive type of data that are only obtained for specimens selected based on objective criteria. We here use this approach to sort 18 000 scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) from Sweden into 315 preliminary species hypotheses based on NGS barcode (313bp) clusters. These clusters were subsequently tested with morphology and used to develop quantitative indicators for predicting which barcode clusters are in conflict with morphospecies. For this purpose, we first randomly selected 100 clusters for in-depth validation with morphology. Afterwards, we used a linear model to demonstrate that the best predictors for conflict between barcode clusters and morphology are maximum p-distance within the cluster and cluster stability across different clustering thresholds. A test of these indicators using the 215 remaining clusters reveals that these predictors correctly identify all clusters that conflict with morphology. The morphological validation step in our study involved only 1 039 specimens (5.8% of all specimens), but a newly proposed simplified protocol would only require the study of 915 (5.1%: 2.5 specimens per species), as we show that clusters without signatures of incongruence can be validated by only studying two specimens representing the most divergent haplotypes. To test the generality of our results across different barcode clustering techniques, we establish that the levels of conflict are similar across Objective Clustering (OC), Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Poisson Tree Processes (PTP) and Refined Single Linkage (RESL) (used by Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) to assign Barcode Index Numbers (BINs)). OC and ABGD achieved a maximum congruence score with morphology of 89% while PTP was slightly less effective (84%). RESL could only be tested for a subset of the specimens because the algorithm is not public. BINs based on 277 of the original 1 714 haplotypes were 86% congruent with morphology while the values were 89% for OC, 74% for PTP, and 72% for ABGD.",

Yet, their contribution to organic matter export has not been quantified, making an assessment of their impact on the biological carbon pump impossible. Here, we demonstrate that cyanobacterial and non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs are massively exported down to 1000 m-depth in the western subtropical South Pacific Ocean (WTSP), accounting for up to 52-100% of the total particulate nitrogen export fluxes. We further demonstrate that small size unicellular diazotrophs (UCYN, 1-8 {micro}m) are exported more efficiently than filamentous diazotrophs (>100-1000 {micro}m) under the form of large (>50 {micro}m) aggregates linked by an extracellular organic matrix. Beyond the WTSP, our data are supported by analysis of the Tara Oceans metagenomes collected in other ocean basins, showing that diazotrophs are systematically detected in mesopelagic waters when present at the surface. We thus conclude that diazotrophs are key players in carbon sequestration in the ocean and need to be considered in future studies to improve the accuracy of current regional and global estimates of export.",

    "abstract": "The SAR116 clade within the class Alphaproteobacteria represents one of the most abundant groups of heterotrophic bacteria inhabiting the surface of the ocean. The small number of cultured representatives of SAR116 (only two to date) is a major bottleneck that has prevented an in-depth study at the genomic level to understand the relationship between genome diversity and its role in the marine environment. In this study, we use all publicly available genomes to provide a genomic overview of the phylogeny, metabolism and biogeography within the SAR116 clade. This increased genomic diversity revealed has led to the discovery of two subclades of SAR116 that, despite having similar genome size (ca. 2.4 Mb) and coexist in the same environment, display different properties in their genomic make up. One represents a novel subclade for which no pure cultures have been isolated and is composed mainly of single-amplified genomes (SAGs). Genomes within this subclade showed convergent evolutionary trajectories with more streamlining features, such as low GC content (ca. 30%), short intergenic spacers (<22 bp) and strong purifying selection (low dN/dS). Besides, they were more abundant in metagenomic databases recruiting also at the deep chlorophyll maximum. Less abundant and restricted to the upper photic layers of the global ocean, the other subclade of SAR116, enriched in MAGs, accommodated the only two pure cultures. Genomic analysis suggested that both clades have a significant role in the sulfur cycle with differences in the way in which both clades can metabolize the dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).\n\nIMPORTANCESAR116 clade of Alphaproteobacteria is an ubiquitous group of heterotrophic bacteria inhabiting the surface of the ocean, but the information about their ecology and population genomic diversity is scarce due to the difficulty of getting pure culture isolates. The combination of single-cell genomics and metagenomics has become an alternative approach to study this kind of microbes. Our results expand the understanding of the genomic diversity, distribution, and lifestyles within this clade and provide evidence of different evolutionary trajectories in the genome make-up of the two subclades that could serve to understand how evolutionary pressure can drive different adaptations to the same environment. Therefore, the SAR116 clade represents an ideal model organism for the study of the evolutionary streamlining of genomes in microbes that have relatively close relatedness to each other.",

On the cell surface, these sugars form a cushion known as the glycocalyx. Here, we show that Heparan Sulfate (HS) chains - part of the glycocalyx - and other glycans - expressed on the surface of both host and virus proteins - have a critical role in modulating both attractive and repulsive potentials during viral infection. We analyse the SARS-CoV-2 virus, modelling its spike proteins binding to HS chains and two key entry receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We include the volume exclusion effect imposed on the HS chains impose during virus insertion into glycocalyx and the steric repulsion caused by changes in the conformation of the ACE2 glycans involved in binding to the spike. We then combine all these interactions, showing that the interplay of all these components is critical to the behaviour of the virus. We show that the virus tropism depends on the combinatorial expression of both HS chains and receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that when both HS chains and entry receptors express at high density, steric effects dominate the interaction, preventing infection.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with the host translation remains largely unexplored. Using polysome profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco2 cells, we here demonstrate that the virus induces a strong suppression of global translation by 48 hours of infection. Heavy polysome fractions displayed substantial depletion in the infected cells, indicating the loss of major translational activities in them. Further assessment of the major pathways regulating translation in multiple permissive cell lines revealed strong eIF4E dephosphorylation accompanied by Mnk1 depletion and ERK1/2 dephosphorylations. p38MAPK showed consistent activation and its inhibition lowered viral titers, indicating its importance in viral survival. mTORC1 pathway showed the most profound inhibition, indicating its potential contribution to the suppression of global translation associated with the infection. Pharmacological activation of mTORC1 caused a drop in viral titers while inhibition resulted in higher viral RNA levels, confirming a critical role of mTORC1 in regulating viral replication. Surprisingly, the infection did not cause a general suppression of 5-TOP translation, as evident from the continued expression of ribosomal proteins. Our results collectively indicate that the differential suppression of mTORC1 might allow SARS-CoV-2 to hijack translational machinery in its favor and specifically target a set of host mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive analysis and characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 infection model that mimics non-severe and severe COVID-19 in humans is warranted for understating the virus and developing preventive and therapeutic agents. Here, we characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse model expressing human (h)ACE2 in mice, controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter, in epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where SARS-CoV-2 infections typically start. We found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2x103 and 2x104 PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lungs, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2x101 and 2x102 PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this humanized hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered after infection with a low dose of virus also survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and non-severe COVID-19 in humans and can provide insight into disease progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19.\n\nImportanceThe pandemic of COVID-19 has reached 112,589,814 cases and caused 2,493,795 deaths worldwide as of February 23, 2021, has raised an urgent need for development of novel drugs and therapeutics to prevent the spread and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. To achieve this goal, an animal model that recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and pathogenesis is greatly needed. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the mice with low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 virus to study the pathogenesis and survival in response to different infection patterns. Moreover, we compared the pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients to show that this model could be a useful tool for the development of anti-viral drugs and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphAmong the biomolecules at the center of human health and molecular biology is a system of molecules that defines the human phenotype known as the metabolome. Through an untargeted metabolomic analysis of fecal samples from human individuals from Africa and the Americas--the birthplace and the last continental expansion of our species, respectively--we present the characterization of the core human fecal metabolome. The majority of detected metabolite features were ubiquitous across populations, despite any geographic, dietary, or behavioral differences. Such shared metabolite features included hyocholic acid and cholesterol. However, any characterization of the core human fecal metabolome is insufficient without exploring the influence of industrialization. Here, we show chemical differences along an industrialization gradient, where the degree of industrialization correlates with metabolomic changes. We identified differential metabolite features like leucyl-leucine dipeptides and urobilin as major metabolic correlates of these behavioral shifts. Our results indicate that industrialization significantly influences the human fecal metabolome, but diverse human lifestyles and behavior still maintain a core human fecal metabolome. This study represents the first characterization of the core human fecal metabolome through untargeted analyses of populations along an industrialization gradient.",

    "abstract": "Low barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) is a special type of hydrogen bond which occurs where two heteroatoms with similar pKa values share a single proton resulting in an unusually strong and short hydrogen bond. LBHBs in protein play important roles in enzyme catalysis and maintaining protein structural integrity but its other biochemical roles are unknown. Here we report a novel function of LBHB in selectively inducing tubulin protein degradation. A tubulin inhibitor, 3-(3-Phenoxybenzyl) amino-{beta}-carboline (PAC), promotes selective degradation of {beta}-tubulin heterodimers by binding to the colchicine site of {beta}-tubulin. Biochemical studies have revealed that PAC specifically destabilizes tubulin, making it prone to aggregation that then predisposes it to ubiquitinylation and then degradation. Structural activity analyses have indicated that the destabilization is mediated by a single hydrogen bond formed between the pyridine nitrogen of PAC and {beta}Glu198, which is identified as a LBHB. In contrast, another two tubulin inhibitors only forming normal hydrogen bonds with {beta}Glu198 exhibit no degradation effect. Thus, the LBHB accounts for the degradation. Most importantly, we screened for compounds capable of forming LBHB with {beta}Glu198 and demonstrated that BML284, a Wnt signaling activator, also promotes tubulin heterodimers degradation in a PAC-like manner as expected. Our study has identified a novel approach for designing tubulin degraders, providing a unique example of LBHB function and suggests that designing small molecules to form LBHBs with protein residues resulting in the highly specific degradation of a target protein could be a new strategy for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant protein glycosylation is a prominent cancer feature. While many tumour-associated glycoepitopes have been reported, advances in glycoanalytics continue to uncover new associations between glycoproteins and cancer. Guided by a comprehensive literature survey suggesting that oligomannosylation (Man5-9GlcNAc2, M5-M9) is a widespread albeit poorly studied glyco-signature in human cancers, we here re-visit a valuable compilation of nearly 500 LC-MS/MS N-glycomics datasets acquired across 11 human cancer types to systematically test for oligomannose-cancer associations. Firstly, our quantitative glycomics data obtained across 34 cancerous cell lines demonstrated that oligomannosylation, particularly the under-processed M7-M9, is a strong pan-cancer feature. We then showed cell surface expression of oligomannosidic epitopes in the promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cell line using concanavalin A-based flow cytometry. In keeping with literature, our quantitative glycomics data of tumour and matching control tissues and new MALDI-MS imaging data of tissue microarrays showed a strong cancer-associated elevation of oligomannosylation in both basal cell (p = 1.78 x 10-12) and squamous cell (p = 1.23 x 10-11) skin cancer and colorectal cancer (p = 8.0 x 10-4). The glycomics data also indicated that few cancer types including gastric and liver cancer exhibit unchanged or reduced oligomannose levels, observations also supported by literature and MALDI-MSI. Finally, data from cancer repositories indicated that three 1,2-mannosidases dictate oligomannose expression in cancer cells, and further suggested that deleterious mutations and reduced expression of MAN1A1 are key contributors to the cancer-associated oligomannose elevation. Collectively, these findings open hitherto unexplored avenues for the development of new cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

However, LOD is less useful for  continuous assays designed to discriminate between concentrations of an analyte--e.g., glucose monitoring in diabetes, where clinical care is guided by particular concentration ranges and thresholds. In such scenarios, it would be valuable to quantify discriminatory resolution--i.e., whether an assay can differentiate 1 pM from 10 pM-- but no such standardized metric currently exists. Here, we propose a useful solution, termed  resolution of molecular concentration (RMC). RMC offers a simple means for characterizing quantitative resolution and quickly comparing the quantitative performance of assays.

    "abstract": "The energetic economy of running benefits from tendon and other tissues that store and return elastic energy, thus saving muscles from costly mechanical work. The classic \"Spring-mass\" computational model successfully explains the forces, displacements and mechanical power of running, as the outcome of dynamical interactions between the body center of mass and a purely elastic spring for the leg. Conversely, the Spring-mass model does not include active muscles and cannot explain the metabolic energy cost of running. Here we add explicit actuation and dissipation to the Spring-mass model, resulting in substantial active (and thus costly) work for running on level ground and up or down slopes. Dissipation is modeled as modest energy losses (5% of total mechanical energy for running at 3 m {middle dot} s-1) from hysteresis and foot-ground collisions, that must be restored by active work each step. Even with substantial elastic energy return (59% of positive work, comparable to empirical observations), the active work could account for most of the metabolic cost of human running (about 68%, assuming human-like muscle efficiency). We also introduce a previously unappreciated energetic cost for rapid production of force, that helps explain the relatively smooth ground reaction forces of running, and why muscles might also actively perform negative work. Although elastic return is key to energy savings, there are still losses that require restorative muscle work, which can cost substantial energy during running.\n\nAuthor SummaryRunning is an energetically economical gait whereby the legs bounce like pogo sticks. Leg tendons act elastically to store and return energy to the body, thus saving the muscles from costly work with each running step. Although elasticity is known to save energy, it does not explain why running still requires considerable effort, and why the muscles still do any work at all. We use a simple computational model to demonstrate two possible reasons why. One is that small amounts of energy are lost when the leg collides with the ground and when the tendons are stretched, and muscles must restore that energy during steady running. A second reason is that muscles may perform work to avoid turning on and off rapidly, which may be even more energetically costly. The resulting muscle work, while small, may actually explain most of the energetic cost of running. Economy may be gained from elasticity, but running nonetheless requires muscles to do active work.",

    "abstract": "Cell state transitions or cell fate decision making processes, such as cell development and cell pathological transformation, are believed to be determined by the regulatory network of genes, which intimately depend on the structures of chromosomes in the cell nucleus. The high temporal resolution picture of how chromosome reorganizes its 3D structure during the cell state transitions is the key to understanding the mechanisms of these fundamental cellular processes. However, this picture is still challenging to acquire at present. Here, we studied the chromosome structural dynamics during the cell state transitions among the pluripotent embryonic stem cell (ESC), the terminally differentiated normal cell and the cancer cell using landscape-switching model implemented in the molecular dynamics simulation. We considered up to 6 transitions, including differentiation, reprogramming, cancer formation and reversion. We found that the pathways can merge at certain stages during the transitions for the two processes having the same destination as the ESC or the normal cell. Before reaching the merging point, the two pathways are cell-type-specific. The chromosomes at the merging points show high structural similarity to the ones at the final cell states in terms of the contact maps, TADs and compartments. The post-merging processes correspond to the adaption of the chromosome global shape geometry through the chromosome compaction without significantly disrupting the contact formation. On the other hand, our detailed analysis showed no merging point for the two cancer formation processes initialized from the ESC and the normal cell, implying that cancer progression is a complex process and may be associated with multiple pathways. Our results draw a complete molecular picture of cell development and cancer at the dynamical chromosome structural level, and help our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell fate decision making processes.",

    "abstract": "Ion channels conduct various ions across biological membranes to maintain the membrane potential, to transmit the electrical signals, and to elicit the subsequent cellular responses by the signaling ions. Ion channels differ in their capabilities to select and conduct ions, which can be studied by the patch-clamp recording method that compares the current traces responding to the test voltage elicited at different conditions. In these experiments, the current-voltage curves are usually fitted by a sigmoidal function containing the Boltzmann factor. This equation is quite successful in fitting the experimental data in many cases, but it also fails in several others. Regretfully, some useful information may be lost in these data, which otherwise can reveal the ion-permeation mechanisms. Here we present a generalized kinetic model that captures the essential features of the current-voltage relations and describes the simple mechanism of the ion permeation through different ion channels. We demonstrate that this model is capable to fit various types of the patch-clamp data and explain their ion-permeation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Finding the causative pathophysiological mechanisms for Parkinsons disease (PD) is important for developing therapeutic interventions. Until recently, it was believed that Lewy bodies (LBs), the hallmark of PD, are mostly composed of alpha-synuclein (-syn) fibrils. Recent results (Shahmoradian et al., Lewy pathology in Parkinsons disease consists of crowded organelles and lipid membranes, Nature Neuroscience 22 (2019) 1099-1109) demonstrated that the fibrillar form of -syn is lacking from LBs. Here we propose that this surprising observation can be explained by the catalytic activity of the fibrillar form of -syn. We assumed that -syn fibrils catalyze the formation of LBs, but do not become part of them. We developed a mathematical model based on this hypothesis. By using the developed model, we investigated the consequences of this hypothesis. In particular, the model suggests that the long incubation time of PD can be explained by a two-step aggregation process that leads to its development: (i) aggregation of monomeric -syn into -syn oligomers and fibrils and (ii) clustering of membranebound organelles, which may cause disruption of axonal trafficking and lead to neuron starvation and death. The model shows that decreasing the rate of destruction of -syn aggregates in somatic lysosomes accelerates the formation of LBs. Another consequence of the model is the prediction that removing -syn aggregates from the brain after the aggregation of membrane-bound organelles into LBs has started may not stop the progression of PD because LB formation is an autocatalytic process; hence, the formation of LBs will be catalyzed by aggregates of membrane-bound organelles even in the absence of -syn aggregates. The performed sensitivity study made it possible to establish the hierarchy of model parameters with respect to their effect on the formation of vesicle aggregates in the soma.",

Protection against a historical SARS-CoV-2 strain was observed across a 100-fold vaccine dose range and over a 200-day period. At 6 weeks or 9 months after vaccination, serum antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 strains with B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 spike proteins and conferred almost complete protection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts after challenge.

    "abstract": "In natural and agricultural ecosystems, survival and growth of plants depend substantially on microbes in the endosphere and rhizosphere. Although numerous studies have reported the presence of plant-growth promoting bacteria and fungi in below-ground biomes, it remains a major challenge to understand how sets of microbial species positively or negatively affect plants performance. By conducting a series of single- and dual-inoculation experiments of 13 endophytic and soil fungi targeting a Brassicaceae plant species, we here evaluated how microbial effects on plants depend on presence/absence of co-occurring microbes. The comparison of single- and dual-inoculation experiments showed that combinations of the fungal isolates with the highest plant-growth promoting effects in single inoculations did not yield highly positive impacts on plant performance traits (e.g., shoot dry weight). In contrast, pairs of fungi including small/moderate contributions to plants in single-inoculation contexts showed the greatest effects on plants among the 78 fungal pairs examined. These results on the offset and synergistic effects of pairs of microbes suggest that inoculation experiments of single microbial species/isolates can result in the overestimation or underestimation of microbial functions in multi-species contexts. Because keeping single-microbe systems in outdoor conditions is impractical, designing sets of microbes that can maximize performance of crop plants is an important step for the use of microbial functions in sustainable agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest form of human malaria, remains one of the major threats to human health in endemic regions. Its virulence is attributed to its ability to modify infected red blood cells (iRBC) to adhere to endothelial receptors by placing variable antigens known as PfEMP1 on the surface of the red cell. PfEMP1 expression on the red cell surface determines the cytoadhesive properties of the iRBCs and is implicated in severe manifestations of malaria. To evade antibody mediated responses the parasite undergoes continuous switches of expression between different PfEMP1 variants. Recently it became clear that in addition to antibody mediated responses, PfEMP1 triggers an innate immune response, however, the role of neutrophils, the most abundant white blood cells in the human circulation, in malaria remains elusive. Here we show that neutrophils recognize and kill blood stages of several P. falciparum isolates, and we identify neutrophil ICAM-1 and specific PfEMP1s implicated in cerebral malaria as the key molecules involved in this killing. Our data provide mechanistic insight into the interactions between neutrophils and iRBCs and demonstrate the important influence of PfEMP1 on the selective innate response to cerebral malaria.",

The results establish that, whereas RNA extension in standard transcription initiation proceeds through a scrunching mechanism, RNA extension in reiterative transcription initiation proceeds through a slippage mechanism, with slipping of RNA relative to DNA within a short RNA-DNA hybrid, and with extrusion of RNA from RNAP through an alternative RNA exit.",

We explored the effects of integrating two key processes of home-ranging arising from individual movement decisions: (i) memory-based resource use; and (ii) scent-based territoriality. Both mechanisms together led to the formation of exclusive, resource- and population density-dependent home-ranges, which were responsive to perturbations in the conspecific environment (i.e., removing individuals). Home-range patterns (size, size skewness and overlap) were primarily influenced by memory and scent decay rate parameters, demonstrating that home-ranging is ultimately a balance between an animals inherent exploratory tendency and its desire to avoid conspecifics. Model application to a population of feral cats demonstrated that general space use patterns could be approximated through simulation, and replication of finer-scale space use patterns is plausible with further model development. Our modelling framework provides a foundation for sophisticated theoretical models of space use in interacting animals.",

    "abstract": "Photopigments, consisting of an opsin protein bound to a light-sensitive chromophore, are at the centre of vertebrate vision. The vertebrate ancestor already possessed four cone opsin classes involved in colour perception during bright-light conditions, which are sensitive from the ultraviolet to the red-wavelengths of light. Teleosts experienced an extra round of whole genome duplication (3R) at their origin, and while most teleosts maintained only one long-wavelength-sensitive opsin gene (LWS1), the second ancestral copy (LWS2) persisted in characins and osteoglossomorphs. Following 3R, teleost opsins have continued to expand and diversify, which is thought to be a consequence of the different light environment fishes inhabit, from clear streams to the relative darkness of the deep-sea. Although many recent and a few ancestral opsin duplicates can be found, none predating the 3R were thought to exist. In this study we report on a second, previously unnoticed ancestral duplication of the red-sensitive opsin (LWS3), which predates the teleost-specific genome duplication and only persists in gobiid fishes. This is surprising, since it implies that LWS3 has been lost at least 19-20 times independently along the teleost phylogeny. Mining 109 teleost genomes we also uncover a third lineage, the elopomorphs, that maintained the LWS2 copy. We identify convergent amino acid changes that green-shift ancestral and recent LWS copies, leading to adaptive differentiation and the functional replacement of the original green-sensitive RH2 opsin. Retinal transcriptomes and in-situ hybridisation show that LWS3 is expressed to various extents in gobies and in the case of the whitebarred goby, Amblygobius phalaena, it occurs in a separate photoreceptor to LWS1. Our study highlights the importance of comparative studies to comprehend evolution of gene function.",

This serves to foster a greater understanding of the scientific method and science-based solutions generally. Apis mellifera (honeybees) are a well-established model for the study of learning and cognition and can serve as an engaging outreach system for this wider community. Here, we developed and implemented a protocol using well established honeybee conditioning protocols to safely study the effects of caffeine and dopamine on learning performance. Using this protocol, a group of high-school aged students as part of the Ryukyu Girls program demonstrated that caffeine, but not dopamine, significantly reduced the number of trials required for a successful conditioning response.

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphChronic inflammation underlies the onset, progression and associated pain of numerous diseases.(1) Current anti-inflammatory treatments administered systemically are associated with moderate-to-severe side effects, while locally administered drugs have short-lived efficacy, and neither approach successfully modifies the underlying causality of disease.(2) We report a new way to locally modulate inflammation by fusing the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO) to galectin-3 (Gal3). A general regulator of inflammation(3), IDO is immunosuppressive(4), catabolizing the essential amino acid tryptophan into kynurenine.(5) Recently we demonstrated that extracellular exogenous IDO regulates innate immune cell function(6), and envisioned delivering IDO into specific tissues would provide control of inflammation. However, proteins problematically diffuse away from local injection sites. Addressing this, we recently established that fusion to Gal3 anchors enzymes to tissues(7) via binding to extracellular glycans. Fusion protein IDO-Gal3 was retained in injected tissues and joints for up to a week or more, where it suppressed local inflammation in rodent models of endotoxin-induced inflammation, psoriasis, periodontal disease and osteoarthritis. Amelioration of local inflammation, disease progression and inflammatory pain were concomitant with homeostatic preservation of tissues without global immune suppression. Thus, IDO-Gal3 presents a new concept of anchoring immunomodulatory enzymes for robust control of focal inflammation in multiple disease settings.",

Such subgroups might include patients with a particular disease subtype, patients with a good (or poor) prognosis, or patients most (or least) likely to respond to a particular therapy. Diverse types of biomarkers have been proposed for assigning patients to subgroups. For example, DNA variants in tumors show promise as biomarkers; however, tumors exhibit considerable genomic heterogeneity. As an alternative, transcriptomic measurements reflect the downstream effects of genomic and epigenomic variations. However, high-throughput technologies generate thousands of measurements per patient, and complex dependencies exist among genes, so it may be infeasible to classify patients using traditional statistical models. Machine-learning classification algorithms can help with this problem. However, hundreds of classification algorithms exist--and most support diverse hyperparameters--so it is difficult for researchers to know which are optimal for gene-expression biomarkers. We performed a benchmark comparison, applying 50 classification algorithms to 50 gene-expression datasets (143 class variables). We evaluated algorithms that represent diverse machine-learning methodologies and have been implemented in general-purpose, open-source, machine-learning libraries. When available, we combined clinical predictors with gene-expression data. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of performing hyperparameter optimization and feature selection in nested cross-validation folds. Kernel- and ensemble-based algorithms consistently outperformed other types of classification algorithms; however, even the top-performing algorithms performed poorly in some cases. Hyperparameter optimization and feature selection typically improved predictive performance, and univariate feature-selection algorithms outperformed more sophisticated methods. Together, our findings illustrate that algorithm performance varies considerably when other factors are held constant and thus that algorithm selection is a critical step in biomarker studies.\n\nAuthor Summary",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSpinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene. The mutant ATXN2 protein with a polyglutamine tract is known to be toxic and contributes to the SCA2 pathogenesis.\n\nOBJECTIVEHere we tested the hypothesis that the mutant ATXN2 transcript with an expanded CAG repeat (expATXN2) is also toxic and contributes to SCA2 pathogenesis.\n\nMETHODSThe toxic effect of expATXN2 transcripts on SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells and primary mouse cortical neurons was evaluated by caspase 3/7 activity and nuclear condensation assay, respectively. RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed to identify RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that bind to expATXN2 RNA. Quantitative PCR was used to examine if rRNA processing is disrupted in SCA2 and Huntington disease (HD) human brain tissue.\n\nRESULTSexpATXN2 RNA induces neuronal cell death, and aberrantly interacts with RBPs involved in RNA metabolism. One of the RBPs, transducin {beta}-like protein 3 (TBL3), involved in rRNA processing, binds to both expATXN2 and expanded huntingtin (expHTT) RNA in vitro. rRNA processing is disrupted in both SCA2 and HD human brain tissue.\n\nCONCLUSIONThese findings provide the first evidence of a contributory role of expATXN2 transcripts in SCA2 pathogenesis, and further support the role expHTT transcripts in HD pathogenesis. The disruption of rRNA processing, mediated by aberrant interaction of RBPs with expATXN2 and expHTT transcripts, suggest a point of convergence in the pathogeneses of repeat expansion diseases with potential therapeutic implications.",

    "abstract": "A stressor can trigger adaptations that contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. Predator odor (TMT) exposure is an innate stressor that produces lasting adaptations. TMT exposure may activate metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGlu3), triggering excitatory corticolimbic adaptations that underlie behavioral changes. To evaluate functional involvement, the mGlu3 negative allosteric modulator (NAM, VU6010572; 3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered before TMT exposure in male, Long Evans rats. Two weeks after stressor, rats underwent behavioral testing (context re-exposure, zero maze and acoustic startle response) followed by RT-PCR gene expression in the insular cortex and BNST. During the TMT exposure, rats displayed stress-reactive behaviors that were not affected by the VU6010572. During the context re-exposure, prior TMT exposure and VU6010572 pretreatment both produced a hyperactive response. TMT exposure did not affect zero maze or ASR measures, but VU6010572 increased time spent in the open arms and habituation to ASR, indicating anxiolytic-like effects. In the insular cortex, TMT exposure resulted in excitatory adaptations as shown by increased expression of mGlu (Grm3, Grm5), NMDA (GriN2A, GriN2B, GriN2C, GriN3A, GriN3B) and AMPA (GriA3) receptor transcripts. Interestingly, mGlu3 signaling during stressor mediated GriN3B upregulation. Stress reactivity during TMT exposure was associated with Grm5, GriN2A, GriN2C, and GriA3 upregulation in the insular cortex and context re-exposure reactivity in the TMT/vehicle, but not the TMT/mGlu3 NAM group. In the BNST, GriN2A, GriN2B and GriN3B were increased by VU6010572, but TMT prevented these effects. These data demonstrate that mGlu3 signaling contributes to the lasting behavioral and molecular adaptations of predator odor stressor.",

    "abstract": "How does attention help to focus perceptual processing on the important parts of a visual scene? Although the neural and perceptual effects of attention were traditionally assumed to be sustained over time, the field is converging on a dramatically different view: that covert attention rhythmically switches between objects at 3-8 Hz. Here I demonstrate that ubiquitous analyses in this literature conflate rhythmic oscillations with aperiodic temporal structure. Using computational simulations, I show that the behavioral oscillations reported in this literature could reflect aperiodic dynamics in attention, rather than periodic rhythms. I then propose two analyses (one novel and one widely used in climate science) that discriminate between periodic and aperiodic structure in behavioral time-series. Finally, I apply these alternative analyses to published data-sets, and find no evidence for rhythms in attentional switching after accounting for aperiodic temporal structure. Attention shows rich temporal structure. The techniques presented here will help to clarify the periodic and aperiodic dynamics of perception and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Long-term stress has a profound impact on the human brain and cognition, and trait anxiety influences stress-induced adaptive and maladaptive effects. However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying long-term stress and trait anxiety interactions remain elusive. Here we investigated how long-term stress and trait anxiety interact to affect dynamic decisions during working-memory (WM) by altering functional brain network balance. In comparison to controls, male participants under long-term stress experienced higher psychological distress and exhibited faster evidence accumulation but had a lower decision-threshold during WM. This corresponded with hyper-activation in the anterior insula, less WM-related deactivation in the default-mode network, and stronger default-mode network decoupling with the frontoparietal network. Critically, high trait anxiety under long-term stress led to slower evidence accumulation through higher WM-related frontoparietal activity, and increased decoupling between the default-mode and frontoparietal networks. Our findings provide neurocognitive evidence for long-term stress and trait anxiety interactions on executive functions with (mal)adaptive changes.",

    "abstract": "It is estimated that in the human brain, short association fibres (SAF) represent more than half of the total white matter volume and their involvement has been implicated in a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This population of fibres, however, remains relatively understudied in the neuroimaging literature. Some of the challenges pertinent to the mapping of SAF include their variable anatomical course and proximity to the cortical mantle, leading to partial volume effects and potentially affecting streamline trajectory estimation. This work considers the impact of seeding and filtering strategies and choice of scanner, acquisition, data resampling to propose a whole-brain, surface-based short ([&le;]30-40 mm) SAF tractography approach. The framework is shown to produce longer streamlines with a predilection for connecting gyri as well as high cortical coverage. We further demonstrate that certain areas of subcortical white matter become disproportionally underrepresented in diffusion-weighted MRI data with lower angular and spatial resolution and weaker diffusion weighting; however, collecting data with stronger gradients than are usually available clinically has minimal impact, making our framework translatable to data collected on commonly available hardware. Finally, the tractograms are examined using voxel- and surfacebased measures of consistency, demonstrating moderate reliability, low repeatability and high between-subject variability, urging caution when streamline count-based analyses of SAF are performed.",

    "abstract": "Functional networks of cortical neurons contain highly interconnected hubs, forming a rich-club structure. However, the cell type composition within this distinct subnetwork and how it influences large-scale network dynamics is unclear. Using spontaneous activity recorded from hundreds of cortical neurons in orbitofrontal cortex of awake behaving mice and from organotypic cultures, we show that the rich-club is disproportionately composed of inhibitory neurons, and that inhibitory neurons within the rich-club are significantly more synchronous than other neurons. At the population level, neurons in the rich-club exert higher than expected Granger causal influence on overall population activity at a broad range of frequencies compared to other neurons. Finally, neuronal avalanche duration is significantly correlated with the fraction of rich neurons that participate in the avalanche. Together, these results suggest an unexpected role of a highly connected, inhibition-rich subnetwork in driving and sustaining activity in local cortical networks.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIt is widely believed that the relative abundance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits is roughly 4:1. This relative abundance has been widely used to construct numerous cortical network models. Here we show that contrary to this notion, a sub-network of highly connected hub neurons (rich-club) consists of a higher abundance of inhibitory neurons compared to that found in the entire network or the non-rich subnetwork. Inhibitory hub neurons contribute to higher synchrony within the rich club compared to the rest of the network. Strikingly, higher activation of the inhibition-dominated rich club strongly correlates with longer avalanches in cortical circuits. Our findings reveal how network topology combined with cell-type specificity orchestrates population wide activity in cortical microcircuits.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an infectious disease that has spread worldwide. Current treatments are limited in both availability and efficacy, such that improving our understanding of the factors that facilitate infection is urgently needed to more effectively treat infected individuals and to curb the pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated the significance of interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, integrin 5{beta}1, and human ACE2 to facilitate viral entry into host cells in vitro. We previously found that inhibition of integrin 5{beta}1 by the clinically validated small peptide ATN-161 inhibits these spike protein interactions and cell infection in vitro. In continuation with our previous findings, here we have further evaluated the therapeutic potential of ATN-161 on SARS-CoV-2 infection in k18-hACE2 transgenic (SARS-CoV-2 susceptible) mice in vivo. We discovered that treatment with single- or repeated intravenous doses of ATN-161 (1 mg/kg) within 48 hours after intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 lead to a reduction of lung viral load, viral immunofluorescence and improved lung histology in a majority of mice 72 hours post-infection. Furthermore, ATN-161 reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced increased expression of lung integrin 5 and v (an 5-related integrin that has also been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 interactions) as well as the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), further supporting the potential involvement of these integrins, and the anti-inflammatory potential of ATN-161, respectively, in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting integrin 5{beta}1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and supports the development of ATN-161 as a novel SARS-CoV-2 therapy.",

    "abstract": "Over one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several excellent vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies1,2. Here we report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines3,4. In the absence of vaccination antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response, and as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern that are comparable to or greater than neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 achieved by vaccination of naive individuals2,5-8. The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover, and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in variants of concern4,9. In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand dramatically after vaccination. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

In vitro, B.1.617.2 is 6-fold less sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies from recovered individuals, and 8-fold less sensitive to vaccine-elicited antibodies as compared to wild type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G.

B.1.617.2 spike pseudotyped viruses exhibited compromised sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD), in particular to the clinically approved bamlavinimab and imdevimab monoclonal antibodies. B.1.617.2 demonstrated higher replication efficiency in both airway organoid and human airway epithelial systems as compared to B.1.1.7, associated with B.1.617.2 spike being in a predominantly cleaved state compared to B.1.1.7.

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is supported by cellular machineries that ensure polypeptides fold to their native three-dimensional conformation with high fidelity whilst eliminating misfolded, aggregation-prone species. While protein aggregates can contribute to pathologies exemplified by Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, their abundance is normally minimised by molecular chaperones such as HSP70/90, which promote native folding and drive the recycling of aberrantly folded species. Cytoplasmic chaperones (e.g. HSP70/40) can resolve insoluble protein aggregates should the preventive mechanisms falter. However, it is unknown whether an analogous disaggregation system is needed and exists in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), where [~]30% of the proteome is synthesised. Here we show that the ER of a variety of mammalian cell types, including neurons, is endowed with the capability to resolve protein aggregates that accumulate upon expression of metastable proteins. Utilising a purpose-developed protein aggregation probing system with a sub-organellar resolution, we observed steady-state aggregate accumulation in the ER. Strikingly, pharmacological induction of ER stress did not augment aggregates but rather stimulated their clearance within hours. We found that this disaggregation activity was catalysed by the stress-responsive ER molecular chaperone - BiP. Its elimination abolished the disaggregation activity in cells. Further, we reconstructed the disaggregation-reaction in-vitro by a minimal system of ATP-fuelled BiP and its J-protein cofactor. These data reveal a hitherto unknown, non-redundant function of the ER stress response. Thus, our findings may facilitate the identification of aggregation-antagonising strategies and rationalising the age-dependent protein misfolding pathology.\n\nSummaryER stress induction activates a protein disaggregation machinery, powered by BiP - an abundant ER chaperone, revealed by a FLIM-based protein aggregation monitoring in live cells.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are thought to mediate the transport of proteins and RNAs involved in intercellular communication. Here, we show dynamic changes in the buoyant density and abundance of extracellular vesicles that are secreted by PC12 cells stimulated with nerve growth factor (NGF), N2A cells treated with retinoic acid to induce neural differentiation and mESCs differentiated into neuronal cells. EVs secreted from in vitro differentiated cells promote neural induction of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Cyclin D1 enriched within the EVs derived from differentiated neuronal cells contributes to this induction. EVs purified from cells overexpressing cyclin D1 are more potent in neural induction of mESC cells. Depletion of cyclin D1 from the EVs reduced the neural induction effect. Our results suggest that extracellular vesicles regulate neural development through sorting of cyclin D1.\n\nSummaryExtracellular vesicles (EVs) may mediate intercellular communication through the transfer of cargo molecules. Here, we report that cyclinD1 is sorted into EVs during neuronal differentiation and that these EVs help to promote the neural induction of mouse embryonic stem cells.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMixture effect on stand productivity is usually apprehended through a substitutive approach, whereby productivity in mixed stands is compared to productivity in monocultures, at equivalent stand density. This approach has proved that in many cases mixed stands perform better than monospecific forests, however, we do not yet have a solid theory about species behaviour in the mixture or even guidelines for combining species. The addition of a second tree species to an existing mono-specific stand has received much less consideration. Yet, this approach has the potential to separate the facilitation effect from the complementarity effect.\nC_LIO_LIWe compared the effect of tree species substitution vs. addition on the productivity of maritime pine and silver birch in a young tree diversity experiment implemented in 2008 in SW France.\nC_LIO_LISubstituting pines with birches to create two-species mixtures resulted in an increase of tree productivity at stand level beyond what was expected from monocultures (i.e., overyielding). In contrast, creating mixture through the addition of birches to pine stands had no effect on the maritime pine stand productivity (transgressive mixture effect not significant). This absence of effect is produced by two distinct density-dependence responses at an individual level.\nC_LIO_LIOur results allow clarifying the cases in which a mixed stand can be considered as an alternative to a monoculture of a productive species. In particular, the addition of a pioneer and soil low-demanding species during young developmental stages is a possibility to diversify the stand and potentially to increase ecosystem services without altering the productivity of the target species.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Environmental factors, such as elevated temperature, can have varying effects on hosts and their parasites, which can have consequences for disease outcomes. The individual direct effects of temperature must be disentangled to determine the net-effect in host-parasite relationships, yet few studies have determined the net-effects in a multi-host system. To address this gap, we experimentally manipulated temperature and parasite presence in the nests of two host species infested by parasitic blowflies (Protocalliphora sialia). We conducted a factorial experiment by increasing temperature (or not) and removing all parasites (or not) in the nests of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We then measured nestling morphometrics, blood loss, and survival and quantified parasite abundance. We predicted that if temperature had a direct effect on parasite fitness, then elevated temperature would cause similar directional effects on parasite abundance across host species. If temperature had a direct effect on hosts, and therefore an indirect effect on the parasite, parasite abundance would differ across host species. Heated swallow nests had fewer parasites compared to non-heated nests. In contrast, heated bluebird nests had more parasites compared to non-heated nests. The results of our study demonstrate that elevated temperature can have differential effects on host species, which can impact infestation susceptibility. Furthermore, changing climates could have complex net-effects on parasite fitness and host health across multi-host-parasite interactions.",

    "abstract": "Vegetation regulates land-atmosphere water and energy exchanges and is an essential component of land-surface models (LSMs). However, LSMs have been handicapped by assumptions that equate acclimated photosynthetic responses to environment with fast responses observable in the laboratory. These time scales can be distinguished by including specific representations of acclimation, but at the cost of further increasing parameter requirements. Here we develop an alternative approach based on optimality principles that predict the acclimation of carboxylation and electron-transport capacities, and a variable controlling the response of leaf-level carbon dioxide drawdown to vapour pressure deficit (VPD), to variations in growth conditions on a weekly to monthly time scale. In the \"P model\", an optimality-based light-use efficiency model for gross primary production (GPP) on this time scale, these acclimated responses are implicit. Here they are made explicit, allowing fast and slow response time-scales to be separated and GPP to be simulated at sub-daily timesteps. The resulting model mimics diurnal cycles of GPP recorded by eddy-covariance flux towers in a temperate grassland and boreal, temperate and tropical forests, with no parameter changes between biomes. Best performance is achieved when biochemical capacities are adjusted to match recent midday conditions. This model suggests a simple and parameter-sparse method to include both instantaneous and acclimated responses within an LSM framework, with many potential applications in weather, climate and carbon - cycle modelling.\n\nPlain Language SummaryVegetation regulates the exchanges of energy, water and carbon dioxide between the land and the atmosphere. Numerical climate models represent these processes, focusing mainly on their rapid variations in response to changes in the environment (including temperature and light) on timescales of seconds to hours. However, plants also adjust their physiology to environmental changes over longer periods within the season. Here we have adapted a simple model that formulates plant behaviour in terms of optimal trade-offs between different processes, so it simulates processes on both time scales. This model correctly reproduces the daily cycle of carbon dioxide uptake by plants, as recorded in different kinds of vegetation. We show that plants optimize their behaviour for midday conditions, when the light is greatest, and adjust to longer-term environmental variations on a timescale of about a week to a month. The model conveniently avoids the need to give specific, fixed values to physiological variables (such as photosynthetic capacity) for different types of plants. The optimality assumptions mean that the model gives equally good results in tropical, temperate and boreal forests, and in grasslands, using the same equations, and a very small number of input variables that are constant across the world.\n\nKey PointsO_LIOptimality theory is used to develop a simple model incorporating fast and acclimated responses of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance\nC_LIO_LIBiogeochemical photosynthetic capacities adjust to midday light conditions\nC_LIO_LIThe new model simulates gross primary production on sub-daily timesteps across a range of different vegetation types and climate\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The term \"destructive fishing\" appears in multiple international policy instruments intended to improve outcomes for marine biodiversity, coastal communities and sustainable fisheries. However, the meaning of \"destructive fishing\" is often vague, limiting effectiveness in policy. Therefore, in this study we systematically reviewed the use of \"destructive fishing\" in three record types: academic literature, media articles, and policy documents between 1976-2020. A more detailed analysis was performed on sub-sets of these records, considering the extent to which the term is characterised, geographic distribution of use, and specific impacts and practices associated with the term. We found that use of \"destructive fishing\" relative to the generic term  fisheries has increased since the 1990s. Records focused predominantly on fishing practices in South-eastern Asia, followed by Southern Asia and Europe. The term was characterised in detail in only 15% of records. Habitat damage and blast/poison fishing were the most associated ecological impacts and gear/practices, respectively. Bottom trawling and unspecified net fishing were regularly linked to destructive fishing. Importantly, the three record types use the term differently. Academic literature tends to specifically articulate the negative impacts, while media articles focus generally on associated gears/practices. Significant regional variation also exists in how the term is used and what phenomena it is applied to. This study provides evidence and recommendations to inform stakeholders in any future pursuit of a unified definition of \"destructive fishing\" to support more meaningful implementation of global sustainability goals.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenies summarize evolutionary information that is essential in the investigation of ecological and evolutionary causes of diversity patterns. They allow investigating hypotheses from trait evolution to the relationship between evolutionary diversity and ecosystem functioning. However, obtaining a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis can be difficult for some groups, especially those with a high number of species, that is the case for fishes, particularly tropical ones. The lack of species in phylogenetic hypotheses, called Darwinian shortfalls, can hinder ecological and evolutionary studies involving this group. To tackle this problem, we developed FishPhyloMaker, an R package that facilitates the generation of phylogenetic trees through a reliable and reproducible procedure, even for a large number of species. The package adopts well-known rules of insertion based on cladistic hierarchy, allowing its use by specialists and non-specialists in fish systematics. We tested the reliability of our algorithm in maintaining important properties of phylogenetic distances running a sensitivity analysis. We also exemplified the use of the FishPhyloMaker package by constructing complete phylogenies for fishes inhabiting the four richest freshwater ecoregions of the world. Furthermore, we proposed a new method to calculate Darwinian shortfalls and mapped this information for the major freshwater drainages of the world. FishPhyloMaker will expand the range of evolutionary and ecological questions that can be addressed using ray-finned fishes as study models, mainly in the field of community phylogenetics, by providing an easy and reliable way to obtain comprehensive phylogenies. Further, FishPhyloMaker presents the potential to be extended to other taxonomic groups that suffer from the same difficulty in the obtention of comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe provide the first automated procedure to check species names, construct phylogenetic trees and calculate Darwinian shortfalls for ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) by the R package FishPhyloMaker.\nC_LIO_LIThis package provides functions to assemble phylogenies through a fast, reliable, and reproducible method, allowing its use and replicability by specialists and non-specialists in fish systematics.\nC_LIO_LIThe package also provides an interactive procedure that gives more flexibility to the user when compared with other existing tools that construct phylogenetic trees for other highly speciose groups.\nC_LIO_LIThe package includes a new method to compute Darwinian shortfalls for ray-finned fishes, but the rationale of the provided algorithm can be extended in future studies to be used in other groups of organisms\nC_LI",

However, initial trial-and-error features that ultimately give rise to skilled, stereotypic movements, and the underlying neurobiological basis of flexibility in learning, to stereotypic movement in adult animals are still unclear. Knowledge obtained from addressing these questions is crucial to improve quality of life in patients affected by movement disorders.\n\nWe sought to determine if known kinematic parameters of skilled movement in humans could predict learning of motor efficiency in mice during the single pellet reaching and grasping assay. Mice were food restricted to increase motivation to reach for a high reward food pellet. Their attempts to retrieve the pellet were recorded for 10 minutes a day for continuous 4 days. Individual successful and failed reaches for each mouse were manually tracked using Tracker Motion Analysis Software to extract time series data and kinematic features. We found the number of peaks and time to maximum velocity were strong predictors of individual variation in failure and success, respectively. Overall, our approach validates the use of select kinematic features to describe fine motor skill acquisition in mice and establishes peaks and time to maximum velocity as predictive measure of natural variation in motion efficiency in mice. This manually curated dataset, and kinematic parameters would be useful in comparing with pose estimation generated from deep learning approaches.",

The number of publicly available region sets has increased dramatically, leading to challenges in data analysis.\n\nResultsWe propose a new method to represent genomic region sets as vectors, or embeddings, using an adapted word2vec approach. We compared our approach to two simpler methods based on interval unions or term frequency-inverse document frequency and evaluated the methods in three ways: First, by classifying the cell line, antibody, or tissue type of the region set; second, by assessing whether similarity among embeddings can reflect simulated random perturbations of genomic regions; and third, by testing robustness of the proposed representations to different signal thresholds for calling peaks. Our word2vec-based region set embeddings reduce dimensionality from more than a hundred thousand to 100 without significant loss in classification performance. The vector representation could identify cell line, antibody, and tissue type with over 90% accuracy. We also found that the vectors could quantitatively summarize simulated random perturbations to region sets and are more robust to subsampling the data derived from different peak calling thresholds. Our evaluations demonstrate that the vectors retain useful biological information in relatively lower-dimensional spaces. We propose that vector representation of region sets is a promising approach for efficient analysis of genomic region data.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/databio/regionset-embedding",

    "abstract": "Influenza is a serious global health threat that shows varying pathogenicity among different virus strains. Understanding similarities and differences among activated functional pathways in the host responses can help elucidate therapeutic targets responsible for pathogenesis. To compare the types and timing of functional modules activated in host cells by four influenza viruses of varying pathogenicity, we developed a new DYNAmic MOdule (DYNAMO) method that addresses the need to compare functional module utilization over time. This integrative approach overlays whole genome time series expression data onto an immune-specific functional network, and extracts conserved modules exhibiting either different temporal patterns or overall transcriptional activity. We identified a common core response to influenza virus infection that is temporally shifted for different viruses. We also identified differentially regulated functional modules that reveal unique elements of responses to different virus strains. Our work highlights the usefulness of combining time series gene expression data with a functional interaction map to capture temporal dynamics of the same cellular pathways under different conditions. Our results help elucidate conservation of the immune response both globally and at a granular level, and provide mechanistic insight into the differences in the host response to infection by influenza strains of varying pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "While glutathione (GSH) is known to regulate iron (Fe) deficiency response in plants, its involvement in modulating subcellular Fe homeostasis remained elusive. In this study, we report that the GSH depleted mutants, cad2-1 and pad2-1 displayed increased sensitivity to Fe deficiency with significant down-regulation of the vacuolar Fe exporters, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 and the chloroplast Fe importer, AtPIC1. Moreover, the pad2-1 mutant accumulated higher Fe content in vacuoles and lower in chloroplasts compared with Col-0 under Fe limited condition. Exogenous GSH treatment could enhance the chloroplast Fe content in Col-0 plants but failed to do so in the nramp3nramp4 double mutant demonstrating the role of GSH in modulating subcellular Fe homeostasis. Pharmacological experiments, mutant analysis and promoter assay revealed that this regulation involved transcriptional activation of the transporter genes by a GSH-GSNO module. The Fe responsive bHLH transcription factors (TFs), AtbHLH29, AtbHLH38 and AtbHLH101 were identified to interact with the promoters of these genes which were in turn activated via S-nitrosylation. Together, the present study delineates the role of GSH-GSNO module in regulating subcellular Fe homeostasis by transcriptional activation of the Fe transporters AtNRAMP3, AtNRAMP4 and AtPIC1 via S-nitrosylation of the bHLH TFs during Fe deficiency.\n\nSummary statementGlutathione regulates subcellular iron homeostasis under iron deficiency via GSNO dependent transcriptional activation of AtNRAMP3, AtNRAMP4 and AtPIC1 genes by S-nitrosylation of the iron responsive bHLH transcription factors, AtbHLH29, AtbHLH38 and AtbHLH101.",

    "abstract": "In humans and rats, aging is associated with a progressive deterioration of spatial learning and memory. These functional alterations are correlated with morphological and molecular changes in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus. Here, we assessed the age-related changes in the DNA methylation (DNAm) landscape in the rat hippocampus and assessed the correlation of spatial memory performance with hippocampal DNAm age in young (2.6 mo.) and old (26.6 mo.) rats.\n\nSpatial memory performance was assessed with a modified version of the Barnes maze test. In order to evaluate learning ability as well as spatial memory retention, we assessed the time spent (permanence) by animals in goal sector 1 (GS1) and 3 (GS3) when the escape box was removed. The rat pan-tissue clock was applied to DNA methylation profiles of hippocampal tissue. The bisulfite converted genomic DNA was analyzed by Illumina Infinium HorvathMammalMethylChip40. The Horvath Mammal Methyl Chip40 assay provides quantitative measurements of DNA methylation for 22528 CpG dinucleotides that map to the Rattus norvegicus UCSC 6.0 genome. An enrichment pathway analysis revealed that neuron fate commitment, brain development, and central nervous system development were processes whose underlying genes were enriched in positively methylated CpGs. In the old rat hippocampi, the methylation levels of CpGs proximal to transcription factors associated with genes Pax5, Lbx1, Nr2f2, Hnf1b, Zic1, Zic4, Hoxd9; Hoxd10, Gli3, Gsx1 and Lmx1b, and Nipbl showed a significant regression with spatial memory performance. Regression analysis of different memory performance indices with hippocampal DNAm age was significant when data from young and old rats were taken together. The above results suggest that age-related hypermethylation of certain gene families, like Zic and Gli, may play a causal role in the decline in spatial memory in old rats. Hippocampal DNAm age seems to be a reliable index of spatial memory performance in young and old rats.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disorder primarily affecting the elderly. An estimated 6.2 million Americans age 65 and older are suffering from Alzheimers dementia today. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for the clinical diagnosis of AD. In the meanwhile, medical researchers have identified 40 risk locus using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) information from Genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the past decades. However, existing studies usually treat MRI and GWAS separately. For instance, convolutional neural networks are often trained using MRI for AD diagnosis. GWAS and SNPs are frequently used to identify genomic traits. In this study, we propose a multi-modal AD diagnosis neural network that uses both MRIs and SNPs. The proposed method demonstrates a novel way to use GWAS findings by directly including SNPs in predictive models. We test the proposed methods on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. The evaluation results show that the proposed method improves the model performance on AD diagnosis and achieves 93.5% AUC and 96.1% AP, respectively, when patients have both MRI and SNP data. We believe this work brings exciting new insights to GWAS applications and sheds light on future research directions.",

    "abstract": "The subgenual (sgACC) and pregenual (pgACC) anterior cingulate are important afferents of the amygdala, with different cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and function. The sgACC is associated with arousal mechanisms linked to salient cues, while the pgACC is engaged in conflict decision-making, including in social contexts. After placing same-size, small volume tracer injections into sgACC and pgACC of the same hemisphere in male Macaques, we examined anterogradely labeled fiber distribution to understand how these different functional systems communicate in the main amygdala nuclei at both mesocopic and cellular levels. The sgACC has broad-based termination patterns. In contrast, the pgACC has a more restricted pattern which was always nested in sgACC terminals. Terminal overlap occurred in subregions of the accessory basal and basal nuclei, which we termed  hotspots. In triple-labeling confocal studies, the majority of randomly selected CAMKII (+) cells (putative amygdala glutamatergic neurons) in  hotspots received dual contacts from the sgACC and pgACC. The ratio of dual contacts occurred over a surprisingly narrow range, suggesting a consistent, tight balance of afferent contacts on postsynaptic neurons. Large boutons, which are associated with greater synaptic strength, were approximately 3 times more frequent on sgACC versus pgACC axon terminals in  hotspots, consistent with a fast  driver function. Together, the results reveal a nested interaction in which pgACC (conflict/social monitoring) terminals converge with the broader sgACC (salience) terminals at both the mesoscopic and cellular level. The pre-synaptic organization in  hotspots suggest that shifts in arousal states can rapidly, and flexibly influence decision-making functions in the amygdala.\n\nSignificance statementThe subgenual (sgACC) and perigenual cingulate (pgACC) have distinct structural and functional characteristics and are important afferent modulators of the amygdala. The sgACC is critical for arousal, while the pgACC mediates conflict-monitoring, including in social contexts. Using dual tracer injections in the same monkey, we found that sgACC inputs broadly project in the main amygdala nuclei, whereas pgACC inputs were more restricted and nested in zones containing sgACC terminals ( hotspots). The majority of CAMKII + (excitatory) amygdala neurons in  hotspots received converging contacts, which were tightly balanced. pgACC and sgACC afferent streams are therefore highly interdependent in these specific amygdala subregions, permitting  internal arousal states to rapidly shape responses of amygdala neurons involved in conflict and social monitoring networks.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging has led to an increased demand for standardized data processing workflows. Within the ENIGMA consortium, we developed HALFpipe (Harmonized AnaLysis of Functional MRI pipeline), an open-source, containerized, user-friendly tool that facilitates reproducible analysis of task-based and resting-state fMRI data through uniform application of preprocessing, quality assessment, single-subject feature extraction, and group-level statistics. It provides state-of-the-art preprocessing using fMRIPrep without the requirement for input data in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format. HALFpipe extends the functionality of fMRIPrep with additional preprocessing steps, which include spatial smoothing, grand mean scaling, temporal filtering, and confound regression. HALFpipe generates an interactive quality assessment (QA) webpage to assess the quality of key preprocessing outputs and raw data in general. HALFpipe features myriad post-processing functions at the individual subject level, including calculation of task-based activation, seed-based connectivity, network-template (or dual) regression, atlas-based functional connectivity matrices, regional homogeneity (ReHo), and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF), offering support to evaluate a combinatorial number of features or preprocessing settings in one run. Finally, flexible factorial models can be defined for mixed-effects regression analysis at the group level, including multiple comparison correction. Here, we introduce the theoretical framework in which HALFpipe was developed, and present an overview of the main functions of the pipeline. HALFpipe offers the scientific community a major advance toward addressing the reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging, providing a workflow that encompasses preprocessing, post-processing, and QA of fMRI data, while broadening core principles of data analysis for producing reproducible results.

    "abstract": "CD33 is an immunomodulatory receptor expressed on microglia and genetically linked to Alzheimers disease (AD) susceptibility. While antibodies targeting CD33 have entered clinical trials to treat neurodegeneration, it is unknown whether the glycan-binding properties of CD33 can be exploited to modulate microglia. Here, we use liposomes that multivalently display glycan ligands of CD33 (CD33L liposomes) to engage CD33. We find that CD33L liposomes increase phagocytosis of cultured monocytic cells and microglia in a CD33-dependent manner. Enhanced phagocytosis strongly correlates with loss of CD33 from the cell surface and internalization of liposomes. Increased phagocytosis by treatment with CD33L liposomes is dependent on a key intracellular signaling motif on CD33 as well as the glycan-binding ability of CD33. These effects are specific to trans engagement of CD33 by CD33L liposomes, as cis engagement through insertion of lipid-linked CD33L into cells produces the opposite effect on phagocytosis. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of CD33L liposomes in mice enhances phagocytosis of microglia in a CD33-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that multivalent engagement of CD33 with glycan ligands can modulate microglial cell function.",

Here, we monitored osteoblast-immune cell interactions in bone, a tissue which is particularly difficult to in vivo image in tetrapod species. Ablation of individual osteoblasts leads to recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages in varying numbers, depending on the extent of the initial insult, and initiates generation of cathepsinK+ osteoclasts from macrophages. Induced osteoblast death triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, which are needed for successful macrophage recruitment. Excess glucocorticoid signaling as it occurs during the stress response inhibits macrophage recruitment, maximum speed and changes the macrophages phenotype. While osteoblast loss is compensated for within a day by contribution of committed osteoblasts, macrophages continue to populate the region. Their presence is required for osteoblasts to fill the lesion site. Our model enables visualization of homeostatic bone repair after microlesions at single cell resolution and demonstrates a pro-osteogenic function of tissue-resident macrophages in non-mammalian vertebrates.\n\nSummary statementLaser-mediated osteoblast ablation induces recruitment of tissue-resident macrophages by a release of reactive oxygen species. The presence of macrophages is required for osteoblasts to repopulate the lesion site and can be modulated by glucocorticoids.",

By selecting same-gene isoforms between these clusters, we subsequently detect and characterize genes with co-differential isoform usage (coDIU) across neural cell types.

    "abstract": "AbstractPerception or imagination requires top-down signals from high-level cortex to primary visual cortex (V1) to reconstruct or simulate the representations bottom-up stimulated by the seen images. Interestingly, top-down signals in V1 have lower spatial resolution than bottom-up representations. It is unclear why the brain uses low-resolution signals to reconstruct or simulate high-resolution representations. By modeling the top-down pathway of the visual system using the decoder of variational auto-encoder (VAE), we reveal that low-resolution top-down signals can better reconstruct or simulate the information contained in the sparse activities of V1 simple cells, which facilitates perception and imagination. This advantage of low-resolution generation is related to facilitating high-level cortex to form geometry-respecting representations observed in experiments. Moreover, our finding inspires a simple artificial- intelligence (AI) technique to significantly improve the generation quality and diversity of sketches, a style of drawings made of thin lines. Specifically, instead of directly using original sketches, we use blurred sketches to train VAE or GAN (generative adversarial network), and then infer the thin-line sketches from the VAE- or GAN- generated blurred sketches. Collectively, our work suggests that low-resolution top-down generation is a strategy the brain uses to improve visual perception and imagination, and advances sketch-generation AI techniques.",

    "abstract": "Post-fabrication formation of a proper vasculature remains an unresolved challenge in bioprinting. Established strategies focus on the supply of the fabricated structure with nutrients and oxygen and either rely on the mere formation of a channel system using fugitive inks, or additionally use mature endothelial cells and/or peri-endothelial cells such as smooth muscle cells for the formation of blood vessels in vitro. Functional vessels, however, exhibit a hierarchical organization and multilayered wall structure that is important for their function. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesodermal progenitor cells (hiMPCs) have been shown to possess the capacity to form blood vessels in vitro, but have so far not been assessed for their applicability in bioprinting processes. Here, we demonstrate that hiMPCs, after formulation into an alginate / collagen type 1 bioink and subsequent extrusion, retain their ability to give rise to the formation of complex vessels that display a hierarchical network in a process that mimicks the embryonic steps of vessel formation by vasculogenesis. Histological evaluations at different time points of extrusion revealed initial formation of spheres, followed by lumen formation and further structural maturation as evidenced by building a multilayered vessel wall and a vascular network. These findings are supported by immunostainings for endothelial and peri-endothelial cell markers as well as electron microscopic analyses at the ultrastructural level. Moreover, capillary-like vessel structures deposited a basement membrane-like matrix structure at the basal side between the vessel wall and the alginate-collagen matrix. These results evidence the applicability and great potential of hiMPCs for the bioprinting of vascular structures mimicking the basic morphogenetic steps of de novo vessel formation during embryogenesis.",
