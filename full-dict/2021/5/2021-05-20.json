    "abstract": "Plant diversity and plant-related ecosystem functions have been in focus in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning studies. However, in this context, biotic interactions with mycorrhizal fungi have been understudied although they are crucial for plant-resource acquisition. We investigated the effects of tree species richness, tree mycorrhizal type on arbuscular (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities. We aimed to understand how dissimilarities in taxa composition and beta-diversity are related to target trees and neighbours of the same/different mycorrhizal type. We sampled a tree experiment with saplings ([~]7 years old), where tree species richness (monocultures, 2-species, and 4-species mixtures) and mycorrhizal type were manipulated. AMF and EMF richness significantly increased with increasing tree species richness. AMF richness of mixture plots resembled that of the sum of the respective monocultures, whereas EMF richness of mixture plots was lower compared to the sum of the respective monocultures. Specialisation scores revealed significantly more specialised AMF than EMF suggesting that, in contrast to previous studies, AMF were more specialised, whereas EMF were not. We further found that AMF communities were little driven by the surrounding trees, whereas EMF communities were. Our study revealed the drivers of mycorrhizal fungal communities and further highlights the distinct strategies of AMF and EMF.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how gene flow influences adaptive divergence is important for predicting adaptive responses. Theoretical studies suggest that when gene flow is high, clustering of adaptive genes in fewer genomic regions would protect adaptive alleles from among-population recombination and thus be selected for, but few studies have tested this hypothesis with empirical data. Here, we used RADseq to generate genomic data for six fish species with contrasting life histories from six reaches of the Upper Mississippi River System, USA. We then conducted genome scans for genomic islands of divergence to examine the distribution of adaptive loci and investigated whether these loci were found in inversions. We found that gene flow varied among species, and adaptive loci were clustered more tightly in species with higher gene flow. For example, the two species with the highest overall FST (0.03 - 0.07) and therefore lowest gene flow showed little evidence of clusters of adaptive loci, with adaptive loci spread uniformly across the genome. In contrast, nearly all adaptive loci in the species with the lowest FST (0.0004) were found in a single large putative inversion. Two other species with intermediate gene flow (FST ~ 0.004) also showed clustered genomic architectures, with most islands of divergence clustered on a few chromosomes. These results provide important empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that increasingly clustered architectures of local adaptation are associated with high gene flow. Our study utilized a unique system with species spanning a large gradient of life histories to highlight the importance of gene flow in shaping adaptive divergence.",

Conventional C. elegans assays often require a large sample size with frequent manipulations, rendering them labor-intensive.

Thus, most assays are carried out manually, where logging and digitizing experimental data can be as time-consuming as picking and scoring worms. Here we report the development of CeAid, C. elegans Application for inputting data, which significantly expedites the data entry process, utilizing swiping gestures and a voice recognition algorithm for logging data using a standard smartphone or Android device. This modular platform can also be adapted for a wide range of assays where recording data is laborious, even beyond worm research.",

    "abstract": "Extra or missing chromosomes--a phenomenon termed aneuploidy--frequently arises during human meiosis and embryonic mitosis and is the leading cause of pregnancy loss, including in the context of in vitro fertilization (IVF). While meiotic aneuploidies affect all cells and are deleterious, mitotic errors generate mosaicism, which may be compatible with healthy live birth. Large-scale abnormalities such as triploidy and haploidy also contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, but remain hidden from standard sequencing-based approaches to preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-A). The ability to reliably distinguish meiotic and mitotic aneuploidies, as well as abnormalities in genome-wide ploidy may thus prove valuable for enhancing IVF outcomes. Here, we describe a statistical method for distinguishing these forms of aneuploidy based on analysis of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data, which is the current standard in the field. Our approach overcomes the sparse nature of the data by leveraging allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) measured in a population reference panel. The method, which we term LD-informed PGT-A (LD-PGTA), retains high accuracy down to coverage as low as 0.05x and at higher coverage can also distinguish between meiosis I and meiosis II errors based on signatures spanning the centromeres. LD-PGTA provides fundamental insight into the origins of human chromosome abnormalities, as well as a practical tool with the potential to improve genetic testing during IVF.\n\nSignificance StatementWhole chromosome gains and losses--termed aneuploidies--are the leading cause of human pregnancy loss and congenital disorders. Recent work has demonstrated that in addition to harmful meiotic aneuploidies, mitotic aneuploidies (which lead to mosaic embryos harboring cells with different numbers of chromosomes) may also be common in preimplantation embryos but potentially compatible with healthy birth. Here we developed and tested a method for distinguishing these forms of aneuploidy using genetic testing data from 8154 IVF embryos. We re-classified embryos based on signatures of meiotic and mitotic error, while also revealing lethal forms of chromosome abnormality that were hidden to existing approaches. Our method complements standard protocols for preimplantation and prenatal genetic testing, while offering insight into the biology of early development.",

    "abstract": "Experiments with biological samples require precise control of environmental conditions. In our work we use zebrafish (Danio rerio) to understand the neurobiology of sleep, which requires precise control of temperature and lighting. Like many labs, lighting and temperature in the animal facility are centrally controlled in the building. During behavioral experiments and microscopy sessions, we use custom-built heating systems and perform occasional manual checks of conditions. However, without a system to precisely record conditions, gradual changes in temperature can go unnoticed for a long time, and temporary failures may be missed entirely. Here we present the design and characterization of affordable open-source tools to record temperature and light conditions during animal experiments using an Arduino microcontroller or a Raspberry Pi compact computer. The waterproof temperature sensor has high stability over 50 days of recording and is precise to 0.1{degrees}C. The Arduino device can be used through a common serial port interface for which we present code in Python and MATLAB. The Raspberry Pi version can be accessed through a web interface, for which we provide an installation guide. We use the device to record and review temperature and lighting conditions in two zebrafish animal facilities. We use our platform to add a water heating system to maintain temperature at 28{degrees}C during in vivo light-sheet imaging of larval zebrafish. We show that a change in temperature from 28{degrees}C to 32{degrees}C affects resting heart rate of the animal, highlighting the importance of maintaining and recording conditions. The protocols presented here do not require advanced engineering, fabrication, or software skills, and provide an approach to accurately record and report experimental conditions.",

By employing physical entanglements13 of protein chains and force-induced protein unfolding,14,15 here we report the engineering of a highly tough and stiff protein hydrogel to mimic articular cartilage. By crosslinking an engineered artificial elastomeric protein from its unfolded state, we introduced chain entanglement into the hydrogel network. Upon renaturation, the entangled protein chain network and forced protein unfolding entailed this single network protein hydrogel with superb mechanical properties in both tensile and compression tests, showing a Youngs modulus of [~]0.7 MPa and toughness of 250 kJ/m3 in tensile testing; and [~]1.7 MPa in compressive modulus and toughness of 3.2 MJ/m3. The energy dissipation in both tensile and compression tests is reversible and the hydrogel can recovery its mechanical properties rapidly. Moreover, this hydrogel can withstand a compression stress of >60 MPa without failure, amongst the highest compressive strength achieved by a hydrogel. These properties are comparable to those of articular cartilage, making this protein hydrogel a novel cartilage-mimetic biomaterial. Our study opened up a new potential avenue towards engineering protein hydrogel-based substitute for articular cartilage, and may also help develop protein biomaterials with superb mechanical properties for applications in soft actuators and robotics.",

Pathways are useful to study as their activities are frequently more directly related to the behavior of the cell than their components. Traditional pathway analysis gives significance to differences in the pathway components concentrations between sample groups. Here we instead advocate a singular value decomposition-based method for estimating individual samples pathway activities that allow us to investigate more advanced statistical models. Specifically, we investigate the pathway activities association with patients survival time based on the transcription profiles of the METABRIC dataset. Our implementation shows that pathway activities are better prognostic markers for survival time in METABRIC than the individual transcripts. We also demonstrate that we can regress out the effect of individual pathways on other pathways, which allows us to estimate the other pathways residual pathway activity on survival.",

Given that cell size in a population can vary considerably, for the protein gradients to work properly they often have to be scaled to the size of the cell. Here we examine a model of protein gradient formation within a cell that relies on cytoplasmic diffusion and cortical transport of proteins toward a cell pole. We show that the shape of the protein gradient is determined solely by the cell geometry. Furthermore, we show that the length scale over which the protein concentration in the gradient varies is determined by the linear dimensions of the cell, independent of the diffusion constant or the transport speed. This gradient provides scale-invariant positional information within a cell, which can be used for assembly of intracellular structures whose size is scaled to the linear dimensions of the cell, as was recently reported for the cytokinetic ring and actin cables in budding yeast cells.",

Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are an emerging class of quantum magnetic sensors with a demonstrated sensitivity at the 1 fT/{surd}Hz level, capable of cortical action current detection. But OPMs were ostensibly constrained to low bandwidth therefore precluding their use in peripheral nerve electrodiagnosis. With careful OPM bandwidth characterization, we hypothesized OPMs may also detect compound action current signatures consistent with both Sensory Nerve Action Potential (SNAP) and the Hoffmann Reflex (H-Reflex). In as much, our work confirms OPMs enabled with expanded bandwidth can detect the magnetic signature of both the SNAP and H-Reflex. Taken together, OPMs now show potential as an emerging electrodiagnostic tool.",

    "abstract": "Chronically implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide amazing opportunities to those living with disability and for the treatment of chronic disorders of the nervous system. However, this potential has yet to be fully realized in part due to the lack of stability in measured signals over time. Signal disruption stems from multiple sources including mechanical failure of the interface, changes in neuron health, and glial encapsulation of the electrodes that alter the impedance. In this study we present an algorithmic solution to the problem of long-term signal disruption in chronically implanted neural interfaces. Our approach utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN), based on the original Unsupervised Image to Image Translation (UNIT) algorithm, which learns how to recover degraded signals back to their analogous non-disrupted (\"clean\") exemplars measured at the time of implant. We demonstrate that this approach can reliably recover simulated signals in two types of commonly used neural interfaces: multi-electrode arrays (MEA), and electrocorticography (ECoG). To test the accuracy of signal recovery we employ a common BCI paradigm wherein a classification algorithm (neural decoder) is trained on the starting (non-disrupted) set of signals. Performance of the decoder demonstrates expected failure over time as the signal disruption accumulates. In simulated MEA experiments, our approach recovers decoder accuracy to >90% when as many as 13/ 32 channels are lost, or as many as 28/32 channels have their neural responses altered. In simulated ECoG experiments, our approach shows stabilization of the neural decoder indefinitely with decoder accuracies >95% over simulated lifetimes of over 1 year. Our results suggest that these types of neural networks can provide a useful tool to improve the long-term utility of chronically implanted neural interfaces.",

    "abstract": "PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a very short-lived protein that is required for the removal of damaged mitochondria through Parkin translocation and mitophagy. Because the short half-life of PINK1 limits its ability to be trafficked into neurites, local translation is required for this mitophagy pathway to be active far from the soma. The Pink1 transcript is associated with and cotransported with neuronal mitochondria. In concert with translation, the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Synaptojanin 2 binding protein (SYNJ2BP) and Synaptojanin 2 (SYNJ2) are required for tethering Pink1 mRNA to mitochondria via an RNA-binding domain in SYNJ2. This neuron-specific adaptation for local translation of PINK1 provides distal mitochondria with a continuous supply of PINK1 for activation of mitophagy.",

    "abstract": "Strong inhibitory synaptic gating of dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs), attributed largely to fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs), is essential to maintain sparse network activity needed for dentate dependent behaviors. However, the contribution of PV-INs to basal and input driven sustained synaptic inhibition in GCs and semilunar granule cells (SGCs), a sparse morphologically distinct dentate projection neuron subtype are currently unknown. In studies conducted in hippocampal slices from mice, we find that although basal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) are more frequent in SGCs and optical activation of PV-INs elicited IPSCs in both GCs and SGCs, optical suppression of PV-INs failed to reduce IPSC frequency in either cell type. Amplitude and kinetics of IPSCs evoked by perforant path activation were not different between GCs and SGCs. However, the robust increase in sustained polysynaptic IPSCs elicited by paired afferent stimulation was lower in SGCs than in simultaneously recorded GCs. Optical suppression of PV-IN selectively reduced sustained IPSCs in SGCs but not in GCs. These results demonstrate that PV-INs, while contributing minimally to basal synaptic inhibition in both GCs and SGCs in slices, mediate sustained feedback inhibition selectively in SGCs. The temporally selective blunting of activity-driven sustained inhibitory gating of SGCs could support their preferential and persistent recruitment during behavioral tasks.\n\nSignificance StatementOur study identifies that feedback inhibitory regulation of dentate semilunar granule cells, a sparse and functionally distinct class of projection neurons, differs from that of the classical projection neurons, granule cells. Notably, we demonstrate relatively lower activity dependent increase in sustained feedback inhibitory synaptic inputs to semilunar granule cells when compared to granule cells which would facilitate their persistent activity and preferential recruitment as part of memory ensembles. Since dentate granule cell activity levels during memory processing are heavily shaped by basal and feedback inhibition, the fundamental differences in basal and evoked sustained inhibition between semilunar granule cells and granule cells characterized here provide a framework to reorganize current understanding of the dentate circuit processing.",

    "abstract": "Although targeted inhibition of the MAPK pathway has achieved remarkable patient responses in many cancers with MAPK hyperactivation, the development of resistance has remained a critical challenge. Besides genomic resistance mechanisms, adaptive tumor response also underlies the resistance to targeted MAPK inhibitors. It is being increasingly appreciated that such bypass mechanisms often lead to the activation of many pro-survival kinases, which complicates the rational design of combination therapies. Here we performed global tyrosine phosphoproteomic (pTyr) analyses and demonstrated that targeted inhibition of MAPK signaling in melanoma cells leads to a profound remodeling of the pTyr proteome. Intriguingly, many of these kinases contain a cholesterol binding motif, suggesting that altered cholesterol metabolism might drive, in a coordinated fashion, the activation of these kinases. Indeed, we found a dramatic accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in melanoma cells (with BRAFV600E mutations) and non-small cell lung cancer cells (with KRASG12C mutations) treated with MAPK and KRASG12C inhibitors, respectively. Importantly, depletion of cholesterol not only prevented the MAPK inhibition-induced feedback activation of pTyr singling but also enhanced the cytotoxic effects of MAPK inhibitors, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings provide the evidence suggesting that cholesterol functions as a master regulator of the tumor adaptive response to targeted MAPK inhibitors. These results also suggest that MAPK inhibitors could be combined with cholesterol-lowering agents to achieve a more complete and durable response in tumors with hyperactive MAPK signaling.",

This is mainly because rhodamines exist in a dynamic equilibrium between a fluorescent zwitterion and a non-fluorescent but cell-permeable spirocyclic form. Different imaging applications require different positions of this dynamic equilibrium, which poses a challenge for the design of suitable probes. We describe here how the conversion of the ortho-carboxy moiety of a given rhodamine into substituted acyl benzenesulfonamides and alkylamides permits the systematic tuning of the equilibrium of spirocyclization with unprecedented accuracy and over a large range. This allows to transform the same rhodamine into either a highly fluorogenic and cell-permeable probe for live-cell stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, or into a spontaneously blinking dye for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). We used this approach to generate differently colored probes optimized for different labeling systems and imaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Non-canonical autophagy is a key cellular pathway in immunity, cancer and neurodegeneration, characterised by Conjugation of ATG8 to endolysosomal Single-Membranes (CASM). CASM is activated by engulfment (endocytosis, phagocytosis), agonists (STING, TRPML1) and infection (influenza), dependent on the ATG16L1 WD40-domain, and specifically K490. However, the factor(s) associated with non-canonical ATG16L1 recruitment, and CASM induction, remain unknown. Here, we investigate a role for V-ATPase during non-canonical autophagy. We report that increased V0-V1 engagement is associated with, and sufficient for, CASM activation. Upon V0-V1 binding, V-ATPase directly recruits ATG16L1, via K490, during LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), STING- and drug-induced CASM, indicating a common mechanism. Furthermore, during LAP, key molecular players, including NADPH oxidase/ROS, converge on V-ATPase. Finally, we show that LAP is sensitive to Salmonella SopF, which disrupts the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis, and provide evidence that CASM contributes to the Salmonella host response. Together, these data identify V-ATPase as a universal regulator of CASM, and indicate that SopF evolved in part to evade non-canonical autophagy.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin conformation capture-related methods such as Hi-C have improved our understanding of nuclear architecture and organization in recent years. However, reconstruction of nuclear architecture from single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data is challenging due to limited information of DNA contacts obtained from a single cell. We have previously developed the Recurrence Plot-Based Reconstruction (RPR) method for reconstructing three dimensional (3D) genomic structure from Hi-C data of single haploid cells (1) and diploid cells (2). This algorithm is based on a recurrence plot, a tool of nonlinear time-series analysis for visualizing patterns within a time series (3, 4), and enables the reconstruction of a unique 3D chromosome architecture even from low-coverage DNA contact information. Here we used the RPR method to analyzing published scHi-C data of diploid cells derived from early-stage F1 hybrid embryos (5) as a proof-of-concept for understanding of global developmental changes in chromosomal architecture of early stage embryos. We found that paternal and maternal chromosomes become gradually intermingled from 1 cell to 64 cell stage, and that discrete chromosome territories are largely established between 8 cell and 64 cell stages. We also observed Rabl-like polarization of chromosomes from the 2-to 8-cell stages, but this polarization becomes mostly dissolved by the 64-cell stage. Rabl-like chromosome polarization precedes rod-like extension and parallel alignment of chromosomes, implicating the role of Rabl-like polarization in effective mixing of chromosomes before establishing chromosome territories. We also found cell-to-cell variability in chromatin configuration. A combination of scHi-C and RPR analyses can depict features of the 3D chromatin architecture of individual cells at different developmental stages during early embryogenesis.",

Despite abundant transcriptome data for most developmental stages of the three main human-infective schistosome species, i.e. Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum and S. haematobium, the transcriptomic profiles of developing eggs remain largely unexplored. In this study, we performed RNAseq of S. mansoni eggs laid in vitro during early and late embryogenesis (days 1-3 and 3-6 post-oviposition, respectively). Analysis of the transcriptomes identified hundreds of up-regulated genes during the later stage, including venom allergen-like (VAL) proteins, well-established host immunomodulators, and genes involved in organogenesis of the miracidium larva. In addition, the transcriptomes of the in vitro laid eggs were compared with existing publicly available RNA-seq dataset from S. mansoni eggs collected from the livers of murine hosts. Analysis of enriched GO terms and pathway annotations revealed cell division and protein synthesis processes associated with early embryogenesis, whereas cellular metabolic processes, microtubule-based movement, and microtubule cytoskeleton organization were found enriched in the later developmental time point. This is the first transcriptomic analysis of S. mansoni embryonic development, and will facilitate our understanding of infection pathogenesis, miracidia development and life cycle progression of schistosomes.",

The retina is one of the first brain regions to accommodate microglia. In zebrafish, embryonic microglial precursors use intraocular hyaloid blood vessels as a pathway to migrate into the optic cup via the choroid fissure. Once retinal progenitor cells exit the cell cycle, microglial precursors associated with hyaloid blood vessels start to infiltrate the retina preferentially through neurogenic regions, suggesting that colonization of retinal tissue depends upon the neurogenic state. Along with blood vessels and retinal neurogenesis, IL34 also participates in microglial precursor colonization of the retina.

To achieve this objective, molecular approaches, such as the use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms are key. This study develops a multi-primer metabarcoding approach and explores its suitability for the screening of the most common trophic interactions of two predatory species of arthropod with contrasted morphology, Rhagonycha fulva (Coleoptera: Cantharidae) and Anthocoris nemoralis (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) collected in an organic peach crop. To save time and cost in this metabarcoding approach, we first evaluated the effect of two different predator-pool sizes (10 and 23 individuals of the same species), as well as the performance of using one or two primer pairs in the same library. Our results show that the analysis of 23 individuals together with the use of two primer pairs in the same library optimizes the HTS analysis. With these best-performing conditions, we analyzed whole bodies of field-collected predators as well as the washing solutions used to clean the insect bodies. Results showed that we were able to identify both, gut content (i.e. diet) as well as external pollen load (i.e. on the insects body), respectively. This study also demonstrates the need of washing predatory insects prior to HTS analysis when the target species have a considerable size and hairy structures. This metabarcoding approach has a high potential for the study of trophic links in agriculture, revealing both expected and unexpected trophic relationships.",

Supposedly \"incompatible\" fusions often establish viable heterokaryotic cells and mosaic mycelia, where nuclei can engage in fusion or transfer of genetic material. The molecular machinery of autophagy has a protective function against destruction of \"incompatible\" heterokaryons.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest an autophagy-mediated trade-off between parasexual interactions for genetic exchange and allorecognition systems possibly for mycelial protection from parasitic elements. Our study reveals unexpected capacity for heterokaryosis in V. dahliae and suggests, therefore, important roles of parasexuality in the evolution of asexual fungi.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sortilin is a receptor for neuronal uptake of apolipoprotein E. Sortilin-dependent uptake of lipidated apoE promotes conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into neuromodulators that induce anti-inflammatory gene expression in the brain. This neuroprotective pathway works with apoE3 but is lost with apoE4, the main risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Here, we elucidated steps in cellular handling of lipids through sortilin, and why they are disrupted by apoE4. Combining unbiased proteome screens with analyses in mouse models, we uncover interaction of sortilin with fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) 7, the intracellular carrier for PUFA in the brain. In the presence of apoE3, sortilin promotes functional expression of FABP7 and its ability to elicit lipid-dependent gene transcription. By contrast, apoE4 binding blocks sortilin sorting, causing catabolism of FABP7 and impairing lipid signaling. Reduced FABP7 levels in the brain of AD patients expressing apoE4 substantiate the relevance of these interactions for neuronal lipid homeostasis. Taken together, we document interaction of sortilin with mediators of extracellular and intracellular lipid transport that provides a mechanistic explanation for loss of a neuroprotective lipid metabolism in AD.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTLipids are central to brain health and defects in brain lipid homeostasis are causal to neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimers disease. Here, we uncovered how the neuronal lipoprotein receptor sortilin interacts with apoE and FABP7, the carriers for extra- and intracellular transport of lipids in the brain, respectively. We show that this interaction enables lipids to control gene transcription via nuclear receptors; and why this presumed neuroprotective lipid action is disturbed in humans who carry the {varepsilon}4 variant of apoE, the most important risk factor for sporadic Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes consist of two centrioles and surrounding pericentriolar material (PCM). PCM expands during mitosis in a process called centrosome maturation, in which PCM scaffold proteins play pivotal roles to recruit other centrosomal proteins. In C. elegans, the scaffold protein SPD-5 forms PCM scaffold in a PLK-1 phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, how phosphorylation of SPD-5 promotes PCM scaffold assembly is unclear. Here, we identified three functional domains of SPD-5 through in vivo domain analyses, and propose that sequential domain interactions of SPD-5 are required for mitotic PCM scaffold assembly. Firstly, SPD-5 is targeted to centrioles through direct interaction between its centriole localization (CL) domain and a centriolar protein PCMD-1. Then, intra- and inter-molecular interaction between SPD-5 phospho-regulated multimerization (PReM) domain and the PReM association (PA) domain is triggered by phosphorylation by PLK-1, which leads to PCM scaffold expansion. Our findings suggest that the sequential domain interactions of scaffold proteins mediated by Polo/PLK-1 phosphorylation is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of PCM scaffold assembly.",

    "abstract": "mRNA localization is an evolutionarily widespread phenomenon that facilitates sub-cellular protein targeting. Extensive work has focused on mRNA targeting through \"zip codes\" within untranslated regions (UTRs), while much less is known about translation-dependent cues. Here, we examine mRNA localization in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic epithelia. From an smFISH-based survey, we identified mRNAs associated with the cell membrane or cortex, and with apical junctions in a stage- and cell type-specific manner. Mutational analyses for one of these transcripts, dlg-1/discs large, revealed that it relied on a translation-dependent process and did not require its 5 or 3 UTR. We suggest a model in which dlg-1 transcripts are co-translationally colocalized with the encoded protein: first the translating complex goes to the cell membrane through sequences of the SH3 domain, and then to the apical junction by the L27 and PDZ sequences. In addition, the Hook and GuK sequences contribute to the second step: they are required for mRNA, but not protein, to accumulate at the apical junctions from locations at or near the membrane. These studies identify a translation-based process for mRNA localization within developing epithelia and determine the necessary cis-acting sequences for dlg-1 mRNA targeting.\n\nSummary statementAn smFISH-based survey identified a subset of mRNAs coding for junctional components that localize at or in the proximity of the adherent junction through a translation-dependent mechanism.",

Here, we report the use of CRISPR-Cas13 in plants to reduce both viral and endogenous RNA. Unexpectedly, we discovered that crRNA designed to guide Cas13 could, in the absence of the Cas13 protein, cause substantial reduction in RNA levels as well. We demonstrate Cas13-independent guide-induced gene silencing (GIGS) in three plant species, including stable transgenic Arabidopsis. We determined that GIGS utilizes endogenous RNAi machinery despite the fact that crRNA are unlike canonical triggers of RNAi such as miRNA, hairpins or long double-stranded RNA. These results suggest that GIGS offers a novel and flexible approach to RNA reduction with potential benefits over existing technologies for crop improvement. Our results demonstrate that GIGS is active across a range of plant species, evidence similar to recent findings in an insect system, which suggests that GIGS is potentially active across many eukaryotes.",

Developing a vaccine that only requires single immunization but provides long-term protection for the prevention and control of COVID-19 is important. Here, we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vaccine expressing a stable receptor-binding domain (SRBD) protein. The vaccine requires only a single shot but provides effective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) over 598 days in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Importantly, our results showed that the NAbs were kept in high level and long lasting against authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants using plaque reduction neutralization test. Of note, although we detected pre-existing AAV2/9 antibodies before immunization, the vaccine still induced high and effective NAbs against COVID-19 in rhesus macaques. AAV-SRBD immune serum also efficiently inhibited the binding of ACE2 with RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1/P.2 (Gamma), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.1/3(Kappa), and C.37 (Lambda) variants.

    "abstract": "Global deployment of vaccines that can provide protection across several age groups is still urgently needed to end the COVID-19 pandemic especially for low- and middle-income countries. While vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 based on mRNA and adenoviral-vector technologies have been rapidly developed, additional practical and scalable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are needed to meet global demand. In this context, protein subunit vaccines formulated with appropriate adjuvants represent a promising approach to address this urgent need. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a key target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) but is poorly immunogenic. We therefore compared pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, including those activating STING, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR9, alone or formulated with aluminum hydroxide (AH), and benchmarked them to AS01B and AS03-like emulsion-based adjuvants for their potential to enhance RBD immunogenicity in young and aged mice. We found that the AH and CpG adjuvant formulation (AH:CpG) demonstrated the highest enhancement of anti-RBD neutralizing Ab titers in both age groups ([~]80-fold over AH), and protected aged mice from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Notably, AH:CpG-adjuvanted RBD vaccine elicited neutralizing Abs against both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 variant at serum concentrations comparable to those induced by the authorized mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. AH:CpG induced similar cytokine and chemokine gene enrichment patterns in the draining lymph nodes of both young adult and aged mice and synergistically enhanced cytokine and chemokine production in human young adult and elderly mononuclear cells. These data support further development of AH:CpG-adjuvanted RBD as an affordable vaccine that may be effective across multiple age groups.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAlum and CpG enhance SARS-CoV-2 RBD protective immunity, variant neutralization in aged mice and Th1-polarizing cytokine production by human elder leukocytes.",

Very few studies have investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 within the nasopharynx, the site of initial infection and viral replication. In this study we profiled changes in the nasal microbial communities as well as in host transcriptional profile during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using 16S amplicon sequencing and RNA sequencing. These analyses were coupled to viral genome sequencing. Our microbiome analysis revealed that the nasal microbiome of COVID patients was unique and was marked by an expansion of bacterial pathogens. Some of these microbes (i.e. Acinetobacter) were shared with COVID negative health care providers from the same medical center but absent in COVID negative outpatients seeking care at the same institutions suggesting acquisition of nosocomial respiratory pathogens. Specifically, we report a distinct increase in the prevalence and abundance of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in COVID patients that correlated with viral RNA load. These data suggest that the inflammatory environment caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially exposure to the hospital environment leads to an expansion of bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity that could contribute to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections. Additionally, we observed a robust host transcriptional response in the nasal epithelia of COVID patients, indicative of an antiviral innate immune repones and neuronal damage.

Genetic screens are often performed in transformed cell lines that poorly represent viral target cells in vivo, leading to discoveries that may not be translated to the clinic. Intestinal organoids (IOs) are increasingly used to model human disease and are amenable to genetic engineering. To discern which host factors are reliable anti-coronavirus therapeutic targets, we generate mutant clonal IOs for 19 host genes previously implicated in coronavirus biology. We verify ACE2 and DPP4 as entry receptors for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV respectively. SARS-CoV-2 replication in IOs does not require the endosomal Cathepsin B/L proteases, but specifically depends on the cell surface protease TMPRSS2. Other TMPRSS family members were not essential. The newly emerging coronavirus variant B.1.1.7, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV similarly depended on TMPRSS2. These findings underscore the relevance of non-transformed human models for coronavirus research, identify TMPRSS2 as an attractive pan-coronavirus therapeutic target, and demonstrate that an organoid knockout biobank is a valuable tool to investigate the biology of current and future emerging coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Type I interferons (IFN-I) exert pleiotropic biological effects during viral infections, balancing virus control versus immune-mediated pathologies and have been successfully employed for the treatment of viral diseases. Humans express twelve IFN-alpha () subtypes, which activate downstream signalling cascades and result in distinct patterns of immune responses and differential antiviral responses. Inborn errors in type I IFN immunity and the presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies account for very severe courses of COVID-19, therefore, early administration of type I IFNs may be protective against life-threatening disease. Here we comprehensively analysed the antiviral activity of all IFN subtypes against SARS-CoV-2 to identify the underlying immune signatures and explore their therapeutic potential. Prophylaxis of primary human airway epithelial cells (hAEC) with different IFN subtypes during SARS-CoV-2 infection uncovered distinct functional classes with high, intermediate and low antiviral IFNs. In particular IFN5 showed superior antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dose-dependency studies further displayed additive effects upon co-administered with the broad antiviral drug remdesivir in cell culture. Transcriptomics of IFN-treated hAEC revealed different transcriptional signatures, uncovering distinct, intersecting and prototypical genes of individual IFN subtypes. Global proteomic analyses systematically assessed the abundance of specific antiviral key effector molecules which are involved in type I IFN signalling pathways, negative regulation of viral processes and immune effector processes for the potent antiviral IFN5. Taken together, our data provide a systemic, multi-modular definition of antiviral host responses mediated by defined type I IFNs. This knowledge shall support the development of novel therapeutic approaches against SARS-CoV-2.",

Previously, our lab identified a number of non-canonical Giardia lamblia actin (GlActin) interactors; however, these proteins appeared to interact only with monomeric or globular actin (G-actin), rather than filamentous actin (F-actin). To identify interactors, we used a chemical crosslinker to preserve native interactions, followed by an anti-GlActin antibody, Protein A affinity chromatography, and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. We found 46 putative actin interactors enriched in the conditions favoring F-actin. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD026067. None of the proteins identified contain known actin-interacting motifs, and many lacked conserved domains. Each potential interactor was then tagged with the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen and visualized in live cells. We categorized the proteins based on their primary localization; localizations included ventral disc, marginal plate, nuclei, flagella, plasma membrane, and internal membranes. One protein from each category was co-localized with GlActin using immunofluorescence microscopy. We also co-immunoprecipitated one protein from each category and confirmed three interactions. Most of the localization patterns are consistent with previously demonstrated GlActin functions, but the ventral disc represents a new category of actin interactor localization. These results suggest a role for GlActin in ventral disc function, which has previously been controversial.\n\nImportanceThe single-celled eukaryote Giardia lamblia is an intestinal parasite that colonizes the small intestine and causes diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration and malnutrition. Giardia actin (GlActin) has a conserved role in Giardia cells, despite being a highly divergent protein with none of the conserved regulators found in model organisms. Here we identify and localize 46 interactors of polymerized actin. These putative interactors localize to a number of places in the cell, underlining GlActins importance in multiple cellular processes. Surprisingly, eight of these proteins localize to the ventral disc, Giardias host attachment organelle. Since host attachment is required for infection, proteins involved in this process are an appealing target for new drugs. While treatments for Giardia exist, drug resistance is becoming more common, resulting in a need for new treatments. Giardia and human systems are highly dissimilar, thus drugs specifically tailored to Giardia proteins would be unlikely to have side effects.",

For this, it is necessary to identify which type of mobile genetic elements is able to spread them from animal reservoirs into human pathogens. Previous research suggests that in pig feces, ARGs may be encoded by bacteriophages. However, convincing proof for phage-encoded ARGs in pig viromes is still lacking, because of bacterial DNA contaminating issues. We collected 14 pig fecal samples and performed deep sequencing on both highly purified viral fractions and total microbiota, in order to investigate phage and prophage-encoded ARGs. We show that ARGs are absent from the genomes of active, virion-forming phages (below 0.02% of viral contigs from viromes), but present in three prophages, representing 0.02% of the viral contigs identified in the microbial dataset. However, the corresponding phages were not detected in the viromes, and their genetic maps suggest they might be defective. Furthermore, our dataset allows for the first time a comprehensive view of the interplay between prophages and viral particles.",

    "abstract": "Manufacturing of probiotics and functional foods using lactic acid bacteria that overproduce vitamin B2 has gained growing interest due to ariboflavinosis problems affecting populations of both developing and affluent countries. Two isogenic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains, namely a riboflavin-producing parental strain (UFG9) and a roseoflavin-resistant strain (B2) that carries a mutation in the FMN-aptamer of the potential rib operon riboswitch, were analyzed for production and intra- and extracellular accumulation of flavins, as well as for regulation of the rib operon expression. Strain B2 accumulated in the medium one of the highest levels of riboflavin+FMN ever reported for lactic acid bacteria, exceeding by ~25 times those accumulated by UFG9. Inside the cells, concentration of FAD was similar in both strains, while that of riboflavin+FMN was ~6-fold higher in B2. Mutation B2 could decrease the stability of the aptamers regulatory P1 helix even in the presence of the effector, thus promoting the antiterminator structure of the riboswitch ON state. Although the B2-mutant riboswitch showed an impaired regulatory activity, it retained partial functionality being still sensitive to the effector. The extraordinary capacity of strain B2 to produce riboflavine, together with its metabolic versatility and probiotic properties, can be exploited for manufacturing multifunctional foods.",

Like most protein-coding genes, the full multifunctional nature of kinetochore factors remains uncharacterized due to the limited experimental tools for unbiased dissection of human protein sequences. We developed a method that leverages CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutations to identify key functional regions within protein sequences required for cellular outgrowth. Our analysis of 48 human mitotic genes revealed hundreds of regions required for cell proliferation, including known domains and uncharacterized ones. We validated the essential nature for 15 of these regions, including amino acids 387-402 of Mad1, which identified an unknown domain that contributes to Mad1 kinetochore localization and chromosome segregation fidelity. Altogether, we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9-based tiling mutagenesis identifies key functional domains in protein-coding genes de novo, which elucidates separation of function mutants and allows functional annotation across the human proteome.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor RpoS ({sigma}S) of Escherichia coli controls a large number of genes important for tolerance of a variety of stress conditions. IraD promotes the post-translation stability of RpoS by inhibition of RssB, an adaptor protein for ClpXP degradation. We have previously documented DNA damage induction of iraD expression, independent of the SOS response. Both iraD and rpoS are required for tolerance to DNA damaging treatments such as H2O2 and the replication inhibitor azidothymidine in the log phase of growth. Using luciferase gene fusions to the 672 bp iraD upstream region, we show here that both promoters of iraD are induced by AZT. Genetic analysis suggests that both promoters are repressed by DnaA-ATP, partially dependent on a putative DnaA box at -81 bp, and regulated by RIDA (regulatory inactivation of DnaA), dependent on the DnaN processivity clamp. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays we show that purified DnaA protein binds to the iraD upstream region, so DnaA regulation of IraD is likely to be direct. DNA damage induction of iraD during log phase growth is abolished in the dnaA-T174P mutant, suggesting that DNA damage, in some way, relieves DnaA repression, possibly through the accumulation of replication clamps and enhanced RIDA. We demonstrate that the RNA-polymerase associated factor, SspA (stringent starvation protein A), induced by the accumulation of ppGpp, also affects IraD expression, with a positive effect on constitutive expression and a negative effect on AZT-induced expression, in a fashion independent of DnaA.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDNA damage can lead to cell death or genomic instability. Cells have evolved transcriptional responses that sense DNA damage and up-regulate tolerance and repair factors; the LexA/RecA-regulated SOS response in E. coli was the first example of such a system. This work describes an alternative DNA damage response, controlled by DnaA and the IraD post-translational regulator of RpoS. The cellular signals for this response, we propose, are empty replication processivity ({beta}) clamps that accumulate at replication blocks. IraD expression is also regulated by stringent starvation protein, SspA, induced by nutrient deprivation. This SOS-independent DNA damage response integrates a signal of incomplete replication with starvation to modulate expression of genes that promote the completion of replication.",

    "abstract": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) constitute a class of small RNAs that bind PIWI proteins and are essential to repress transposable elements in the animal germline, thereby promoting genome stability and maintaining fertility. C. elegans piRNAs (21U RNAs) are transcribed individually from minigenes as precursors that require 5 and 3 processing. This process depends on the PETISCO complex, consisting of four proteins: IFE-3, TOFU-6, PID-3, and ERH-2. We employ biochemical and structural biology approaches to characterize the PETISCO architecture and its interaction with RNA, together with its effector proteins TOST-1 and PID-1. These two proteins define different PETISCO functions: PID-1 governs 21U processing whereas TOST-1 links PETISCO to an unknown process essential for early embryogenesis.\n\nHere, we show that PETISCO forms an octameric assembly with each subunit present in two copies. Determination of structures of the TOFU-6/PID-3 and PID-3/ERH-2 subcomplexes, supported by in vivo studies of subunit interaction mutants, allows us to propose a model for the formation of the TOFU-6/PID-3/ERH-2 core complex, and its functionality in germ cells and early embryos. Using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that TOST-1 and PID-1 bind to a common surface on ERH-2, located opposite its PID-3 binding site, explaining how PETISCO can mediate different cellular roles.",

    "abstract": "Primary open-angle glaucoma is associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) that damages the optic nerve and leads to gradual vision loss. Several agents that reduce the stiffness of pressure-regulating Schlemms canal endothelial cells, in the conventional outflow pathway of the eye, lower IOP in glaucoma patients and are approved for clinical use. However, poor drug penetration and uncontrolled biodistribution limit their efficacy and produce local adverse effects. Compared to other ocular endothelia, FLT4/VEGFR3 is expressed at elevated levels by Schlemms canal endothelial cells and can be exploited for targeted drug delivery. Here, we validate FLT4 receptors as a clinically relevant target on Schlemms canal cells from glaucomatous human donors and engineer polymeric self-assembled nanocarriers displaying lipid-anchored targeting ligands that optimally engage this receptor. Targeting constructs were synthesized as lipid-PEGX-peptide, differing in the number of PEG spacer units (x), and were embedded in micelles. We present a novel proteolysis assay for quantifying ligand accessibility that we employ to design and optimize our FLT4-targeting strategy for glaucoma nanotherapy. Peptide accessibility to proteases correlated with receptor-mediated targeting enhancements. Increasing the accessibility of FLT4-binding peptides enhanced nanocarrier uptake by Schlemms canal cells while simultaneously decreasing uptake by off-target vascular endothelial cells. Using a paired longitudinal IOP study in vivo, we show this enhanced targeting of Schlemms canal cells translates to IOP reductions that are sustained for a significantly longer time as compared to controls. Histological analysis of murine anterior segment tissue confirmed nanocarrier localization to Schlemms canal within one hour after intracameral administration. This work demonstrates that steric effects between surface-displayed ligands and PEG coronas significantly impact targeting performance of synthetic nanocarriers across multiple biological scales. Minimizing the obstruction of modular targeting ligands by PEG measurably improved the efficacy of glaucoma nanotherapy and is an important consideration for engineering PEGylated nanocarriers for targeted drug delivery.",

Module blue, is negatively correlated with modules brown and green, and contained ribosomal and metabolic proteins. Finally, module yellow shows co-expression with the three other modules.

We speculate that they may also play roles during sporulation. Finally, levels of some coat proteins, for example morphogenetic coat proteins, decreased late in sporulation. We speculate on their possible role in guiding or helping assembly of other coat proteins, after which they can be disposed of, but such a hypothesis remains to be experimentally addressed.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that phages can be a mortality factor for the dense heterotrophic bacterial population succeeding in phytoplankton blooms. For the marine carbon cycle, spring phytoplankton blooms are important recurring events. In this study, we focused on Flavobacteriia, because they are main responders during these blooms and have an important role in the degradation of polysaccharides. A cultivation-based approach was used, obtaining 44 lytic flavobacterial phages (flavophages), representing twelve new species from two viral realms - Duplodnaviria and Monodnaviria. Taxonomic analysis allowed us to delineate ten new phage genera and seven new families, from which nine and four, respectively, had no previously cultivated representatives. Genomic analysis predicted various life styles and genomic replication strategies. A likely eukaryote-associated host habitat was reflected in the gene content of some of the flavophages. Detection in cellular metagenomes and by direct-plating indicated that part of these phages were actively replicating in the environment during the 2018 spring bloom. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas spacers and re-isolation during two consecutive years indicated that, at least part of the new flavophages are stable components of the microbial community in the North Sea. Together, our results indicate that these diverse flavophages have the potential to modulate their respective host populations.",

    "abstract": "In animals with distinct life stages such as holometabolous insects, adult phenotypic variation is often shaped by the environment of immature stages, including their interactions with microbes colonizing larval habitats. Such carry-over effects were previously observed for several adult traits of the mosquito Aedes aegypti after larval exposure to different bacteria, but the mechanistic underpinnings are unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular changes triggered by gnotobiotic larval exposure to different bacteria in Ae. aegypti. We initially screened a panel of 16 bacterial isolates from natural mosquito breeding sites to determine their ability to influence adult life-history traits. We subsequently focused on four bacterial isolates (belonging to Flavobacterium, Lysobacter, Paenibacillus, and Enterobacteriaceae) with significant carry-over effects on adult survival and found that they were associated with distinct transcriptomic profiles throughout mosquito development. Moreover, we detected carry-over effects at the level of gene expression for the Flavobacterium and Paenibacillus isolates. The most prominent transcriptomic changes in gnotobiotic larvae reflected a profound remodeling of lipid metabolism, which translated into phenotypic differences in lipid storage and starvation resistance at the adult stage. Together, our findings indicate that larval exposure to environmental bacteria trigger substantial physiological changes that impact adult fitness, uncovering a mechanism underlying carry-over effects of mosquito-bacteria interactions during larval development.",

    "abstract": "Fat Mass and Obesity-related (FTO) gene is associated with a diverse set of human diseases. Yet, the functional landscape of FTO remains largely unknown, most likely owing to its wide range of mechanistic roles and cell-type-specific targets. Here, we discover the intricate role of FTO in multiple WNT signaling pathways. Re-analyses of public data identified the bifurcation of canonical and noncanonical WNT pathways as the major role of FTO. In FTO-depleted cells, we find that the canonical WNT/{beta}-Catenin signaling is inhibited in a non-cell autonomous manner via the upregulation of DKK1. Simultaneously, this upregulation of DKK1 promotes cell migration via activating the noncanonical WNT/PCP pathway. Unexpectedly, we also find that the canonical WNT/STOP signaling induces the accumulation of cytoplasmic FTO proteins. This subsequently leads to the stabilization of mRNAs via RNA demethylation, revealing a previously uncharacterized mode of WNT action in RNA regulation. Altogether, this study places the functional context of FTO at the branching point of multiple WNT signaling pathways which may explain the wide spectrum of FTO functions.",

    "abstract": "Adenovirus derived vectors, based on chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 (ChAdOx1) and human adenovirus type 26 are proving critical in combatting the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Following emergency use authorisation, scale up in vaccine administration has inevitably revealed vaccine related adverse effects; too rare to observe even in large Phase-III clinical trials. These include vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), an ultra-rare adverse event in which patients develop life-threatening blood clots 5-24 days following vaccination.\n\nTo investigate vector-host interactions of ChAdOx1 underpinning VITT we solved the structure of the ChAdOx1 capsid by CryoEM, and the structure of the primary receptor tropism determining fiber-knob protein by crystallography. These structural insights have enabled us to unravel key protein interactions involved in ChAdOx1 cell entry and a possible means by which it may generate misplaced immunity to platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein involved in coagulation.\n\nWe use in vitro cell binding assays to show that the fiber-knob protein uses coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) as a high affinity binding partner, while it does not form a stable interface with CD46. Computational simulations identified a putative mechanism by which the ChAdOx1 capsid interacts with PF4 by binding in the spaces between hexon proteins, with downstream implications for the causes of VITT.\n\nSummaryWe present the structure of the ChAdOx1 viral vector, derived from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 at 4.2[A] resolution1. ChAdOx1 is in global use in the AstraZeneca vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD-1222, to combat the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. Recently observed, rare, adverse events make detailed mechanistic understanding of this vector key to informing proper treatment of affected patients and the development of safer viral vectors.\n\nHere, we determine a primary mechanism ChAdOx1 uses to attach to cells is coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a protein which is identical in humans and chimpanzees. We demonstrate the vector does not form a stable CD46 interaction, a common species B adenovirus receptor, via its primary attachment protein.\n\nFurther, we reveal the surface of the ChAdOx1 viral capsid has a strong electronegative potential. Molecular simulations suggest this charge, together with shape complementarity, are a mechanism by which an oppositely charged protein, platelet factor 4 (PF4) may bind the vector surface. PF4 is a key protein involved in the formation of blood clots2, and the target of auto-antibodies in heparin-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (HITT)3, an adverse reaction to heparin therapy which presents similarly to vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), a rare complication of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination4-6. We propose a mechanism in which the ChAdOx1-PF4 complex may stimulate the production of antibodies against PF4, leading to delayed blood clot formation, as observed in VITT.",

    "abstract": "In response to myocardial infarction (MI), quiescent cardiac fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts mediating tissue repair in the infarcted area. One of the most widely accepted markers of myofibroblast differentiation is the expression of Acta2 which encodes smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA) that is assembled into stress fibers. However, the requirement of Acta2 in the myofibroblast differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts and its role in post-MI cardiac repair were still not known. To answer these questions, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible cardiac fibroblast-specific Acta2 knockout mouse line. Surprisingly, mice that lacked Acta2 in cardiac fibroblasts had a normal survival rate after MI. Moreover, Acta2 deletion did not affect the function or overall histology of infarcted hearts. No difference was detected in the proliferation, migration, or contractility between WT cardiac fibroblasts and Acta2-null cardiac myofibroblasts. Additional analysis identified that Acta2-null cardiac myofibroblasts had a normal total filamentous actin level and total actin level. Acta2 deletion caused a unique compensatory increase in the transcription level of Actg2 and a possible increase in the protein abundance of cytoplasmic actin isoforms. In conclusion, the deletion of Acta2 does not prevent the myofibroblast differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts or affect the post-MI cardiac repair, and the increase in the expression of non-SMA actin isoforms and the functional redundancy between actin isoforms are likely able to compensate for the loss of Acta2 in cardiac myofibroblasts.",

To establish a cell model for study of CS with an isogenic control, we corrected the c.1569G>A mutation to the NHE6 reference genome sequence using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair knock-in methodology. Multiple subclonal lines were generated, and notably, NHE6 protein was expressed in all analyzed c.1569G>A (p.(W523X)) genome-corrected iPSC lines.

    "abstract": "The Axin family of scaffolding proteins regulates a wide array of developmental and post-developmental processes in eukaryotes. Studies in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, have shown that the Axin homolog, PRY-1, plays essential roles in multiple tissues. To understand the genetic network of pry-1, we focused on a set of genes that are differentially expressed in the pry-1-mutant transcriptome and are linked to reproductive structure development. Eight of the genes (ard-1, rpn-7, cpz-1, his-7, cdk-1, rnr-1, clsp-1, and spp-1), when knocked down by RNA interference, efficiently suppressed the plate-level multivulva phenotype of pry-1 mutants. In every case, other than clsp-1 and spp-1, the ectopic vulval precursor cell (VPC) induction was also inhibited. The suppressor genes are members of known gene families in eukaryotes and perform essential functions. Our genetic interaction experiments revealed that except for clsp-1, the genes participate in one or more pry-1-mediated biological events. While four of them (cpz-1, his-7, cdk-1, and rnr-1) function in VPC induction, stress response, and aging, the other three (spp-1, ard-1, and rpn-7) are specific to one or more of these processes. Further analysis of the genes involved in aging showed that his-7, cdk-1, and rnr-1 also interacted with daf-16/FOXO. The results of genetic epistasis experiments suggested that his-7 functions upstream of daf-16, whereas cdk-1 and rnr-1 act downstream of the pry-1-daf-16 pathway. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the important role of pry-1 suppressors in C. elegans. Given that all of the genes described in this study are conserved, future investigations of their interactions with Axin and their functional specificity promises to uncover the genetic network of Axin under normal and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory toxicity caused by the common urban air pollutant ozone (O3) varies considerably within the human population and across inbred mouse strains, suggestive of gene-environment interactions (GxE). Though previous studies genetic mapping studies using classical inbred strains have identified several and quantitative trait locus (QTL) and candidate genes underlying responses to O3 exposure, precise mechanisms of susceptibility remain incompletely described. We sought to expand our understanding of the genetic architecture of O3 responsiveness using the Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse panel, which contains more genetic diversity than previous inbred strain panels. We evaluated hallmark O3-induced respiratory phenotypes in 56 CC strains after exposure to filtered air or 2 ppm O3, and performed focused genetic analysis of variation in lung injury as measured by the total bronchoalveolar lavage protein concentration. Because animals were exposed in sex- and batch-matched pairs, we defined a protein response phenotype as the difference in lavage protein between the O3- and FA-exposed animal within a pair. The protein response phenotype was heritable, and QTL mapping revealed two novel loci on Chromosomes 10 (peak: 26.2 Mb; 80% CI: 24.6-43.6 Mb) and 15 (peak: 47.1 Mb; 80% CI: 40.2-54.9 Mb), the latter surpassing the 95% significance threshold. At the Chr. 15 locus, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ founder haplotypes were associated with higher protein responses compared to all other CC founder strain haplotypes. Using additional statistical analysis and high-density SNP data, we delimited the Chr. 15 QTL to a [~]2 Mb region containing 21 genes (10 protein coding). Using a weight of evidence approach that incorporated candidate variant analysis, functional annotations, and publicly available lung gene expression data, we nominated three candidate genes (Oxr1, Rspo2, and Angpt1). In summary, we have shown that O3-induced lung injury is modulated by genetic variation and demonstrated the value of the CC for uncovering and dissecting gene-environment interactions.",

    "abstract": "Apples (Malus domestica Borkh) are prone to pre-harvest fruit drop which is more pronounced in  Honeycrisp. Using a transcriptomic approach, we analyzed the molecular mechanisms of fruit retention in  Honeycrisp. A total of 726 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the abscission zone of hexanal-treated and untreated fruit (FAZ). Hexanal down-regulated the genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis, such as S-adenosylmethionine synthase (SAM2) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1carboxylic acid oxidases (ACO3, ACO4 and ACO4-like). Genes related to ABA biosynthesis (FDPS and CLE25) were also down-regulated. On the contrary, gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis genes, gibberellin 20 oxidase1-like (GA20OX-like) and ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) were up-regulated. Further, hexanal down-regulated the expression of genes related to cell-wall remodelling enzymes such as polygalacturonase (PG1), glucanases (endo-{beta}-1,4-glucanase; EG) and expansins (EXPA1-like, EXPA6, EXPA8, EXPA10-like, EXPA16-like). Hexanal also reduced ethylene, and abscisic acid (ABA) production at commercial harvest stage. Hexanal reduced ethylene production in fruits and thus reduced the sensitivity of FAZ cells to ethylene and ABA. Simultaneously, hexanal maintained the cell-wall integrity of FAZ cells by regulating genes involved in cell-wall modifications. Our findings show that fruit abscission is delayed by hexanal, by down regulating ABA through an ethylene-dependent mechanism.\n\nHighlightHexanal, a naturally occurring plant compound, increased fruit retention in apples by decreasing ethylene and ABA production and maintaining the cell-wall integrity in the fruit abscission zone.",

    "abstract": "Protein kinase CK2 has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), advent that becomes particularly relevant since the treatment of this hematological neoplasia remains challenging. Here we explored for the first time the effect of the clinical-grade peptide-based CK2 inhibitor CIGB-300 on AML cells proliferation and viability. CIGB-300 internalization and subcellular distribution were also studied, and the role of B23/nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), a major target for the peptide in solid tumors, was addressed by knock-down in model cell lines. Finally, pull-down experiments and phosphoproteomic analysis were performed to study CIGB-interacting proteins and identify the array of CK2 substrates differentially modulated after treatment with the peptide. Importantly, CIGB-300 elicited a potent anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effect in AML cells, with more than 80% of peptide transduced cells within three minutes. Unlike solid tumor cells, NPM1 did not appear to be a major target for CIGB-300 in AML cells. However, in vivo pull-down experiments and phosphoproteomic analysis evidenced that CIGB-300 targeted the CK2 catalytic subunit, different ribosomal proteins, and inhibited the phosphorylation of a common CK2 substrates array among both AML backgrounds. Remarkably, our results not only provide cellular and molecular insights unveiling the complexity of the CIGB-300 anti-leukemic effect in AML cells, but also reinforce the rationale behind the pharmacologic blockade of protein kinase CK2 for AML targeted therapy.",

The inhibitory effect of the two antagonists, on the novel receptor-cross-talk activation signals generated by the ATP-receptor, show that both antagonists inhibit the effect of the positive allosteric FFAR2 modulators (PAMs) AZ1729 and Cmp58. No neutrophil activation was induced by AZ1729 or Cmp58 alone, but together they were co-agonistic PAMs and activated the superoxide generating NADPH-oxidase in neutrophils. This response was inhibited by CATPB but not by GLPG0974; in contrast, GLPG0974 acted as a positive modulator that increased the potency but not the efficacy of the response. At the signaling level, GLPG0974 changed the biased signaling induced by the co-agonistic PAMs, to include a rise in the cytosolic concentration of free calcium ions (Ca2+). This effect was reciprocal, i.e., GLPG0974 triggers a rise in intracellular Ca2+, demonstrating that GLPG0974 may act as an FFAR2 agonist. In summary, by studying the effects of the FFAR2 ligand GLPG0974 on neutrophils activation induced by the co-agonists AZ1729 and Cmp58, we reveal that GLPG0974 in addition to be an antagonist, displays also agonistic and positive FFAR2 modulating functions that affects the NADPH-oxidase activity and the receptor down-stream signaling induced by the two co-agonistic PAMs.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesData and data visualization are integral parts of (clinical) decision-making in general and stewardship (antimicrobial stewardship, infection control, and institutional surveillance) in particular. However, systematic research on the use of data visualization in stewardship is lacking. This study aimed at filling this gap by creating a visual dictionary of stewardship through an assessment of data visualization in stewardship research.\n\nMethodsA random sample of 150 data visualizations from published research articles on stewardship were assessed. The visualization vocabulary (content) and design space (design elements) were combined to create a visual dictionary. Additionally, visualization errors, chart junk, and quality were assessed to identify problems in current visualizations and to provide improvement recommendations.\n\nResultsDespite a heterogeneous use of data visualization, distinct combinations of graphical elements to reflect stewardship data were identified. In general, bar (n=54; 36.0%) and line charts (n=42; 28.1%) were preferred visualization types. Visualization problems comprised colour scheme mismatches, double y-axis, hidden data points through overlaps, and chart junk. Recommendations were derived that can help to clarify visual communication, improve colour use for grouping/stratifying, improve the display of magnitude, and match visualizations to scientific standards.\n\nConclusionsResults of this study can be used to guide data visualization creators in designing visualizations that fit the data and visual habits of the stewardship target audience. Additionally, the results can provide the basis to further expand the visual dictionary of stewardship towards more effective visualizations that improve data insights, knowledge, and clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "In the study of single cell RNA-seq data, a key component of the analysis is to identify sub-populations of cells in the data. A variety of approaches to this have been considered, and although many machine learning based methods have been developed, these rarely give an estimate of uncertainty in the cluster assignment. To allow for this probabilistic models have been developed, but single cell RNA-seq data exhibit a phenomenon known as dropout, whereby a large proportion of the observed read counts are zero. This poses challenges in developing probabilistic models that appropriately model the data. We develop a novel Dirichlet process mixture model which employs both a mixture at the cell level to model multiple populations of cells, and a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture of counts at the transcript level. By taking a Bayesian approach we are able to model the expression of genes within clusters, and to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignments. It is shown that this approach out-performs previous approaches that applied multinomial distributions to model single cell RNA-seq counts and negative binomial models that do not take into account zero-inflation. Applied to a publicly available data set of single cell RNA-seq counts of multiple cell types from the mouse cortex and hippocampus, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to distinguish sub-populations of cells as clusters in the data, and to identify gene sets that are indicative of membership of a sub-population. The methodology is implemented as an open source Snakemake pipeline available from https://github.com/tt104/scmixture.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with alcohol use disorder continue to drink in excess despite the health and societal consequences, and the rate of problematic drinking and alcohol-related harms is increased in women. Clinical imaging studies report widespread adaptations in brain structure after chronic, heavy drinking, and alcohol-related cues enhance brain reactivity in reward-related regions. In rodents, alcohol drinking induces expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos, which can be a marker of cellular activity, across multiple brain regions. Recent evidence also suggests that abstinence from chronic intermittent alcohol exposure can produce mesoscale changes in c-Fos expression. However, there is a substantial gap in our understanding of how excessive drinking affects functional connectivity networks to influence alcohol-seeking behaviors. For this study, male and female C57BL/6J mice were given access to either water or a choice between water and ethanol in the intermittent access drinking model for 4 weeks. After a short-access drinking session, whole brains from high alcohol drinking male and female mice and water drinking controls were then subjected to c-Fos immunolabeling, iDISCO+ clearing, light sheet imaging, and whole-brain c-Fos mapping. Correlation matrices were then generated and graph theoretical statistical approaches were used to determine changes in functional connectivity across sex and drinking condition. We observed robust sex differences in the network of c-Fos+ cells in water drinking mice, and excessive alcohol drinking produce divergent and robust changes in functional network connectivity in male and female mice. In addition, these analyses identified novel hub regions in excessively drinking mice that were unique for each sex. In conclusion, the whole-brain c-Fos mapping analysis identified sex difference in functional network connectivity and unique and understudied regions that may play a critical role in controlling excessive ethanol drinking in male and female mice.",

    "abstract": "Piglets are often weaned between 19 and 22 d of age in North America although in some swine operations this may occur at 14 d or less. Piglets are abruptly separated from their sow at weaning and are quickly transitioned from sows milk to a plant-based diet. The effect of weaning age on the long-term development of the pig gut microbiome is largely unknown. Here, pigs were weaned at either 14, 21, or 28 d of age and fecal samples collected 20 times from d 4 (neonatal) through to marketing at d 140. The fecal microbiome was characterized using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The fecal microbiome of all piglets shifted significantly three to seven days post-weaning with an increase in microbial diversity. Several Prevotella spp. increased in relative abundance immediately after weaning as did butyrate-producing species such as Butyricicoccus porcorum, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Megasphaera elsdenii. Within 7 days of weaning, the gut microbiome of pigs weaned at 21 and 28 days of age resembled that of pigs weaned at 14 d. Resistance genes to most antimicrobial classes decreased in relative abundance post-weaning with the exception of those conferring resistance to tetracyclines and macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B. The relative abundance of microbial carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) changed significantly in the post-weaning period with an enrichment of CAZymes involved in degradation of plant-derived polysaccharides. These results demonstrate that the pig gut microbiome tends change in a predictable manner post-weaning and that weaning age has only a temporary effect on this microbiome.\n\nImportancePiglets are abruptly separated from their sow at weaning and are quickly transitioned from sows milk to a plant-based diet. This is the most important period in commercial swine production yet the effect of weaning age on the long-term development of the pig gut microbiome is largely unknown. Metagenomic sequencing allows for a higher resolution assessment of the pig gut microbiome and enables characterization of the resistome. Here we used metagenomic sequencing to identify bacterial species that were enriched post-weaning and therefore may provide targets for future manipulation studies. In addition, functional profiling of the microbiome indicated that many carbohydrate and metabolic enzymes decrease in relative abundance of after weaning. This study also highlights the challenges faced in reducing antimicrobial resistance in pigs as genes conferring tetracycline and macrolide resistance remained relatively stable from 7 days of age through to market weight at 140 d despite no exposure to antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "How and when potential becomes restricted in differentiating stem cell daughters is poorly understood. While it is thought that signals from the niche are actively required to prevent differentiation, another model proposes that stem cells can reversibly transit between multiple states, some of which are primed, but not committed, to differentiate. In the Drosophila testis, somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) generate cyst cells, which encapsulate the germline to support its development. We find that CySCs are maintained independently of niche self-renewal signals if activity of the PI3K/Tor pathway is inhibited. Conversely, PI3K/Tor is not sufficient alone to drive differentiation, suggesting that it acts to license cells for differentiation. Indeed, we find that the germline is required for differentiation of CySCs in response to PI3K/Tor elevation, indicating that final commitment to differentiation involves several steps and intercellular communication. We propose that CySC daughter cells are plastic, that their fate depends on the availability of neighbouring germ cells, and that PI3K/Tor acts to induce a primed state for CySC daughters to enable coordinated differentiation with the germline.",

    "abstract": "Derailed signaling originating from the plasma membrane is associated with many types of cancer. Different human cancers and thrombocytopenia are linked to ANKRD26 mutations. We unveil that Ankrd26 is a plasma membrane-localized protein forming nanoclusters and that Ankrd26 is critical for retinoic acid/BDNF-induced neuroblastoma differentiation. An N-terminal amphipathic structure lacking in an AML-associated Ankrd26 mutant is indispensable for membrane binding and bending by partial membrane insertion and renders Ankrd26 inactive in both gain-of-function and loss-of- function/rescue studies addressing cellular differentiation. In a papillary thyroid carcinoma-linked mutant, truncated Ankrd26 is fused with the kinase domain of the protooncogene RET. Our data show that the Ankrd26 part of this fusion mutant mediates anchoring of the RET kinase domain to the plasma membrane and self-association by the coiled coil domain of Ankrd26. Ankrd26-RET fusion led to massively increased ERK1/2 activity and RET autophosphorylation at both Y905 and Y1015, i.e. caused aberrant RET signaling. Our results highlight the importance and molecular details of Ankrd26-mediated organizational platforms for cellular differentiation and signaling pathways from the plasma membrane, which, if derailed, lead to cancer-associated pathomechanisms involving the unveiled Ankrd26 properties.",

Here we evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in a full, systematic comparison. We compared the performance of four detection methods, DeepSqueak (DSQ), MUPET, USVSEG, and the Automatic Mouse Ultrasound Detector (A-MUD). Moreover, we compared these to human-based manual detection (considered as ground truth), and evaluated the inter-observer reliability. All four methods had comparable rates of detection failure, though A-MUD outperformed the others in terms of true positive rates for recordings with low or high signal-to-noise ratios. We also did a systematic comparison of existing classification algorithms, where we found the need to develop a new method for automating the classification of USVs using supervised classification, bootstrapping on Gammatone Spectrograms, and Convolutional Neural Networks algorithms with Snapshot ensemble learning (BootSnap). It successfully classified calls into 12 types, including a new class of false positives used for detection refinement. BootSnap provides enhanced performance compared to state-of-the-art tools, it has an improved generalizability, and it is freely available for scientific use.",

    "abstract": "Gamma band synchronization can facilitate local and long-range communication in neural circuits. In the primary visual cortex (V1) the strength of synchronization on the local level is strongly tuned to the contrast, size and center/surround orientation of grating stimuli. On the global level, the synchronization of gamma oscillations across the retinotopic map crucially depends on matched stimulus properties in the corresponding locations in the visual field. Although these features of V1 gamma rhythms are likely to be crucial for how they might support cortico-cortical communication and visual perception, their neural basis remains largely unknown. We hypothesized VIP disinhibitory interneurons, which shape other tuning properties in V1 by inhibiting SST neurons, may be responsible for tuning local gamma band power and global gamma synchronization. To test these ideas, we combined multi-electrode electrophysiology, cell-type specific optogenetic suppression of VIP neurons and computational modeling. Contrary to expectations, our data show that on the local level, VIP activity has no role in tuning gamma power to stimulus properties; rather, it scales the gain of gamma oscillations linearly across stimulus space and across behavioral state. Conversely, on the global level, VIP neurons specifically suppress gamma synchronization (as measured by spectral coherence) between spatially separated cortical ensembles when they are processing non-matched stimulus features. A straightforward computational model of V1 shows that like-to-like connectivity across retinotopic space, and specific, but powerful VIPSST inhibition are sufficient to capture these seemingly opposed effects. These data demonstrate how VIP neurons differentially impact local and global properties of gamma rhythms depending on the global statistics of the retinal image. VIP neurons may thus construct temporal filters in the gamma band for spatially continuous image features, such as contours, to facilitate the downstream generation of coherent visual percepts.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine whose reported functions during bacterial infections are debated as an area of active research. To address this, we investigated the role of IL-27 signaling during Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis. Clinically, we observed elevated serum IL-27 levels (20-fold higher, p<0.05) in patients with S. aureus osteomyelitis compared to uninfected patients undergoing elective total joint replacement. Remarkably, IL-27 serum levels immediately following septic death were 60-fold higher vs. uninfected patients (p<0.05), suggesting that IL-27 may be a biomarker of end-stage infection and/or cytokine storm. To test this, we hypothesized that IL-27 mediates bacterial clearance during the acute phase of S. aureus osteomyelitis, and subsequently suppresses inflammation to prevent cytokine storm and osteolysis during chronic infection. In mice, we observed that systemic IL-27 delivery by a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV-IL-27) ameliorates surgical site soft tissue infection and peri-implant bone loss during the establishment of implant-associated S. aureus osteomyelitis. This effect was not observed in IL-27 receptor  knock-out mice, suggesting a direct role of IL-27/IL-27R signaling on immune and bone cell functions. Examination of IL-27-mediated immune responses via transcriptome analyses of infected tibiae demonstrated that IL-27 is a biphasic cytokine with IL-27/IL-27R activating immunostimulatory responses including Th17, IL-2, TLR, and iNOS signaling early, and subsequently suppressing these pathways during chronic infection. Ex vivo confirmation using murine macrophages revealed that IL-27 co-stimulates TLR signaling to increase the production of nitric oxide, and immunomodulatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-21, IL-31, and TNF-{beta}, but is not a chemokine.\n\nAuthor SummaryStaphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen in orthopaedic infections, and hard-to-treat (MRSA) strains cause >50% of these infections. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop immunotherapies to treat these life-threatening S. aureus infections. Currently, the role of multifunctional IL-27 on S. aureus osteomyelitis is unknown. In a clinical study, we observed that IL-27 is an important biomarker for identifying S. aureus osteomyelitis patients, and that elevated serum IL-27 levels correlated with adverse clinical outcomes, such as septic death. In our efforts to uncover the underlying mechanisms, we reveal that IL-27 is a biphasic cytokine, activating proinflammatory immune pathways, including Th17 responses, early during acute S. aureus osteomyelitis, and subsequently repressing them during the chronic phase to prevent cytokine storm and bone damage. These results indicate that immune modulation of IL-27/IL-27R signaling could be a viable therapeutic strategy in mitigating S. aureus osteomyelitis.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial pathogens use a type III secretion system (T3SS) as molecular syringe to inject effector proteins into the host cell. In the foodborne pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, delivery of the secreted effector protein cocktail through the T3SS depends on YopN, a molecular gatekeeper that controls access to the secretion channel from the bacterial cytoplasm. Here, we show that several checkpoints adjust yopN expression to virulence conditions. A dominant cue is the host body temperature. A temperature of 37 {degrees}C is known to induce the RNA thermometer (RNAT)-dependent synthesis of LcrF, a transcription factor that activates expression of the entire T3SS regulon. Here, we uncovered a second layer of temperature control. We show that another RNAT silences translation of the yopN mRNA at low environmental temperatures. The long and short 5-untranslated region of both cellular yopN isoforms fold into a similar secondary structure that blocks ribosome binding. The hairpin structure with an internal loop melts at 37 {degrees}C and thereby permits formation of the translation initiation complex as shown by mutational analysis, in vitro structure probing and toeprinting methods. Importantly, we demonstrate the physiological relevance of the RNAT in the faithful control of type III secretion by using a point-mutated thermostable RNAT variant with a trapped SD sequence. Abrogated YopN production in this strain led to unrestricted effector protein secretion into the medium, bacterial growth arrest and delayed translocation into eukaryotic host cells. Cumulatively, our results show that substrate delivery by the Yersinia T3SS is under hierarchical surveillance of two RNATs.\n\nAuthor summaryTemperature serves as reliable external cue for pathogenic bacteria to recognize the entry into or exit from a warm-blooded host. At the molecular level, a temperature of 37 {degrees}C induces various virulence-related processes that manipulate host cell physiology. Here, we demonstrate the temperature-dependent synthesis of the secretion regulator YopN in the foodborne pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a close relative of Yersinia pestis. YopN blocks secretion of effector proteins through the type III secretion system unless host cell contact is established. Temperature-specific regulation relies on an RNA structure in the 5-untranslated region of the yopN mRNA, referred to as RNA thermometer, which allows ribosome binding and thus translation initiation only at an infection-relevant temperature of 37 {degrees}C. A mutated variant of the thermosensor resulting in a closed conformation prevented synthesis of the molecular gatekeeper YopN and led to permanent secretion and defective translocation of virulence factors into host cells. We suggest that the RNA thermometer plays a critical role in adjusting the optimal cellular concentration of a surveillance factor that maintains the controlled translocation of virulence factors.",

By combined use of rbcL and ITS2 local databases of 74 alpine plant species found in the study area, a total of 43 plant taxa were identified and could be assigned to 40 species (93.0%), two genera (4.7%), and one family (2.3%). Rarefaction analysis of each sample collection period showed that this study covered more than 90% of the plant food resources found in the study area. Of the 21 plant families identified using the combined rbcL and ITS2 local databases, the most dominant families were Ericaceae (98.1% of 105 fecal samples), followed by Rosaceae (42.9%), Apiaceae (35.2%), and Poaceae (19.0%). In all fecal samples examined, the most frequently encountered plant species were Vaccinium ovalifolium var. ovalifolium (69.5%), followed by Empetrum nigrum var. japonicum (68.6%), Vaccinium sp.

Rarefaction analysis of each collection period in the study revealed that this study covered more than 90% (from 91.0% in July to 97.5% in September) of the plant food resources found in the study area, and 98.1% of the plant food taxa were covered throughout the entire study period. Thus, DNA metabarcoding using the rbcL and ITS2 local databases of alpine plants in combination and rarefaction analysis are considered to be well suited for estimating the dominant food plants in the diet of Japanese rock ptarmigans. Further, the local database constructed in this study can be used to survey other areas with similar flora.",

Althouigh ALHS are often be limited to a single sex or populations of a species, they can, in rare cases, be found among several species across a genus. In the butterfly genus Colias, at least a third of the species have a female limited ALHS called Alba. While many females develop brightly pigmented wings, Alba females reallocate nitrogen resources used in pigment synthesis to reproductive development, producing white-winged, more fecund females. Whether this ALHS evolved once or many times, and whether it has moved among species via introgression or been maintained via long-term balancing selection, has not been established. Answering these questions presents an opportunity to investigate the genetic basis and evolutionary forces acting upon ALHS, which have rarely been studied at a genus level. Here we identify the genetic locus of Alba in a second Colias species, allowing us to compare this with previous results in a larger phylogenetic context. Our findings suggest Alba has a singular origin and has been maintained in Colias through a combination of balancing selection and introgression for nearly one million years and at least as many generations. Finally, using CRISPR/Cas9 deletions in the cis-regulatory region of the Alba allele, we demonstrate that the Alba allele is a modular enhancer for the BarH1 gene and is necessary for the induction of the ALHS, which potentially facilitates its long-term persistence in the genus.",
