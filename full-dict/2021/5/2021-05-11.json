    "abstract": "The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).",

    "abstract": "Cellular differentiation during hematopoiesis is guided by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) thought to be organized as a hierarchy of bistable switches, with antagonism between Gata1 and PU.1 driving red- and white-blood cell differentiation. We utilized high temporal-resolution gene-expression data from in vitro erythrocyte-neutrophil differentiation and a predictive data-driven dynamical modeling framework to learn the architecture and dynamics of gene regulation in a comprehensive twelve-gene GRN. The inferred genetic architecture is densely interconnected rather than hierarchical. The analysis of model dynamics revealed that neutrophil differentiation is driven by C/EBP and Gfi1 rather than PU.1. This prediction is supported by the sequence of gene up-regulation in an independent mouse bone marrow scRNA-Seq dataset. These results imply that neutrophil differentiation is not driven by the Gata1-PU.1 switch but by neutrophil-specific genes instead. More generally, this work shows that data-driven dynamical modeling can uncover the causality of developmental events that might otherwise be obscured.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research attempting to slow the onset of Alzheimers disease (AD) indicates that a better understanding of memory will be key to the discovery of effective therapeutic approaches. Here, we ask whether prodromal neural network dysfunction might occur in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit by using 5IA as a selective negative modulator of extrasynaptic 5GABA-A receptors in TgF344-AD transgenic rats, a model for early onset AD. The results demonstrate that orally bioavailable 5IA, an established memory enhancer, increases CA1 pyramidal cell mean firing rates and peak CA1 ripple amplitude during wakeful immobility in wild type F344 rats resting in a familiar environment. We show that TgF344-AD rats, which express human amyloid-beta precursor protein (with the Swedish mutation) and human presenilin-1 (with a {Delta} exon 9 mutation), exhibit high serum A{beta}42 and A{beta}40 levels by 3 months of age. By 9 months of age, CA1 ripples in young adult TgF344-AD rats are nonresponsive to 5IA indicating network dysfunction prior to the onset of AD pathology and memory dysfunction. These results demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence for prodromal 5GABA-A receptor dysfunction in the AD hippocampal trisynaptic circuit. Moreover, as 5GABA-A receptors are located extrasynaptically and subserve the function of tonic inhibition we posit that an early stage of memory dysfunction involves the disruption of tonic inhibition in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "The intercellular transmission of -synuclein is proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD)1. Supporting this transmission hypothesis, -synuclein has been identified to act as a prion2 and has been found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and saliva3. However, the mechanism required to initiate the pathogenic spread of -synuclein in the body that results in PD remains unclear. Here we identify a mechanism for the loading of -synuclein into exosomes, resulting in prion-like transmission that is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase activator, Ndfip1. Risk factors associated with PD, including metal toxicity, lysosome dysfunction and pesticide exposure,4 stimulate the upregulation of Ndfip1 and increase the loading of -synuclein into exosomes. We used this pathway to promote the loading of endogenous -synuclein into exosomes, that when intranasally delivered to either wild type or M83 transgenic mice, resulted in Parkinsons-like pathology including motor impairments and brain amyloids. Recipient cells require -synuclein for pathogenesis, as delivery of exosomes containing -synuclein to Snca knockout mice did not generate brain amyloids or Parkinsons-like motor impairments. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism to initiate the prion-like spread of -synuclein in exosomes, following exposure to risk factors for PD.",

    "abstract": "Koalas are of great cultural, ecological and economic significance to Australia. However, they are in steep decline throughout much of their geographic range, with the recently endogenized koala retrovirus (KoRV) presumed to be a contributing factor. Olagoke, et al. 1 have proposed vaccination against KoRV as a suitable control mechanism to reduce the severity of KoRV infections and suggest that their recombinant vaccine is effective at invoking a neutralising immune response and significantly reducing viral loads. Here, we report the findings of our own attempts to detect antibodies specific to the KoRV envelope protein (Env) in infected animals. Antibodies against Env were undetectable in all animals, as would be expected in the case of an endogenous virus antigen which should proceed towards a pathway of self-tolerance. This finding calls into question the results of Olagoke, et al. 1, and prior work by this team 2,3. Following a critical review of this work 1-3, we have identified a number of assay inaccuracies and possible over interpretations of the data and conclude that further work to develop and test a vaccine against KoRV in koalas is not supported by evidence.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown great promise in the field of regenerative medicine as many studies have shown that MSCs possess immunomodulatory function. Despite this promise, no MSC therapies have been granted licensure from the FDA. This lack of successful clinical translation is due in part to MSC heterogeneity and a lack of critical quality attributes (CQAs). While MSC Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygnease (IDO) activity has been shown to correlate with MSC function, multiple CQAs may be needed to better predict MSC function.\n\nMethodsThree MSC lines (two bone marrow, one iPSC) were expanded to three passages. At the time of harvest for each passage, cell pellets were collected for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), and media was collected for cytokine profiling. Harvested cells were also cryopreserved for assessing function using T cell proliferation and IDO activity assays. Linear regression was performed on functional and multiomics data to reduce the number of important features, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to obtain putative CQAs based on variable importance in projection (VIP) scores.\n\nResultsSignificant functional heterogeneity (in terms of T cell suppression and IDO activity) was observed between the three MSC lines, as well as donor-dependent differences based on passage. Omics characterization revealed distinct differences between cell lines using principal component analysis (PCA). Cell lines separated along principal component 1 based on tissue source (bone marrow vs. iPSC-derived) for NMR, MS, and cytokine profiles. PLSR modeling of important features predicts MSC functional capacity with NMR (R2=0.86), MS (R2=0.83), cytokines (R2=0.70), and a combination of all features (R2=0.88).\n\nDiscussionThe work described here provides a platform for identifying putative CQAs for predicting MSC functional capacity using PLSR modeling that could be used as release criteria and guide future manufacturing strategies for MSCs and other cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "Epidemic and pandemic infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses constitute a significant hazard to human and animal health. Disinfection is an essential aspect of infection prevention and control measures. In this study, we estimated UV-C sensitivity of 83 human and veterinary pathogenic (+) ssRNA viruses by developed pyrimidine dinucleotide frequency-based genomic model. The data showed that the avian infectious bronchitis virus (genus: {gamma}-coronavirus) with an estimated D90 value of 17.8 J/m2 was highly UV sensitive, whereas Salivirus NG-J1 (genus: salivirus) with a D90 value of 346.4 J/m2 was highly UV resistant. Overall, the trend of UV-C sensitivity of (+) ssRNA virus families followed as Coronaviridae < Flaviviridae < Togadoviridae < Arteriviridae, Matonaviridae, Astroviridae < Caciviridae < Picornaviridae < Nodaviridae < Herpeviridae. The results revealed that the enveloped viral families (Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Togadoviridae Arteriviridae, and Matonaviridae) are more UV-C sensitive than other nonenveloped families. Further validation of the model estimated UV sensitivity with literature available experimental data showed good agreement of predicted values. The estimates presented here could make it possible to reasonably predict UV-C disinfection efficiency of human and veterinary pathogenic viruses, which need specific biosafety requirements and/or difficult to cultivate in lab conditions.",

    "abstract": "Molnupiravir is an orally available antiviral drug candidate that is in phase III trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients1,2. Molnupiravir increases the frequency of viral RNA mutations3,4 and impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models4-6 and in patients2. Here we establish the molecular mechanisms that underlie molnupiravir-induced RNA mutagenesis by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Biochemical assays show that the RdRp readily uses the active form of molnupiravir, {beta}-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate, as a substrate instead of CTP or UTP. Incorporation of NHC monophosphate into nascent RNA does not impair further RdRp progression. When the RdRp uses the resulting RNA as a template, NHC directs incorporation of either G or A, leading to mutated RNA products. Structural analysis of RdRp-RNA complexes containing mutagenesis products shows that NHC can form stable base pairs with either G or A in the RdRp active center, explaining how the polymerase escapes proofreading and synthesizes mutated RNA. This two-step mutagenesis mechanism likely applies to various viral polymerases and can explain the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of molnupiravir.",

The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope mediates human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and thus is the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we built various S trimer-antibody complex structures on the basis of the fully glycosylated S protein models described in our previous work, and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to get insight into the structural dynamics and interactions between S protein and antibodies. Investigation of the residues critical for S-antibody binding allows us to predict the potential influence of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Comparison of the glycan conformations between S-only and S-antibody systems reveals the roles of glycans in S-antibody binding. In addition, we explored the antibody binding modes, and the influences of antibody on the motion of S protein receptor binding domains. Overall, our analyses provide a better understanding of S-antibody interactions, and the simulation-based S-antibody interaction maps could be used to predict the influences of S mutation on S-antibody interactions, which will be useful for the development of vaccine and antibody-based therapy.",

However, some concerns have limited its application into clinic settings like insufficient colonization of tumors and infectious origin of the currently used bacteria like Clostridium and Salmonella species, especially in cancer patients which exhibit different levels of immunocompromising. In the present study, Veillonella parvula (V. parvula) as a strictly anaerobic bacterium which has rarely identified as a pathogen in human, was administrated into 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice. At first, 4T1 breast tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were injected with 107 bacteria intravenously, intraperitoneally, orally, or intratumorally. The best administration route according to tumor colonization and safety was selected. Then, the therapeutic effect of V. parvula administration was investigated according to the 4T1 breast tumors growth, metastasis, and tumor-bearing mice survival. Besides, histopathological evaluations were done to estimate microscopic changes at the inner of the tumor. V. parvula exhibited significant tumor-targeting and colonization efficacy, 24 h after intravenous administration and formed clustered colonies at the central region of the tumors. Although a negligible number of the bacteria were localized at normal organs, these organs became clear from the bacteria after 72 h, and no side effects or death were observed at the animals after intravenous administration of V. parvula. Although mean tumor volumes in the V. parvula treated group was lower than the control (~ 25.4%), their difference wasnt statistically significant (P > 0.05). Despite significant tumor colonization (5500000:1 in comparison with normal organs after 72 h), V. parvula didnt cause a significant therapeutic effect on the metastasis or survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Taking together, V. parvula is a completely safe and tumor-specific agent per se, without any genetic manipulation. Also, it exhibits high tumor penetration and colonization at the deep regions of the tumor.",

To better understand the basis for this large response, the model OVA257-264 epitope was inserted into YopE in Y. pseudotuberculosis and antigen specific CD8+ T cells in mice were characterized after foodborne infection with the resulting strain. The epitope YopE69-77 elicited significantly larger CD8+ T cell populations in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), spleen and liver between 7- and 30-days post infection, despite residing in the same protein and having a similar affinity for H-2Kb as OVA257-264. YopE-specific CD8+ T cell precursors were ~4.6 times as abundant as OVA-specific precursors in the MLNs, spleen and other lymph nodes of naive mice, explaining the dominance of YopE69-77 over OVA257-264 at early infection times. However, other factors contributed to this dominance as the ratio of YopE-specific to OVA-specific CD8+ T cells increased between 7- and 30-days post infection. We also compared the YopE-specific and OVA-specific CD8+ T cells generated during infection for effector and memory phenotypes. Significantly higher percentages of YopE-specific cells were characterized as short short-lived effectors while higher percentages of OVA-specific cells were memory precursor effectors at day 30 post infection in spleen and liver. Our results suggest that a large precursor number contributes to the dominance and effector and memory functions of CD8+ T cells generated to the protective YopE69-77 epitope during Y. pseudotuberculosis infection of C57BL/6 mice.",

Protection against weight loss associated with WT, B.1.1.7, P.1 and B.1.617.2 challenge was also demonstrated. Vaccinated hamsters showed enhanced humoral responses against VOC in a heterologous WT vaccine prime and INO-4802 boost setting. These results demonstrate the potential of the pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, INO-4802 to induce cross-reactive immune responses against emerging VOC as either a standalone vaccine, or as a potential boost for individuals previously immunized with WT-matched vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Individuals infected with both HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are more likely to develop severe Tuberculosis (TB) disease than HIV-naive individuals. To understand how a chronic pre-existing Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection impairs the early immune response to Mtb, we used the Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM) model of SIV/Mtb co-infection. We examined the relationship between peripheral viral control and Mtb burden, Mtb dissemination, and immunological function between SIV+ spontaneous controllers, SIV+ non-controllers, and SIV-naive MCM who were challenged with a barcoded Mtb Erdman strain and necropsied six weeks post infection. Mycobacterial burden was highest in the SIV+ non-controllers in all assessed tissues. In lung granulomas, we found the frequency of CD4+ T cells producing TNF was reduced in all SIV+ MCM, but CD4+ T cells producing IFN{gamma} were only lower in the SIV+ non-controllers. Further, while all SIV+ MCM had more PD1+ and TIGIT+ T cells in the lung granulomas relative to SIV-naive MCM, SIV+ controllers exhibited the highest frequency of cells expressing these markers. To measure the effect of SIV infection on within-host bacterial dissemination, we sequenced the molecular barcodes of Mtb present in each tissue and characterized the complexity of the Mtb populations. While Mtb population complexity was not associated with infection group, lymph nodes had increased complexity when compared to lung granulomas across all groups. These results provide evidence SIV+ animals, independent of viral control, exhibit dysregulated immune responses and enhanced dissemination of Mtb, likely contributing to the poor TB disease course across all SIV/Mtb co-infected animals.\n\nImportanceHIV and TB remain significant global health issues, despite the availability of treatments. Individuals with HIV, including those who are virally suppressed, are at an increased risk to develop and succumb to severe TB disease when compared to HIV-naive individuals. Our study aims to understand the relationship between SIV replication, mycobacterial growth, and immunological function in the tissues of co-infected Mauritian cynomolgus macaques during the early phase of Mtb infection. Here we demonstrate that increased viral replication is associated with increased bacterial burden in the tissues and impaired immunologic responses, and that the damage attributed to virus infection is not fully eliminated when animals spontaneously control virus replication.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is an important cause of human fungal infections. A widely studied virulence trait of C. albicans is its ability to undergo filamentation to hyphae and pseudohyphae. Although yeast, pseudohyphae and hyphae are present in pathological samples of infected mammalian tissue, it has been challenging to characterize the role of regulatory networks and specific genes during in vivo filamentation. In addition, the phenotypic heterogeneity of C. albicans clinical isolates is becoming increasingly recognized and correlating this heterogeneity with pathogenesis remains an important goal. Here, we describe the use of an intravital imaging approach to characterize C. albicans filamentation in a mammalian model of infection by taking advantage of the translucence of mouse pinna (ears). Using this model, we have found that the in vitro and in vivo filamentation phenotypes of different C. albicans isolates can vary significantly, particularly when in vivo filamentation is compared to solid agar-based assays. We also show that the well-characterized transcriptional regulators Efg1 and Brg1 appear to play important roles both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, Ume6 is much more important in vitro than in vivo. Finally, strains that are dependent on Bcr1 for in vitro filamentation are able to form filaments in vivo. This intravital imaging approach provides a new approach to the systematic characterization of this important virulence trait during mammalian infection. Our initial studies provide support for the notion that the regulation and initiation of C. albicans filamentation in vivo is distinct from in vitro induction.\n\nImportanceCandida albicans is one of the most common causes of fungal infections in humans. C. albicans undergoes a transition from a round yeast form to a filamentous form during infection which is critical for its ability to cause disease. Although this transition has been studied in the laboratory for years, methods to do so in an animal model of infection have been limited. We have developed a microscopy method to visualize fluorescently labeled C. albicans undergoing this transition in the subcutaneous tissue of mice. Our studies indicate that the regulation of C. albicans filamentation during infection is distinct from that observed in laboratory conditions.",

    "abstract": "Candida species are causal pathogens for urinary tract infections, vulvovaginitis, and balanitis. Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for Candida infection. To investigate the potential effects of glucosuria on Candida spp. (C. albicans, C. krusei, and C. glabrata), we investigated the influence of their growth and antifungal susceptibilities by glucose in urine.\n\nCandida spp. exhibited greater growth in urine with glucose (300 and 3,000 mg/dL) than in plain urine taken from healthy volunteers. After 24 h incubation, the viable cell number was more than 10-fold higher in the urine added 3,000 mg/dL glucose than in plain urine.\n\nIn antifungal susceptibility, more than 80% of C. albicans clinical isolates increased minimum inhibitory concentrations of azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and miconazole) and 5-fluorocytosine with the addition of glucose exceeding their breakpoints. This phenomenon was not observed in clinical isolates of C. krusei and C. glabrata. We observed the growth in the urine to which 3,000 mg/dL glucose was added even in the presence of a 128-fold higher minimum inhibitory concentration of fluconazole. In most of the C. albicans clinical isolates, the mRNA expression of the azole resistance genes ERG11, CDR1, CDR2, and MDR1 increased in glucose-added urine compared with plain urine.\n\nIn conclusion, the growth of C. albicans is accelerated and azoles and 5-fluorocytosine become ineffective as a result of a high concentration of glucose in urine. These observations provide valuable information about the clinical course and therapeutic effects of azoles against C. albicans infections in patients with diabetes mellitus and hyperglucosuria.\n\nIMPORTANCEDiabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and glucosuria, with a high risk of Candida infection. The current study demonstrated the acceleration of Candida growth and ineffectiveness of azoles and 5-fluorocytosine against C. albicans in urine in the presence of glucose. These observations provide novel and valuable information about the clinical course and antifungal treatment of Candida spp. in urinary tract and genital infections of diabetes mellitus patients. For the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Candida spp., the guidelines do not mention glucosuria. Thus, this study suggests the necessity to conduct clinical evaluations for glucosuria in patients with diabetes mellitus who have urinary tract and genital infections with Candida spp.",

    "abstract": "At present, global immunity to SARS-CoV-2 resides within a heterogeneous combination of susceptible, naturally infected and vaccinated individuals. The extent to which viral shedding and transmission occurs on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 after prior natural exposure or vaccination is an emerging area of understanding. We used Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) in rats to model the extent to which immune protection afforded by prior natural infection via high risk (inoculation; direct contact) or low risk (fomite) exposure, or by vaccination, influenced viral shedding and transmission on re-exposure. On initial infection, we confirmed that amount, duration and consistency of viral shedding were correlated with exposure risk. Animals were reinfected after 3.7-5.5 months using the same exposure paradigm. Amount and duration of viral shedding were correlated with re-exposure type and serologic status. 59% of seropositive animals shed virus. Previously exposed seropositive reinfected animals were able to transmit virus to 25% of naive recipient rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Rats vaccinated intranasally with a related virus (Parkers Rat Coronavirus) were able to transmit SDAV to only 4.7% of naive animals after a 7-day direct contact exposure, despite comparable viral shedding. Observed cycle threshold values associated with transmission in both groups ranged from 29-36 cycles, however observed shedding was not a prerequisite for transmission. Results indicate that low-level shedding in both naturally infected and vaccinated seropositive animals can propagate infection in susceptible individuals. Extrapolated to COVID-19, our results suggest that continued propagation of SARS-CoV-2 by seropositive previously infected or vaccinated individuals is possible.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant Adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are one of the most commonly used vectors for a variety of gene therapy applications. In the last two decades research focused primarily on the characterization and isolation of new cap genes resulting in hundreds of natural and engineered AAV capsid variants while the rep gene, the other major AAV open reading frame, has been less studied. This is due to the fact that the rep gene from AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) enables the ssDNA packaging of recombinant genomes into most AAV serotype and engineered capsids. However, a major byproduct of all vector productions is empty AAV capsids, lacking the encapsidated vector genome, especially for non-AAV2 vectors. Despite the packaging process being considered the rate-limiting step for rAAV production, none of the rep genes from the other AAV serotypes have been characterized for their packaging efficiency. Thus, in this study AAV2 rep was replaced with the rep gene of a select number of AAV serotypes. However, this led to a lowering of capsid protein expression, relative to the standard AAV2-rep system. In further experiments the 3end of the AAV2 rep gene was reintroduced to promote increased capsid expression and a series of chimeras between the different AAV Rep proteins were generated and characterized for their vector genome packaging ability. The utilization of these novel Rep hybrids increased the percentage of genome containing (full) capsids ~2-4-fold for all of the non-AAV2 serotypes tested. Thus, these Rep chimeras could revolutionize rAAV production.\n\nImportanceA major byproduct of all Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector production systems are \"empty\" capsids, void of the desired therapeutic gene, and thus do not provide any curative benefit for the treatment of the targeted disease. In fact, empty capsids can potentially elicit additional immune responses in vivo gene therapies if not removed by additional purification steps. Thus, there is a need to increase the genome packaging efficiency and reduce the number of empty capsids from AAV biologics. The novel Rep hybrids from different AAV serotypes described in this study are capable of reducing the percentage of empty capsids in all tested AAV serotypes and improve overall yields of genome-containing AAV capsids at the same time. They can likely be integrated easily into existing AAV manufacturing protocols to optimize the production of the generated AAV gene therapy products.",

This valuable resource remains acutely underused because discovering particular samples from this ever-growing data collection remains a significant challenge.

We propose a natural-language-processing-based machine learning approach (NLP-ML) to infer tissue and cell-type annotations for -omics samples based only on their free-text metadata. NLP-ML works by creating numerical representations of sample descriptions and using these representations as features in a supervised learning classifier that predicts tissue/cell-type terms. Our approach significantly outperforms an advanced graph-based reasoning annotation method (MetaSRA) and a baseline exact string matching method (TAGGER). Model similarities between related tissues demonstrate that NLP-ML models capture biologically-meaningful signals in text. Additionally, these models correctly classify tissue-associated biological processes and diseases based on their text descriptions alone. NLP-ML models are nearly as accurate as models based on gene-expression profiles in predicting sample tissue annotations but have the distinct capability to classify samples irrespective of the -omics experiment type based on their text metadata.

    "abstract": "Differentiating the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer is crucial for deciding the best treatment strategy. Deep learning can predict the subtypes from genetic information more accurately than conventional statistical methods, but to date, deep learning has not been directly utilized to examine which genes are associated with which subtypes. To clarify the mechanisms embedded in the intrinsic subtypes, we developed an explainable deep learning model called a point-wise linear (PWL) model that generates a custom-made logistic regression for each patient. Logistic regression, which is familiar to both physicians and medical informatics researchers, allows us to analyze the importance of the feature variables, and the PWL model harnesses these practical abilities of logistic regression. In this study, we show that analyzing breast cancer subtypes is clinically beneficial for patients and one of the best ways to validate the capability of the PWL model. First, we trained the PWL model with RNA-seq data to predict PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and applied it to the 41/50 genes of PAM50 through the subtype prediction task. Second, we developed a deep enrichment analysis method to reveal the relationships between the PAM50 subtypes and the copy numbers of breast cancer. Our findings showed that the PWL model utilized genes relevant to the cell cycle-related pathways. These preliminary successes in breast cancer subtype analysis demonstrate the potential of our analysis strategy to clarify the mechanisms underlying breast cancer and improve overall clinical outcomes.",

Recently, genomes of Acidobacteria species with unusually large repertoires of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were reconstructed from grassland soil metagenomes, but the degree to which these species are widespread is still unknown. To investigate this, we augmented a dataset of publicly available Acidobacteria genomes with 46 metagenome-assembled genomes recovered from permanently saturated organic-rich soils of a vernal (spring) pool ecosystem in Northern California. We recovered high quality genomes for three novel species from Candidatus Angelobacter (a proposed subdivision 1 Acidobacterial genus), a genus that is genomically enriched in genes for specialized metabolite biosynthesis. Acidobacteria were particularly abundant in the vernal pool sediments, and a Ca. Angelobacter species was the most abundant bacterial species detected in some samples. We identified numerous diverse biosynthetic gene clusters in these genomes, and also in additional genomes from other publicly available soil metagenomes for other related Ca. Angelobacter species. Metabolic analysis indicates that Ca. Angelobacter likely are aerobes that ferment organic carbon, with potential to contribute to carbon compound turnover in soils. Using metatranscriptomics, we identified in situ expression of specialized metabolic traits for two species from this genus. In conclusion, we expand genomic sampling of the uncultivated Ca. Angelobacter, and show that they represent common and sometimes highly abundant members of dry and saturated soil communities, with a high degree of capacity for synthesis of diverse specialized metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulators that integrate cellular and environmental signals to control cell division are well known in bacteria and eukaryotes, but their existence is poorly understood in archaea. We identified a conserved gene (cdrS) that encodes a small protein and is highly transcribed in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The cdrS gene could not be deleted, but CRISPRi-mediated repression of the cdrS gene caused slow growth, cell division defects, and changed the expression of multiple genes and their products associated with cell division, protein degradation and metabolism. Consistent with this complex regulatory network, overexpression of cdrS inhibited cell division, whereas overexpression of the operon encoding both CdrS and a tubulin-like cell division protein (FtsZ2) stimulated division. ChIP-Seq identified 18 DNA-binding sites of the CdrS protein including one upstream of the promoter for diadenylate cyclase, which is an essential gene involved in c-di-AMP signalling implicated in the regulation of cell division. These findings suggest that CdrS is a transcription factor that plays a central role in a regulatory network coordinating metabolism and cell division.\n\nImportanceCell division is a central mechanism of life, and is essential for growth and development. Bacteria and Eukarya have different mechanisms for cell division, which have been studied in detail. In contrast, cell division in Archaea is still understudied, and its regulation is poorly understood. Interestingly, different cell division machineries appear in the Archaea, with the Euryarchaeota using a cell division apparatus based on the tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, as in bacteria. Here we identify the small protein CdrS as essential for survival and a central regulator of cell division in the Euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. CdrS also appears to coordinate other cellular pathways including synthesis of signalling molecules and protein degradation. Our results show that CdrS plays a sophisticated role in cell division, including regulation of numerous associated genes. These findings are expected to initiate investigations into conditional regulation of division in archaea.",

    "abstract": "Applying crop residues is a widely used strategy to increase soil organic matter (SOM) in arable soils because of its recorded effects on increasing microbial biomass and consequently necromass. However, fresh residue inputs could also \"prime\" the decomposition of native SOM, resulting in accelerated SOM depletion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Increasing the botanical diversity of the crops grown in arable systems has been promoted to increase the delivery of multiple ecological functions, including increasing soil microbial biomass and SOM. Whether mixtures of fresh residues from different crops grown in polyculture contribute to soil carbon (C) pools to a greater extent than would be expected from applying individual residues (i.e., the mixture produces a non-additive synergistic effect) has not been systematically tested and is currently unknown. In this study, we used 13C isotope labelled cover crop residues (i.e., buckwheat, clover, radish, and sunflower) to track the fate of plant residue-derived C and C derived from the priming of SOM in treatments comprising a quaternary mixture of the residues and the average effect of the four individual residues one day after residue incorporation in a laboratory microcosm experiment. Our results indicate that, despite all treatments receiving the same amount of plant residue-derived C (1 mg-1 C g soil), the total microbial biomass in the treatment receiving the residue mixture was significantly greater, by 26% (3.69 {micro}g-1 C g), than the average microbial biomass observed in treatments receiving the four individual components of the mixture one day after applying crop residues. The greater microbial biomass C in the quaternary mixture, compared to average of the individual residue treatments, that can be attributed directly to the plant residue applied was also significantly greater, by 132% (3.61 {micro}g-1 C g). However, there was no evidence that the mixture resulted in any more priming of native SOM than average priming observed in the individual residue treatments. The soil microbial community structure, assessed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, was significantly (P < 0.001) different in the soil receiving the residue mixture, compared to the average structures of the communities in soil receiving four individual residues. Differences in the biomass of fungi, general bacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria were responsible for the observed synergistic effect of crop residue mixtures on total microbial biomass and residue-derived microbial biomass, especially biomarkers 16:0, 18:2{omega}6 and 18:3{omega}3. Our study demonstrates that applying a mixture of crop residues increases soil microbial biomass to a greater extent than would be expected from applying individual residues and that this occurs either due to faster decomposition of the crop residues or greater carbon use efficiency (CUE), rather than priming the decomposition of native SOM. Therefore, growing crop polycultures (e.g., cover crop mixtures) and incorporating mixtures of the resulting crop residues into the soil could be an effective method to increase microbial biomass and ultimately C stocks in arable soils.",

    "abstract": "As the global burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections escalates, so does the evolution of viral variants which is of particular concern due to their potential for increased transmissibility and pathology. In addition to this entrenched variant diversity in circulation, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within single infected hosts with co-existing viral variants evolving differently in distinct cell types. The BriS{Delta} variant, originally identified as a viral subpopulation by passaging SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/England/02/2020, comprises in the spike glycoprotein an eight amino-acid deletion encompassing the furin recognition motif and S1/S2 cleavage site. Here, we elucidate the structure, function and molecular dynamics of this variant spike providing mechanistic insight into how the deletion correlates to viral cell tropism, ACE2 receptor binding and infectivity of this SARS-CoV-2 variant. Moreover, our study reveals long-range allosteric communication between functional regions within the spike that differ in wild-type and deletion variant. Our results support a view of SARS-CoV-2 probing multiple evolutionary trajectories in distinct cell types within the same infected host.",

    "abstract": "The majority of viruses within the human gut are obligate bacterial viruses known as bacteriophages (phages)1. Their bacteriotropism underscores the study of phage ecology in the gut, where they sustain top-down control2-4 and co-evolve5 with gut bacterial communities. Traditionally, these were investigated empirically via in vitro experimental evolution6-8 and more recently, in vivo models were adopted to account for gut niche effects4,9. Here, we probed beyond conventional phage-bacteria co-evolution to investigate the potential evolutionary interactions between phages and the mammalian \"host\". To capture the role of the mammalian host, we recapitulated a life-like mammalian gut mucosa using in vitro lab-on-a-chip devices (to wit, the gut-on-a-chip) and showed that the mucosal environment supports stable phage-bacteria co-existence. Next, we experimentally evolved phage populations within the gut-on-a-chip devices and discovered that phages adapt by de novo mutations and genetic recombination. We found that a single mutation in the phage capsid protein Hoc - known to facilitate phage adherence to mucus10 - caused altered phage binding to fucosylated mucin glycans. We demonstrated that the altered glycan-binding phenotype provided the evolved mutant phage a competitive fitness advantage over their ancestral wildtype phage in the gut-on-a-chip mucosal environment. Collectively, our findings revealed that phages - in addition to their evolutionary relationship with bacteria - are also able to engage in evolution with the mammalian host.",

    "abstract": "Manipulating soil metabolism by heavy inoculation with microbes is deemed realistic if waste from anaerobic digestion (digestate) is utilized as substrate and vector, but requires organisms that can grow both in digestate and soil (=generalist). We designed a strategy to enrich and isolate such generalist N2O-respiring bacteria (NRB) in soil and digestate, to provide inoculum for reducing N2O-emissions from agricultural soil. Sequential anaerobic enrichment cultures were provided with a small dose of O2 and unlimited N2O, alternating between sterilized digestate and soil as substrates. The cultures were monitored for gas kinetics and community composition (16SrDNA), and cluster-analysis identified generalist-OTUs which became dominant, digestate/soil-specialists which did not, and a majority that were diluted out. Several NRBs circumscribed by generalist-OTUs were isolated, genome sequenced to screen for catabolic capacity, and phenotyped, to assess their capacity as N2O-sinks in soil. The two isolates Cloacibacterium sp., carrying only N2O-reductase (Clade-II) and Pseudomonas sp., with full-fledged denitrification-pathway, were both very effective N2O-sinks in soil, with Pseudomonas sp., showing a long-lasting sink effect, suggesting better survival in soil. This avenue for utilizing waste to bioengineer the soil microbiota holds promise to effectively combat N2O-emissions but could also be utilized for enhancing other metabolic functions in soil.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

To combat biofouling, protective coatings are applied on vessel hulls which are divided into two major groups: biocidal and non-toxic fouling-release. The aim of the current study was to explore the effect of coating type on microbial biofilm community profiles to better understand the differences between the communities developed on fouling control biocidal antifouling and biocidal-free coatings. Biocidal (Intersmooth(R) 7460HS SPC), fouling-release (Intersleek(R) 900), and inert surfaces were deployed in the marine environment for 4 months and the biofilms that developed on these surfaces were investigated using Illumina NGS sequencing, targeting the prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene. The results confirmed differences in the community profiles between coating types. The biocidal coating supported communities dominated by Alphaproteobacteria (Loktanella, Sphingorhabdus, Erythrobacter) and Bacteroidetes (Gilvibacter), whilst other taxa such as Portibacter and Sva0996 marine group, proliferated on the fouling-release surface. Knowledge of these marine biofilm components on fouling control coatings will serve as a guide for future investigations of marine microfouling as well as informing the coatings industry of potential microbial targets for robust coating formulations.",

A number of resistance mutations have previously been identified in treated patients or cell culture. Here, we generate a complete map of the effect of all single-amino-acid mutations to an avian PB2 on resistance to pimodivir. We identified both known and novel resistance mutations not only in the previously implicated cap-binding and mid-link domains, but also in the N-terminal domain.

    "abstract": "For antibiotics with intracellular targets, effective treatment of bacterial infections requires the drug to accumulate to a high concentration inside cells. Bacteria produce a complex cell envelope and possess drug-export efflux pumps to limit drug accumulation inside cells. Decreasing cell envelope permeability and increasing efflux pump activity can reduce intracellular accumulation of antibiotics, and are commonly seen in antibiotic resistant strains. Here, we show that the balance between influx and efflux differs depending on bacterial growth phase in Gramnegative bacteria. Accumulation of the model fluorescent drug, ethidium bromide (EtBr) was measured in S. Typhimurium SL1344 (wild-type) and efflux deficient ({Delta}acrB) strains during growth. In SL1344, EtBr accumulation remained low, regardless of growth phase and did not correlate with acrAB transcription. EtBr accumulation in {Delta}acrB was high in exponential phase but dropped sharply later in growth, with no significant difference to SL1344 in stationary phase. Low EtBr accumulation in stationary phase was not due to the upregulation of other efflux pumps, but instead, due to decreased permeability of the envelope in stationary phase. RNAseq identified changes in expression of several pathways that remodel the envelope in stationary phase, leading to lower permeability. This study shows that efflux is only important for maintaining low drug accumulation in actively growing cells, and that envelope permeability is the predominant factor dictating the rate of drug entry in stationary phase cells. This conclusion means that (i) antibiotics with intracellular targets may be less effective in complex non-growing or slow-growing bacterial infections where intracellular accumulation may be low, (ii) efflux inhibitors may be successful in potentiating the activity of existing antibiotics, but potentially only for bacterial infections where cells are actively growing and (iii) the remodelling of the cell envelope prior to stationary phase could provide novel drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a common fatal genetic disease caused by mutations happened to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Lungs of CF patients are often colonized or infected with microorganisms. Drug resistant bacterial infection has been problematic in cystic fibrosis patient. The chronic bacterial infections and concomitant airway inflammation could damage the lung and lead to respiratory failure. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that high-dose ibuprofen reduces the rate of pulmonary function decline in CF patients. This beneficial effect has been attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of ibuprofen. Previously, we have confirmed that high-dose ibuprofen demonstrated antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa in in vitro and in vivo. However, no study has examined the antimicrobial effect of combining ibuprofen with standard-of-care (SoC) antimicrobials. Here, we evaluated possible synergistic activity of combinations of common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), namely, aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen, with commonly used antibiotics for CF patients. The drug combinations were screened against different CF clinical isolates. Drugs that demonstrated efficacy in the presence of ibuprofen were further verified synergistic effects between these antimicrobials and NSAIDs. Finally, the survival analysis of an P. aeruginosa murine infection model was used to demonstrate the efficacy of synergistic combination. Our results suggest that combinations of ibuprofen with commonly used antibiotics demonstrate synergistic antimicrobial activity against drug resistant, clinical bacterial strains in in vitro. The efficacy of combination ceftazidime and ibuprofen was demonstrated in in vivo.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundComplex carbohydrates that escape digestion in the small intestine, are broken down in the large intestine by enzymes encoded by the gut microbiome. This is a symbiotic relationship between particular microbes and the host, resulting in metabolic products that influence host gut health and are exploited by other microbes. However, the role of carbohydrate structure in directing microbiota community composition and the succession of carbohydrate-degrading microbes is not fully understood. Here we take the approach of combining data from long and short read sequencing allowing recovery of large numbers of high quality genomes, from which we can predict carbohydrate degrading functions, and impact of carbohydrate on microbial communities.\n\nResultsIn this study we evaluate species-level compositional variation within a single microbiome in response to six structurally distinct carbohydrates in a controlled model gut using hybrid metagenome assemblies. We identified 509 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to ten bacterial classes and 28 bacterial families. We found dynamic variations in the microbiome amongst carbohydrate treatments, and over time. Using these data, the MAGs were characterised as primary (0h to 6h) and secondary degraders (12h to 24h). Annotating the MAGs with the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme (CAZyme) database we are able to identify species which are enriched through time and have the potential to actively degrade carbohydrate substrates.\n\nConclusionsRecent advances in sequencing technology allowed us to identify significant unexplored diversity amongst starch degrading species in the human gut microbiota including CAZyme profiles and complete MAGs. We have identified changes in microbial community composition in response to structurally distinct carbohydrate substrates, which can be directly related to the CAZyme complement of the enriched MAGs. Through this approach, we have identified a number of species which have not previously been implicated in starch degradation, but which have the potential to play an important role.",

Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR/cas9 screen, we identified elongation factor ELOF1 as an important new factor in the transcription stress response upon DNA damage. We show that ELOF1 has an evolutionary conserved role in Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER), where it promotes recruitment of the TC-NER factors UVSSA and TFIIH to efficiently repair TBLs and resume transcription. Additionally, ELOF1 modulates transcription to protect cells from transcription-mediated replication stress, thereby preserving genome stability.

Here, we use pearl danio (D. albolineatus) to assess the developmental origin of erythrophores and their mechanisms of differentiation. We show that erythrophores in the fin of D. albolineatus share a common progenitor with xanthophores and maintain plasticity in cell fate even after differentiation. We further identify the predominant ketocarotenoids that confer red coloration to erythrophores and use reverse genetics to pinpoint genes required for the differentiation and maintenance of these cells. Our analyses are a first step towards defining the mechanisms underlying the development of erythrophore-mediated red coloration in Danio and reveal striking parallels with the mechanism of red coloration in birds.",

Perturbations to the epigenome could underpin such acquired changes, however, the extent and contexts in which modified chromatin states confer heritable memory in mammals is unclear. Here we exploit a modular epigenetic editing strategy to establish de novo heterochromatin domains (epialleles) at endogenous loci and track their inheritance in a developmental model. We find that naive pluripotent phases systematically erase ectopic domains of heterochromatin via active mechanisms, which acts as an intergenerational safeguard against transmission of epialleles. Upon lineage specification however, acquired chromatin states can be probabilistically inherited under selectively favourable conditions, including propagation of p53 silencing through in vivo development. Using genome-wide CRISPR screening, we identify the mechanisms that block heritable silencing memory in pluripotent cells, and demonstrate removal of Dppa2 unlocks the potential for epigenetic inheritance uncoupled from DNA sequence. Our study outlines a mechanistic basis for how epigenetic inheritance is restricted in mammals, and reveals genomic- and developmental-contexts in which heritable memory is feasible.",

The physiological and pathological functions of ZFP36L1 in liver, however, remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of ZFP36L1 in liver physiology and pathology, we generated liver-specific ZFP36L1-deficient (Zfp36l1flox/flox /Cre+; L1LKO) mice. Under normal conditions, the L1LKO mice and their littermate controls (Zfp36l1flox/flox/Cre-; L1FLX) appeared normal. When fed a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing alcohol, L1LKO mice were significantly protected from developing alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation compared to L1FLX mice. Serum ALT levels were significantly increased in alcohol-fed L1FLX versus alcohol-fed L1LKO mice. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 584 differentially-expressed transcripts in L1FLX alcohol-fed mice, many of which were inflammatory mediators, compared to only 159 in alcohol-fed L1LKO mice. Most importantly, fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) mRNA was significantly increased in the livers of alcohol-fed L1LKO mice but not in the alcohol-fed control group. The Fgf21 mRNA contains three AREs in its 3UTR, and Fgf21 3UTR was directly regulated by ZFP36L1 in luciferase reporter assays. Steady state levels of Fgf21 mRNA were significantly decreased by wildtype ZFP36L1, but not by a non-binding zinc-finger ZFP36L1 mutant. Finally, wildtype ZFP36L1, but not the ZFP36L1 mutant, bound to Fgf21 3UTR ARE RNA probe. Our results demonstrate that ZFP36L1 inactivation protects against alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and liver injury, possibly by stabilizing Fgf21 mRNA. Our findings suggest that the modulation of ZFP36L1 may be beneficial in the prevention or treatment of human alcoholic liver disease.",

    "abstract": "The primitive cells that emerged at the origin of life are commonly viewed as spherical biosurfactant shells, freely suspended in aqueous media1-3. This model explains initial, but not subsequent events in the development process towards structured protocells. Taking into consideration the involvement of naturally occurring surfaces, which were abundant on the early Earth4, we report feasible and productive pathways for the development of primitive cells. Surfaces intrinsically possess energy, easily utilized by the interfacing amphiphiles, such as lipids, to attain self-organization and spontaneous transformations5-7. We show that the physical interaction of phospholipid pools with 20 Hadean Earth analogue materials as well as a Martian meteorite composed of fused regolith representing the ancient crust of Mars, consistently lead to the shape transformation and autonomous formation of surfactant compartment assemblies. Dense, colony-like protocell populations grow from these lipid deposits, predominantly at the grain boundaries or cleavages of the investigated natural surfaces, and remain there for several days. The model protocells in our study are able to autonomously develop, transform and pseudo-divide, and encapsulate RNA as well as DNA. We also demonstrate that they can accommodate non-enzymatic, DNA strand displacement reactions. Our findings suggest a feasible route towards the transformation from nonliving to living entities, and provide fresh support for the  Lipid World hypothesis8.",

    "abstract": "Phytochrome B (PHYB) triggers diverse light responses in Arabidopsis by binding to a group of antagonistically acting PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING transcription FACTORs (PIFs) to promote PIF degradation, consequently downregulating PIF target genes. However, whether PHYB directly controls the transactivation activity of PIFs remains ambiguous. Here we show that the prototypic PIF, PIF3, possesses a p53-like transcription activation domain (TAD) consisting of a sequence-specific, hydrophobic activator motif surrounded by acidic residues. A PIF3mTAD mutant in which the activator motif is replaced with alanines fails to activate PIF3 target genes in Arabidopsis in dark, light, and shade conditions, validating the in vivo functions of the PIF3 TAD. Intriguingly, binding of PHYBs N-terminal photosensory module to the PHYB-binding site adjacent to the TAD inhibits its transactivation activity. These results unveil a photoresponsive transcriptional switching mechanism in which photoactivated PHYB directly masks the transactivation activity of PIF3. Our study also suggests the unexpected conservation of sequence-specific TADs between the animal and plant kingdoms.",

    "abstract": "IL-22 is a key cytokine in immune defense against pathogens at barrier sites. In response to enteric attaching and effacing bacteria, IL-22 produced by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) is thought to be important early for induction of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that protect intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in advance of T cell-derived IL-22 that arises later. Yet, the basis for a requirement for both innate and adaptive IL-22-producing immune cells in protecting the intestinal mucosa is unknown. Here, using novel mice that both report IL-22 expression and can be targeted for its lineage-specific deletion, we show that mice with deficiency of IL-22 targeted to innate immune cells, including ILC3s, have impaired STAT3 activation of surface colonic IECs colonized by bacteria early in infection. In contrast, mice with IL-22 deficiency limited to T cells have complete loss of STAT3 activation in IECs lining colonic crypts and fail to protect the crypts from bacterial invasion late despite ongoing production of IL-22 from ILC3s. T cell-derived IL-22 is required for upregulation of many host-protective genes by crypt IECs, including those encoding AMPs, neutrophil-recruiting chemokines, and mucins and mucin-related molecules, while also restricting pro-inflammatory genes downstream of IFN{gamma} and TNF signals. Thus, T cell-derived IL-22 is indispensable for antibacterial defense and damage control of intestinal crypts.",

    "abstract": "High levels of serum CD138, a heparan sulfate-bearing proteoglycan, correlates with increased disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Mechanisms responsible for serum CD138 production and its biological function in SLE disease remain poorly understood. In this study, corroborating patient data, we detected an increase in serum CD138 in MRL/Lpr mice parallel to disease activity. Although TCR{beta}+CD138+ T cells expand in MRL/Lpr mice as the disease progresses, surprisingly, TCR{beta}+CD138- cells were the primary source of circulating CD138 as the transfer of TCR{beta}+CD138- cells to young MRL/Lpr mice, but not TCR{beta}+CD138+ cells, resulted with higher serum CD138 in the recipient mice. We found that elevated trypsin, expressed by TCR{beta}+CD138- cells, was able to cleave CD138 from T cells. Moreover, suggesting the contribution of cleaved CD138 to the increase in blood CD138, trypsin inhibitors  defined trypsin inhibitor (DTI) or leupeptin increased CD138 expression on TCR{beta}+CD138- cells. Furthermore, soluble CD138 was able to bind  a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) and enhanced APRIL-mediated plasma cell generation and autoreactive antibody production through the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in B cells. APRIL receptor,  transmembrane activator, calcium modulator, and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) was involved in the enhancement of APRIL activity by CD138, as the synergistic effect of APRIL and CD138 was ablated on TACI deficient B cells.

We further demonstrate that single-stranded DNA coupled to ColB is also transported into the periplasm, emphasizing that the import routes of colicins can be exploited to carry large cargo molecules into bacteria. Moreover, we characterize the molecular mechanism of ColB association with its OM receptor FepA, applying a combination of photo-activated crosslinking, mass spectrometry, and structural modeling. We demonstrate that complex formation is coincident with a large-scale conformational change in the colicin. Finally In vivo crosslinking experiments and supplementary simulations of the translocation process indicate that part of the colicin engages active transport by disguising itself to part of the cellular receptor.",

    "abstract": "Mutations and aberrant gene expression during cellular differentiation lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) which results from the deletion of an imprinted locus on chromosome 15. We analysed chromatin-associated RNA in human induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) upon depletion of hybrid small nucleolar long non-coding RNAs (sno-lncRNAs) and 5 snoRNA capped and polyadenylated long non-coding RNAs (SPA-lncRNAs) transcribed from the locus deleted in PWS. We found that rapid ablation of these lncRNAs affects transcription of specific gene classes. Downregulated genes contribute to neurodevelopment and neuronal maintenance while genes that are upregulated are predominantly involved in the negative regulation of cellular metabolism and apoptotic processes. Our data revealed the importance of SPA-lncRNAs and sno-lncRNAs in controlling gene expression in iPSCs and provided a platform for synthetic experimental approaches in PWS studies. We conclude that ncRNAs transcribed from the PWS locus are critical regulators of a transcriptional signature important for neuronal differentiation and development.",

The bottleneck of the parasite life cycle is the invasion of erythrocytes immediately after parasites egress from infected red blood cells. DNA damage-inducible protein 1 (Ddi1) is a conserved eukaryotic proteasome shuttle protein containing an internal retroviral-like protease domain. Using conditional genetics, we now show that the proteolytic activity of the P. falciparum homologue, PfDdi1, is critically required for invasion of red blood cells. Furthermore, PfDdi1 disruption results in the accumulation of highly polyubiquitinated proteins that can be processed by purified PfDdi1 or distant eukaryotic homologues. We also show that PfDdi1 interacts with multiple components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that parasites lacking PfDdi1 are more sensitive to proteasome inhibition. Overall, this study establishes PfDdi1 as a key component of the eukaryotic ubiquitin-proteasome system and as a promising antimalarial target.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease with poorly defined pathogenic mechanism and no cure. It is characterized by chronic inflammation, myofibroblast accumulation, and aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Fibrosis progression is considered to occur due to sustained aberrant fibroblast mechanotransduction: sensing \"normal\" soft tissue as stiff scarred tissue leading to the overproduction of ECM that then stiffens the microenvironment, thus reinforcing a progressive, stiffness-dependent fibrotic program. How chronic inflammation leads to aberrant mechanotransduction is not well understood. Thy-1 is a regulator of mechanotransduction in fibroblasts. Thy-1 expression is lost in fibroblastic foci, the active sites of fibrosis, although the mechanism of this loss is unknown. We demonstrate that in IPF tissue, the SMA+ fibroproliferative foci express the Type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI) and IL-1RI-deficient mice did not develop bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Using ASC speck formation during inflammasome activation as a marker of mature IL-1{beta} release, we identified the immune compartment as the source of active IL-1{beta} during bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Furthermore, incubating mouse lung fibroblasts on soft (2kPa) hydrogels with IL-1{beta} was sufficient to reduce Thy-1 surface expression and induce v{beta}3 integrin activation. As expected, Thy-1 negative fibroblasts exhibited elevated v{beta}3 integrin activation but surprisingly, Thy-1 negative fibroblasts also expressed higher levels of IL-1RI, potentially linking the immuno-responsive and mechanosensitivity of this fibroblast subpopulation. Leveraging the non-resolving fibrosis that occurs in Thy-1-/- mice, we observed that crossing Thy-1-/- mice onto the IL-1RI-/- background was sufficient to reduce fibrosis. Together, these data indicate that Thy-1 negative fibroblasts are an immuno-responsive subpopulation that also display altered mechanotransduction, potentially serving as the link between the noted inflammation and aberrant mechanotransduction observed in IPF.",

In humans the impairment of these motors through mutation results in the disease, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Studies in Drosophila have helped to validate several PCD genes whose products are required for cytoplasmic pre-assembly of axonemal dynein motors. Here we report the characterisation of the Drosophila homologue of the less known assembly factor, DNAAF3. This gene, CG17669 (Dnaaf3), is expressed exclusively in developing mechanosensory chordotonal (Ch) neurons and spermatocytes, the only two Drosophila cell types bearing motile cilia/flagella. Mutation of Dnaaf3 results in larvae that are deaf and adults that are uncoordinated, indicating defective Ch neuron function. The mutant Ch neuron cilia of the antenna specifically lack dynein arms, while Ca imaging in larvae reveals a complete loss of Ch neuron response to vibration stimulus, confirming that mechanotransduction relies on ciliary dynein motors. Mutant males are infertile with immotile sperm whose flagella lack dynein arms and show axoneme disruption. Analysis of proteomic changes suggest a reduction in heavy chains of all axonemal dynein forms, consistent with an impairment of dynein pre-assembly.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTDNAAF3 function as a dynein assembly factor for motile cilia is conserved in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "The Tup1-Cyc8 corepressor complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is recruited to promoters by DNA-binding proteins to repress transcription of genes, including the a-specific mating type genes. We report here a tup1(S649F) mutant that displays mating irregularities similar to a tup1 null and an -predominant growth defect. RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq were used to analyze gene expression and Tup1 occupancy changes in mutant vs. wild-type in both a and  cells. Increased Tup1(S649F) occupancy tended to occur upstream of upregulated genes, whereas locations with decreased occupancy usually did not show changes in gene expression, suggesting this mutant not only loses corepressor function but also behaves as a coactivator. Based upon studies demonstrating a dual role of Tup1 in both repression and activation, we postulate that the coactivator function of Tup1(S649F) results from diminished interaction with repressor proteins, including 2. We also found that large changes in mating type-specific gene expression between a and  or between mutant and wild-type were not easily explained by the range of Tup1 occupancy levels within their promoters, as predicted by the classic model of a-specific gene repression by Tup1. Most surprisingly, we observed Tup1 occupancy upstream of the a-specific gene MFA2 and the -specific gene MF(ALPHA)1 in cells in which each gene was expressed rather than repressed. These results, combined with identification of additional mating related genes upregulated in the tup1(S649F)  strain, illustrate that the role of Tup1 in distinguishing mating types in yeast appears to be both more comprehensive and more nuanced than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "The use of blood-based extracellular RNA (cell-free RNA; exRNA) as clinical biomarker requires the implementation of a validated procedure for sample collection, processing, and profiling. So far, no study has systematically addressed the pre-analytical variables affecting transcriptome analysis of exRNAs. In the exRNAQC study, we evaluated ten blood collection tubes, three time intervals between blood draw and downstream processing, and eight RNA purification methods using the supplier-specified minimum and maximum biofluid input volumes. The impact of these pre-analytics on deep transcriptome profiling of both small and messenger RNA from healthy donors plasma or serum was assessed for each pre-analytical variable separately and for interactions between a selected set of pre-analytics, resulting in 456 extracellular transcriptomes. Making use of 189 synthetic spike-in RNAs, the processing and analysis workflow was controlled. When comparing blood collection tubes, so-called preservation tubes do not stabilize exRNA well, and result in variable RNA concentration and sensitivity (i.e., the number of detected RNAs) over time, as well as compromised reproducibility. We also document large differences in RNA purification kit performance in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility, and observed transcriptome complexity, and demonstrate interactions between specific blood collection tubes, purification kits and time intervals. Our results are summarized in 11 performance metrics that enable an informed selection of the most optimal sample processing workflow for a given experiment. In conclusion, we put forward robust quality control metrics for exRNA quantification methods with validated standard operating procedures (SOPs), representing paramount groundwork for future exRNA-based precision medicine applications.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of an obligate parasitic lifestyle often leads to the reduction of morphological and physiological traits, which may be accompanied by loss of genes and functions. Slave-maker ants are social parasites that exploit the work force of closely related ant species for social behaviours such as brood care and foraging. Recent divergence between these social parasites and their hosts enables comparative studies of gene family evolution. We sequenced the genomes of eight ant species, representing three independent origins of ant slavery. During the evolution of eusociality, chemoreceptor genes multiplied due to the importance of chemical communication in societies. We investigated evolutionary patterns of chemoreceptors in relation to slave-making in ants. We found that slave-maker ant genomes harboured only half as many gustatory receptors as their hosts, potentially mirroring the outsourcing of foraging tasks to host workers. In addition, parasites had fewer odorant receptors and their loss shows patterns of convergence across origins of parasitism, representing a rare case of convergent molecular evolution. This convergent loss of specific odorant receptors suggests that selective deprivation of receptors is adaptive. The 9-exon odorant receptor subfamily, previously linked to social evolution in insects, was significantly enriched for convergent loss across the three origins of slavery in our study, indicating that the transition to social parasitism in ants is accompanied by the loss of receptors that are likely important for mediating eusocial behaviour. Overall, gene loss in slave-maker ants suggests that a switch to a parasitic lifestyle accompanies relaxed selection on chemical perception.",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas are the most frequent primary intracranial tumors. They can follow a wide clinical spectrum from benign to highly aggressive clinical course. No specific therapy exists for refractory cases or cases not amenable to resection and radiotherapy. Identification of risk of recurrence and malignant transformation for the individual patients is challenging. However, promising molecular markers and prognostic subgrouping by DNA methylation are emerging. Still, the biological underpinnings of these diagnostic subgroups are elusive, and, consequently, no novel therapeutic options arise thereof. Here we establish robust subgroups across the full landscape of meningiomas, consistent through DNA methylation, mutations, the transcriptomic, proteomic and phospho-proteomic level. Pronounced proliferative stress and DNA damage repair signals in malignant cells and in clusters exclusive to recurrent tumors are in line with their higher mitotic activity, but also provide an explanation for the accumulation of genomic instability in anaplastic meningiomas. Although homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B is a diagnostic marker of high-grade meningioma, the expression of its gene product increased from low to non-deleted high-grade cases. Differences between subgroups in lymphocyte and myeloid cell infiltration, representing a majority of tumor mass in low-grade NF2 tumors, could be assigned to cluster-specific interaction with tumor cells. Activation to a more proinflammatory phenotype and decreased infiltration of myeloid cells in high-grade cases correlated with lower expression of CSF1, located on chromosome arm 1p, whose deletion is known as prognostic marker, with no proposed mechanism before. Our results demonstrate a robust molecular subclassification of a tumor type across multiple layers, provide insight into heterogeneous growth dynamics despite shared pathognomonic mutations, and highlight immune infiltration modulation as a novel target for meningioma therapy.",

    "abstract": "Many membraneless organelles are thought to be biomolecular condensates formed by phase separation of proteins and other biopolymers. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) can impact protein phase separation behavior, although for many PTMs this aspect of their function is unknown. O-linked {beta}-D-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is an abundant form of intracellular glycosylation whose roles in regulating biomolecular condensate assembly and dynamics have not been delineated. Using an in vitro approach, we found that O-GlcNAcylation reduces the phase separation propensity of the EWS N-terminal low complexity region (LCRN) under different conditions, including in the presence of the arginine-and glycine-rich RNA-binding domains (RBD). O-GlcNAcylation enhances fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) within EWS LCRN condensates and causes the droplets to exhibit more liquid-like relaxation following fusion. Following extended incubation times, EWS LCRN+RBD condensates exhibit diminished FRAP, indicating a loss of fluidity, while condensates containing the O-GlcNAcylated LCRN do not. In HeLa cells, EWS is less O-GlcNAcylated following OGT knockdown and more prone to aggregation based on a filter retardation assay. Relative to the human proteome, O-GlcNAcylated proteins are enriched with regions that are predicted to phase separate, suggesting a general role of O-GlcNAcylation in regulation of biomolecular condensates.\n\nInsert Table of Contents artwork here\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/443654v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a09fb6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1556f47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fcd76borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a2dbda_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG For Table of Contents only.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric pressure plasmas have been widely applied in surface modification and biomedical treatment due to its ability to generate highly reactive radicals and charged particles. In negative-stain electron microscopy (Neg-EM) and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), plasmas have been used in eliminating the surface contaminants as well as generating the hydrophilic surface to embed the specimen on grids. Plasma treatment is a prerequisite for negative stain and quantifoil grids, which are coated with hydrophobic carbon on the grid surface. Here we introduce a non-thermal atmospheric plasma jet system as an alternative new tool for surface treatment. Unlike the conventional glow discharger, we found that the plasma jet system successfully cleans the grid surface and introduces hydrophilicity on grids in the ambient environment without introducing a vacuum. Therefore, we anticipate the plasma jet system will be beneficial in many aspects, such as cost-effective, convenient, versatile, and potential applications in surface modification for both negative stain and cryo-EM grid treatment.",

    "abstract": "Phytochromes (Phys) are known as red/far-red light photoreceptors and are responsible for directing the photosensory responses across the species, majorly from fungal, bacterial and plant kingdoms. Such responses majorly include photosynthetic potential and pigmentation in bacteria, whereas in a plant, they are involved in chloroplast development and photomorphogenesis. Many prokaryotic Phys have been modelled for their structural and functional analysis, but their plant counterparts have not been explored yet. To date, only the crystal structures of the photo-sensing module (PSM) of PhyB isoform from Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max have been resolved experimentally. Thus, in this study, we elucidated the complete 3D structure of Citrus PhyB. Initially, the structure and organisation of the Citrus PhyB have been predicted computationally, which were found to have the same domain organisation as A. thaliana and G. max PhyBs, yet their considerable distinct structural difference indicated potential divergence in signaling and functioning. Therefore, to evaluate the structural and functional implications of Citrus PhyB, we compared its structure with A. thaliana and G. max PhyBs using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches. The modeling studies revealed that the region of Citrus PhyB-GAF domain possibly contributes to the variations between Citrus, A. thaliana and G. max PhyBs structures/functions. Hence, structural and molecular insights into Citrus PhyB can help to discover the Phys signaling and thus, an essential framework can be designed for optogenetic reagents and various agricultural/horticulture benefits.\n\nOne sentence summaryA complete Citrus PhyB structure together with photo-sensory and out-put modules provides significant information to evaluate its biological activities for agricultural benefits.",

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology to characterize PIP2 binding sites in a human Kv7.2 channel. In the closed state, PIP2 localizes to the periphery of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD). In the open state, PIP2 binds to 4 distinct interfaces formed by the cytoplasmic ends of the VSD, the gate, intracellular helices A and B and their linkers. PIP2 binding induces bilayer-interacting conformation of helices A and B and the correlated motion of the VSD and the pore domain, whereas charge-neutralizing mutations block this coupling and reduce PIP2 sensitivity of Kv7.2 channels by disrupting PIP2 binding.

    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic polymers vital for cellular physiology. Bulk tubulin polymerization is nucleation dependent, while individual filaments exhibit  dynamic instability driven by GTP hydrolysis rates. Although MTs assembled from well-studied animal brain tubulins have very comparable nucleation and GTP-hydrolysis rates, the kinetic rates of evolutionarily more distant species could diverge. Here we focus on a plant tubulin, the legume Vigna sp. (mung bean) to test the effect of kinetic diversification on MT polymerization. We activity purify tubulin from seedlings and find MT filaments are fewer and shorter than animal brain tubulin. We find mung tubulin polymerization kinetics is nucleation dependent with a high rate of GTP hydrolysis and a critical concentration lower than previously reported for tubulins. A computational model of the kinetics based on the relative influence of rates of nucleation and hydrolysis demonstrates increased rates of hydrolysis can affect MT filament numbers and their lengths, as compared to increasing nucleation rates. Our approach provides a framework to compare the effect of evolutionary diversification of MT nucleation and elongation.",

    "abstract": "NEIL1 is a DNA glycosylase that recognizes and initiates base excision repair of oxidized bases. The ubiquitous ssDNA binding scaffolding protein replication protein A (RPA) modulates NEIL1 activity in a manner that depends on DNA structure. Interaction between NEIL1 and RPA has been reported, but the molecular basis of this interaction has yet to be investigated. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that NEIL1 interacts with RPA through two contact points. An interaction with the RPA32C protein recruitment domain was mapped to a motif in the common interaction domain (CID) of NEIL1 and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 200 nM was measured. A substantially weaker secondary interaction with the tandem RPA70AB ssDNA binding domains was also mapped to the CID. Together these two contact points reveal NEIL1 has a high overall affinity (Kd [~] 20 nM) for RPA. A homology model of the complex of RPA32C with the NEIL1 RPA binding motif in the CID was generated and used to design a set of mutations in NEIL1 to disrupt the interaction, which was confirmed by ITC. The mutant NEIL1 remains catalytically active against ionizing radiation-induced DNA lesions in duplex DNA in vitro. Testing the functional effect of disrupting the NEIL1-RPA interaction in vivo using a Fluorescence Multiplex-Host Cell Reactivation (FM-HCR) reporter assay revealed that RPA interaction is not required for NEIL1 activity against oxidative damage in duplex DNA, and furthermore revealed an unexpected role for NEIL1 in nucleotide excision repair. These findings are discussed in the context of the role of NEIL1 in replication-associated repair.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) cancers mitigate the action of chemotherapeutics through drug efflux that occurs via ABC (ATP-Binding Cassette) transporters, including P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp or ABCB1/MDR1). Because Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) agonist immunotherapies elicit abscopal anti-tumoral effects by modulating the activity of bystander tumor infiltrating immune cells, they not only circumvent the neutralizing effects of drug efflux, but could also work in synergy with this process. However, the effect of drug resistance on TLR agonist efflux is largely unknown. We begin to address this by investigating P-gp mediated efflux of model TLR agonists in cancer cell lines before and after acquired drug resistance. First, we used functionalized liposomes to determine that imidazoquinoline TLR agonists Imiquimod, Resiquimod, and Gardiquimod are substrates for P-gp. Next, we created Doxorubicin-resistant cancer cell lines from B16 melanoma, TRAMP prostate, and 4T1 breast cancer and observed that each cell line increased P-gp expression in response to Doxorubicin. Comparing imidazoquinoline efflux in Doxorubicin-resistant cell lines, relative to parent cancer cell lines, we used P-gp competitive substrates and inhibitors to demonstrate that imidazoquinoline efflux occurs through P-gp and is enhanced as a consequence of acquired drug resistance. We found that the most hydrophobic, yet least potent imidazoquinoline (Imiquimod), was the best substrate for efflux. This suggests a new parameter, susceptibility to drug efflux, could be an important consideration in the rationale design of the next generation of TLR agonist immunotherapies that are targeted to cancer cells, yet effect their mechanisms of action by modulating the activity of tumor infiltrating immune cells.",

Developing resistant varieties represents a useful method of disease control, and thus, understanding the genetic basis for leaf rust resistance is required.

Afterwards, a consensus map with a total length of 4567 cM consisting of different types of markers (SSR, DArT, Chip-based SNP markers and SNP markers from GBS) was used for QTL projection, and meta-QTL analysis was performed on 320 QTLs. A total of 75 genetic map positions (gmQTLs) were discovered and refined to 15 high confidence mQTLs (hcmQTLs). The candidate genes discovered within the hcmQTL interval were then checked for differential expression using data from three transcriptome studies, resulting in 92 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The expression of these genes in various leaf tissues during wheat development was explored. This study provides insight into leaf rust resistance in wheat and thereby provides an avenue for developing resistant varieties by incorporating the most important hcmQTLs.",

    "abstract": "DWARF14 (D14) is an [a]/{beta}-hydrolase and receptor for the plant hormone strigolactone (SL) in angiosperms. Upon SL perception, D14 works with MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2) to trigger polyubiquitination and degradation of DWARF53(D53)-type proteins in the SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE (SMXL) family. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate knockout alleles of the two homoeologous D14 genes in the Nicotiana benthamiana genome. The Nbd14a,b double mutant had several phenotypes that are consistent with the loss of SL perception in other plants, including increased axillary bud outgrowth, reduced height, shortened petioles, and smaller leaves. A ratiometric fluorescent reporter system was used to monitor degradation of SMXL7 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtSMXL7) after transient expression in N. benthamiana and treatment with the strigolactone analog GR24. AtSMXL7 was degraded after treatment with GR245DS, which has the stereochemical configuration of SLs, as well as its enantiomer GR24ent-5DS . In Nbd14a,b leaves, AtSMXL7 abundance was unaffected by GR24. Transient coexpression of AtD14 with the AtSMXL7 reporter in Nbd14a,b restored the degradation response to GR24, but required an active catalytic triad. With this platform, we evaluated the ability of several AtD14 mutants that had not been characterized in plants to target AtSMXL7 for degradation.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology seeks to develop modular bio-circuits that combine to produce complex, controllable behaviors. These designs are often subject to noisy fluctuations and uncertainties, and most modern synthetic biology design processes have focused to create robust components to mitigate the noise of gene expression and reduce the heterogeneity of single-cell responses. However, deeper understanding of noise can achieve control goals that would otherwise be impossible. We explore how an \"Optogenetic Maxwell Demon\" could selectively amplify noise to control multiple cells using single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) feedback. Using data-constrained stochastic model simulations and theory, we show how an appropriately selected stochastic SIMO controller can drive multiple different cells to different user-specified configurations irrespective of initial condition. We explore how controllability depends on cells regulatory structures, the amount of information available to the controller, and the accuracy of the model used. Our results suggest that gene regulation noise, when combined with optogenetic feedback and non-linear biochemical auto-regulation, can achieve synergy to enable precise control of complex stochastic processes.",

    "abstract": "One important approach to human brain mapping is to define a set of distinct regions that can be linked to unique functions. Numerous brain parcellations have been proposed, using cytoarchitectonic, structural or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The intrinsic smoothness of brain data, however, poses a problem for current methods seeking to compare different parcellations. For example, criteria that simply compare within-parcel to between-parcel similarity provide even random parcellations with a high value. Furthermore, the evaluation is biased by the spatial scale of the parcellation. To address this problem, we propose the Distance Controlled Boundary Coefficient (DCBC), an unbiased criterion to evaluate discrete parcellations. We employ this new criterion to evaluate existing parcellations of the human neocortex in their power to predict functional boundaries for an fMRI data set with many different tasks, as well as for resting-state data. We find that common anatomical parcellations do not perform better than chance, suggesting that task-based functional boundaries do not align well with sulcal landmarks. Parcellations based on resting-state fMRI data perform well; in some cases, as well as a parcellation defined on the evaluation data itself. Finally, multi-modal parcellations that combine functional and anatomical criteria perform substantially worse than those based on functional data alone, indicating that functionally homogeneous regions often span major anatomical landmarks. Overall, the DCBC advances the field of functional brain mapping by providing an unbiased metric that compares the predictive ability of different brain parcellations to define brain regions that are functionally maximally distinct.",

We report that OCM determines the functional and gene expression profile of human macrophages. PMX induces the acquisition of a p53-dependent proinflammatory gene signature in human monocyte-derived macrophages (GM-MO). Indeed, OCM blockade reprograms GM-MO towards a state of LPS-tolerance at the signaling and functional levels, an effect abolished by folinic acid. Importantly, OCM blockade led to reduced expression of membrane-bound and soluble CD14 (sCD14), whose exogenous addition restores LPS sensitivity. The therapeutic relevance of these results was confirmed in early RA patients, as MTX-responder RA patients exhibit lower sCD14 serum levels, with baseline sCD14 levels predicting MTX response. Our results indicate that OCM is a metabolic circuit that critically mediates the acquisition of innate immune tolerance, and positions sCD14 as a valuable tool to predict MTX-response in RA patients.",

Although macrophages are densely distributed throughout the human intestine, our understanding of how gut macrophages maintain tissue homeostasis is limited.

LpM comprise subsets with proinflammatory properties and subsets high antigen presenting and phagocytic capacity. The latter are strategically positioned close to the surface epithelium. Most MM differentiate along two trajectories; one that upregulates genes associated with immune activation and angiogenesis, whereas the other upregulates genes associated with neuronal homeostasis. Importantly, MM are located adjacent to neurons and vessels. Cell-cell interaction and gene network analysis indicated that survival, migration, transcriptional reprogramming, and niche-specific localization of LpM and MM are controlled by an extensive interaction with tissue-resident cells and a few key transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cell suppression of T cells is a key determinant of viral pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. This process involves perforin-dependent elimination of activated CD4 T cells during the first three days of infection. Although this mechanism requires cell-cell contact, NK cells and T cells typically reside in different compartments of lymphoid tissues at steady state. Here, we show that NK-cell suppression of T cells is associated with a transient accumulation of NK cells within T cell-rich sites of the spleen during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is required for relocation to T-cell zones and suppression of antiviral T cells. Accordingly, this NK-cell migration is mediated by type I interferon (IFN)-dependent promotion of CXCR3 ligand expression. In contrast, adenoviral vectors that weakly induce type I IFN and do not stimulate NK-cell inhibition of T cells also do not promote measurable redistribution of NK cells to T-cell zones. Provision of supplemental IFN could rescue NK-cell migration during adenoviral vector immunization. Thus, type I IFN and CXCR3 are critical for properly positioning NK cells to constrain antiviral T-cell responses. Development of strategies to curtail migration of NK cells between lymphoid compartments may enhance vaccine-elicited immune responses.",

This resulted in elevated levels of intracellular calcium for prolonged period following caffeine. Our findings show that delayed re-uptake of calcium was caused by changes in phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN), a major regulator of SR calcium reuptake. PI3K{gamma}-/- cardiomyocytes show significantly reduced PLN phosphorylation due to increase in PLN-associated protein phosphatase (PP) activity as reflected by decreased demethylated-PP2A. Consistently, the altered calcium regulation in the cardiomyocytes of PI3K{gamma}-/- can be restored by inhibition of PP by okadaic acid. Unexpectedly, cardiomyocyate-specific overexpression of kinase-dead PI3K{gamma} PI3K{gamma}inact) in the global PI3K{gamma}-/- cardiomyocytes normalized caffeine induced calcium reuptake, restored PLN phosphorylation, and decreased PLN-associated PP activity reflected by increased demethylated-PP2A.\n\nConclusionsThese studies bring-to-fore an unrecognized regulation of PLN by PI3K{gamma} through PP2A with implications in deleterious cardiac remodeling as PI3K{gamma} is significantly upregulated following cardiac stress.",

    "abstract": "Genetic editing has revolutionized biotechnology but delivery of endonuclease genes as DNA can lead to aberrant integration or overexpression, leading to off-target effects. Here we develop a mechanism to deliver Cre recombinase as a protein by engineering the bacterial type six secretion system (T6SS). Using multiple T6SS fusion proteins, Aeromonas dhakensis or attenuated Vibrio cholerae donor strains, and a gain-of-function cassette for detecting Cre recombination, we demonstrate successful delivery of active Cre directly into recipient cells. Most efficient transfer was achieved using a truncated version of PAAR2 from V. cholerae, resulting in a relatively small (118 amino acid)  delivery tag. We further demonstrate the versatility of this system by delivering an exogenous effector, TseC, enabling V. cholerae to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This implicates that P. aeruginosa is naturally resistant to all native effectors of V. cholerae and that the TseC chaperone protein is not required for its activity. Moreover, it demonstrates that the engineered system can improve T6SS efficacy against specific pathogens, proposing future application in microbiome manipulation or as a next-generation antimicrobial. Inexpensive and easy to produce, this protein delivery system has many potential applications ranging from studying T6SS effectors to genetic editing.\n\nImportanceDelivery of protein-based drugs, antigens, and gene-editing agents has broad applications. The type VI protein secretion system (T6SS) can target both bacteria and eukaryotic cells and deliver proteins of diverse size and function. Here we harness the T6SS to successfully deliver Cre recombinase to genetically edit bacteria without requiring the introduction of exogenous DNA into the recipient cells. This demonstrates a promising advantage over current genetic editing tools that require transformation or conjugation of DNA. The engineered secretion tag can also deliver a heterologous antimicrobial toxin that kills an otherwise unsusceptible pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results demonstrate the potential of T6SS-mediated delivery in areas including genome editing, killing drug-resistant pathogens, and studying toxin functions.",

    "abstract": "The structure of communities is influenced by many ecological and evolutionary processes, but the way this manifests in classic biodiversity patterns often remains unclear. Here, we aim to distinguish the ecological footprint of selection - through competition or environmental filtering - from that of neutral processes that are invariant to species identity. We build on existing Massive Eco-evolutionary Synthesis Simulations (MESS), which uses information from three biodiversity axes - species abundances, genetic diversity, and trait variation - to distinguish between mechanistic processes. In order to correctly detect and characterise competition, we add a new and more realistic form of competition that explicitly compares the traits of each pair of individuals. Our results are qualitatively different to those of previous work in which competition is based on the distance of each individuals trait to the community mean. We find that our new form of competition is easier to identify in empirical data compared to the alternatives. This is especially true when trait data are available and used in the inference procedure. Our findings hint that signatures in empirical data previously attributed to neutrality may in fact be the result of pairwise-acting selective forces. We conclude that gathering more different types of data, together with more advanced mechanistic models and inference as done here, could be the key to unravelling the mechanisms of community assembly.",

One such example is bacterial biofilms, which are surface-attached aggregates of bacterial cells embedded in an extracellular matrix. However, how bacterial growth coordinates with cell-surface interactions to create distinctive, long-range order in biofilms remains elusive. Here we report a collective cell reorientation cascade in growing Vibrio cholerae biofilms, leading to a differentially ordered, spatiotemporally coupled core-rim structure reminiscent of a blooming aster. Cell verticalization in the core generates differential growth that drives radial alignment of the cells in the rim, while the radially aligned rim in turn generates compressive stresses that expand the verticalized core. Such self-patterning disappears in adhesion-less mutants but can be restored through opto-manipulation of growth. Agent-based simulations and two-phase active nematic modeling reveal the strong interdependence of the driving forces for the differential ordering. Our findings provide insight into the collective cell patterning in bacterial communities and engineering of phenotypes and functions of living active matter.",

However, how neuronal EVs contribute to trans-neuronal signaling is largely elusive. We examined the role of neuron-derived EVs in neuronal morphogenesis downstream signaling induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We found that EVs perpetuated BDNF induction of dendrite complexity and synapse maturation in naive hippocampal neurons, which was dependent on the activity of three microRNAs, miR-132-5p, miR-218 and miR-690. These microRNAs were up-regulated in BDNF-stimulated EVs. Moreover, supplementation with BDNF-EVs rescued the block of BDNF-induced phenotypes upon inhibition of miRNA activity. Our data therefore suggest a major role for EVs in BDNF-dependent morphogenesis, and provide new evidence for the functional transfer of microRNAs between neurons. This is not only an important step towards understanding the function of EVs in inter-neuronal signaling, but is also relevant for many disorders characterized by decreased BDNF signaling, such as major depression or cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Projection neurons are the commonest neuronal type in the mammalian forebrain and their individual characterization is a crucial step to understand how neural circuitry operates. These cells have an axon whose arborizations extend over long distances, branching in complex patterns and/or in multiple brain regions. Axon length is a principal estimate of the functional impact of the neuron, as it directly correlates with the number of synapses formed by the axon in its target regions; however, its measurement by direct 3D axonal tracing is a slow and labor-intensive method. On the contrary, axon length estimations have been recently proposed as an effective and accessible alternative, allowing a fast approach to the functional significance of the single neuron. Here, we analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the most used length estimation tools - design-based stereology by virtual planes or spheres, and mathematical correction of the 2D projected-axon length - in contrast with direct measurement, to quantify individual axon length. To this end, we computationally simulated each tool, applied them over a dataset of 951 3D-reconstructed axons (from NeuroMorpho.org), and compared the generated length values with their 3D reconstruction counterparts. Additionally, the computational results were compared with estimated and direct measurements of individual axon lengths performed on actual brain tissue sections, to analyze the practical difficulties and biases arising in real cases. The evaluated reliability of each axon length estimation method is then balanced with the required human effort, experience and know-how, and economic affordability. This work, therefore, aims to provide a constructive benchmark to help guide the selection of the most efficient method for measuring specific axonal morphologies according to the particular circumstances of the conducted research.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCharacterization of single neurons is a crucial step to understand how neural circuitry operates. Visualization of individual neurons is feasible thanks to labelling techniques that allows precise measurements at cellular resolution. This milestone gave access to powerful estimators of the functional impact of a neuron, such as axon length. Although techniques relying on direct 3D reconstruction of individual axons are the gold standard, handiness and accessibility are still an issue. Indirect estimations of axon length have been proposed as agile and effective alternatives, each offering different solutions to the accuracy-cost tradeoff. In this work we report a computational benchmarking between three experimental tools used for axon length estimation on brain tissue sections. Performance of each tool was simulated and tested for 951 3D-reconstructed axons, by comparing estimated axon lengths against direct measurements. Assessment of suitability to different research and funding circumstances is also provided, taking into consideration factors such as training expertise, economic cost and required equipment, alongside methodological results. These findings could be an important reference for research on neuronal wiring, as well as for broader studies involving neuroanatomical and neural circuit modelling.",

    "abstract": "Diarrheal disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves, is strongly associated with the health and composition of the gut microbiome. Clostridioides difficile is an opportunistic pathogen that proliferates and can produce enterotoxins when the host experiences gut dysbiosis. However, even asymptomatic colonization with C. difficile can be associated with differing degrees of microbiome disruption in a range of species, including people, swine, and dogs. Little is known about the interaction between C. difficile and the gut microbiome in dairy calves. In this study, we sought to define microbial features associated with C. difficile colonization in pre-weaned dairy calves less than 2 weeks of age. We characterized the fecal microbiota of 80 calves from 23 different farms using 16S rRNA sequencing and compared the microbiota of C. difficile-positive (n=24) and C. difficile-negative calves (n=56). Farm appeared to be the greatest source of variability in the gut microbiota. When controlling for calf age, diet, and farm location, there was no significant difference in Shannon alpha diversity (P= 0.50) or in weighted UniFrac beta diversity (P=0.19) between C. difficile-positive and -negative calves. However, there was a significant difference in beta diversity as assessed using Bray-Curtiss diversity (P=0.0077), and C. difficile-positive calves had significantly increased levels of Ruminococcus (gnavus group) (Adj. P=0.052), Lachnoclostridium (Adj. P=0.060), Butyricicoccus (Adj. P=0.060), and Clostridium sensu stricto 2 compared to C. difficile-negative calves. Additionally, C. difficile-positive calves had fewer microbial co-occurrences than C. difficile-negative calves, indicating reduced bacterial synergies. Thus, while C. difficile colonization alone is not associated with dysbiosis and is therefore unlikely to result in an increased likelihood of diarrhea in dairy calves, it may be associated with a more disrupted microbiota.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome of the anaerobic digester (AD) regulates the level of energy production. To assess the microbiome dysbiosis in different stages of anaerobic digestion, we analyzed 16 samples dividing into four groups (Group-I = 2; Group-II = 5; Group-III = 5 and Group-IV = 4) through whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). The physicochemical analysis revealed that highest CH4 production (74.1%, on Day 35 of digestion) was associated with decreased amount of non-metal (phosphorus and sulfur) and heavy metals (chromium, lead and nickel). The WMS generated 380.04 million reads mapped to ~ 2800 distinct bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes through PathoScope (PS) and MG-RAST (MR) analyses. The PS analysis detected 768, 1421, 1819 and 1774 bacterial strains in Group-I, Group-II, Group-III and Group-IV, respectively which were represented by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres (> 93.0% of the total abundances). The archaeal fraction of the AD microbiomes was represented by 343 strains, of which 95.90% strains shared across these metagenomes. The indicator species analysis showed that Methanosarcina vacuolate, Dehalococcoides mccartyi, Methanosarcina sp. Kolksee and Methanosarcina barkeri were the highly specific for energy production in Group-III and Group-IV. However, most of the indicator phylotypes displayed reduced abundance in the initial stage of biogas production (Group-I and Group-II) compared to their increased relative abundances in Group-IV (Day 35). The correlation network analysis showed that different strains of Euryarcheota and Firmicutes phyla were associated with highest level (74.1%) of energy production (Group-IV). In addition to taxonomic dysbiosis, top CH4 producing microbiomes showed increased genomic functional activities related to one carbon and biotin metabolism, oxidative stress, proteolytic pathways, MT1-MMP pericellular network, acetyl-CoA production, motility and chemotaxis. This study reveals distinct changes in composition and diversity of the AD microbiomes including different indicator species, and their genomic features that are highly specific for energy production.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBacillus virus Bam35 is the model Betatectivirus and member of the Tectiviridae family, which is composed of tailless, icosahedral, and membrane-containing bacteriophages. The interest in these viruses has greatly increased in recent years as they are thought to be an evolutionary link between diverse groups of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. Additionally, betatectiviruses infect bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group, known for their applications in industry and notorious since it contains many pathogens. Here, we present the first protein-protein interactions network for a tectivirus-host system by studying the Bam35-Bacillus thuringiensis model using a novel approach that integrates the traditional yeast two-hybrid system and Illumina high-throughput sequencing. We generated and thoroughly analyzed a genomic library of Bam35s host B. thuringiensis HER1410 and screened interactions with all the viral proteins using different combinations of bait-prey couples. In total, this screen resulted in the detection of over 4,000 potential interactions, of which 183 high-confidence interactions were defined as part of the core virus-host interactome. Overall, host metabolism proteins and peptidases are particularly enriched within the detected interactions, distinguishing this host-phage system from the other reported host-phage protein-protein interaction networks (PPIs). Our approach also suggests biological roles for several Bam35 proteins of unknown function, resulting in a better understanding of the Bam35-B. thuringiensis interaction at the molecular level.\n\nAO_SCPLOWUTHORC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWSUMMARYC_SCPLOWMembers of the family Tectiviridae, composed of non-tailed icosahedral, membrane-containing bacteriophages, have been increasingly scrutinized in recent years for their possible role in the origin of dsDNA viruses. In particular, the genus Betatectivirus receives increased attention as these phages can infect clinical strains as well as industrially relevant members of the B. cereus group. However, little is known about the interactions between these temperate viruses and their hosts. Here, we present the first high-throughput study of tectivirus-host protein-protein interactions focusing on Bam35, model virus of betatectiviruses, and its host B. thuringiensis, an important entomopathogenic bacterium. We adapted the well-known technique yeast-two-hybrid and integrated high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics for the downstream analysis of the results which enables large-scale analysis of protein-protein interactions. In total, 182 detected interactions show an enrichment in host metabolic proteins and peptidases, in contrast with the current knowledge on host-phage PPIs. Specific host-viral protein-protein interactions were also detected enabling us to propose functions for uncharacterized proteins.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria causing chronic infections are often found in cell aggregates suspended in polymer secretions, and aggregation may be a factor in infection persistence. One aggregation mechanism, called depletion aggregation, is driven by physical forces between bacteria and polymers. Here we investigated whether the depletion mechanism can actuate the aggregating effects of P. aeruginosa exopolysaccharides for suspended (i.e. not surface attached) bacteria, and how depletion affects bacterial inter-species interactions. We found cells overexpressing the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, but not alginate remained aggregated after depletion-mediating conditions were reversed. In co-culture, depletion aggregation had contrasting effects on P. aeruginosas interactions with coccus- and rod-shaped bacteria. Depletion caused S. aureus (cocci) and P. aeruginosa (rods) to segregate from each other, S. aureus to resist secreted P. aeruginosa antimicrobial factors, and the species to co-exist. In contrast, depletion aggregation caused P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia sp. to intermix, enhancing type VI secretion inhibition of Burkholderia by P. aeruginosa, leading to P. aeruginosa dominance. These results show that in addition to being a primary cause of aggregation in polymer-rich suspensions, physical forces inherent to the depletion mechanism can actuate the aggregating effects of self-produced exopolysaccharides and determine species distribution and composition of bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein mediates innate antiviral responses, including responses to certain coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have previously shown that ultraviolet-A (UVA) therapy can prevent virus-induced cell death in human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells (HTEpC) infected with coronavirus-229E, and that UVA treatment results in an increase in intracellular levels of MAVS. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanisms by which UVA light can activate MAVS, and whether local UVA light application can activate MAVS at locations distant from the light source (such as via cell-to-cell communication). MAVS levels were compared in HTEpC exposed to 2 mW/cm2 narrow band (NB)-UVA for 20 minutes and in unexposed controls, at 30-40% and at 100% confluency. MAVS levels were also compared in unexposed HTEpC treated with supernatants or lysates from UVA-exposed cells or from unexposed controls. Also, MAVS was assessed in different sections of confluent monolayer plates where only one section was exposed to NB-UVA. The results show that UVA increases the expression of MAVS protein. Cells in a confluent monolayer exposed to UVA were able to confer an elevation in MAVS in cells adjacent to the exposed section, and even cells in the most distant sections not exposed to UVA. In this study, human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells exposed to UVA demonstrate increased MAVS protein, and also appear to transmit this influence to distant confluent cells not exposed to light.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in gene expression are widespread in the liver, where a large number of autosomal factors act in tandem with growth hormone signaling to regulate individual variability of sex differences in liver metabolism and disease. Here, we compare hepatic transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles of mouse strains C57Bl/6J and CAST/EiJ, representing two subspecies separated by 0.5-1 million years of evolution, to elucidate the actions of genetic factors regulating liver sex differences. We identify 144 protein coding genes and 78 lncRNAs showing strain-conserved sex bias; many have gene ontologies relevant to liver function, are more highly liver-specific and show greater sex bias, and are more proximally regulated than genes whose sex bias is strain-dependent. The strain-conserved genes include key growth hormone-dependent transcriptional regulators of liver sex bias; however, three other transcription factors, Trim24, Tox, and Zfp809, lose sex-biased expression in CAST/EiJ mouse liver. To elucidate these strain specificities in expression, we characterized the strain-dependence of sex-biased chromatin opening and enhancer marks at cis regulatory elements (CREs) within expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) regulating liver sex-biased genes. Strikingly, 208 of 286 eQTLs with strain-specific, sex-differential effects on expression were associated with a complete gain, loss, or reversal of expression sex differences between strains. Moreover, 166 of the 286 eQTLs were linked to the strain-specific gain or loss of localized sex-biased CREs. Remarkably, a subset of these CREs lacked strain-specific genetic variants yet showed coordinated, strain-dependent sex-biased epigenetic regulation. Thus, we directly link hundreds of strain-specific genetic variants to the high variability in CRE activity and expression of sex-biased genes, and uncover underlying genetically-determined epigenetic states controlling liver sex bias in genetically diverse mouse populations.\n\nAuthor summaryMale-female differences in liver gene expression confer sex differences in diverse biological processes relevant to human health and disease, but are difficult to model in inbred mice given their identical genetic backgrounds. Outbred mice provide some variability, but cross-strain studies of sex bias in rodents have not been well studied. Here we elucidate the actions of genetic factors regulating liver sex differences in two Diversity Outbred mouse founder mouse strains, C57Bl/6 and CAST/EiJ. We find that many of the strain differences in sex-biased gene expression can be linked to the gain or loss of a cis regulatory element associated with one or more strain-specific sequence variants. Strikingly, in many cases, the associated cis regulatory element lacked strain-specific variants, yet was subject to coordinated, strain-dependent epigenetic regulation. Thus, harnessing the power of naturally occurring genetic diversity of Diversity Outbred mice, we integrated biological data at the genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic levels across evolutionary divergent mouse strains to discover hundreds of localized genomic regions that control phenotypic sex differences in the liver. These findings may serve as a model for studies of human genetic variation and the effect of population-wide variation on sex differences in health and disease.",

T. cruzi maxicircles have a common architecture composed of four regions: coding region (CR), AT-rich region, short (SR) and long repeats (LR). Distribution of genes, both in order and in strand orientation are conserved, being the main differences the presence of deletions affecting genes coding for NADH dehydrogenase subunits, reinforcing biochemical findings that indicate that complex I is not functional in T. cruzi. Moreover, the presence of complete minicircles into maxicircles of some strains lead us to think about the origin of minicircles. Finally, a careful phylogenetic analysis was conducted using coding regions of maxicircles from up to 29 strains, and 1023 single copy nuclear genes from all of the DTUs, clearly establishing that taxonomically T. cruzi is a complex of species composed by group 1 that contains clades A, B and D, and group 2 containing clade C. No significant differences were found in hybrid strains that justify the existence of TcV and Tc VI as separate clades: our results indicate that a unique event of hybridization between TcII and TcIII occurred. Three variants of maxicircles exist in T. cruzi: a, b and c, in correspondence with clades A, B, and C from mitochondrial phylogenies. While A and C carry maxicircles a and c respectively, both clades B and D carry b maxicircle variant; hybrid strains also carry the b- variant. We then propose a new nomenclature that is self-descriptive and makes use of both the phylogenetic relationships and the maxicircle variants present in T. cruzi.",

    "abstract": "In model organisms, epigenome dynamics underlies a plethora of biological processes. The role of epigenetic modifications in development and parasitism in nematode pests remains unknown. The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita adapts rapidly to unfavorable conditions, despite its asexual reproduction. However, the mechanisms underlying this remarkable plasticity and their potential impact on gene expression remain unknown. This study provides the first insight into contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to this plasticity, by studying histone modifications in M. incognita. The distribution of five histone modifications revealed the existence of strong epigenetic signatures, similar to those found in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We investigated their impact on chromatin structure and their distribution relative to transposable elements (TE) loci. We assessed the influence of the chromatin landscape on gene expression at two developmental stages: eggs, and pre-parasitic juveniles. H3K4me3 histone modification was strongly correlated with high levels of expression for protein-coding genes implicated in stage-specific processes during M. incognita development. We provided new insights in the dynamic regulation of parasitism genes kept under histone modifications silencing. In this pioneering study, we establish a comprehensive framework for the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of the genome expression and its stability in plant-parasitic nematodes.\n\nAuthor summaryThe nematode Meloidogyne incognita is one of the most destructive plant parasites worldwide. Its ability to infect a wide range of hosts and its high adaptability contribute to its parasitic success. We investigated the role of epigenetic mechanisms -- specifically post-translational histone modifications -- in the parasitic life cycle. We showed these modifications are linked to gene expression regulation and likely contribute to nematode development and pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "One aspect of natural language comprehension is understanding how many of what or whom a speaker is referring to. While previous work has documented the neural correlates of general number comprehension and quantity comparison, we investigate semantic number from a cross-linguistic perspective with the goal of identifying cortical regions involved in distinguishing plural from singular nouns. We use three fMRI datasets in which Chinese, French, and English native speakers listen to an audiobook of a childrens story in their native language. We select these three languages because they differ in their number semantics. While Chinese lacks nominal pluralization, French and English nouns are overtly marked for number. We find a number of known semantic processing regions in common, including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the pars orbitalis, in which cortical activation is greater for plural than singular nouns and posit a cross-linguistic role for number in semantic comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation concentrates biomolecules, which should benefit RNA viruses that must sequester viral and host factors during an infection. Here, the p26 movement protein from Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) was found to phase separate and partition in nucleoli and G3BP stress granules (SGs) in vivo. Electrostatic interactions drive p26 phase separation as mutation of basic (R/K-G) or acidic (D/E-G) residues either blocked or reduced phase separation, respectively. During infection, p26 must partition inside the nucleolus and interact with fibrillarin (Fib2) as a pre-requisite for systemic trafficking of viral RNAs. Partitioning of p26 in pre-formed Fib2 droplets was dependent on p26 phase separation suggesting that phase separation of viral movement proteins supports nucleolar partitioning and virus movement. Furthermore, viral ribonucleoprotein complexes containing p26, Fib2, and PEMV2 RNA were formed via phase separation in vitro and could provide the basis for self-assembly in planta. Interestingly, both R/K-G and D/E-G p26 mutants failed to support systemic trafficking of a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) vector in Nicotiana benthamiana suggesting that p26 phase separation, proper nucleolar partitioning, and systemic movement are intertwined. p26 also partitioned in SGs and G3BP over-expression restricted PEMV2 accumulation >20-fold. Expression of phase separation-deficient G3BP only restricted PEMV2 5-fold, demonstrating that G3BP phase separation is critical for maximum antiviral activity.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPhase separation of several cellular proteins is associated with forming pathological aggregates and exacerbating neurodegenerative disease progression. In contrast, roles for viral protein phase separation in RNA virus lifecycles are less understood. Here, we demonstrate that the p26 movement protein from Pea enation mosaic virus 2 phase separates and partitions with phase-separated cellular proteins fibrillarin and G3BP. The related orthologue from Groundnut rosette virus has been extensively studied and is known to interact with fibrillarin in the nucleolus as a pre-requisite for virus movement. We determined that basic residues and electrostatic interactions were critical for p26 phase separation. Furthermore, mutation of charged residues prevented the rescue of a movement-deficient Tobacco mosaic virus vector in Nicotiana benthamiana. Stress granules form through phase separation and we found that p26 could partition inside stress granules following heat shock. Phase separation of the stress granule nucleator G3BP was required for maximum antiviral activity and constitutes a host response that is dependent on cellular protein phase separation. Collectively, we demonstrate that phase separation of a plant virus protein facilitates virus-host interactions that are required for virus movement and phase separation of cellular proteins can simultaneously restrict virus replication.",
