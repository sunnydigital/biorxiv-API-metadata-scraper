    "abstract": "Humans have the ability to store and retrieve memories with various degrees of specificity, and recent advances in reinforcement learning have identified benefits to learning when past experience is represented at different levels of temporal abstraction. How this flexibility might be implemented in the brain remains unclear. We analyzed the temporal organization of rat hippocampal population spiking to identify potential substrates for temporally flexible representations. We examined activity both during locomotion and during memory-associated population events known as sharp wave-ripples (SWRs). We found that spiking during SWRs is rhythmically organized with higher event-to-event variability than spiking during locomotion-associated population events. Decoding analyses using clusterless methods further indidate that similar spatial experience can be replayed in multiple SWRs, each time with a different rhythmic structure whose periodicity is sampled from a lognormal distribution. This variability increases with experience despite the decline in SWR rates that occurs as environments become more familiar. We hypothesize that the variability in temporal organization of hippocampal spiking provides a mechanism for storing experiences with various degrees of specificity.",

    "abstract": "The ability to regulate and withhold an immediate behaviour in pursuit of a more preferred or valuable, albeit delayed, outcome is regarded as an important cognitive ability enabling adaptive decision-making in both social and asocial contexts. Abilities to cope with a delay in gratification have been investigated in a range of species using a variety of experimental paradigms. The present study attempts a first systematic evaluation of available experimental data from non-human animals, which is an essential basis for quantifying biological and non-biological factors (e.g. socio-ecology versus experimental design) affecting performance in delay of gratification tasks. Data were sourced from 52 separate studies, and a comprehensive overview of the available literature on delay of gratification in non-human animals is presented. We present data from 21 species, spanning across eight taxonomic order, with 1-9 species tested per taxonomic group. We highlight variation in experimental paradigms used to study delay of gratification abilities in non-human animals, both with regard to reward type or experimental setup, and discuss the implications for comparative analyses. We conclude that, at present, cross-species comparisons of delay of gratification abilities are hindered by a lack of consistency in experimental designs and low number of species tested across taxonomic orders. We hope to stimulate research on a more diverse set of species, and that future studies consider potential social and ecological factors that cause intra-specific variation in test performances, that is repeatedly seen across species.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of neuromuscular function is critical for understanding pathophysiological changes related to motor system dysfunction in many rodent disease models. Among methods used for quantification of grip performance in rodents, gauge-based grip strength meters provide the most reliable results, however, such instruments are unaffordable by many laboratories. Here we demonstrate how to build a rodent grip strength apparatus from scratch using a digital kitchen scale, an empty cage, and a microcontroller, with both hardware and software being completely open-source to enable maximal modularity and flexibility of the instrument in concordance with the principles of open-source bioinstrumentation. Furthermore, we test the griPASTA system for assessment of increased muscular rigidity in the proof-of-concept experiment in the rat model of Parkinsons disease induced by intrastriatal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Finally, the importance of bioinstrumental customization is demonstrated by utilizing griPASTA for assessment of trial speed from initial-to-maximal deflection time segments and controlling for its potential confounding effects on the grip strength.\n\nSignificance StatementNeuromuscular function analyzed by grip strength performance tests is an integral part of motor system neuroscience and neurotoxicology. Strain gauge-based grip strength meters provide the most reliable results, however, commercial solutions are unaffordable by many. Consequently, cheap semi-quantitative tests are often used at the expense of precision and reliability. We propose griPASTA - a simple and robust open-source grip strength platform made from an ordinary kitchen scale. griPASTA could improve the quality and reproducibility of grip strength experiments by enabling researchers to obtain quantitative grip strength data in high resolution using a highly customizable platform.",

    "abstract": "Honey bees utilize their circadian rhythms to accurately predict the time of day. This ability allows foragers to remember the specific timing of food availability and its location for several days. Previous studies have provided strong evidence toward light/dark cycles being the primary Zeitgeber for honey bees. Work in our laboratory described large individual variation in the endogenous period length of honey bee foragers from the same colony and differences in the endogenous rhythms under different constant temperatures. In this study, we further this work by examining temperature inside the honey bee colony. By placing temperature and light data loggers at different locations inside the colony we measured temperature at various locations within the colony. We observed significant oscillations of temperature inside the hive, that show seasonal patterns. We then simulated the observed temperature oscillations in the laboratory and found that using the temperature cycle as a Zeitgeber, foragers present large individual differences in the phase of locomotor rhythms with respect to temperature. Moreover, foragers successfully synchronize their locomotor rhythms to these simulated temperature cycles. Advancing the cycle by six hours, resulted in changes in the phase of activity in some foragers in the assay. The results shown in this study highlight the importance of temperature as a potential Zeitgeber in the field. Future studies will examine the possible functional and evolutionary role of the observed phase differences of circadian rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated neurons (iPSC-neurons) are a widely used cellular model in the research of the central nervous system. However, it is unknown how well they capture age-associated processes, particularly given that pluripotent cells are only present during the earliest stages of mammalian development. Epigenetic clocks utilize coordinated age-associated changes in DNA methylation to make predictions that correlate strongly with chronological age. It has been shown that the induction of pluripotency rejuvenates predicted epigenetic age. As existing clocks are not optimized for the study of brain development, we developed the fetal brain clock (FBC), a bespoke epigenetic clock trained in human prenatal brain samples in order to investigate more precisely the epigenetic age of iPSCs and iPSC-neurons. The FBC was tested in two independent validation cohorts across a total of 194 samples, confirming that the FBC outperforms other established epigenetic clocks in fetal brain cohorts. We applied the FBC to DNA methylation data from iPSCs and iPSC-derived neuronal precursor cells and neurons, finding that these cell types are epigenetically characterized as having an early fetal age. Furthermore, while differentiation from iPSCs to neurons significantly increases epigenetic age, iPSC-neurons are still predicted as being fetal. Together our findings reiterate the need to better understand the limitations of existing epigenetic clocks for answering biological research questions and highlight a limitation of iPSC-neurons as a cellular model of age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cytokinin (CK) is an important plant developmental regulator, having activities in many aspects of plant life and its response to the environment. CKs are involved in diverse processes in the plant, including stem-cell maintenance, vascular differentiation, growth and branching of roots and shoots, leaf senescence, nutrient balance and stress tolerance. In some cases, phytopathogens secrete CKs. It has been suggested that to achieve pathogenesis in the host, CK-secreting biotrophs manipulate CK signaling to regulate the host cell cycle and nutrient allocation. CK is known to induce host plant resistance to several classes of phytopathogens from a handful of works, with induced host immunity via salicylic acid signaling suggested to be the prevalent mechanism for this host resistance.\n\nHere, we show that CK directly inhibits the growth, development, and virulence of fungal phytopathogens. Focusing on Botrytis cinerea (Bc), we demonstrate that various aspects of fungal development can be reversibly inhibited by CK. We also found that CK affects both budding and fission yeast in a similar manner. Investigating the mechanism by which CK influences fungal development, we conducted RNA-NGS on mock and CK treated B. cinerea samples, finding that CK inhibits the cell cycle, cytoskeleton, and endocytosis. Cell biology experiments demonstrated that CK affects cytoskeleton structure and cellular trafficking in Bc, lowering endocytic rates and endomembrane compartment sizes, likely leading to reduced growth rates and arrested developmental programs. Mutant analyses in yeast confirmed that the endocytic pathway is altered by CK.\n\nOur work uncovers a remarkably conserved role for a plant growth hormone in fungal biology, suggesting that pathogen-host interactions resulted in fascinating molecular adaptations on fundamental processes in eukaryotic biology.\n\nImportanceCytokinins (CKs), important plant growth/ developmental hormones, have previously been associated with host disease resistance. Here, we demonstrate that CK directly inhibits the growth, development, and virulence of B. cinerea (Bc) and many additional phytopathogenic fungi. Molecular and cellular analyses revealed that CK is not toxic to Bc, but rather, Bc likely recognizes CK and responds to it, resulting in cell cycle and individual cell growth retardation, via downregulation of cytoskeletal components and endocytic trafficking. Mutant analyses in yeast confirmed that the endocytic pathway is a CK target. Our work demonstrates a conserved role for CK in yeast and fungal biology, suggesting that suggesting that pathogen-host interactions may cause molecular adaptations on fundamental processes in eukaryotic biology.",

Through ligandreceptor pairs, cells coordinate complex processes such as development, homeostasis, and immune response. In this work, we model the ligand-receptor-mediated cell-to-cell communication network as a weighted directed hypergraph. In this mathematical model, collaborating cell types are considered as a node community while the ligand-receptor pairs connecting them are considered a hyperedge community. We first define the community structures in a weighted directed hypergraph and develop an exact community detection method to identify these communities. We then modify approximate community detection algorithms designed for simple graphs to identify the nodes and hyperedges within each community. Application to synthetic hypergraphs with known community structure confirmed that one of the proposed approximate community identification strategies, named HyperCommunity algorithm, can effectively and precisely detect embedded communities. We then applied this strategy to two organism-wide datasets and identified putative community structures. Notably the method identifies non-overlapping edge-communities mediated by different sets of ligand-receptor pairs, however node-communities can overlap.",

    "abstract": "The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) is a group of about 30 neurons that resides on the stomach in decapod crustaceans. Its two central pattern generators (CPGs) control the chewing action of the gastric mill and the peristaltic movement of food through the pylorus to the gut. The STG has been studied extensively because it has properties that are common to all nervous systems and because of the small number of neurons and other features that make it convenient to study. So many details are known that the STG is considered a classic test case in neuroscience for the reductionist strategy of explaining the emergence of macro-level phenomena from micro-level data. In spite of the intense scrutiny the STG has received, how it generates its rhythmic patterns of bursts remains unknown.\n\nThe explicit neural networks proposed here model the pyloric CPG of the American lobster (Homarus americanus). The models share enough significant features with the lobsters CPG that they may be considered first approximations, or perhaps simplified versions, of STG architecture. The similarities include 1) mostly inhibitory synapses; 2) pairs of cells with reciprocal inhibitory inputs, complementary outputs that are approximately 180 degrees out of phase, and state changes occurring with the high output changing first; 3) cells that have reciprocal, inhibitory inputs with more than one other cell; and 4) six cells that produce coordinated oscillations with the same period, four phases distributed approximately uniformly over the period, and half of the burst durations approximately 1/4 of the period and the other half 3/8.\n\nEach models connectivity is explicit, and its operation depends only on minimal neuron capabilities of excitation and inhibition. One model performs a function that fills a gap in standard ring oscillators. It is apparently new to engineering, making it an example of neuroscience and logic circuit design informing each other.\n\nSome models are derived from standard circuit designs by moving each negation symbol from one end of a connection to the other. This does not change the logic of the network, but it changes each logic gate to one that can be implemented with a single neuron.",

Here we present SigProfilerExtractor, an automated tool for accurate de novo extraction of mutational signatures for all types of somatic mutations. Benchmarking with a total of 34 distinct scenarios encompassing 2,500 simulated signatures operative in more than 60,000 unique synthetic genomes and 20,000 synthetic exomes demonstrates that SigProfilerExtractor outperforms thirteen other tools across all datasets with and without noise. For genome simulations with 5% noise, reflecting high-quality genomic datasets, SigProfilerExtractor outperforms other approaches by elucidating between 20% and 50% more true positive signatures while yielding more than 5-fold less false positive signatures. Applying SigProfilerExtractor to 4,643 whole-genome sequenced and 19,184 whole-exome sequenced cancers reveals four previously missed mutational signatures. Two of the signatures are confirmed in independent cohorts with one of these signatures associating with tobacco smoking. In summary, this report provides a reference tool for analysis of mutational signatures, a comprehensive benchmarking of bioinformatics tools for extracting mutational signatures, and several novel mutational signatures including a signature putatively attributed to direct tobacco smoking mutagenesis in bladder cancer and in normal bladder epithelium.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiological tissues consist of heterogenous populations of cells. Because gene expression patterns from bulk tissue samples reflect the contributions from all cells in the tissue, understanding the contribution of individual cell types to the overall gene expression in the tissue is fundamentally important. We recently developed a computational method, CDSeq, that can simultaneously estimate both sample-specific cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles using only bulk RNA-Seq counts from multiple samples. Here we present an R implementation of CDSeq (CDSeqR) with significant performance improvement over the original implementation in MATLAB and an added new function to aid cell type annotation. The R package would be of interest for the broader R community.\n\nResultWe developed a novel strategy to substantially improve computational efficiency in both speed and memory usage. In addition, we designed and implemented a new function for annotating the CDSeq estimated cell types using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This function allows users to readily interpret and visualize the CDSeq estimated cell types. In addition, this new function further allows the users to annotate CDSeq-estimated cell types using marker genes. We carried out additional validations of the CDSeqR software using synthetic, real cell mixtures, and real bulk RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.\n\nConclusionsThe existing bulk RNA-seq repositories, such as TCGA and GTEx, provide enormous resources for better understanding changes in transcriptomics and human diseases. They are also potentially useful for studying cell-cell interactions in the tissue microenvironment. Bulk level analyses neglect tissue heterogeneity, however, and hinder investigation of a cell-type-specific expression. The CDSeqR package may aid in silico dissection of bulk expression data, enabling researchers to recover cell-type-specific information.",

    "abstract": "In biomedical imaging studies, numerous methods have been used to capture human data, mostly by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). However, due to being inexpensive and accessibility of Microsoft Kinect, its usage has been significantly increased in recent years. In this study, we aimed to represent the procedure of data acquisition, which includes a set of depth images from individuals back surfaces. The goal of image acquisition is to investigate spinal deformities and landmark detection of the back surface. Traditional imaging systems are challenging, most notably because of ionized beams in the data acquisition process, which has not been solved yet. Indeed, noninvasiveness is the most crucial advantage of our study. Our imaging system was set in a dim laboratory, and the University approved the ethical letter of Medical Sciences before data acquisition. After that, the subjects (total 105; 50 women and 55 men) were recruited, and data images were captured from the back surface. Then, we increased the imaging data size by using the augmentation method to use deep learning methods in future works. Finally, this Dataset leads us to the desired output in our study procedure.",

Here, we describe CRISPRpath, a scalable screening strategy for parallelly characterizing CREs of genes linked to the same biological pathway and converging phenotypes. We demonstrate the ability of CRISPRpath for simultaneously identifying functional enhancers of six genes in the 6-thioguanine-induced DNA mismatch repair pathway using both CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR nuclease (CRISPRn) approaches. 60% of the identified enhancers are known promoters with distinct epigenomic features compared to other active promoters, including increased chromatin accessibility and interactivity. Furthermore, by imposing different levels of selection pressure, CRISPRpath can distinguish enhancers exerting strong impact on gene expression from those exerting weak impact. Our results offer a nuanced view of cis-regulation and demonstrate that CRISPRpath can be leveraged for understanding the complex gene regulatory program beyond transcriptional output at scale.",

    "abstract": "Patients harboring mutations in the PI3K-AKT-MTOR signaling pathway often develop a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy. A significant proportion of them remain unresponsive to conventional anti-seizure medications. Understanding mutation-specific pathophysiology is thus critical for molecularly targeted therapies. We previously determined that mouse models expressing patient-related activating mutation in PIK3CA are epileptic and acutely treatable with PI3K inhibition, irrespective of dysmorphology (Roy et al. 2015). Using the same mutant model, we have now identified physiological mechanisms underlying the dysregulated neuronal excitability and its acute attenuation. We show that Pik3ca-driven hyperexcitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons is mediated by changes in multiple non-synaptic, cell-intrinsic properties. These are distinct from mechanisms driving epilepsy in TSC/RHEB models. Further, we report that acute inhibition of PI3K or AKT, but not MTOR, suppresses the intrinsic epileptiform nature of the mutant neurons. These data represent an important step towards precision therapeutics against intractable epilepsy, using pathway drugs originally developed as anti-cancer agents.",

    "abstract": "Cell death plays a critical role in inflammatory responses. During pyroptosis, inflammatory caspases cleave Gasdermin D (GSDMD) to release an N-terminal fragment that generates plasma membrane pores that mediate cell lysis and IL-1 cytokine release. Terminal cell lysis and IL-1{beta} release following caspase activation can be uncoupled in certain cell types or in response to particular stimuli, a state termed hyperactivation. However, the factors and mechanisms that regulate terminal cell lysis downstream of GSDMD cleavage remain poorly understood. In the course of studies to define regulation of pyroptosis during Yersinia infection, we identified a line of Card19-deficient mice (Card19lxcn) whose macrophages were protected from cell lysis and showed reduced apoptosis and pyroptosis, yet had wild-type levels of caspase activation, IL-1 secretion, and GSDMD cleavage. Unexpectedly, CARD19, a mitochondrial CARD-containing protein, was not directly responsible for this, as two independently-generated CRISPR/Cas9 Card19 knockout mice showed no defect in macrophage cell lysis, and expression of CARD19 in Card19lxcn macrophages did not restore cell lysis. Card19 is located on chromosome 13, adjacent to Ninj1, which was recently reported to regulate cell lysis downstream of GSDMD activation. Intriguingly, RNA-seq and western blotting revealed that Card19lxcn BMDMs are hypomorphic for NINJ1 expression, and reconstitution of Ninj1 in Card19lxcn immortalized BMDMs restored cell lysis. Card19lxcn mice exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to Yersinia infection, demonstrating that cell lysis itself plays a key role in protection against bacterial infection. Our findings identify genetic targeting of Card19 being responsible for off-target effects on the adjacent Ninj1 gene, thereby disrupting the ability of macrophages to undergo plasma membrane rupture downstream of gasdermin cleavage and impacting host survival and bacterial control during Yersinia infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryProgrammed cell death is critical for regulating tissue homeostasis and host defense against infection. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that couples cell lysis with release of inflammatory cytokines. Cell lysis is triggered by activation of particular intracellular pore forming proteins, but how regulation of cell lysis occurs is not well understood. Genetic targeting of Card19 on chromosome 13 resulted in decreased expression of the adjacent gene, Ninj1 which was recently found to regulate terminal lysis events in response to cell death-inducing stimuli. We found that macrophages from Card19-deficient mice were resistant to multiple forms of cell death in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, including canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation, as well as triggers of cell-extrinsic apoptosis. Notably, Card19-deficient mice were more susceptible to Yersinia infection, indicating that cell lysis contributes to control of bacterial infections. Our data provide new insight into the impact of terminal cell lysis on control of bacterial infection and highlight the role of additional factors that regulate lytic cell death downstream of gasdermin cleavage.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural basis of the remarkable human cognitive capacity to learn novel concepts from just one or a few sensory experiences constitutes a fundamental problem. We propose a simple, biologically plausible, mathematically tractable, and computationally powerful neural mechanism for few-shot learning of naturalistic concepts. We posit that the concepts that can be learnt from few examples are defined by tightly circumscribed manifolds in the neural firing rate space of higher order sensory areas. We further posit that a single plastic downstream readout neuron learns to discriminate new concepts based on few examples using a simple plasticity rule. We demonstrate the computational power of our proposal by showing it can achieve high few-shot learning accuracy on natural visual concepts using both macaque inferotemporal cortex representations and deep neural network models of these representations, and can even learn novel visual concepts specified only through linguistic descriptors. Moreover, we develop a mathematical theory of few-shot learning that links neurophysiology to behavior by delineating several fundamental and measurable geometric properties of high-dimensional neural representations that can accurately predict the few-shot learning performance of naturalistic concepts across all our numerical simulations. We discuss testable predictions of our theory for psychophysics and neurophysiological experiments.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is a hallmark out-of-equilibrium process in biology. In addition to persistent self-propelled motion, many cells display remarkable adaptive behaviors when they navigate complex environments within the body. Combining theory and experiments, we identify a curvature-sensing mechanism underlying obstacle avoidance in immune-like cells. The genetic perturbation of this machinery leads to a reduced capacity to evade obstructions combined with faster and more persistent cell migration in obstacle-free environments. We propose that the active polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton at the advancing edge of migrating cells is locally inhibited by the curvature-sensitive BAR protein Snx33 in regions with inward plasma membrane curvature. This coupling between actin and membrane dynamics leads to a mechanochemical instability that generates complex protrusive patterns at the cellular front. Adaptive motility thus arises from two simultaneous curvature-dependent effects, i) the specific reduction of propulsion in regions where external objects deform the plasma membrane and ii) the intrinsic patterning capacity due to the membrane-actin coupling that promotes spontaneous changes in the cells protrusions. Our results show how cells utilize actin- and plasma membrane biophysics to sense their environment, allowing them to adaptively decide if they should move ahead or turn away. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the natural diversity of BAR proteins may allow cells to tune their curvature sensing machinery to match the shape characteristics in their environment.",

    "abstract": "New microbial communities often arise through the mixing of two or more separately assembled parent communities, a phenomenon that has been termed \"community coalescence\". Understanding how the interaction structures of complex parent communities determine the outcomes of coalescence events is an important challenge. While recent work has begun to elucidate the role of competition in coalescence, that of cooperation, a key interaction type commonly seen in microbial communities, is still largely unknown. Here, using a general consumer-resource model, we study the combined effects of competitive and cooperative interactions on the outcomes of coalescence events. In order to do so, we simulate coalescence events between pairs of communities with different degrees of competition for shared carbon resources and cooperation through cross-feeding on leaked metabolic by-products (facilitation). We also study how structural and functional properties of post-coalescence communities evolve when they are subjected to repeated coalescence events. We find that in coalescence events, the less competitive and more cooperative parent communities contribute a higher proportion of species to the new community, because this endows superior ability to deplete resources and resist invasions. Consequently, when a community is subjected to repeated coalescence events, it gradually evolves towards being less competitive and more cooperative, as well as more species rich, robust and efficient in resource use. Encounters between microbial communities are becoming increasingly frequent as a result of anthropogenic environmental change, and there is great interest in how the coalescence of microbial communities affects environmental and human health. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms behind microbial community coalescence, and a framework to predict outcomes based on the interaction structures of parent communities.\n\nAuthor summaryIn nature, new microbial communities often arise from the fusion of whole, previously separate communities (community coalescence). Despite the crucial role that interactions among microbes play in the dynamics of complex communities, our ability to predict how these affect the outcomes of coalescence events remains limited. Here, using a general mathematical model, we study how the structure of species interactions confers an advantage upon a microbial community when it encounters another, and how communities evolve after undergoing repeated coalescence events. We find that competitive interactions between species preclude their survival upon a coalescence event, while cooperative interactions are advantageous for post-coalescence survival. Furthermore, after a community is exposed to many coalescence events, the remaining species become less competitive and more cooperative. Ultimately, this drives the community evolution, yielding post-coalescence communities that are more species-rich, productive, and resistant to invasions. There are many potential environmental and health implications of microbial community coalescence, which will benefit from the theoretical insights that we offer here about the fundamental mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania cycle between the phagolysosome of mammalian macrophages, where they reside as rounded intracellular amastigotes, and the midgut of female sand flies, which they colonize as elongated extracellular promastigotes. Previous studies indicated that protein kinase A (PKA) plays an important role in the initial steps of promastigote development into amastigotes. Here, we describe a novel regulatory subunit of PKA (which we have named PKAR3) that is unique to Leishmania and most (but not all) other Kinetoplastea. PKAR3 is localized to subpellicular microtubules (SPMT) in the cell cortex, where it recruits a specific catalytic subunit (PKAC3). Promastigotes of PKAR3 or PKAC3 null mutants lose their elongated shape and are round but remain flagellated. Truncation of an N-terminal formin homology-like domain of PKAR3 results in its detachment from the SPMT, also leading to rounded promastigotes. Thus, the tethering of PKAC3 kinase activity via PKAR3 at the cell cortex is essential for maintenance of the elongated shape of promastigotes. This role of PKAR3 is reminiscent of PKARI{beta} and PKARII{beta} binding to microtubules of mammalian neurons, which is essential for the elongation of dendrites and axons, respectively. Interestingly, PKAR3 does not bind cAMP but nucleoside analogs with a very high affinity similar to the PKAR1 isoform of Trypanosoma. We propose that these early diverged protists have re-purposed PKA for a novel signaling pathway that spatiotemporally controls microtubule remodeling and cell shape via PKA activity.",

Here, we demonstrate that the developmental TF, SIX1, is highly expressed in RMS and is critical to maintain a muscle progenitor-like state. SIX1 loss induces terminal differentiation of RMS cells into myotube-like cells and dramatically impedes tumor growth in vivo.

    "abstract": "Multiple studies have demonstrated less favourable childhood outcomes in infants born in early term (37-38 weeks gestation) compared to those born at full term (40-41 weeks gestation). While this could be due to higher perinatal morbidity, gestational age at birth may also have a direct effect on the brain and subsequent neurodevelopment in term-born babies. Here we characterise structural brain correlates of gestational age at birth in healthy term-born neonates and their relationship to later neurodevelopmental outcome. We used T2 and diffusion weighted Magnetic Resonance Images acquired in the neonatal period from a cohort (n=454) of healthy babies born at term age (>37 weeks gestation) and scanned between 1 and 41 days after birth. Images were analysed using tensor based morphometry (TBM) and tract based spatial statistics (TBSS). Neurodevelopment was subsequently assessed at age 18 months using the Bayley-III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, and the effects of gestational age at birth and related neuroimaging findings on outcome were analysed with linear regression. Infants born earlier had areas of higher relative ventricular volume, and lower relative brain volume in the basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. Earlier birth was also associated with lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean, axial and radial diffusivity in major white matter tracts. Gestational age at birth was positively associated with all Bayley-III subscales at age 18 months. Linear regression models predicting outcome from gestational age at birth were significantly improved by adding neuroimaging features associated with gestational age at birth. This work adds to the growing body of evidence of the impact of early term birth and highlights the importance of considering the effect of gestational age at birth in future neuroimaging studies including term-born babies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnnotation ambiguities and annotation errors are a general challenge in genomics. While a reliable protein function assignment can be obtained by experimental characterization, this is expensive and time-consuming, and the number of such Gold Standard Proteins (GSP) with experimental support remains very low compared to proteins annotated by sequence homology, usually through automated pipelines. Even a GSP may give a misleading assignment when used as a reference: the homolog may be close enough to support isofunctionality, but the substrate of the GSP is absent from the species being annotated. In such cases the enzymes cannot be isofunctional. Here, we examine a variety of such issues in halophilic archaea (class Halobacteria), with a strong focus on the model haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii.\n\nResultsAnnotated proteins of Hfx. volcanii were identified for which public databases tend to assign a function that is probably incorrect. In some cases, an alternative, probably correct, function can be predicted or inferred from the available evidence but this has not been adopted by public databases because experimental validation is lacking. In other cases, a probably invalid specific function is predicted by homology, and while there is evidence that this assigned function is unlikely, the true function remains elusive. We list 50 of those cases, each with detailed background information so that a conclusion about the most likely biological function can be drawn. For reasons of brevity and comprehension, only key aspects are listed in the main text, with detailed information being provided in a corresponding section of the Supplementary Material.\n\nConclusionsCompiling, describing and summarizing these open annotation issues and functional predictions will benefit the scientific community in the general effort to improve the evaluation of protein function assignments and more thoroughly detail them.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith a growing amount of (multi-)omics data being available, the extraction of knowledge from these datasets is still a difficult problem. Classical enrichment-style analyses require predefined pathways or gene sets that are tested for significant deregulation to assess whether the pathway is functionally involved in the biological process under study. De novo identification of these pathways can reduce the bias inherent in predefined pathways or gene sets. At the same time, the definition and efficient identification of these pathways de novo from large biological networks is a challenging problem.\n\nResultsWe present a novel algorithm, DeRegNet, for the identification of maximally deregulated subnetworks on directed graphs based on deregulation scores derived from (multi-)omics data. DeRegNet can be interpreted as maximum likelihood estimation given a certain probabilistic model for de-novo subgraph identification. We use fractional integer programming to solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We can show that the approach outperforms related algorithms on simulated data with known ground truths. On a publicly available liver cancer dataset we can show that DeRegNet can identify biologically meaningful subgraphs suitable for patient stratification. DeRegNet is freely available as open-source software.\n\nConclusionThe proposed algorithmic framework and its available implementation can serve as a valuable heuristic hypothesis generation tool contextualizing omics data within biomolecular networks.",

    "abstract": "Arrhythmia is a marked symptom of many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The accurate and timely detection of heart rate can greatly reduce the harm of arrhythmia to people. However, it is still a challenge to robustly and remotely measure heart rate in daily life due to the changing environmental conditions during measurement, such as the varying light intensity, the movement of people, and the uncertain distance between the sensor to people. In this study, we propose a method to accurately measure human heart rate within a distance of 4.5 meters under different light intensities by simply using a surveillance camera. After a 20-second color video of a persons hand is captured by the camera, a method based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm is designed to extract the blood volume pulse wave to calculate the heart rate. According to the comparison between the real heart rate and results measured by electrocardiography (ECG), the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 95.8% when the measurement is performed within a distance of 4.5 meters and 90% when within 5.0 meters. Our experiments show that when the illuminance varies between 100-1000 lux (lighting level indoor), we still get the correct results. Our experiments also demonstrate that the proposed method accurately obtain heart rate even when the light intensity is below 32 lux (300-500 lux in a workplace environment). The methods strong adaptability to changing environmental conditions makes it applicable to many scenarios, such as homes of the elderly, classrooms, and other public spaces.",

We aimed to detect microbial signatures that might predict response to the low FODMAP diet and assess whether microbiota compositional and functional shifts could provide insights into its mode of action.\n\nDesignWe used metagenomics to determine high-resolution taxonomic and functional profiles of the stool microbiota from IBS cases and household controls (n=56 pairs) on their usual diet. Clinical response and microbiota changes were studied in 41 pairs after 4 weeks on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nResultsUnsupervised analysis of baseline IBS cases pre-diet identified two distinct microbiota profiles, which we refer to as IBSP (pathogenic-like) and IBSH (health-like) subtypes. IBSP microbiomes were enriched in Firmicutes and genes for amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, but depleted in Bacteroidetes species. IBSH microbiomes were similar to controls. On the low FODMAP diet IBSH and control microbiota were unaffected, but the IBSP signature shifted towards a health-associated microbiome with an increase in Bacteroidetes (p=0.009), a decrease in Firmicutes species (p=0.004) and normalization of primary metabolic genes. The clinical response to the low FODMAP diet was greater in IBSP subjects compared to IBSH (p = 0.02).\n\nConclusion50% of IBS cases manifested a  pathogenic gut microbial signature. This shifted towards the healthy profile on the low FODMAP diet; and IBSP cases showed an enhanced clinical responsiveness to the dietary therapy.

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTimely assessments are critical to providing early intervention and better hearing and spoken language outcomes for children with hearing loss. To facilitate faster diagnostic hearing assessments in infants, the authors developed the parallel auditory brainstem response (pABR), which presents randomly timed trains of tone pips at five frequencies to each ear simultaneously. The pABR yields high-quality waveforms that are similar to the standard, single-frequency serial ABR but in a fraction of the recording time. While well-documented for standard ABRs, it is yet unknown how presentation rate and level interact to affect responses collected in parallel. Furthermore, the stimuli are yet to be calibrated to perceptual thresholds. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the optimal range of parameters for the pABR and to establish the normative stimulus level correction values for the ABR stimuli.\n\nDesignTwo experiments were completed, each with a group of 20 adults (18 - 35 years old) with normal hearing thresholds ([&le;] 20 dB HL) from 250 to 8000 Hz. First, pABR electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were recorded for six stimulation rates and two intensities. The changes in component wave V amplitude and latency were analyzed, as well as the time required for all responses to reach a criterion signal-to-noise ratio of 0 dB. Second, behavioral thresholds were measured for pure tones and for the pABR stimuli at each rate to determine the correction factors that relate the stimulus level in dB peSPL to perceptual thresholds in dB nHL.\n\nResultsThe pABR showed some adaptation with increased stimulation rate. A wide range of rates yielded robust responses in under 15 minutes, but 40 Hz was the optimal singular presentation rate. Extending the analysis window to include later components of the response offered further time-saving advantages for the temporally broader responses to low frequency tone pips. The perceptual thresholds to pABR stimuli changed subtly with rate, giving a relatively similar set of correction factors to convert the level of the pABR stimuli from dB peSPL to dB nHL.\n\nConclusionsThe optimal stimulation rate for the pABR is 40 Hz, but using multiple rates may prove useful. Perceptual thresholds that subtly change across rate allow for a testing paradigm that easily transitions between rates, which may be useful for quickly estimating thresholds for different configurations of hearing loss. These optimized parameters facilitate expediency and effectiveness of the pABR to estimate hearing thresholds in a clinical setting.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe pABR yields robust responses across stimulus rates and intensities.\nC_LIO_LIThe optimal rate is 40 Hz, but using multiple rates may prove useful.\nC_LIO_LIThe pABR shows some adaptation with increased stimulation rate.\nC_LIO_LIExtended analysis windows improve response detection for low stimulus frequencies.\nC_LIO_LIBehavioral thresholds subtly change across pABR rate, giving similar dB nHL values.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How do we choose the best action in a constantly-changing environment? Many natural decisions unfold in dynamic environments where newer observations carry better information about the present state of the world. Recent work has shown that rats can learn to optimally discount old evidence, updating their provisional decision when the environmental state changes. Provisional decisions are thought to be represented in the Frontal Orienting Fields (FOF), but this has only been tested in static environments where the provisional and final decisions are not easily dissociated. Here, we characterize the representation of accumulated evidence in rat FOF during decision-making in a dynamic environment. We find that FOF encodes evidence throughout decision formation with a temporal gain modulation that rises until the period when the animal may need to act. Using a behavioral model to predict the timing of changes of mind revealed that FOF neurons respond rapidly to these events, representing the new provisional decisions in their firing rates. Our results suggest that the FOF represents provisional decisions even in dynamic, uncertain environments, allowing for rapid motor execution when it is time to act.",

    "abstract": "SETDB1 is a methyltransferase responsible for the methylation of histone H3-lysine-9, which is mainly related to heterochromatin formation. SETDB1 is overexpressed in various cancer types and is associated with an aggressive phenotype. In agreement with its activity, it mainly exhibits a nuclear localization; however, in several cell types a cytoplasmic localization was reported. Here we show that a substantial cytoplasmic pool of SETDB1 is colocalized with microtubules. Significantly, silencing of SETDB1 led to faster polymerization and reduced rate of catastrophe events of microtubules in parallel to reduced proliferation rate and slower mitotic kinetics. Interestingly, over-expression of either wild-type or catalytic dead SETDB1 altered microtubule polymerization rate to the same extent, suggesting that SETDB1 affects MT dynamics by a methylation-independent mechanism. Finding interaction between SETDB1 and the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 and increased tubulin acetylation levels upon silencing of SETDB1 suggest a model in which SETDB1 affects microtubule dynamics by interacting with both microtubules and HDAC6 to enhance tubulin deacetylation. Overall, our results suggest a novel cytoplasmic role for SETDB1 in the regulation of microtubule dynamics.",

Also, the upregulation of GRINA expression is associated with hypomethylation of its promoter region. Our GRINA-miRNAs network analysis revealed potential regulatory miRNAs regulating the GRINA expression and its downstream pathways. Next, functional enrichment and pathway analysis of genes commonly co-express with GRINA in breast, colon, gastric, and prostate cancers revealed GRINA regulatory pathways. Concurrently, our upstream regulator analysis revealed possible kinases, transcription factors, and proteins that may potentially regulate GRINA.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe effects of hardstyle kettlebell training are increasingly cited in strength and conditioning research, yet reference data from a proficient swing is scarce. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the force profile of a two-handed hardstyle swing performed by a Russian Kettlebell Challenge (RKC) instructor.\n\nMethodsThe subject is a 44-year-old male, body mass 75.6 kg, height 173.5 cm, with six years of regular hardstyle training experience. Two-handed hardstyle swings were performed with a series of incremental mass kettlebells (8-68 kg). Ground reaction force (GRFs) was obtained from a floor-mounted force platform. Force-time curves (FTCs), peak force, forward force, rate of force development (RFD) and swing cadence were investigated.\n\nResultsData revealed the FTC of a proficient swing is highly consistent and dominated by a single force peak (mean SD = 47 N), with a profile that remained largely unchanged to 24 kg. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a very strong positive correlation in peak force with kettlebell mass (r = 0.95), which increased disproportionately from the lightest to heaviest kettlebells; net peak force increased from 8.36 {+/-} 0.75 N.kg-1 (0.85 x BW) to 12.82 {+/-} 0.39 N.kg-1 (1.3x BW). There was a strong negative correlation between RFD and kettlebell mass (r = 0.82) that decreased from 39.2 N.s-1.kg-1 to 21.5 N.s-1.kg-1. There was a very strong positive correlation in forward ground reaction force with kettlebell mass (r = 0.99), expressed as a ratio of vertical ground reaction, that increased from 0.092 (9.2%) to 0.205 (20.5%). Swing cadence exceeded 40 swings per minute (SPM) with all kettlebells.\n\nConclusionOur findings challenge some of the popular beliefs of the hardstyle kettlebell swing. Consistent with hardstyle practice, and previous kinematic analysis of expert and novice, force-time curves show a characteristic single large force peak, differentiating passive from active shoulder flexion. Ground reaction force did not increase proportionate to kettlebell mass, with a magnitude of forward force smaller than described in practice. These results could be useful for coaches and trainers wanting to improve athletic performance, and healthcare providers using the kettlebell swing for therapeutic purposes.

    "abstract": "Cultivation of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) in tropical and subtropical regions can be challenging if flowering behavior of a given cultivar is unknown, poorly understood, or not accurately selected for the photoperiod. Identifying cultivars adapted to local environmental conditions is key to optimizing hemp vegetative and flowering performance. We investigated the effects of varying light cycles in regulating extension growth and flowering response of 15 essential oil and 12 fiber/grain hemp cultivars both in indoors and outdoors. Plants were subjected to eleven photoperiods in the controlled rooms ranging from 12 h to 18 h, and natural day length in the field. The critical photoperiod threshold was identified for seven essential oil cultivars and two fiber/grain cultivars.  Cherry Wine-CC,  PUMA-3, and  PUMA-4 had the shortest critical day length between 13 h 45 min and 14 h. The flowering of essential oil cultivars was generally delayed by 1 to 2 d when photoperiod exceeded 13 h compared to 12 h, and flowering was further delayed by 7 to 8 d when photoperiod exceed 14 h. In fiber/grain cultivars, flowering was generally delayed by 1 to 3 d when day length exceeded 14 h. Flowering for most essential oil cultivars was delayed by 5 to 13 d under 14 h photoperiod compared to 13 h 45 min, suggesting a photoperiod difference as little as 15 min can significantly influence the floral initiation of some essential oil cultivars. Cultivars represented by the same name but acquired from different sources can perform differently under the same environmental conditions, suggesting genetic variation among cultivars with the same name. Average days to flower of fiber/grain cultivars was correlated with reported cultivar origin with faster flowering occurring among northern cultivars when compared to southern cultivars. Plant height generally increased as the day length increased in essential oil cultivars but was not affected in fiber/grain cultivars. In addition, civil twilight of approximately 2 {micro}mol{middle dot}m-2{middle dot}s-1 was discovered to be biologically effective in regulating hemp flowering. Collectively, we conclude that most of the essential oil cultivars and some southern fiber/grain cultivars tested express suitable photoperiods for tropical and sub-tropical region cultivation.",

Heuristic approaches to their analysis have revealed that a small fraction of SWRs appear to \"simulate\" trajectories through the environment--called awake hippocampal replay--while the functional role of a majority of these SWRs remains unclear. Applying a novel probabilistic approach to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics embedded in SWRs, we instead show that almost all SWRs of foraging rodents simulate such trajectories through the environment. Furthermore, these trajectories feature momentum, that is, inertia in their velocities, that mirrors the animals natural movement. This stands in contrast to replay events during sleep which seem to follow Brownian motion without such momentum. Lastly, interpreting the replay trajectories in the context of navigational planning revealed that similar past analyses were biased by the heuristic SWR sub-selection. Overall, our approach provides a more complete characterization of the spatio-temporal dynamics within SWRs, highlights qualitative differences between sleep and awake replay, and ought to support future, more detailed, and less biased analysis of the role of awake replay in navigational planning.",

    "abstract": "Under physiological conditions, peptide-MHC (pMHC) molecules can trigger T-cell receptors (TCRs) as monovalent ligands that are sparsely distributed on the plasma membrane of an antigen-presenting cell. TCR can also be activated by artificial clustering, such as with pMHC tetramers or antibodies; however, these strategies circumvent many of the natural ligand discrimination mechanisms of the T cell and can elicit non-physiological signaling activity. We have recently introduced a synthetic TCR agonist composed of an anti-TCR{beta} Fab antibody fragment covalently bound to a DNA oligonucleotide, which serves as a membrane anchor. This Fab-DNA ligand efficiently activates TCR as a monomer when membrane-associated and exhibits a potency and activation profile resembling agonist pMHC. In this report, we explore the geometric requirements for effective TCR triggering and cellular activation by Fab-DNA ligands. We find that T cells are insensitive to the ligand binding epitope on the TCR complex, but that length of the DNA tether is important. Increasing the intermembrane distance spanned by Fab-DNA:TCR complexes decreases TCR triggering efficiency and T cell activation potency, consistent with the kinetic-segregation model of TCR triggering. These results establish design parameters for construction of synthetic TCR agonists that are able to activate polyclonal T cell populations, such as T cells from a human patient, in a similar manner as the native pMHC ligand.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe report geometric requirements for potent T cell activation by synthetic TCR ligands that mimic biophysical properties of the native pMHC ligand, but have the additional ability to activate polyclonal T cell populations. We find that increasing the space between apposed membranes at TCR binding events decreases ligand potency, but that changing the ligands binding epitope on the TCR has essentially no effect. The observed decrease in potency with increased ligand height is attributed to the longer ligands attenuated ability to trigger TCR at binding events.",

    "abstract": "Markov state models (MSMs) have become one of the preferred methods for the analysis and interpretation of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of conformational transitions in biopolymers. While there is great variation in terms of implementation, a well-defined workflow involving multiple steps is often adopted. Typically, molecular coordinates are first subjected to dimensionality reduction and then clustered into small \"microstates\", which are subsequently lumped into \"macrostates\" using the information from the slowest eigenmodes. However, the microstate dynamics is often non-Markovian and long lag times are required to converge the MSM. Here we propose a variation on this typical workflow, taking advantage of hierarchical density-based clustering. When applied to simulation data, this type of clustering separates high population regions of conformational space from others that are rarely visited. In this way, density-based clustering naturally implements assignment of the data based on transitions between metastable states. As a result, the state definition becomes more consistent with the assumption of Markovianity and the timescales of the slow dynamics of the system are recovered more effectively. We present results of this simplified workflow for a model potential and MD simulations of the alanine dipeptide and the FiP35 WW domain.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and force spectroscopy have demonstrated improvements in rapid acquisition of quantitative data for applications in materials science, surface characterization, and biology. However, conventional AFM technology is limited in detection sensitivity and the ability to excite at off-resonance frequencies restricting broad utility of the technology. Here we demonstrate new AFM cantilevers fabricated with a planar microcoil at the tip region, which can be used to generate or sense highly-localized magnetic fields. Torsion/bending actuation of the cantilevers is accomplished with simple experimental configurations, enabling quantitative and simultaneous mapping of both stiffness and friction at the sample surface with more than one order of magnitude improvement in compositional contrast. Our method is compatible with commercial AFM systems, allowing us to clearly resolve small stiffness and friction variations in copolymer and biological samples that were difficult to detect by conventional AFM methods. In combination with fluorescence microscopy, we also generated localized fields to selectively stimulate and monitor structural changes in viable cells with nm-scale detail. Hybrid AFM cantilevers may be useful to characterize a broad range of complex material surfaces, in addition to combined physical and chemical analyses of single cells and biological microenvironments.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAs the large-scale study of metabolites and a direct readout of a systems metabolic state, metabolomics has significant appeal as a source of information for many metabolic modelling platforms and other metabolic analysis tools. However, metabolomics data are typically reported in terms of relative abundances, which precluding use with tools where absolute concentrations are necessary. While chemical standards can be used to determine the absolute concentrations of metabolites, they are often time-consuming to run, expensive, or unavailable for many metabolites. A computational framework that can infer absolute concentrations without the use of chemical standards would be highly beneficial to the metabolomics community.\n\nResultsWe have developed and characterized MetaboPAC, a computational strategy that leverages the mass balances of a system to infer absolute concentrations in metabolomics datasets. MetaboPAC uses a kinetic equations approach and an optimization approach to predict the most likely response factors that describe the relationship between absolute concentrations and their relative abundances. We determined that MetaboPAC performed significantly better than the other approaches assessed on noiseless data when at least 60% of kinetic equations are known a priori. Under the most realistic conditions (low sampling frequency, high noise data), MetaboPAC significantly outperformed other methods in the majority of cases when 100% of the kinetic equations were known. For metabolomics datasets extracted from systems that are well-studied and have partially known kinetic structures, MetaboPAC can provide valuable insight about their absolute concentration profiles.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence suggests that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may entrain endogenous neural oscillations to match the frequency and phase of the exogenously applied current and this entrainment may outlast the stimulation (although only for a few oscillatory cycles following the cessation of stimulation). However, observing entrainment in the electroencephalograph (EEG) during stimulation is extremely difficult due to the presence of complex tACS artefacts. The present study assessed entrainment to slow oscillatory (SO) tACS by measuring motor cortical excitability across different oscillatory phases during (i.e., online) and outlasting (i.e., offline) stimulation. 30 healthy participants received 60 trials of intermittent SO tACS (0.75 Hz; 16s on / off interleaved) at an intensity of 2mA peak-to-peak. Motor cortical excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the hand region of the primary motor cortex (M1HAND) to induce motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the contralateral thumb. MEPs were acquired at four time-points within each trial - early online, late online, early offline, and late offline - as well as at the start and end of the overall stimulation period (to probe longer-lasting aftereffects of tACS). A significant increase in MEP amplitude was observed from pre-to post-tACS (P = 0.013) and from the first to the last tACS block (P = 0.008). However, no phase-dependent modulation of excitability was observed. Therefore, although SO tACS had a facilitatory effect on motor cortical excitability that outlasted stimulation, there was no evidence supporting entrainment of endogenous oscillations as the underlying mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Current metabolic modeling tools suffer from a variety of limitations, from scalability to simplifying assumptions, that preclude their use in many applications. We recently created a modeling framework, LK-DFBA, that addresses a key gap: capturing metabolite dynamics and regulation while retaining a potentially scalable linear programming structure. Key to this frameworks success are the linear kinetics and regulatory constraints imposed on the system. However, while the linearity of these constraints reduces computational complexity, it may not accurately capture the behavior of many biochemical systems. Here, we developed three new classes of LK-DFBA constraints to better model interactions between metabolites and the reactions they regulate. We tested these new approaches on several synthetic and biological systems, and also performed the first-ever comparison of LK-DFBA predictions to experimental data. We found that no single constraint approach was optimal across all systems examined, and systems with the same topological structure but different parameters were often best modeled by different types of constraints. However, we did find that the optimal constraint approach was generally robust to local perturbations of the system, indicating that just a single wild-type dataset could allow identification of the ideal constraint for a given system. These results suggest that the availability of multiple constraint approaches will allow LK-DFBA to model a wider range of metabolic systems.",

    "abstract": "Infections with enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) cause severe diarrhea in children. The non-invasive bacteria adhere to enterocytes of the small intestine and use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into host cells to modify and exploit cellular processes in favor of bacterial survival and replication. Several studies have shown that the T3SSs of bacterial pathogens are essential for virulence. Furthermore, the loss of T3SS-mediated effector translocation results in increased immune recognition and clearance of the bacteria. The T3SS is, therefore, considered a promising target for antivirulence strategies and novel therapeutics development. Here, we report the results of a high-throughput screening assay based on the translocation of the EPEC effector protein Tir. Using this assay, we screened more than 13,000 small molecular compounds of six different compound libraries and identified three substances which showed a significant dose-dependent effect on translocation without adverse effects on bacterial or eukaryotic cell viability. Additionally, these substances reduced bacterial binding to host cells, effector-dependent cell detachment and abolished A/E lesion formation without affecting the expression of components of the T3SS or associated effector proteins. Moreover, no effects of the inhibitors on bacterial motility or Shiga-toxin expression were observed. In summary, we have identified three new compounds that strongly inhibit T3SS-mediated translocation of effectors into mammalian cells, which could be valuable as lead substances for treating EPEC and EHEC infections.",

    "abstract": "Footrot is a polymicrobial infectious disease in sheep causing severe lameness, leading to one of the industrys biggest welfare problems. The complex aetiology of footrot makes in-situ or in-vitro investigations difficult. Computational methods offer a solution to understanding the bacteria involved, how they may interact with the host and ultimately providing a way to identify targets for future hypotheses driven investigative work. Here we present the first combined global analysis of the bacterial community transcripts together with the host immune response in healthy and diseased ovine feet during a natural polymicrobial infection state using metatranscriptomics. The intra tissue and surface bacterial populations and the most abundant bacterial transcriptome were analysed, demonstrating footrot affected skin has a reduced diversity and increased abundances of, not only the causative bacteria Dichelobacter nodosus, but other species such as Mycoplasma fermentans and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Host transcriptomics reveals a suppression of biological processes relating to skin barrier function, vascular functions, and immunosurveillance in unhealthy interdigital skin, supported by histological findings that type I collagen (associated with scar tissue formation) is significantly increased in footrot affected interdigital skin comparted to outwardly healthy skin. Finally, we provide some interesting indications of host and pathogen interactions associated with virulence genes and the host spliceosome which could lead to the identification of future therapeutic targets.\n\nImpact StatementLameness in sheep is a global welfare and economic concern and footrot is the leading cause of lameness, affecting up to 70% of flocks in the U.K. Current methods for control of this disease are labour intensive and account for approximately 65% of antibiotic use in sheep farming, whilst preventative vaccines suffer from poor efficacy due to antigen competition. Our limited understanding of cofounders, such as strain variation and polymicrobial nature of infection mean new efficacious, affordable and scalable control measures are not receiving much attention. Here we examine the surface and intracellular bacterial populations and propose potential interactions with the host. Identification of these key bacterial species involved in the initiation and progression of disease and the host immune mechanisms could help form the basis of new therapies.",

Since its first discovery in Dec 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has become a global pandemic and caused 3.3 million direct/indirect deaths (2021 May). Amongst the scientific communitys response to COVID-19, data sharing has emerged as an essential aspect of the combat against SARS-CoV-2. Despite the ever-growing studies about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, to date, only a few databases were curated to enable access to gene expression data. Furthermore, these databases curated only a small set of data and do not provide easy access for investigators without computational skills to perform analyses. To fill this gap and advance open-access to the growing gene expression data on this deadly virus, we collected about 1,500 human bulk RNA-seq datasets from publicly available resources, developed a database and visualization tool, named CovidExpress (https://stjudecab.github.io/covidexpress). This open access database will allow research investigators to examine the gene expression in various tissues, cell lines, and their response to SARS-CoV-2 under different experimental conditions, accelerating the understanding of the etiology of this disease to inform the drug and vaccine development. Our integrative analysis of this big dataset highlights a set of commonly regulated genes in SARS-CoV-2 infected lung and Rhinovirus infected nasal tissues, including OASL that were under-studied in COVID-19 related reports. Our results also suggested a potential FURIN positive feedback loop that might explain the evolutional advantage of SARS-CoV-2.",

Calu-3 cells showed greater allicin tolerance due >4-fold increased GSH levels compared to Vero E6. However, biocompatible allicin doses efficiently inhibited viral replication in both cell lines. Proteome analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 cells revealed a strong induction of the antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature (e.g. cGAS, Mx1, IFIT, IFIH, IFI16, IFI44, 25OAS and ISG15), pathways of vesicular transport, tight junctions (KIF5A/B/C, OSBPL2, CLTC1, ARHGAP17) and ubiquitin modification (UBE2L3/5), as well as reprogramming of host metabolism, transcription and translation. Allicin abrogated the ISG host response and reverted the host cellular pathways to levels of uninfected Calu-3 cells, confirming the antiviral and immunomodulatory activity of allicin in the host proteome. Thus, biocompatible doses of allicin could be promising for protection of lung cells against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented global demand for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has demonstrated the need for highly effective vaccine candidates that are thermostable and amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Nanoparticle immunogens presenting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) in repetitive arrays are being advanced as second-generation vaccine candidates, as they feature robust manufacturing characteristics and have shown promising immunogenicity in preclinical models. Here, we used previously reported deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to guide the design of stabilized variants of the RBD. The selected mutations fill a cavity in the RBD that has been identified as a linoleic acid binding pocket. Screening of several designs led to the selection of two lead candidates that expressed at higher yields than the wild-type RBD. These stabilized RBDs possess enhanced thermal stability and resistance to aggregation, particularly when incorporated into an icosahedral nanoparticle immunogen that maintained its integrity and antigenicity for 28 days at 35-40{degrees}C, while corresponding immunogens displaying the wild-type RBD experienced aggregation and loss of antigenicity. The stabilized immunogens preserved the potent immunogenicity of the original nanoparticle immunogen, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Our findings may improve the scalability and stability of RBD-based coronavirus vaccines in any format and more generally highlight the utility of comprehensive DMS data in guiding vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Targeting host factors exploited by multiple viruses could offer broad-spectrum solutions for pandemic preparedness. Seventeen candidates targeting diverse functions emerged in a screen of 4,413 compounds for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. We demonstrated that lapatinib and other approved inhibitors of the ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases suppress replication of SARS-CoV-2, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and other emerging viruses with a high barrier to resistance. Lapatinib suppressed SARS-CoV-2 entry and later stages of the viral life cycle and showed synergistic effect with the direct-acting antiviral nirmatrelvir. We discovered that ErbB1, 2 and 4 bind SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and regulate viral and ACE2 internalization, and they are required for VEEV infection. In human lung organoids, lapatinib protected from SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of ErbB-regulated pathways implicated in non-infectious lung injury, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and epithelial barrier injury. Lapatinib suppressed VEEV replication, cytokine production and disruption of the blood-brain barrier integrity in microfluidic-based human neurovascular units, and reduced mortality in a lethal infection murine model. We validated lapatinib-mediated inhibition of ErbB activity as an important mechanism of antiviral action. These findings reveal regulation of viral replication, inflammation, and tissue injury via ErbBs and establish a proof-of-principle for a repurposed, ErbB-targeted approach to combat emerging viruses.",

    "abstract": "South America is home to the highest freshwater fish biodiversity on Earth1,2. The hotspot of species richness is located in the western Amazon Basin, and richness decreases downstream along the Amazon River towards the mouth at the Atlantic coast (Fig. 1b, c)3,4, which contradicts the positive relationship between stream size and biodiversity that is commonly observed in river systems across the world5,6. We investigate the role of river rerouting events caused by Andean mountain building and repeated episodes of flooding in western Amazonia in shaping the modern-day richness pattern of freshwater fishes in South America. To this end, we combine a reconstruction of river networks following Andean surface uplift since 80 million years ago with a mechanistic biological model simulating dispersal, allopatric speciation and extinction over the dynamic landscape of rivers and lakes. We show that the numerous small river rerouting events in western Amazonia resulting from mountain building produced highly dynamic riverine habitats that caused high diversification rates, shaping the exceptional present-day richness of this region. The history of marine incursions and lakes, including the Miocene Pebas megawetland system in western Amazonia, played a secondary role.

    "abstract": "The unstable nature of freshwater ponds in arid landscapes represent a sizable challenge for strictly aquatic organisms, such as fishes. Yet the Arabian Desert, bordering the coastline of the Red Sea, plays host to a species very well adapted to such extreme environments: the Arabian pupfish, Aphanius dispar. In this study, we estimated patterns of hydrological connectivity; population structure and stable isotope for samples of A. dispar living in small, isolated ponds of nearly-freshwater in the Arabian desert and highly saline coastal lagoons along the Red Sea. The genomic and hydrological analyses indicate that populations are largely separated by drainage origin, as fish from desert ponds appear to be transported to coastal lagoons of the Red Sea along ephemeral river systems arising from flash flood events. Further, our study indicates there is an ecological change when being washed from pond environments to coastal waters, due to a significant shift in muscle stable isotopes ratios between both groups. Considering that the genetic breaks are mostly observed between drainage origin, this study suggests that A. dispar can survive large changes in salinity and ecological regimes over small time-scales.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in enhancers have been shown to often underlie natural variation but the evolved differences between enhancer activity can be difficult to identify in vivo. Threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are a robust system for studying enhancer evolution due to abundant natural genetic variation, a diversity of evolved phenotypes between ancestral marine and derived freshwater forms, and the tractability of transgenic techniques. Previous work identified a series of polymorphisms within an intronic enhancer of the Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (Bmp6) gene that are associated with evolved tooth gain, a derived increase in freshwater tooth number that arises late in development. Here we use a bicistronic reporter construct containing a genetic insulator and a pair of reciprocal two-color transgenic reporter lines to compare enhancer activity of marine and freshwater alleles of this enhancer. In older fish the two alleles drive partially overlapping expression in both mesenchyme and epithelium of developing teeth, but the freshwater enhancer drives a reduced mesenchymal domain and a larger epithelial domain relative to the marine enhancer. In younger fish these spatial shifts in enhancer activity are less pronounced. Comparing Bmp6 expression by in situ hybridization in developing teeth of marine and freshwater fish reveals similar evolved spatial shifts in gene expression. Together, these data support a model in which the polymorphisms within this enhancer underlie evolved tooth gain by shifting the spatial expression of Bmp6 during tooth development, and provide a general strategy to identify spatial differences in enhancer activity in vivo.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) includes some of the most infamous insect pests of cultivated plants including Spodoptera frugiperda, Spodoptera litura and Spodoptera exigua. To effectively develop targeted pest control strategies for diverse Spodoptera species, genomic resources are highly desired. To this aim, we provide the genome assembly and developmental transcriptome comprising all major life stages of S. exigua, the beet armyworm. Spodoptera exigua is a polyphagous herbivore that can feed from > 130 host plants including several economically important crops.\n\nResultsThe 419 Mb beet armyworm genome was sequenced from a female S. exigua pupa. Using a hybrid genome sequencing approach (Nanopore long read data and Illumina short read), a high-quality genome assembly was achieved (N50=1.1 Mb). An official gene set (OGS, 18,477 transcripts) was generated by automatic annotation and by using transcriptomic RNA-seq data sets of 18 S. exigua samples as supporting evidence. In-depth analyses of developmental stage-specific expression in combination with gene tree analyses of identified homologous genes across Lepidoptera genomes revealed potential Spodoptera-specific genes of interest such as mg7 and REPAT46 upregulated during 1st and 3rd instar larval stages for targeted pest-outbreak management.\n\nConclusionsThe beet armyworm genome sequence and developmental transcriptome covering all major developmental stages provides critical insights into the biology of this devastating polyphagous insect pest species with a worldwide distribution. In addition, comparative genomic analyses across Lepidoptera significantly advance our knowledge to further control other invasive Spodoptera species and reveals potential lineage-specific target genes for pest control strategies.",

We here analyzed assembly of the transmembrane (TM)-juxtamembrane (JM) region of EGFR, one of the best studied species of RTKs, by combining single-pair FRET imaging and a nanodisc technique. The JM domain of EGFR contains a threonine residue (Thr654) that is phosphorylated after ligand association. We observed that the TM-JM peptides of EGFR form anionic lipid-induced dimers and cholesterol-induced oligomers. The two forms involve distinct molecular interactions, with a bias towards oligomer formation upon threonine phosphorylation. We further analyzed the functions and oligomerization of whole EGFR molecules, with or without a substitution of Thr654 to alanine, in living cells. The results suggested an autoregulatory mechanism in which Thr654 phosphorylation causes a switch of the major function of EGFR from kinase activation dimers to scaffolding oligomers.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota features important genetic diversity, and the specific spatial features of the gut may shape evolution within this environment. We investigate the fixation probability of neutral bacterial mutants within a minimal model of the gut that includes hydrodynamic flow and resulting gradients of food and bacterial concentrations. We find that this fixation probability is substantially increased compared to an equivalent well-mixed system, in the regime where the profiles of food and bacterial concentration are strongly spatially-dependent. Fixation probability then becomes independent of total population size. We show that our results can be rationalized by introducing an active population, which consists of those bacteria that are actively consuming food and dividing. The active population size yields an effective population size for neutral mutant fixation probability in the gut.\n\nSignificance statementThe human body harbors numerous and diverse bacteria, the vast majority of which are located in the gut. These bacteria can mutate and evolve within the gut, which is their natural environment. This can have important public health implications, e.g. when gut bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance. The gut features specific characteristics, including hydrodynamic flow and resulting gradients of food and bacterial concentrations. How do these characteristics impact the evolution and diversity of gut bacteria? We demonstrate that they can substantially increase the probability that neutral mutants reach high proportions and eventually take over the population. This is because only a fraction of gut bacteria is actively dividing. Thus, the specific environment of the gut enhances neutral bacterial diversity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe mammalian skin, the bodys largest single organ, is a highly organized tissue that forms an essential barrier against dehydration, pathogens, light and mechanical injury. Damage triggers perturbations of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) that spread from cell to cell (known as intercellular Ca2+ waves) in different epithelia, including epidermis. Ca2+ waves are considered a fundamental mechanism for coordinating multicellular responses, however the mechanisms underlying their propagation in the damaged epidermis are incompletely understood.\n\nAIM OF THE PROJECTTo dissect the molecular components contributing to Ca2+ wave propagation in murine model of epidermal photodamage.\n\nMETHODSTo trigger Ca2+ waves, we used intense and focused pulsed laser radiation and targeted a single keratinocyte of the epidermal basal layer in the earlobe skin of live anesthetized mice. To track photodamage-evoked Ca2+ waves, we performed intravital multiphoton microscopy in transgenic mice with ubiquitous expression of the sensitive and selective Ca2+ biosensor GCaMP6s. To dissect the molecular components contributing to Ca2+ wave propagation, we performed in vivo pharmacological interference experiments by intradermal microinjection of different drugs.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTSThe major effects of drugs that interfere with degradation of extracellular ATP or P2 purinoceptors suggest that Ca2+ waves in the photodamaged epidermis are primarily due to release of ATP from the target cell, whose plasma membrane integrity was compromised by laser irradiation. The limited effect of the Connexin 43 (Cx43) selective inhibitor TAT-Gap19 suggests ATP-dependent ATP release though connexin hemichannels (HCs) plays a minor role, affecting Ca2+ wave propagation only at larger distances, where the concentration of ATP released from the photodamaged cell was reduced by the combined effect of passive diffusion and hydrolysis due to the action of ectonucleotidases. The ineffectiveness of probenecid suggests pannexin channels have no role. As GCaMP6s signals in bystander keratinocytes were augmented by exposure to the Ca2+ chelator EGTA in the extracellular medium, the corresponding transient increments of the [Ca2+]c should be ascribed primarily to Ca2+ release from the ER, downstream of ATP binding to P2Y purinoceptors, with Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane channels playing a comparatively negligible role. The effect of thapsigargin (a well-known inhibitor of SERCA pumps) and carbenoxolone (a recently recognized inhibitor of Ca2+ release through IP3 receptors) support this conclusion.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe one presented here is an experimental model for accidental skin injury that may also shed light on the widespread medical practice of laser skin resurfacing, used to treat a range of pathologies from photodamage and acne scars to hidradenitis suppurativa and posttraumatic scarring from basal cell carcinoma excision. The results of our experiments support the notion that Ca2+ waves reflect chiefly the sequential activation of bystander keratinocytes by the ATP released through the compromised plasma membrane of the cell hit by laser radiation. We attributed the observed increments of the [Ca2+]c chiefly to signal transduction through purinergic P2Y receptors. Several studies have highlighted fundamental roles of P2Y receptors during inflammatory and infectious diseases, and the initial phase of wound healing involves acute inflammation. In addition, hyaluronan is a major component of the extracellular matrix and its synthesis is rapidly upregulated after tissue wounding via P2Y receptor activation. It is tempting to speculate that response coordination after injury in the epidermis occurs via propagation of the ATP-dependent intercellular Ca2+ waves described in this work.",

Leaky scanning, which supplies ribosomes to downstream open reading frames (ORFs) by read-through of upstream ORFs, is the most major regulatory mechanism to translate polycistronic mRNAs. However, the general regulatory factors controlling leaky scanning and their biological relevance have rarely been elucidated, with exceptions such as the Kozak sequence. Here, we have analyzed the strategy of a plant RNA virus to translate three movement proteins from a single RNA molecule through leaky scanning. The in planta and in vitro results indicate that significantly shorter 5' UTR of the most upstream ORF promotes leaky scanning, potentially finetuning the translation efficiency of the three proteins in a single RNA molecule to optimize viral propagation. Moreover, in plant endogenous mRNAs, we found that shorter UTRs were more frequently observed in uORFs of polycistronic mRNAs. We propose that the promotion of leaky scanning induced by a short 5' UTR (LISH), together with the Kozak sequence, is a conserved gene regulation mechanism not only in viruses but also in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The tinnitus-inducing agent salicylate reduces cochlear output but causes hyperactivity in higher auditory centres, including the inferior colliculus (the auditory midbrain). Using multi-electrode recording in anaesthetised guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), we addressed the hypothesis that salicylate-induced hyperactivity in the inferior colliculus involves nitric oxide signalling secondary to increased ascending excitatory input.\n\nIn the inferior colliculus, systemic salicylate (200 mg/kg i.p., 0 h) markedly increased spontaneous and sound-driven neuronal firing (3-6 h post drug) with both onset and sustained responses to pure tones being massively increased. Reverse microdialysis of increasing concentrations of salicylate directly into the inferior colliculus (100 {micro}M-10 mM, from 0 h) failed to mimic systemic salicylate. In contrast, it caused a small, transient, increase in sound-driven firing (1 h), followed by a larger sustained decrease in both spontaneous and sound-driven firing (2-5 h). When salicylate was given systemically, reverse microdialysis of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-methyl arginine into the inferior colliculus (500 mM, 2-6 h) completely blocked the salicylate-induced increase in spontaneous and sound-driven neuronal firing.\n\nOur data indicate that systemic salicylate induces neuronal hyperactivity in the auditory midbrain via a mechanism outside the inferior colliculus, presumably upstream in the auditory pathway; and that the mechanism is ultimately dependent on nitric oxide signalling within the inferior colliculus.\n\nGiven that nitric oxide is known to mediate NMDA receptor signalling in the inferior colliculus, we propose that salicylate activates an ascending glutamatergic input to the inferior colliculus and that this is an important mechanism underlying salicylate-induced tinnitus.\n\nGraphical abstractTinnitus is associated with increased activity in the central auditory pathway, an effect replicated by high dose sodium salicylate. Here we show that salicylate-induced increases in neuronal activity in the auditory midbrain are mediated by nitric oxide signalling within this region. Nitric oxide is a key mediator of neuronal responses to NMDA receptor stimulation in this region. Our data support the hypothesis that tinnitus is mediated by increased ascending glutamatergic input to the auditory midbrain.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/444151v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d732dcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14c2314org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1930a33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82d799_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Intestine homeostasis is maintained by the delicate balance of Th17 effector cells and Treg cells. Dysregulation of these cell populations contributes to inflammation, tissue damage, and chronic conditions. ROR{gamma}t is essential for the differentiation of Th17 and a subset of Treg (ROR{gamma}t+ Treg) cells involved in intestinal inflammation. ROR{gamma}t belongs to the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors with hinge regions that are highly flexible for co-activator/co-repressor interactions. Serine 182 at the hinge region of ROR{gamma}t is phosphorylated. This study aims to uncover how S182 on ROR{gamma}t contributes to mucosal homeostasis and diseases. We used CRISRP technology to generate a phosphor-null knock-in mutant mouse line (ROR{gamma}tS182A) to assess its role in intestine physiology. scRNA-seq was performed on WT and ROR{gamma}tS182A cohoused littermates to evaluate colonic T cell heterogeneity under steady state and colitis settings. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that ROR{gamma}tS182 maintains colonic T cell heterogeneity under steady state, without interfering T cell development and differentiation. In inflamed tissues, ROR{gamma}tS182 simultaneously restricts IL-1{beta}-mediated Th17 activities and promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production in LT-like Treg cells. Phospho-null ROR{gamma}tS182A knock-in mice challenged with DSS induced colitis and EAE experienced delayed recovery and exacerbated pathology. The double switch role of ROR{gamma}tS182 is critical in resolving T cell-mediated inflammation and provides a potential therapeutic target to combat autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS) can develop in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial tissue, but the precise pathways of B cell activation and selection are not well understood. Here, we identified a unique B cell population in the synovium characterized by co-expression of a family of orphan nuclear receptors, NR4A1 (also known as NUR77), NR4A2 (NURR1) and NR4A3 (NOR1), that is highly enriched at both early and late stages of RA. NR4A B cells are rare in healthy peripheral blood, RA blood, and SLE kidney, but share markers with blood transcriptomic signatures that peak during RA disease flare. Using combined single cell transcriptomics and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing, we demonstrate that NR4A synovial B cells have an activated transcriptomic profile that significantly overlaps with germinal center (GC) light zone (LZ) B cells and an accrual of somatic hypermutation that correlates with loss of naive B cell status. NR4A B cells uniquely co-express lymphotoxin {beta} and IL6, supporting important functions in ELS promotion and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Further, the presence of shared clones in this activated B cell state and NR4A expressing synovial plasma cells (PC) and the rapid up-regulation with BCR stimulation points to in situ differentiation. Taken together, we identified a dynamic progression of B cell activation in RA synovial ELS, with NR4A transcription factors having an important role in antigen activation and local adaptive immune responses.\n\nOne sentence summaryB cells in the rheumatoid arthritis synovium undergo a spectrum of in situ activation, with the NR4A family of transcription factors having an important role in antigen stimulation, local adaptive immunity, and pathological B cell responses.",

SIRL-1 inhibits myeloid effector functions such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We here identify S100 proteins as SIRL-1 ligands. S100 proteins are composed of two calcium-binding domains. Various S100 proteins are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from damaged cells, after which they initiate inflammation by ligating activating receptors on immune cells. We now show that the inhibitory SIRL-1 recognizes individual calcium-binding domains of all tested S100 proteins. Blocking SIRL-1 on human neutrophils enhanced S100 protein S100A6-induced ROS production, showing that S100A6 suppresses neutrophil ROS production via SIRL-1.

However, the purity of PPs varies across different hPSC lines, differentiation protocols and laboratories. The uncommitted cells may give rise to non-pancreatic endodermal, mesodermal, or ectodermal derivatives in vivo, hampering the safety of hPSC-derived PPs for clinical applications. Recently, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses identified glycoprotein 2 (GP2) as a PP-specific cell surface marker. The GP2-enriched PPs generate higher percentages of beta-like cells in vitro compared to unsorted and GP2- fractions, but their potential in vivo remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the GP2-enriched-PPs give rise to all pancreatic cells in vivo, including functional beta-like cells. Remarkably, GP2 enrichment eliminated the formation of teratoma in vivo. This study establishes that the GP2-enriched PPs represent a safe option for T1D treatment.",

The E. coli was sampled from the river mouth up to the upstream land uses dominated by residential. The E. coli contamination was higher in the river mouth and in residential area as well. Likewise, E. coli contamination was higher during the low tide than high tide. During the high tide, the E. coli contamination were significantly affected by temperature and current (r2>0.5). Meanwhile, during the low tide, there were no dominant environmental factors that affect E. coli contamination. Hence, by knowing the spatial model of E. coli contamination driven by tidal, land use and environmental gradients, this paper has contributed to the advance management of water and river system.",

    "abstract": "The bathypelagic ocean (1000-4000 m depth) is the largest aquatic biome on Earth but it is still largely unexplored. Due to its prevalent low dissolved organic carbon concentrations, most of the prokaryotic metabolic activity is assumed to be associated to particles. The role of free-living prokaryotes has thus been mostly ignored, except that of some chemolithoautotrophic lineages. Here we used a global bathypelagic survey of size-fractionated metagenomic and 16S (genes and transcripts) data and performed a differential abundance analysis to explore the functional traits of the different prokaryotic life-strategies, their contribution to the active microbiome, and the role that the quality of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays in driving this contribution. We found that free-living prokaryotes have limited capacity to uplift their metabolism in response to environmental changes and display comparatively lower growth rates than particle associated prokaryotes, but are responsible for the synthesis of vitamins in the bathypelagic. Furthermore, their contribution to the active prokaryotic microbiome increased towards waters depleted of labile DOM, which represented a large fraction of the tropical and subtropical ocean sampled stations. This points to a relevant yet overlooked role of free-living prokaryotes in DOM cycling in the vast bathypelagic desert.",

We aimed to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of Pterocarpus (Leguminosae/ Fabaceae) to assess whether seed dispersal phenotypes and biome switching explain the current biogeographical patterns of this group.\n\nLocationPantropical\n\nTaxonThe Pterocarpus clade, particularly Pterocarpus (Leguminosae/Fabaceae)\n\nMethodsWe sequenced ~300 nuclear loci captured using Angiosperms-353, a genomic  bait set for flowering plants, from which we generated a time-calibrated phylogenomic tree. To corroborate this, we also generated a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree from data-mined Sanger-sequencing data. We then collated distribution data and fruit dispersal morphology traits to compare trait-dependent and trait-independent biogeographical models, allowing us to assess whether dispersal traits influenced the spatio-temporal evolution of Pterocarpus. Finally, using the results of these model tests, we estimated the ancestral ranges and biomes of Pterocarpus species to better understand their biogeographical history, and assessed the degree and direction of biome switching over the course of Pterocarpus diversification history.\n\nResultsWe recovered well-supported phylogenetic relationships within Pterocarpus, within which there were two subclades - one Neotropical and the other Palaeotropical. Our divergence date estimates suggested that Pterocarpus largely diversified from around 12 Ma, during the Miocene.\n\nTrait-dependent biogeographical models were rejected for both range and biome evolution within Pterocarpus, but models parameterising dispersal were supported. Pterocarpus ancestral node shared a range across the new-world and old-world tropics, followed by divergence into two clades, one palaeotropical and one neotropical. Biome switching occurred most frequently into rainforest and grassland.\n\nMain conclusionsOverall, our analyses suggest that Pterocarpus underwent infrequent cross-continental dispersal and establishment into novel biomes. While this was minimally impacted by fruit dispersal syndromes, biome switching precipitated by long-distance dispersal and environmental change have played an important role in diversification within Pterocarpus since the Miocene.",

In cells, such loop extrusion is challenged by many potential conflicts, e.g., the torsional stresses that are generated by other DNA-processing enzymes. It has so far remained unclear how DNA supercoiling affects loop extrusion. Here, we use time-lapse single-molecule imaging to study condensin-driven DNA loop extrusion on supercoiled DNA. We find that condensin binding and DNA looping is stimulated by positive supercoiled DNA where it preferentially binds near the tips of supercoiled plectonemes. Upon loop extrusion, condensin collects all nearby plectonemes into a single supercoiled loop that is highly stable. Atomic force microscopy imaging shows that condensin generates supercoils in the presence of ATP. Our findings provide insight into the topology-regulated loading and formation of supercoiled loops by SMC complexes and clarify the interplay of loop extrusion and supercoiling.",

    "abstract": "Many disordered proteins conserve essential functions in the face of extensive sequence variation. This makes it challenging to identify the forces responsible for functional selection. Viruses are robust model systems to investigate functional selection and they take advantage of protein disorder to acquire novel traits. Here, we combine structural and computational biophysics with evolutionary analysis to determine the molecular basis for functional selection in the intrinsically disordered adenovirus early gene 1A (E1A) protein. E1A competes with host factors to bind the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, triggering early S-phase entry and disrupting normal cellular proliferation. We show that the ability to outcompete host factors depends on the picomolar binding affinity of E1A for Rb, which is driven by two binding motifs tethered by a hypervariable disordered linker. Binding affinity is determined by the spatial dimensions of the linker, which constrain the relative position of the two binding motifs. Despite substantial sequence variation across evolution, the linker dimensions are finely optimized through compensatory changes in amino acid sequence and sequence length, leading to conserved linker dimensions and maximal affinity. We refer to the mechanism that conserves spatial dimensions despite large-scale variations in sequence as conformational buffering. Conformational buffering explains how variable disordered proteins encode functions and could be a general mechanism for functional selection within disordered protein regions.",

By contrast, nonionic and zwitterionic detergents tended to prevent proteins from attaching to the AWI. This ability was positively associated with the critical micelle concentration of the detergent. The protein orientation distributions with different anionic detergents were similar and resembled that obtained without detergent. By contrast, cationic detergents gave distinct orientation distributions. The AWI is negatively charged and the absorption of cationic detergents to the AWI alters its charge. Our results indicates that proteins absorb to charged interface and the negative charge of the AWI plays an important role in absorbing proteins in the conventional cryo-EM sample preparation. According to these findings, a new method was developed to modify the charge distribution of the AWI by adding a very low concentration of anionic detergent. Using this method, the protein particles exhibited a more evenly distributed orientations and still absorbed to the AWI enabling them embedding in a thin layer of ice, which will benefit the cryo-EM structural determination.",

    "abstract": "Bidirectional cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions represent fundamental exchanges during tumor progression. We demonstrate the noncanonical Wnt receptor, Ror2, regulates tumor cell-driven matrix remodeling in models of breast cancer. Wnt/Ror2 loss-of-function triggers tumor cell invasion, accompanied by changes in actin cytoskeleton, adhesion, and collagen crosslinking gene expression programs. E-cadherin levels decline upon Ror2 depletion, and spatially, we pinpoint the upregulation and redistribution of 5 and {beta}3 integrins together with the production of fibronectin in areas of invasion. Wnt/{beta}-catenin-dependent and Wnt/Ror2 alternative Wnt signaling appear to regulate distinct functions for tumor cells regarding their ability to modify cell-ECM exchanges during invasion. Furthermore, blocking either integrin or focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a downstream mediator of integrin-mediated signal transduction, abrogates the enhanced migration observed upon Ror2 loss. These results reveal a critical function for the alternative Wnt receptor, Ror2, as a determinant of reciprocal communication between tumor cells and ECM during cancer invasion and metastasis.",

Herein, we developed versatile and multiplexed absolute protein quantification method using MS. A previously developed method based on the cell-free peptide synthesis system, termed MS-based quantification by isotope-labeled cell-free products (MS-QBiC), was improved for multiple peptide synthesis in one-pot reaction. We pluralized the quantification tags used for the quantification of synthesized peptides and thus, made it possible to use cell-free synthesized isotope-labeled peptides as mixtures for the absolute quantification. The improved multiplexed MS-QBiC method was proved to be applied to clarify ribosomal proteins stoichiometry in the ribosomal subunit, one of the largest cellular complexes. The study demonstrates that the developed method enables the preparation of several dozens and even several hundreds of internal standard peptides within a few days for quantification of multiple proteins with only a single-run of MS analysis.",

    "abstract": "Traits lacking fitness benefit cannot be directly selected for under Darwinian evolution. Thus, features such as metabolite secretion are currently inaccessible to adaptive laboratory evolution. Here, we utilize environment-dependency of trait correlations to enable Darwinian selection of fitness-neutral or costly traits. We use metabolic models to design selection niches and to identify surrogate traits that are genetically correlated with cell fitness in the selection niche but coupled to the desired trait in the target niche. Adaptive evolution in the selection niche and subsequent return to the target niche is thereby predicted to enhance the desired trait. We experimentally validate the theory by evolving Saccharomyces cerevisiae for increased secretion of aroma compounds in wine fermentation. Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes in the evolved strains confirmed the predicted flux re-routing to aroma biosynthesis. The use of model-designed selection niches facilitates the predictive evolution of fitness-costly traits for ecological and biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Single-nucleotide variations in RNA (hereafter referred to simply as SNVs), arising from co- and post-transcriptional phenomena including transcription errors and RNA editing, are well studied in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, stage-specific and non-specific gene-expression variations are known to accompany the parasites array of developmental and morphological phenotypes over the course of its complex life cycle. However, the extent, rate and effect of sequence-level variation in the parasites transcriptome are unknown. Here, we report the presence of pervasive, non-specific SNVs in the transcriptome of the P. falciparum. We show that these SNVs cover most of the parasites transcriptome. SNV rates for the P. falciparum lines we assayed, as well as for publicly available P. vivax and P. falciparum clinical isolate datasets were of the order of 10-3 per base, about tenfold higher than rates we calculated for bacterial datasets. These SNVs may reflect an intrinsic transcriptional error rate in the parasite, and RNA editing may be responsible for a subset of them. This seemingly characteristic property of the parasite may have implications for clinical outcomes and the basic biology and evolution of P. falciparum and parasite biology more broadly, and we anticipate that our study will prompt further investigations into the exact sources, consequences and possible adaptive roles of these SNVs.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated mRNA splicing is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and muscular dystrophies such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Comprehensive assessment of dysregulated splicing on the transcriptome and proteome level has been methodologically challenging, and thus investigations have often been targeting only few genes.\n\nHere, we performed a large-scale coordinated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis to characterize a DM1 mouse model (HSALR) in comparison to wild-type. Our integrative proteogenomics approach comprised gene- and splicing-level assessments for mRNAs and proteins. It recapitulated many known instances of aberrant mRNA splicing in DM1 and identified new ones. It enabled the design and targeting of splicing-specific peptides and confirmed the translation of known instances of aberrantly spliced disease-related genes (e.g. Atp2a1, Bin1, Ryr1), complemented by novel findings (e.g. Ywhae, Flnc, Svil). Comparative analysis of large-scale mRNA and protein expression data showed quantitative agreement of differentially expressed genes and splicing patterns between disease and wild-type.\n\nWe hence propose this work as a suitable blueprint for a robust and scalable integrative proteogenomic strategy geared towards advancing our understanding of splicing-based disorders. With such a strategy, splicing-based biomarker candidates emerge as an attractive and accessible option, as they can be efficiently asserted on the mRNA and protein level in coordinated fashion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/443842v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@593246org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f3b5bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12113b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@947d8f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Through known association with other proteins, human selenoprotein K (selenok) is currently implicated in the palmitoylation of proteins, degradation of misfolded proteins, innate immune response, and the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, neither the catalytic function of selenoks selenocysteine (Sec), which, curiously, resides in an intrinsically disordered protein segment nor selenoks specific role in these pathways are known to date. This report casts these questions in a new light as it describes that selenok is able -both in vitro and in vivo- to cleave some of its own peptide bonds. The cleavages not only release selenok segments that contain its reactive Sec, but as the specific cleavage sites were identified, they proved to cluster tightly near sites through which selenok interacts with protein partners. Furthermore, it is shown that selenoks cleavage activity is neither restricted to itself nor promiscuous but selectively extends to at least one of its protein partners. Together, selenoks cleavage ability and its features have all hallmarks of a regulatory mechanism that could play a central role in selenoks associations with other proteins and its cellular functions overall.",

    "abstract": "Reaction-diffusion models have been widely used to elucidate pattern formation in developmental biology. More recently, they have also been applied in modeling cell fate patterning that mimic early-stage human development events utilizing geometrically confined pluripotent stem cells. However, the traditional reaction-diffusion equations could not satisfactorily explain the concentric ring distributions of various cell types, as they do not yield circular patterns even for circular domains. In previous mathematical models that yield ring patterns, certain conditions that lack biophysical understandings had been considered in the reaction-diffusion models. Here we hypothesize that the circular patterns are the results of the coupling of the mechanobiological factors with the traditional reaction-diffusion model. We propose two types of coupling scenarios: tissue tension-dependent diffusion flux and traction stress-dependent activation of signaling molecules. By coupling reaction-diffusion equations with the elasticity equations, we demonstrate computationally that the contraction-reaction-diffusion model can naturally yield the circular patterns.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination plays dual roles in the evolution and stable inheritance of genomes: recombination promotes genetic diversity by reassorting variants, and it establishes temporary connections between pairs of homologous chromosomes that ensure for their future segregation. Meiotic recombination is initiated by generation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by the conserved topoisomerase-like protein Spo11. Despite strong conservation of Spo11 across eukaryotic kingdoms, auxiliary complexes that interact with Spo11 complexes to promote DSB formation are poorly conserved. Here, we identify DSB-3 as a DSB-promoting protein in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutants lacking DSB-3 are proficient for homolog pairing and synapsis but fail to form meiotic crossovers. Lack of crossovers in dsb-3 mutants reflects a requirement for DSB-3 in meiotic DSB formation. DSB-3 concentrates in meiotic nuclei with timing similar to DSB-1 and DSB-2 (predicted homologs of yeast/mammalian Rec114/REC114), and DSB-1, DSB-2, and DSB-3 are interdependent for this localization. Bioinformatics analysis and interactions among the DSB proteins support the identity of DSB-3 as a homolog of MEI4 in conserved DSB-promoting complexes. This identification is reinforced by colocalization of pairwise combinations of DSB-1, DSB-2, and DSB-3 foci in structured illumination microscopy images of spread nuclei. However, unlike yeast Rec114, DSB-1 can interact directly with SPO-11, and in contrast to mouse REC114 and MEI4, DSB-1, DSB-2 and DSB-3 are not concentrated predominantly at meiotic chromosome axes. We speculate that variations in the meiotic program that have co-evolved with distinct reproductive strategies in diverse organisms may contribute to and/or enable diversification of essential components of the meiotic machinery.\n\nSignificance StatementFaithful inheritance of chromosomes during meiosis depends on the formation and repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), which are generated through the activity of a topoisomerase-like protein known as Spo11. Spo11 exhibits strong conservation throughout eukaryotes, presumably reflecting constraints imposed by its biochemical activity, but auxiliary proteins that collaborate with Spo11 to promote and regulate DSB formation are less well conserved. Here we investigate a cohort of proteins comprising a complex required for meiotic DSB formation in Caenorhabditis elegans, providing evidence for both conservation with and divergence from homologous complexes in other organisms. This work highlights the evolutionary malleability of protein complexes that serve essential, yet auxiliary, roles in fundamental biological processes that are central to reproduction.",

    "abstract": "How is the brain wired during development? Here we look at some of the characteristics of the adult Drosophila brain, a result of this development process. From this we can speculate on at least some aspects of how the wiring was done. A common hypothesis is that surface proteins direct synapse formation among touching neurons. Assuming that surface proteins are specific to cell types, we find support for this hypothesis. The brain in general supports a wide variety of connections of different degrees of reciprocity, with ratios up to a thousand to one in the two directions of synapses between types. However, contacts between cells of the same type are always bi-directional and nearly equal strength. Furthermore, among similar cell types, at least in the mushroom body, the closer the cell type by morphology, the closer the inter-type contacts are to symmetrical. These findings are all consistent with the hypothesis that surface proteins specific to cell types determine the directivity of connections. Next we look at synapses per area, and find this varies widely and is roughly log-normally distributed. In most cases, the number of synapses saturates at higher areas, though other forms are seen - linear, flat, or decreasing with increasing area. Evidence suggests that at least some of this distinction is post-synaptic.",
