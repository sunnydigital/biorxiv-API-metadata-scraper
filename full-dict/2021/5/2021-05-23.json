    "abstract": "Using spatialised population measurements and related geographic habitat data, it is quite feasible nowadays to derive parsimonious spatially explicit population models and to carry on their parameter estimation. To achieve such goal, reaction-diffusion models are fairly common in conservation biology and agricultural plant health where they are used, for example, for landscape planning or epidemiological surveillance. Unfortunately, if the mathematical methods and computational power are readily available, biological measurements are not. Despite the high throughput of some habitat related remote sensors, the experimental cost of biological measurements are, in our view, one of the worst bottleneck against a widespread usage of reaction-diffusion models. Hence, in this paper, we will recall some classical methods for optimal experimental design that we deem useful to spatial ecologist. Using two case studies, one in landscape ecology and one in conservation biology, we will show how to construct a priori experimental design minimizing variance of parameter estimates, enabling optimal experimental setup with pre and post hoc filtering for accommodating additional constraints.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptor connecting cilium (CC) is structurally analogous to the transition zone (TZ) of primary cilia and gates the molecular trafficking between the inner and the outer segment (OS). Retinal dystrophies with underlying CC defects are manifested in a broad array of syndromic conditions known as ciliopathies as well as non-syndromic retinal degenerations. Despite extensive studies, protein trafficking across the photoreceptor CC is largely unknown. Here we genetically inactivated mouse Tmem138, a gene encoding a ciliary membrane protein localized to the ciliary TZ and linked to Joubert syndrome (JBTS). Germline deletion of Tmem138 abolished OS morphogenesis followed by rapid photoreceptor degeneration. Tmem138 was found localized to the photoreceptor CC and, accordingly, the molecular compartments of the CC and axoneme of the mutant photoreceptors were altered despite ciliogenesis proceeding normally at the early stage of photoreceptor development. To gain further insights into Tmem138 function in OS biogenesis, we focused on trafficking of rhodopsin, the most abundant protein of the OS. Mislocalization of rhodopsin was readily observed as early as P5 in the mutant photoreceptors prior to growth of the OS. Ablation of Tmem138 in mature rods recapitulated the molecular changes in the germline mutants, causing well-formed outer segment discs to disintegrate accompanied by mislocalization of rhodopsin in the cell body. Furthermore, Tmem138 interacted with rhodopsin, and two additional CC compartment proteins Ahi1 and Tmem231, which were both altered in the mutant photoreceptors. Taken together, these results suggest that Tmem138 has a distinct role in gating the transport of rhodopsin and likely other OS bound proteins through formation of CC transport complex(es).",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) is an intrinsically quantitative method to screen for protein-protein interactions and frequently used to record the outcome of signal transduction events. With new highly sensitive and photon efficient FLIM instrumentation, the technique also becomes attractive to screen, with high temporal resolution, for fast changes in Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), such as those occurring upon activation of cell signaling.\n\nWe studied the effects of siRNA-mediated individual knockdown of an extensive set of 22 different phosphodiesterases (PDEs) on baseline levels and agonist-induced changes of the second messenger cAMP. Using HeLa cells stably expressing our FRET-FLIM sensor we imaged many hundreds of cells at 5 second intervals for each condition. Following segmentation of cells by the deep-learning implementation Cellpose, FLIM time traces were calculated and fitted for dynamic analysis with custom-made Python scripts. Taking advantage of the quantitative FLIM data, we found very limited effects of PDE knockdown on baseline and agonist-induced peak levels of cAMP. However, cAMP breakdown in the decay phase was significantly slower when PDE3A and, to a lesser amount, PDE10A were knocked down, identifying these isoforms as dominant in HeLa cells.\n\nIn conclusion, we present a robust platform that combines photon-efficient FLIM instrumentation with systematic gene knockdown and an automated open-source analysis pipeline. Our quantitative platform provides detailed kinetic analysis of cellular signals in individual cells with unprecedented throughput.",

    "abstract": "The Hnf1b-CreERT2 BAC transgenic (Tg(Hnf1b-cre/ERT2)1Jfer) has been used extensively to trace the progeny of pancreatic ducts in developmental, regeneration, or cancer models. Hnf1b-CreERT2 transgenics have been used to show that cells from that form a duct-like plexus in the embryonic pancreas are bipotent duct-endocrine progenitors, whereas adult mouse duct cells are not a common source of {beta} cells in various regenerative settings. The interpretation of such genetic lineage tracing studies is critically dependent on a correct understanding of the cell type specificity of recombinase activity with each reporter system. We have re-examined the performance of Hnf1b-CreERT2 with a Rosa26-RFP reporter transgene. This showed inducible recombination of up to 96% adult duct cells, a much higher efficiency than previously used reporter transgenes. Despite this high duct-cell excision, recombination in  and {beta} cells remained very low, similar to previously used reporters. However, nearly half of somatostatin-expressing {delta} cells showed reporter activation, which was due to Cre expression in {delta} cells rather than to duct to {delta} cell conversions. The high recombination efficiency in duct cells indicates that the Hnf1b-CreERT2 model can be useful for both ductal fate mapping and genetic inactivation studies. The recombination in {delta} cells does not modify the interpretation of studies that failed to show duct conversions to other cell types, but needs to be considered if this model is used in studies that aim to modify the plasticity of pancreatic duct cells.",

    "abstract": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an integral part in Reverse Cholesterol Transport (RCT) and is critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis. One theory of lipid efflux by the transporter (alternating access) proposes that ABCA1 harbours two different conformations that provide alternating access for lipid binding and release. This is followed by a sequestration via a direct interaction between ABCA1 and its partner, ApoA1. The alternative theory (lateral access) proposes that ABCA1 obtains lipids laterally from the membrane to form a temporary extracellular \"reservoir\". This reservoir contains an isolated lipid monolayer due to the net accumulation of lipids in the exofacial leaflet. Recently, a full-length Cryo-EM structure of this 2,261-residue transmembrane protein showed its discreetly folded domains and have detected the presence of a tunnel enclosed within ECDs but not in theTMDs giving it an outward-facing conformation. This structure was hypothesized to substantiate the lateral access theory, whereby ApoA1 obtained lipids from the proximal end laterally. Utilizing long time-scale multiple replica atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (MDS), we simulated the structure in a large heterogeneous lipid environment and found that along with several large conformational changes, the protein harbours a continuous tunnel that traverses the entire length of the protein. In this study, we have characterized ABCA1 and the lipid dynamics along with the protein-lipid interactions in the heterogeneous environment, providing novel insights into understanding ABCA1 conformation at an atomistic level.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is a highly immunogenic malignancy, surgically curable at early stages, but life- threatening when metastatic. Here we integrate high-plex imaging, 3D high-resolution microscopy, and spatially-resolved micro-region transcriptomics to study immune evasion and immunoediting in primary melanoma. We find that recurrent cellular neighborhoods involving tumor, immune, and stromal cells change significantly along a progression axis involving precursor states, melanoma in situ, and invasive tumor. Hallmarks of immunosuppression are already detectable in precursor regions. When tumors become locally invasive, a consolidated and spatially restricted suppressive environment forms along the tumor-stromal boundary. This environment is established by cytokine gradients that promote expression of MHC-II and IDO1, and by PD1-PDL1 mediated cell contacts involving macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells. A few millimeters away, cytotoxic T cells synapse with melanoma cells in fields of tumor regression. Thus, invasion and immunoediting can co-exist within a few millimeters of each other in a single specimen.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe reorganization of the tumor ecosystem in primary melanoma is an excellent setting in which to study immunoediting and immune evasion. Guided by classical histopathology, spatial profiling of proteins and mRNA reveals recurrent morphological and molecular features of tumor evolution that involve localized paracrine cytokine signaling and direct cell-cell contact.",

    "abstract": "Replication of the genome must be coordinated with gene transcription and cellular metabolism, especially following replication stress in the presence of limiting deoxyribonucleotides. The S. cerevisiae Rad53 (CHEK2 in mammals) checkpoint kinase plays a major role in cellular responses to DNA replication stress. Cell cycle regulated, genome-wide binding of Rad53 to chromatin was examined. Under replication stress, the kinase bound to sites of active DNA replication initiation and fork progression, but unexpectedly to the promoters of about 20% of genes encoding proteins involved in multiple cellular functions. Rad53 promoter binding correlated with changes in expression of a subset of genes. Rad53 promoter binding to certain genes was influenced by sequence-specific transcription factors and less by checkpoint signaling. However, in checkpoint mutants, untimely activation of late-replicating origins reduces the transcription of nearby genes, with concomitant localization of Rad53 to their gene bodies. We suggest that the Rad53 checkpoint kinase coordinates genome-wide replication and transcription under replication stress conditions.",

Here, we developed a platform of micron-scale 2D cardiac tissues (M2DCTs) to precisely control biomechanics in arrays of thousands of purified, independently contracting cardiac muscle strips in 2D. By defining geometry and workload in M2DCTs in this reductionist platform that does not incorporate other cell types, we show that myofibrillar alignment and auxotonic contractions at physiologic workload critically drive maturation of cardiac contractile function, calcium handling, and electrophysiology. Additionally, the organized biomechanics in this system facilitates rapid and automated extraction of contractile kinetic parameters from brightfield microscopy images, increasing the reproducibility and throughput of pharmacologic testing. Finally, we show that M2DCTs enable precise and efficient dissection of contractile kinetics in cardiomyopathy disease models.",

Here we show the reuse of an ancestral insect venation gene regulatory subnetwork patterning the sharp and distinct rings of color in butterfly eyespots. Using laser microdissection followed by RNA-Seq we first obtained transcriptional profiles of the anterior and posterior compartment of larval wings, and eyespot and adjacent control tissue in pupal wings of Bicyclus anynana butterflies. We identified key venation patterning genes such as Mothers against dpp 6 (Mad6), thickveins, Optix, spalt, optomotor-blind (omb), aristaless, cubitus interruptus, and patched differentially expressed (DE) across compartments, and a sub-set of these genes also DE across eyespot and non-eyespot samples. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (HCR3.0) on the jointly DE genes Mad6, Optix, and spalt, as well as dpp showed clear eyespot-center, eyespot-rings, and compartment-specific expression. Knocking out dpp resulted in an individual with venation defects and loss of eyespots, whereas knockouts of Optix and spalt resulted in the loss of orange scales and black scales, respectively. Furthermore, using CRISPR-Cas9 followed by immunostainings, we showed that Spalt represses Optix in the central region of the eyespot, limiting Optix expression to a more peripheral ring, which parallels the regulatory interaction found in venation patterning in the anterior compartment of fly larval wings. These network similarities suggest that part of the venation GRN was co-opted to aid in the differentiation of the eyespot rings.\n\nOne-sentence summaryWe showed the reuse of an ancestral insect wing venation GRN in patterning a novel complex trait in butterflies.",

    "abstract": "Saul-Wilson syndrome (SWS) is a rare, skeletal dysplasia with progeroid appearance and primordial dwarfism. It is caused by a heterozygous, dominant variant (p.G516R) in COG4, a subunit of the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex involved in intracellular vesicular transport. Our previous work has shown the intracellular disturbances caused by this mutation; however, the pathological mechanism of SWS needs further investigation. We sought to understand the molecular mechanism of specific aspects of the SWS phenotype by analyzing SWS-derived fibroblasts and zebrafish embryos expressing this dominant variant. SWS fibroblasts accumulate glypicans, a group of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) critical for growth and bone development through multiple signaling pathways. Consistently, we find that glypicans are increased in embryos expressing the COG4p.G516R variant. These animals show phenotypes consistent with convergent extension (CE) defects during gastrulation, shortened body length, and malformed jaw cartilage chondrocyte intercalation at larval stages. Since non-canonical Wnt signaling was shown in zebrafish to be related to the regulation of these processes by Glypican 4, we assessed wnt levels and found a selective increase of wnt4 transcripts in the presence of COG4p.G516R. Moreover, overexpression of wnt4 mRNA phenocopies these developmental defects. LGK974, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling corrects the shortened body length at low concentrations but amplifies it at slightly higher concentrations. WNT4 and the non-canonical Wnt signaling component phospho-JNK are also elevated in cultured SWS-derived fibroblasts. Similar results from SWS cell lines and zebrafish point to altered non-canonical Wnt signaling as one possible mechanism underlying SWS pathology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMachine learning (ML) methodology development for classification of immune states in adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRR) has seen a recent surge of interest. However, so far, there does not exist a systematic evaluation of scenarios where classical ML methods (such as penalized logistic regression) already perform adequately for AIRR classification. This hinders investigative reorientation to those scenarios where further method development of more sophisticated ML approaches may be required.\n\nResultsTo identify those scenarios where a baseline method is able to perform well for AIRR classification, we generated a collection of synthetic benchmark datasets encompassing a wide range of dataset architecture-associated and immune state-associated sequence pattern (signal) complexity. We trained {approx}1300 ML models with varying assumptions regarding immune signal on{approx}850 datasets with a total of {approx}210000 repertoires containing {approx}42 billion TCR{beta} CDR3 amino acid sequences, thereby surpassing the sample sizes of current state-of-the-art AIRR ML setups by two orders of magnitude. We found that L1-penalized logistic regression achieved high prediction accuracy even when the immune signal occurs only in 1 out of 50000 AIR sequences.\n\nConclusionsWe provide a reference benchmark to guide new AIRR ML classification methodology by: (i) identifying those scenarios characterised by immune signal and dataset complexity, where baseline methods already achieve high prediction accuracy and (ii) facilitating realistic expectations of the performance of AIRR ML models given training dataset properties and assumptions. Our study serves as a template for defining specialized AIRR benchmark datasets for comprehensive benchmarking of AIRR ML methods.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders have been linked to impairments in fear memory circuitry. Thus, pharmacological approaches that impair aversive memories have been investigated as new treatments. The TRPV1 channel modulates biological processes related to memory consolidation and retrieval. However, TRPV1 seems involved in memories generated by high intense conditioning. Anandamide (AEA), the main endocannabinoid, is an agonist of both, TRPV1 channels and CB1 receptors which are colocalized in several brain structures. Remarkably, AEA has twenty-times more affinity for CB1 than for TRPV1, which may be involved in the intensity-dependent recruitment of this channel. In order to evaluate the role of intensity of the conditioning in the recruitment of TRPV1, the animals were submitted to the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and conditioned with low, moderate or high intensity. Before the retrieval a TRPV1 blocker was administered into the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC). The levels of AEA were quantified by Mass Spectrometry. The RNA levels of Arc, Zif and Trkb, involved in memory and plasticity, were quantified by PCR. Our results showed that TRPV1 blockers impair the retrieval of memory in animals conditioned with moderate and high intensity but not low ones. As revealed by Mass Spectrometry, this different recruitment among intensities seems to be associated with the levels of AEA released. Moreover, the impairment in freezing induced by blocking TRPV1 was prevented by a subeffective dose of the cannabinoid receptor CB1 antagonist which suggest that TRPV1 blockers act increasing AEA availability in the synaptic cleft to act through CB1 receptors. Despite blocking TRPV1 channels impairs freezing in moderate and high intensities, it increases the RNA levels of Arc, Zif and Trkb only in animals conditioned with the moderate intensity. In accordance, the treatment impairs retrieval in both intensities but only in the moderate intensity is able to prevent the reinstatement. Summarizing, our results suggested that intensity of the conditioning modulates AEA levels which in turns determines if TRPV1 will be recruited at the retrieval and which molecular pathways will be engaged due to TRPV1 blocking.",

    "abstract": "Spin-echo (SE) BOLD fMRI has high microvascular specificity, and thus provides a more reliable means to localize neural activity compared to conventional gradient-echo BOLD fMRI. However, the most common SE BOLD acquisition method, SE-EPI, is known to suffer from T2' contrast contamination with undesirable draining vein bias. To address this, in this study, we extended a recently developed distortion/blurring-free multi-shot EPI technique, Echo-Planar Time-resolved Imaging (EPTI), to cortical-depth dependent SE-fMRI at 7T to test whether it could provide purer SE BOLD contrast with minimal T2' contamination for improved neuronal specificity. From the same acquisition, the time-resolved feature of EPTI also provides a series of asymmetric SE (ASE) images with varying T2' weightings, and enables extraction of data equivalent to conventional SE EPI with different echo train lengths (ETLs). This allows us to systematically examine how T2'-contribution affects different SE acquisition strategies using a single dataset. A low-rank spatiotemporal subspace reconstruction was implemented for the SE-EPTI acquisition, which incorporates corrections for both shot-to-shot phase variations and dynamic B0 drifts. SE-EPTI was used in a visual task fMRI experiment to demonstrate that i) the pure SE image provided by EPTI results in the highest microvascular specificity; ii) the ASE EPTI series, with a graded introduction of T2' weightings at time points farther away from the pure SE, show a gradual sensitivity increase along with increasing draining vein bias; iii) the longer ETL seen in conventional SE EPI acquisitions will induce more draining vein bias. Consistent results were observed across multiple subjects, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed technique for SE-BOLD fMRI with high specificity.",

    "abstract": "The human connectome is the set of physical pathways linking brain regions to one another. Empirical and in silico studies have demonstrated that the structure of this network helps shape patterns of functional coupling between brain regions. To better understand this link between structure and function, a growing number of studies have derived geometric, dynamic, and topological predictors from structural connectivity in order to make predictions about correlation structure. These studies, however, have typically focused on global (whole-brain) predictions using a restricted set of predictors. Here, we investigate a wide range of predictors and shift focus onto predictions of local (regional) patterns of functional coupling. We show that, globally, no individual predictor performs well and, that even the best predictors are largely driven by their ability to predict functional coupling between directly connected regions. We then use the same predictors to make predictions of local coupling and find marked improvement. Notably, the most predictable local FC is linked to sensorimotor regions, which are best predicted by measures based on topological similarity, mean first passage times of random walkers, and the brains embedding in Euclidean space. We then show that by combining the predictive power of more than one predictor using multi-linear models, we can further improve local predictions. Finally, we investigate how global and local structure-function coupling differences across the human lifespan. We find that, globally, the magnitude of coupling decreases with biological age, which is paralleled by an increase in the number of multi-step pathways. We also show that, locally, structure-function coupling is preserved in higher order cognitive systems, but preferentially decreases with age in sensorimotor systems. Our results illuminate the heterogeneous landscape of structure-function coupling across the cerebral cortex and help clarify its differences with age.",

    "abstract": "Precise segmentation of infant brain MR images into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are essential for studying neuroanatomical hallmarks of early brain development. However, for 6-month-old infants, the extremely low-intensity contrast caused by inherent myelination hinders accurate tissue segmentation. Existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation models for this task generally employ single-scale symmetric convolutions, which are inefficient for encoding the isointense tissue boundaries in baby brain images. Here, we propose a 3D mixed-scale asymmetric convolutional segmentation network (3D-MASNet) framework for brain MR images of 6-month-old infants. We replaced the traditional convolutional layer of an existing to-be-trained network with a 3D mixed-scale convolution block consisting of asymmetric kernels (MixACB) during the training phase and then equivalently converted it into the original network. Five canonical CNN segmentation models were evaluated using both T1- and T2-weighted images of 23 6-month-old infants from iSeg-2019 datasets, which contained manual labels as ground truth. MixACB significantly enhanced the average accuracy of all five models and obtained the most considerable improvement in the fully convolutional network model (CC-3D-FCN) and the highest performance in the Dense U-Net model. This approach further obtained Dice coefficient accuracies of 0.931, 0.912, and 0.961 in GM, WM, and CSF, respectively, ranking first among 30 teams on the validation dataset of the iSeg-2019 Grand Challenge. Thus, the proposed 3D-MASNet can improve the accuracy of existing CNNs-based segmentation models as a plug-and-play solution that offers a promising technique for future infant brain MRI studies.",

    "abstract": "Reading words aloud is a fundamental aspect of literacy. The rapid rate at which multiple distributed neural substrates are engaged in this process can only be probed via techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution. We probed this with direct intracranial recordings covering most of the left hemisphere in 46 humans as they read aloud regular, exception and pseudo-words. We used this to create a spatiotemporal map of word processing and to derive how broadband gamma activity varies with multiple word attributes critical to reading speed: lexicality, word frequency and orthographic neighborhood. We found that lexicality is encoded earliest in mid-fusiform (mFus) cortex and precentral sulcus, and is represented reliably enough to allow single-trial lexicality decoding. Word frequency is first represented in mFus and later in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while orthographic neighborhood sensitivity resides solely in IPS. We thus isolate the neural correlates of the distributed reading network involving mFus, IFG, IPS, precentral sulcus and motor cortex and provide direct evidence for dual-route models of reading, with parallel processes via the lexical route from mFus to IFG, and the sub-lexical route from IPS and precentral sulcus to anterior IFG.",

    "abstract": "Although previous studies have reported correlations between alpha oscillations and the \"retention\" sub-process of working memory (WM), causal evidence has been limited in human neuroscience due to the lack of delicate modulation of human brain. Conventional tACS is not suitable for demonstrating the causal evidence for parietal alpha oscillations in WM retention because of its inability to modulate brain oscillations within a short period (i.e., the retention sub-process). Here, we developed an online phase-corrected closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) system capable of precisely correcting for the phase differences between tACS and concurrent endogenous oscillations. This system permits both up- and down-regulation of brain oscillations at the target stimulation frequency within a short stimulation period, and is here applied to empirically demonstrate that parietal alpha oscillations causally relate to WM retention. Our experimental design included both in-phase and anti-phase alpha-tACS applied to 39 participants during the retention sub-processes of a modified Sternberg paradigm. Compared to in-phase alpha-tACS, anti-phase alpha-tACS decreased both WM performance and alpha activity. Moreover, the in-phase tACS-induced changes in WM performance were positively correlated with alpha oscillatory activity. These findings strongly support a causal link between alpha oscillations and WM retention, and illustrate the broad application prospects of phase-corrected tACS.",

It has been documented that HCN channels regulate the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Here, we report that HCN channels limited GABAergic transmission onto pyramidal cells in the mPFC. Pharmacological block of HCN channels resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in mPFC pyramidal cells. Such facilitation effect on mIPSCs required presynaptic Ca2+ influx and reversed by high-dose cAMP. Such facilitation did not exist in the presence of the T-type Ca2+ channel selective blockers. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that HCN channels expressed in presynaptic GABAergic terminals, as well as in both soma and neurite of parvalbumin-expressing (PV-expressing) basket cells in the mPFC. The present results indicate that HCN channels in GABAergic interneurons, most likely PV-expressing basket cells, constrain inhibitory control over layer 5-6 pyramidal cells through restricting presynaptic Ca2+ entry.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an important regulatory mechanism in the control of neuronal function. Both during development and following exposure to salient stimuli, plasticity in the methylation of cytosine residues leads to a change in neuron excitability that subsequently sculpts animal behavior. However, although the response of DNA methyltransferase enzymes in adult neurons to stimuli such as drugs of abuse have been described, less is known about how these enzymes regulate methylation at specific loci to change the drive to ingest natural rewards. Specifically, we do not understand how changes in methylation within important brain areas known to regulate palatable food intake can affect ingestion, while a detailed investigation of the neurophysiological and genomic effects of perturbing methyltransferase function has not been pursued. By deleting DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a in the mouse prefrontal cortex, we observed the requirement for these enzymes in the regulation of nutrient rich food consumption in the absence of any effect on the intake of low fat and low sugar chow. We also determined that the deletion profoundly affected neuron excitability within pyramidal cells resident in superficial layers II/III of the cortex but had little effect in deep layer V neurons. Finally, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing revealed both hypo and hypermethylation in response to methyltransferase deletion, an effect that was observed in binding sites for retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR{beta}) located within regulatory regions of genes known to affect neuronal function. Together, our data suggest that alterations in the actions of RAR{beta} could shift neuronal activity to reduce palatable food intake.",

Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disease caused by IgG targeting desmoglein 3, an adhesion molecule of keratinocytes. In this study, we generated knock-in mice that express anti-Dsg3 AK23 autoantibodies. Knock-in B cells developed normally in vivo and showed Ca2+ influx upon IgM cross-linking in vitro. The mice predominantly produced circulating AK23 IgM but little IgG antibodies. Although no IgG deposition or blister formation was observed in Dsg3-bearing tissues, Dsg3 immunization forced to induce pemphigus phenotype after class-switching to IgG in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that FCGR2B and Fc{gamma}RIIB-related genes were downregulated in B cells from peripheral blood of pemphigus patients. Indeed, in AK23 knock-in mice, Fcgr2b deficiency or haploinsufficiency spontaneously led to class-switching, AK23 IgG production, and pemphigus phenotype development. Thus, inhibition of pathogenic class-switching is a crucial tolerogenic process to prevent pemphigus onset, where attenuated Fc{gamma}RIIB signaling is one of the key predispositions to break this tolerogenic state.",

Generally, L. monocytogenes can be detected using traditional microbiology or molecular biology techniques, notably PCR. However, the application of these methods at the field is restricted due to the strict requirement of equipment and skilled personnel. In this study, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal PCR assay was developed to rapidly detect L. monocytogenes in the crude samples. The results showed that the RPA reaction, without requiring complex thermal cycles, was well-performed in the optimal conditions of 39{degrees}C within only 25 minutes. The limit of detection was identified as 310 fg of L. monocytogenes genomic DNA, which was 1000-fold more sensitive than the conventional PCR. In addition, RPA also succeeded to directly detect L. monocytogenes cells at a concentration as low as 2.5 x 101 Colony Forming Unit (CFU)/ml in pure cultures and 2.5 x 102 CFU/ml in crude samples without sample extraction or processing. Therefore, RPA established in this study could be an alternative standard method to confirm the presence of L. monocytogenes in food. Accordingly, this rapid and sensitive method could be further applied to clinical testing for the diagnosis of L. monocytogenes infection, especially in areas with limited settings.",

    "abstract": "Precision CRISPR gene editing relies on the cellular homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) to introduce custom DNA sequences to target sites. The HDR editing efficiency varies between cell types and genomic sites, and the sources of this variation are incompletely understood. Here, we have studied the effect of 450 DNA repair protein - Cas9 fusions on CRISPR genome editing outcomes. We find the majority of fusions to improve precision genome editing only modestly in a locus- and cell-type specific manner. We identify Cas9-POLD3 fusion that enhances editing by speeding up the initiation of DNA repair. We conclude that while DNA repair protein fusions to Cas9 can improve HDR CRISPR editing, most need to be optimized to the particular cell type and genomic site, highlighting the diversity of factors contributing to locus-specific genome editing outcomes.",

    "abstract": "O_LIEvents such as anthropogenic activities and periodic tree masting can alter resource provisioning in the environment, directly affecting animals, and potentially impacting the spread of infectious diseases in wildlife. The effect of these supplemental resources on infectious diseases can manifest through different pathways, affecting host susceptibility, transmission and host demography.\nC_LIO_LITo date however, empirical research has tended to examine these different pathways in isolation, for example by quantifying the effects of provisioning on host behaviour in the wild or changes in immune responses in controlled laboratory studies. Further, while theory has investigated the interactions between these pathways, thus far this work has focussed on a narrow subset of pathogen types, typically directly-transmitted microparasites. Given the diverse ways that provisioning can affect host susceptibility, contact patterns or host demography, we may expect the epidemiological consequences of provisioning to depend on key aspects of parasite life-history, such as the duration of infection and transmission mode.\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a suite of generic epidemiological models to compare how resource provisioning alters responses for different parasites that vary in their biology (micro- and macro-parasite), transmission mode (direct, environmental, and vector transmitted) and duration of infection (acute, latent, and chronic). Next, we parameterised these different parasite types using data from the diverse parasite community of wild wood mice as a case study.\nC_LIO_LIWe show there are common epidemiological responses to host resource provisioning across all parasite types examined. In particular, the response to provisioning could be driven in opposite directions, depending on which host pathways (contact rate, susceptibility or host demography) are most altered by the addition of resources to the environment. Broadly, these responses were qualitatively consistent across all parasite types, emphasising the importance of identifying general trade-offs between provisioning-altered parameters.\nC_LIO_LIDespite the qualitative consistency in responses to provisioning across parasite types, we found notable quantitative differences between parasites, suggesting specific epidemiological outcomes could strongly depend on parasite type, infection duration and permanency of recovery, and whether the parasite is directly, environmentally, or vector transmitted. These analyses therefore highlight the importance of knowing key specific aspects of host-parasite biology, such as host contact behaviours, parasite interactions with the host immune system, and how resource availability shapes host demographics, in order to understand and predict epidemiological responses to provisioning for any specific host-parasite system.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Unraveling the complex demographic histories of natural populations is a central problem in population genetics. Understanding past demographic events is of general anthropological interest, but is also an important step in establishing accurate null models when identifying adaptive or disease-associated genetic variation. An important class of tools for inferring past population size changes from genomic sequence data are Coalescent Hidden Markov Models (CHMMs). These models make efficient use of the linkage information in population genomic datasets by using the local genealogies relating sampled individuals as latent states that evolve along the chromosome in an HMM framework. Extending these models to large sample sizes is challenging, since the number of possible latent states increases rapidly.\n\nHere, we present our method CHIMP (CHMM History-Inference Maximum-Likelihood Procedure), a novel CHMM method for inferring the size history of a population. It can be applied to large samples (hundreds of haplotypes) and only requires unphased genomes as input. The two implementations of CHIMP that we present here use either the height of the genealogical tree (TMRCA) or the total branch length, respectively, as the latent variable at each position in the genome. The requisite transition and emission probabilities are obtained by numerically solving certain systems of differential equations derived from the ancestral process with recombination. The parameters of the population size history are subsequently inferred using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition, we implement a composite likelihood scheme to allow the method to scale to large sample sizes.\n\nWe demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method in a variety of benchmark tests using simulated data and present comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our implementation using TMRCA as the latent variable shows comparable performance and provides accurate estimates of effective population sizes in intermediate and ancient times. Our method is agnostic to the phasing of the data, which makes it a promising alternative in scenarios where high quality data is not available, and has potential applications for pseudo-haploid data.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe demograpic history of natural populations shapes their genetic variation. The genomes of contemporary individuals can thus be used to unravel past migration events and population size changes, which is of anthropological interest. However, it is also important to uncover these past events for studies investigating disease related genetic variation, since past demographic events can confound such analyses. Here we present a novel method for inferring the size history of a given population from full-genome sequencing data of contemporary individuals. Our method is based on a Coalescent Hidden Markov model framework, a model frequently applied to this type of inference. A key component of the model is the representation of unobserved local genealogical relationships among the sampled individuals as latent states. This is achieved by numerically solving certain differential equations that describe the distributions of these quantities and ultimately enables inference of past population size changes. Other methods performing similar inference rely on availability of high quality genomic data, whereas we demonstrate that our method can be applied in situations with limited data quality.",

    "abstract": "Infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is an important viral disease of salmonids that can affect fish during various life cycles. In Atlantic salmon, selecting for genetically resistant animals against IPN has been one of the most highly praised success stories in the history of fish breeding. The findings that resistance against this disease has a significant genetic component, which is mainly controlled by variations in a single gene, has helped to reduce the IPN outbreaks over the past decade to a great extent. In this paper, we present the identification of a new isolate of the IPN virus, from a field outbreak, that had caused mortality, even in the genetically resistant animals. We recovered and assembled the full-length genome of this virus, following deep-sequencing of an infected tissue. The comparative sequence analysis revealed that for the critical amino acid motifs, previously found to be associated with the degree of virulence, the newly identified isolate is similar to the viruss avirulent form. However, we detected a set of deduced amino acid residues, particularly in the hypervariable region of the polyprotein, that collectively are unique to this strain compared to all other reference sequences assessed in this study. We suggest that these mutations have likely equipped the virus with the capacity to escape the host defence mechanism more efficiently, even in the genetically deemed IPN resistant animals.",

We measured the position and orientation of Pol II in eight organs collected from heterozygous F1 hybrid mice using ChRO-seq. Our data revealed a strong genetic basis for the precise coordinates of transcription initiation and promoter proximal pause, allowing us to redefine molecular models of core transcriptional processes. Our results implicate the strength of base pairing between A-T or G-C dinucleotides as key determinants to the position of Pol II initiation and pause. We report evidence that initiation site selection follows a stochastic process similar to brownian motion along the DNA template. We found widespread differences in the position of transcription termination, which impact the primary structure and stability of mature mRNA. Finally, we report evidence that allelic changes in transcription often affect mRNA and ncRNA expression across broad genomic domains. Collectively, we reveal how DNA sequences shape core transcriptional processes at single nucleotide resolution in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrate can be converted into fat by de novo lipogenesis1,2. This process is known to occur in adipose and liver, and its activity is upregulated in fatty liver disease3. Chemically, de novo lipogenesis involves polymerization and reduction of acetyl-CoA, using NADPH as the electron donor1. While regulation of the responsible enzymes has been extensively studied, the feedstocks used to generate acetyl-CoA and NADPH remain unclear. Here we show that, while de novo lipogenesis in adipose is supported by glucose and its catabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway to make NADPH, liver makes fat without relying on glucose. Instead, liver derives acetyl-CoA from acetate and lactate, and NADPH from folate-mediated serine catabolism. Such NADPH generation involves the cytosolic serine pathway running in liver in the opposite direction observed in most tissues and tumors4,5, with NADPH made by the SHMT1-MTHFD1-ALDH1L1 reaction sequence. Thus, specifically in liver, folate metabolism is wired to support cytosolic NADPH production for lipogenesis. More generally, while the same enzymes are involved in fat synthesis in liver and adipose, different substrates are utilized, opening the door to tissue-specific pharmacological interventions.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and suicide, are becoming an increasing public health concern. Rising rates of both depression and suicide, exacerbated by the current COVID19 pandemic, have only hastened our need for objective and reliable diagnostic biomarkers. These can aide clinicians treating depressive disorders in both diagnosing and developing treatment plans. While differential gene expression analysis has highlighted the serotonin signaling cascade among other critical neurotransmitter pathways to underly the pathology of depression and suicide, the biological mechanisms remain elusive. Here we propose a novel approach to better understand molecular underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders by examining patterns of differential RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). We take advantage of publicly available RNA-seq datasets to map ADAR editing landscapes in a global gene-centric view. We use a unique combination of Guttman scaling and random forest classification modeling to create, describe and compare ADAR editing profiles focusing on both spatial and biological sex differences. We use a subset of experimentally confirmed ADAR editing sites located in known protein coding regions, the excitome, to map ADAR editing profiles in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and suicide. Using Guttman scaling, we were able to describe significant changes in editing profiles across brain regions in males and females with respect to cause of death (COD) and MDD diagnosis. The spatial distribution of editing sites may provide insight into biological mechanisms under-pinning clinical symptoms associated with MDD and suicidal behavior. Additionally, we use random forest modeling including these differential profiles among other markers of global editing patterns in order to highlight potential biomarkers that offer insights into molecular changes underlying synaptic plasticity. Together, these models identify potential prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for MDD diagnosis and/or suicide.",

Arguably the most well-known and common method is the minimizer technique, which selects the  lowest-ordered k-mer in a sliding window. Recently, it has been shown that minimizers are a sub-optimal method for selecting subsets of k-mers when mutations are present. There is however a lack of understanding behind the theory of why certain methods perform well.\n\nResultsWe first theoretically investigate the conservation metric for k-mer selection methods. We derive an exact expression for calculating the conservation of a k-mer selection method. This turns out to be tractable enough for us to prove closed-form expressions for a variety of methods, including (open and closed) syncmers, (, b, n)-words, and an upper bound for minimizers. As a demonstration of our results, we modified the minimap2 read aligner to use a more optimal k-mer selection method and demonstrate that there is up to an 8.2% relative increase in number of mapped reads.\n\nAvailability and supplementary informationSimulations and supplementary methods available at https://github.com/bluenote-1577/local-kmer-selection-results. os-minimap2 is a modified version of minimap2 and available at https://github.com/bluenote-1577/os-minimap2.\n\nContactjshaw@math.toronto.edu",

One such protein is AKAP5, which contains SLiMs that anchor PKA and Calcineurin, and recruit substrate (the TRPV1 receptor). Calcineurin is anchored to AKAP5 by a well-characterised PxIxIT SLiM. Here we show, using a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches, that the Calcineurin PxIxIT-binding groove also recognises several hitherto unknown lower-affinity SLiMs in addition to the PxIxIT motif. We demonstrate that the assembly is in reality a complex system with conserved SLiMs spanning a wide affinity range. The capture is analogous to that seen for many DNA-binding proteins that have a weak non-specific affinity for DNA outside the canonical binding site, but different in that it involves (i) two proteins, and (ii) hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interactions. It is also compatible with the requirement for both stable anchoring of the enzyme and responsive downstream signalling. We conclude that the AKAP5 C-terminus is enriched in lower-affinity/mini-SLiMs that, together with the canonical SLiM, maintain a structurally disordered but tightly regulated signalosome.",

    "abstract": "Models of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) capture the dynamics of the regulatory processes that occur within the cell as a means to understand the variability observed in gene expression between different conditions. Arguably the simplest mathematical construct used for modeling is the Boolean network, which dictates a set of logical rules for transition between states described as Boolean vectors. Due to the complexity of gene regulation and the limitations of experimental technologies, in most cases knowledge about regulatory interactions and Boolean states is partial. In addition, the logical rules themselves are not known a-priori. Our goal in this work is to create an algorithm that finds the network that fits the data optimally, and identify the network states that correspond to the noise-free data. We present a novel methodology for integrating experimental data and performing a search for the optimal consistent structure via optimization of a linear objective function under a set of linear constraints. In addition, we extend our methodology into a heuristic that alleviates the computational complexity of the problem for datasets that are generated by single-cell RNA-Sequencing(scRNA-Seq). We demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools using a public scRNA-Seq dataset and the GRN that is associated with it. Our methodology will enable researchers to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks and their biological role.",

    "abstract": "The brain should be best able to associate distinct behavioral responses to sensory stimuli if these stimuli evoke population firing patterns that are close to orthogonal. To investigate whether task training orthogonalizes population codes in primary visual cortex (V1), we measured the orientation tuning of 4,000-neuron populations in mouse V1 before and after training on a visuomotor task. The effect of task training on population codes could be captured by a simple mathematical transformation of firing rates, which suppressed responses to motor-associated stimuli, but only in cells responding to them at intermediate levels. This transformation orthogonalized the representations of the task orientations by sparsening the population responses to these stimuli. The strength of response transformation varied from trial to trial, suggesting a dynamic circuit mechanism rather than static synaptic plasticity. These results indicate a simple process by which visuomotor associations orthogonalize population codes as early as in primary visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "During the breeding program studies, the pollen donor parents (pollinizers) were observed to be characterized by a strong flowering rate and very low fruit set, even after hand pollination. Then the notion of pollinizers in the argane species was born, first mentioned, checked, documented and confirmed like other conventional tree species. Since the argane tree is completely self-incompatible, the presence of compatible pollinizers is necessary for the fruit set. Indeed, pollinizers need to be selected accurately based on the synchronization of bloom periods and compatibility to receiver trees (female). The pollinizer is essential in any breeding program and for new orchard plantations. The current study was conducted on 13 argane genotypes including two pollinizers. The flowering period, bloom phenology, floral structure and fruit set of crossed genotypes were monitored, illustrated and a season phenogram was established. The pollen viability and germination were also evaluated. In order to test compatibility, the hand pollination using two selected pollinizer pollens was compared to open pollination. Then, the compatibility system was monitored and evaluated through analysis of crossing diallel programs and through the index of self-incompatibility. The flowering periods are genotype depending and one to three blooms have been observed during the two years study (2018-2019) and the argane tree is a tristylous species (Mesostylous, brevistylous and longistylous flowers). The in vitro tests showed that the pollen originated from crossed genotypes were viable and able to germinate. The cross-compatibility rate depends on cross associations and it varies from 39 to 84 %. In fact, this study showed that the effect of pollen-parent (xenia) occurs in all fruit components of argane tree. It was observed, for the first time, that both compatible pollinizers and xenic effects of pollen on argane fruit have occurred. Artificial pollination is currently feasible for breeding programs and the screening of elite genotypes. Then the selected pollinizer is quite required for the development of argane tree cropping.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPollinizers in the argane species first mentioned\nC_LIO_LIPollinizer is essential in any breeding program and for new orchard plantations\nC_LIO_LIArgane tree is self-incompatible\nC_LIO_LIPollen-parent effect, (xenia) occurs in all fruit components of argane tree\nC_LI",
