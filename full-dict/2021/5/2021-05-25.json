We herein report in vitro and in vivo characterization of two small molecules from a chemical series of MOR PAMs that exhibit: (i) MOR PAM activity and receptor subtype selectivity in vitro, (ii) a differential potentiation of the antinociceptive effect of oxycodone, morphine, and methadone in mouse models of pain that roughly correlates with in vitro activity, and (iii) a lack of potentiation of adverse effects associated with opioid administration, such as somatic withdrawal, respiratory depression, and analgesic tolerance. This series of MOR PAMs holds promise for the development of adjuncts to opioid therapy to mitigate against overdose and opioid use disorders.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we developed a novel solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) formulation for drug delivery of small hydrophilic cargo to the retina. The new formulation, based on a gel core and composite shell, allowed up to two times increase in the encapsulation efficiency. The type of hydrophobic polyester used in the composite shell mixture affects the particle surface charge, colloidal stability, and cell internalization profile. We validated the SLN capability as a drug delivery system by performing encapsulation of a hydrophilic neuroprotective cyclic guanosine monophosphate analogue, previously demonstrated to hold retinoprotective properties, and the best formulation resulted in particles with size of {+/-} 250nm, anionic charge > -20 mV, and an encapsulation efficiency value of {+/-}60%, criteria that are suitable for retinal delivery. In vitro studies using ARPE-19 and 661W retinal cell lines revealed a relatively low SLN toxicity, even when high particle concentration was used. More importantly, SLN could be uptaken by the cells and the release of the hydrophilic cargo in the cytoplasm was visually demonstrated. These findings suggest that the newly developed SLN with a gel core and composite polymer/lipid shell holds all characteristics suitable for drug delivery of small hydrophilic active molecules into retinal cell.",

    "abstract": "The genus Xanthomonas has long been considered to consist predominantly of plant pathogens, but over the last decade there has been an increasing number of reports on non-pathogenic and endophytic members. As Xanthomonas species are prevalent pathogens on a wide variety of important crops around the world, there is a need to distinguish between these plant-associated phenotypes. To date a large number of Xanthomonas genomes have been sequenced, which enables the application of machine learning (ML) approaches on the genome content to predict this phenotype. Until now such approaches to the pathogenomics of Xanthomonas strains have been hampered by the fragmentation of information regarding strain pathogenicity over many studies. Unification of this information into a single resource was therefore considered to be an essential step. Mining of 39 papers considering both plant-associated phenotypes, allowed for a phenotypic classification of 578 Xanthomonas strains. For 65 plant-pathogenic and 53 non-pathogenic strains the corresponding genomes were available and de novo annotated for the presence of Pfam protein domains used as features to train and compare three ML classification algorithms; CART, Lasso and Random Forest. Recursive feature extraction provided further insights into the virulence enabling factors, but also yielded domains linked to traits not present in pathogenic strains.",

    "abstract": "Glycerol is an eco-friendly solvent that enhances plant biomass decomposition via glycerolysis in many pretreatment methods. Nonetheless, the lack of efficient conversion of glycerol by natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae hinders its use in these methods. Here, we have aimed to develop a complete strategy for the generation of efficient glycerol-converting yeast by modifying the oxidation of cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) by an O2-dependent dynamic shuttle, while abolishing both glycerol phosphorylation and biosynthesis. By following a vigorous glycerol oxidation pathway, the engineered strain increased the conversion efficiency (CE) to up to 0.49 g ethanol/g glycerol (98% of theoretical CE), with production rate > 1 g{middle dot}L{middle dot}h, when glycerol was supplemented in a single fed-batch fermentation in a rich medium. Furthermore, the engineered strain fermented a mixture of glycerol and glucose, producing > 86 g/L bioethanol with 92.8% CE. To our knowledge, this is the highest ever reported titer in this field. Notably, this strategy changed conventional yeast from a non-grower on minimal medium containing glycerol to a fermenting strain with productivity of 0.25-0.5 g{middle dot}L{middle dot}h and 84-78% CE, which converted 90% of the substrate to products. Our findings may improve the utilization of glycerol in several eco-friendly biorefinery approaches.\n\nIMPORTANCEWith the development of efficient lignocellulosic biorefineries, glycerol has attracted attention as an eco-friendly biomass-derived solvent that can enhance the dissociation of lignin and cell wall polysaccharides during the pretreatment process. Co-conversion of glycerol with the sugars released from biomass after glycerolysis increases the resources for ethanol production and lowers the burden of component separation. However, titer productivity hinders the industrial application of this process. Therefore, generation of efficient glycerol-fermenting yeast will promote the applicability of integrated biorefineries. Furthermore, glycerol is an important carbon source for the production of various chemicals. Hence, control of the metabolic flux of yeast grown on glycerol will contribute to the generation of cell factories that produce chemicals such as ethanol from glycerol, which will boost biodiesel and bioethanol industries. Additionally, the use of glycerol-fermenting yeast will reduce global warming and generation of agricultural waste, leading to the establishment of a sustainable society.",

An increasing number of C. difficile infections are attributed to hypervirulence strains that produce more toxins and spores. C. difficile spores are the major factor for the transmission and persistence of the organism. Previous studies have identified global regulators that influence sporulation in C. difficile. This study discovered that PdcB, a phosphodiesterase to influence sporulation in C. difficile UK1 strain positively. Through genetic and biochemical assays, we have shown that phase variable expression of pdcB results in hypo- and hyper-sporulation phenotype. In the \"ON\" orientation, the identified promotor is the right orientation to drive the expression of pdcB. Production of PdcB phosphodiesterase reduces the intracellular cyclic-di-GMP concentration, resulting in hyper-sporulation phenotype. The OFF orientation of pdcB switch or mutating pdcB results in increased cyclic-di-GMP and hypo-sporulating phenotype. Additionally, we demonstrated that CodY binds to the upstream region of pdcB to represses its expression, and CodY mediated repression is relieved by the DNA inversion.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular calcium signaling has been implicated in control of a variety of circadian processes in animals and plants but its role in microbial clocks has remained largely cryptic. To examine the role of intracellular Ca2+ in the Neurospora clock we screened knockouts of calcium transporter genes and identified a gene encoding a calcium exporter, nca-2, uniquely as having significant period effects. Loss of NCA-2 results in an increase in cytosolic calcium level, and this leads to hyper-phosphorylation of core clock components, FRQ and WC-1, and a short period as measured by both the core oscillator and overt clock. Genetic analyses showed that mutations in certain frq phospho-sites, and in Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase (camk-2), are epistatic to nca-2 in controlling the pace of the oscillator. These data are consistent with a model in which elevated intracellular Ca+2 leads to increased activity of CAMK-2 leading to enhanced FRQ phosphorylation, accelerated closure of the circadian feedback loop, and a shortened circadian period length. At a mechanistic level some CAMKs undergo more auto-phosphorylations in {Delta}nca-2, consistent with high calcium in the {Delta}nca-2 mutant influencing the enzymatic activity of CAMKs. NCA-2 interacts with multiple proteins including CSP-6, a protein known to be required for circadian output. Most importantly, expression of nca-2 is circadian clock-controlled at both the transcriptional and translational levels, and this in combination with the period effects seen in strains lacking NCA-2, firmly places calcium signaling within the larger circadian system where it acts as both an input to and output from the core clock.\n\nImportanceCircadian rhythms are based on cell-autonomous, auto-regulatory, feedback loops formed by interlocked positive and negative arms, and they regulate myriad molecular and cellular processes in most eukaryotes including fungi. Intracellular calcium signaling is also a process that impacts a broad range of biological events in most eukaryotes. Clues have suggested that calcium signaling can influence circadian oscillators through multiple pathways; however, mechanistic details have been lacking in microorganisms. Building on prior work describing calcium transporters in the fungus Neurospora, one such transporter, NCA-2, was identified as a regulator of circadian period length. Increased intracellular calcium levels caused by loss of NCA-2 results in over-activation of calcium-responsive protein kinases, in turn leading to a shortened circadian period length. Importantly, expression of NCA-2 is itself controlled by the molecular clock. In this way calcium signaling can be seen as providing both input to and output from the circadian system.",

The effect NO and H2S pathway effectors have on HeLa 229 cell viability was measured after 10 days anaerobic incubation. The addition of arginine or xanthine (NO pathway precursors) consistently increased HeLa cell viability by 13.1- and 4.4-fold, respectively. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, also increased viability, as compared to control levels. In contrast, inhibition of iNOS by 1400W increased cell viability by 79-fold. Regarding the H2S pathway, precursor cysteine enhanced viability by 9.8-fold with the greatest number of viable cells measured in response to the presence of a H2S donor (GYY4137), or an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, propargylglycine (40- and 85-fold, respectively).

However, the complex mechanisms that underlie this crosstalk are poorly understood. To address this question, we focused on the corneal epithelial SC model in which the SC niche, known as the limbus, is spatially segregated from the differentiation compartment. We report that the unique biomechanical property of the limbus supports the nuclear localization and function of Yes-associated protein (YAP), a putative mediator of the mechanotransduction pathway. Perturbation of tissue stiffness or YAP activity affects SC function as well as tissue integrity under homeostasis and significantly inhibited the regeneration of the SC population following SC depletion. In vitro experiments revealed that substrates with the rigidity of the corneal differentiation compartment inhibit YAP localization and induce differentiation, a mechanism that is mediated by the TGF{beta}-SMAD2/3 pathway.

    "abstract": "Fisheries bycatch, the incidental mortality of non-target species, is a major threat to seabirds worldwide. Mitigating bycatch is an important factor to reduce seabird population declines and consequent changes in ocean trophic dynamics and ecosystem functioning. However, it remains an open question how and where mitigating bycatch at a global scale may conserve seabird traits and the ecological strategies that traits represent. Here we combine a dataset of species traits and distribution ranges for 341 seabirds with spatially resolved fishing effort data for gillnet, longline, trawl, and purse seine gears to: (1) understand spatial variation in seabird community traits; and (2) test whether mitigating fisheries bycatch may prevent shifts in traits of seabird communities and loss of ecological strategies. We find distinct spatial variation in the community weighted mean of five seabird traits (clutch size, body mass, generation length, foraging guild, and diet guild). Furthermore, our analysis suggests that successful bycatch mitigation could prevent strong shifts in the traits of seabird communities across the globe particularly in the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Specifically, changes in dominant foraging and diet guilds, and shifts towards communities with faster reproductive speeds (larger clutch sizes and shorter generation lengths) and smaller body masses could be avoided. Therefore, bycatch mitigation may have important indirect benefits for sustaining ecosystem functioning, as mediated by species traits. Incorporating species traits into management actions will provide valuable tools for marine spatial planning and when evaluating the success of conservation initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that confer protection against diverse influenza strains have been isolated1,2. Structural and biochemical characterization of these bnAbs has provided molecular insight into how they bind distinct antigens1. However, our understanding of the evolutionary pathways leading to bnAbs, and thus how best to elicit them, remains limited. Here, we measure equilibrium dissociation constants of combinatorially complete mutational libraries for two naturally isolated influenza bnAbs3-5 (CR-9114, 16 mutations; CR-6261, 11 mutations), reconstructing all possible intermediates back to the unmutated germline sequences. We find that these two libraries exhibit strikingly different patterns of breadth: while many variants of CR-6261 display moderate affinity to diverse antigens, those of CR-9114 display appreciable affinity only in specific, nested combinations. By examining the extensive pairwise and higher-order epistasis between mutations, we find key sites with strong synergistic interactions that are highly similar across antigens for CR-6261 and different for CR-9114. Together, these features of the binding affinity landscapes strongly favor sequential acquisition of affinity to diverse antigens for CR-9114, while the acquisition of breadth to more similar antigens for CR-6261 is less constrained. These results, if generalizable to other bnAbs, may explain the molecular basis for the widespread observation that sequential exposure favors greater breadth6-8, and such mechanistic insight will be essential for predicting and eliciting broadly protective immune responses.",

The lack of knowledge about its evolutionary history contrasts with a large number of studies in the biomedical area. This study aimed to investigate the retrotransposition evolutionary dynamics associated with this gene in primates. We identified retropseudogenes that originated in the ancestors of anthropoids, catarrhines, and lemuriformes, i.e. the strepsirrhine clade that inhabit Madagascar. We also found species-specific retropseudogenes in the philippine tarsier, Bolivian squirrel monkey, capuchin monkey and vervet. Although retropseudogenes are not able to produce a functional protein, we can not rule out that they may represent genetic material upon which evolution acts on, especially with regulatory functions.",

Prior analyses of MS genetics have identified broad enrichments across peripheral immune cells, yet the driver immune subsets are unclear. We utilized chromatin accessibility data across hematopoietic cells to identify cell type-specific enrichments of MS genetic signals. We found that CD4 T and B cells were independently enriched for MS genetics and further refined the driver subsets to Th17 and memory B cells, respectively. We replicated our findings in data from untreated and treated MS patients and found that immunomodulatory treatments suppress chromatin accessibility at driver cell types. Integration of statistical fine-mapping and chromatin interactions nominated numerous putative causal genes, illustrating complex interplay between shared and cell-specific genes. Our study highlights how careful integration of genetics and epigenetics can provide fine-scale insights into causal cell types and nominate new genes and pathways for disease.",

However, current standard approaches often require many millions of cells for input material to achieve high coverage of the immunopeptidome and are therefore not compatible with the often limited amounts of tissue available from clinical tumor samples. Here, we evaluated microscaled basic reversed-phase fractionation to separate HLA peptide samples off-line followed by ion mobility coupled to LC-MS/MS for analysis. The combination of these two separation methods enabled identification of 20% to 50% more peptides compared to samples analyzed without either prior fractionation or use of ion mobility alone. We demonstrate coverage of HLA immunopeptidomes with up to 8,107 distinct peptides starting with as few as 100 million cells or 150 milligrams of wet weight tumor tissue. This increased sensitivity can improve HLA binding prediction algorithms and enable detection of clinically relevant epitopes such as neoantigens.",

    "abstract": "Fitness functions map biological sequences to a scalar property of interest. Accurate estimation of these functions yields biological insight and sets the foundation for model-based sequence design. However, the amount of fitness data available to learn these functions is typically small relative to the large combinatorial space of sequences; characterizing how much data is needed for accurate estimation remains an open problem. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that empirical fitness functions display substantial sparsity when represented in terms of epistatic interactions. Moreover, the theory of Compressed Sensing provides scaling laws for the number of samples required to exactly recover a sparse function. Motivated by these results, we develop a framework to study the sparsity of fitness functions sampled from a generalization of the NK model, a widely-used random field model of fitness functions. In particular, we present results that allow us to test the effect of the Generalized NK (GNK) models interpretable parameters--sequence length, alphabet size, and assumed interactions between sequence positions--on the sparsity of fitness functions sampled from the model and, consequently, the number of measurements required to exactly recover these functions. We validate our framework by demonstrating that GNK models with parameters set according to structural considerations can be used to accurately approximate the number of samples required to recover two empirical protein fitness functions and an RNA fitness function. In addition, we show that these GNK models identify important higher-order epistatic interactions in the empirical fitness functions using only structural information.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) with sub-tomogram averaging (STA) is indispensable when studying macromolecule structures and functions in their native environments. However, current tomographic reconstructions suffer the low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and the missing wedge artifacts. Hence, automatic and accurate macromolecule localization and classification become the bottleneck problem for structural determination by STA. Here, we propose a 3D multi-scale dense convolutional neural network (MSDNet) for voxel-wise annotations of tomograms. Weighted focal loss is adopted as a loss function to solve the class imbalance. The proposed network combines 3D hybrid dilated convolutions (HDC) and dense connectivity to ensure an accurate performance with relatively few trainable parameters. 3D HDC expands the receptive field without losing resolution or learning extra parameters. Dense connectivity facilitates the re-use of feature maps to generate fewer intermediate feature maps and trainable parameters. Then, we design a 3D MSDNet based approach for fully automatic macromolecule localization and classification, called VP-Detector (Voxel-wise Particle Detector). VP-Detector is efficient because classification performs on the pre-calculated coordinates instead of a sliding window.\n\nResultsWe evaluated the VP-Detector on simulated tomograms. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieved a competitive performance on localization with the highest F1-score. We also demonstrated that the weighted focal loss improves the classification of hard classes. We trained the network on a part of training sets to prove the availability of training on relatively small datasets. Moreover, the experiment shows that VP-Detector has a fast particle detection speed, which costs less than 14 minutes on a test tomogram.\n\nContactzsh@amss.ac.cn, xfcui@email.sdu.edu.cn, zhangfa@ict.ac.cn\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

We show that a nanofluidic sample support with well-defined geometry can be used to prepare cryo-EM specimens with reproducible ice thickness from picoliter sample volumes. The sample solution is contained in electron-transparent nanochannels that provide uniform thickness gradients without further optimisation and eliminate the potentially destructive air-water interface. We demonstrate the possibility to perform high-resolution structure determination with three standard protein specimens.

Load forces slow the growth and increase the density of these networks, but the molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood. Here we use single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Unexpectedly, force slows the rate of filament nucleation by promoting the interaction of nucleation promoting factors with actin filament ends, limiting branch formation. This inhibition is countered by an even larger force-induced drop in the rate of filament capping, resulting in a shift in the balance between nucleation and capping that increases network density. Remarkably, the force dependence of capping is identical to that of filament elongation because they require the same size gap to appear between the filament and load for insertion. These results provide direct evidence that Brownian Ratchets generate force and govern the load adaptation of branched actin networks.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been significant advances in quantifying molecule copy number and protein stoichiometry with single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). However, as the density of fluorophores per diffraction-limited spot increases, distinguishing between detection events from different fluorophores becomes progressively more difficult, affecting the accuracy of such measurements. Although essential to the design of quantitative experiments, the dynamic range of SMLM counting techniques has not yet been studied in detail. Here we provide a working definition of the dynamic range for quantitative SMLM in terms of the relative number of missed localizations or blinks, and explore the photophysical and experimental parameters that affect it. We begin with a simple two-state model of blinking fluorophores, then extend the model to incorporate photobleaching and temporal binning by the detection camera. From these models, we first show that our estimates of the dynamic range agree with realistic simulations of the photoswitching. We find that the dynamic range scales inversely with the duty cycle when counting both blinks and localizations. Finally, we validate our theoretical approach on dSTORM datasets of photo-switching Alexa647 dyes. Our results should help guide researchers in designing and implementing SMLM-based molecular counting experiments.",

    "abstract": "The biological clock exhibits circadian rhythms, with an endogenous period tau close to 24h. The circadian resonance theory proposes that lifespan is reduced when endogenous period goes far from 24h. It has been suggested that daily resetting of the circadian clock to the 24h external photoperiod might induce marginal costs that would accumulate over time and forward accelerate aging and affect fitness. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the link between the endogenous period and biomarkers of aging in order to investigate the mechanisms of the circadian resonance theory. We studied 39 middle-aged and aged Microcebus murinus, a nocturnal non-human primate whose endogenous period is about 23.1h, measuring the endogenous period of locomotor activity, as well as several physiological and behavioral parameters (rhythm fragmentation and amplitude, energetic expenditure, oxidative stress, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations and cognitive performances) in both males and females. We found that aged males with tau far from 24h displayed increased oxidative stress. We also demonstrated a positive correlation between tau and IGF-1 concentrations, as well as learning performances, in males and females. Together these results suggest that a great deviation of tau from 24h leads to increased biomarkers of age-related impairments.\n\nSummary StatementThis manuscript describes how the misalignment between the endogenous circadian period and the 24h of the environmental periodicity impacts aging biomarkers and accelerates cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Plasma ultrafiltration in the kidney occurs across glomerular capillaries, which are surrounded by epithelial cells called podocytes. Podocytes have a unique shape maintained by a complex cytoskeleton, which becomes disrupted in glomerular disease resulting in defective filtration and albuminuria. Lack of endogenous thymosin {beta}4 (TB4), an actin sequestering peptide, exacerbates glomerular injury and disrupts the organisation of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, however, the effect of exogenous TB4 therapy on podocytopathy is unknown. Here, through interrogating single-cell RNA-sequencing data of isolated glomeruli we demonstrate that Adriamycin, a toxin which injures podocytes and leads to leakage of albumin in the urine of mice, results in reduced levels of podocyte TB4. Systemic administration of an adeno-associated virus vector encoding TB4 prevented Adriamycin-induced podocyte loss and albuminuria. Adriamycin injury was associated with disorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton in vitro, which was ameliorated by exogenous TB4. Furthermore, Adriamycin administration in mice was associated with increased prevalence of podocyte vesicles, a mechanism by which albumin may leak into the urine, which was also prevented by TB4. Collectively, we propose that TB4 gene therapy prevents podocyte injury and maintains glomerular filtration via modulation of the podocyte cytoskeleton thus presenting a novel treatment strategy for glomerular disease.",

    "abstract": "The impact of salinity on wheat plants is often studied by analysis of shoot responses, even though the main mechanism of tolerance is shoot Na+ exclusion. There is a need to understand the molecular responses of root tissues that directly experience rising NaCl concentrations. We have combined analysis of root growth, ion content and respiration with proteome responses in wheat root tip and mature root tissues under saline conditions. We find significant changes in translation and protein synthesis, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism in a root tissue specific manner. Translation and protein synthesis related proteins showed significant decreases in abundance only in root tips, as did most of the glycolytic enzymes and selected TCA cycle enzymes and ATP synthase subunits. This selective root tip proteome response indicates protein synthesis capacity and energy production were impaired under salt stress, correlating with the anatomical response of roots and reduced root tip respiration rate. Wheat roots respond directly to soil salinity, therefore shoot responses such as reduction in shoot growth and photosynthetic capacity need to be considered in light of these effects.",

    "abstract": "Monoamines are a class of neuromodulators that are crucial for a variety of brain functions, including control of mood, movement, sleep and cognition. From mammals to insects, the nervous system is enriched in monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin and melatonin, analytes which range from being highly polar to non-polar. Here we developed a method using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify in a single run the amounts of six distinct monoamines in extracts from dissected Drosophila and mouse brain tissues. The measured monoamines were dopamine (DA), serotonin (also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)), octopamine (OA, an insect equivalent of norepinephrine), tyramine (TA), melatonin (MT) and N-acetyl-hydroxy-serotonin (NAS). The analytical range of these monoamines was between 0.25 to 5.0 ng/mL.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is an essential, highly conserved quality control pathway that detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs). Although the essentiality of NMD is frequently ascribed to its prevention of truncated protein accumulation, the extent to which NMD actually suppresses proteins encoded by NMD-sensitive transcripts is less well-understood than NMD-mediated suppression of mRNA. Here, we describe a reporter system that permits accurate quantification of both mRNA and protein levels via stable integration of paired reporters encoding NMD-sensitive and NMD-insensitive transcripts into the AAVS1 safe harbor loci in human cells. We use this system to demonstrate that NMD suppresses proteins encoded by NMD-sensitive transcripts by up to [~]8-fold more than the mRNA itself. Our data indicate that NMD limits the accumulation of proteins encoded by NMD substrates by mechanisms beyond mRNA degradation, such that even when NMD-sensitive mRNAs escape destruction, their encoded proteins are still effectively suppressed.",

    "abstract": "A precise quantitative description of the ultrastructural characteristics underlying biological mechanisms is often key to their understanding. This is particularly true for dynamic extra- and intracellular filamentous assemblies, playing a role in cell motility, cell integrity, cytokinesis, tissue formation and maintenance. For example, genetic manipulation or modulation of actin regulatory proteins frequently manifests in changes of the morphology, dynamics, and ultrastructural architecture of actin filament-rich cell peripheral structures, such as lamellipodia or filopodia. However, the observed ultrastructural effects often remain subtle and require sufficiently large datasets for appropriate quantitative analysis. The acquisition of such large datasets has been enabled by recent advances in high-throughput cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) methods. However, this also necessitates the development of complementary approaches to maximize the extraction of relevant biological information. We have developed a computational toolbox for the semi-automatic quantification of filamentous networks from cryo-ET datasets to facilitate the analysis and cross-comparison of multiple experimental conditions. GUI-based components simplify the manipulation of data and allow users to obtain a large number of ultrastructural parameters describing filamentous assemblies. We demonstrate the feasibility of this workflow by analyzing cryo-ET data of untreated and chemically perturbed branched actin filament networks and that of parallel actin filament arrays. In principle, the computational toolbox presented here is applicable for data analysis comprising any type of filaments in regular (i.e. parallel) or random arrangement. We show that it can ease the identification of key differences between experimental groups and facilitate the in-depth analysis of ultrastructural data in a time-efficient manner.",

Imaging endogenously-tagged nucleoporins and F-actin on this system using DNA- and peptide-PAINT routinely gives 30nm resolution or better at depths greater than 20 {micro}m. This revealed that the nuclear pores are nonrandomly distributed in most Drosophila tissues, in contrast to cultured cells. Lamin Dm0 shows a complementary localisation to the nuclear pores, suggesting that it corrals the pores. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the tissue-specific Lamin C distributes the nuclear pores more randomly, whereas lamin C mutants enhance nuclear pore clustering, particularly in muscle nuclei. Since nucleoporins interact with specific chromatin domains, nuclear pore clustering could regulate chromatin organisation locally and contribute to the disease phenotypes caused by human Lamin A/C laminopathies.",

    "abstract": "Fisheries bycatch, the incidental mortality of non-target species, is a global threat to seabirds and a major driver of their declines worldwide. Identifying the most vulnerable species is core to developing sustainable fisheries management strategies that aim to improve conservation outcomes. To advance this goal, we present a preliminary vulnerability framework that integrates dimensions of species exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to fisheries bycatch to classify species into five vulnerability classes. The framework combines species traits and distribution ranges for 341 seabirds, along with a spatially resolved fishing effort dataset. Overall, we find most species have high vulnerability scores for the sensitivity and adaptive capacity dimensions. By contrast, exposure is more variable across species, and thus the median scores calculated within seabird families is low. We further find 46 species have high exposure to fishing activities, but are not identified as vulnerable to bycatch, whilst 133 species have lower exposure, but are vulnerable to bycatch. Thus, the framework has been valuable for revealing patterns between and within the vulnerability dimensions. Still, further methodological development, additional traits, and greater availability of threat data are required to advance the framework and provide a new lens for quantifying seabird bycatch vulnerability that complements existing efforts, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.",

    "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) driven by weak, multivalent interactions among biomolecules is an important means of cellular compartmentation and plays a central role in cellular processes including stress resistance, RNA processing and other cellular activities. Coordination of the condensates and inner membrane was recently revealed, mediating intracellular processes like cell signalling and cargo trafficking. Intracellular LLPS has been observed extensively in vivo, whereas LLPS in extracellular compartments has not been reported under physiological conditions. Here we show, for the first time, that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) undergoes LLPS on the cell surface by interacting with heparan sulphate proteoglycans (HSPG) and the phase transition is required for effective downstream signalling. The condensation is driven by multivalent interactions between bFGF and sulpho-groups on heparan sulphate (HS), and dimerization and oligomerization of bFGF promote the LLPS process. Compared with free bFGF, phase separated bFGF with HS showed higher thermo stability, providing a potential mechanism for the preservation of bFGF activity. Furthermore, we have found that downstream signalling is triggered by phase separation of a ternary complex formed by bFGF, HSPGs and FGFR on cell surface. Our results revealed a molecular mechanism that HS can serve as a platform to promote extracellular proteins like bFGF to condensate on outer membrane, consequently coordinating the signal transduction activities. This novel finding expands the horizons of phase separation in vivo, providing a new dimension on how HSPG may regulate extracellular protein behaviour and cell signalling.",

A restaurateur proposed that exposing lobster to cannabis smoke reduces anxiety and pain during the cooking process. It is unknown if lobster gill respiration in air would result in significant {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) uptake and whether this would have any detectable behavioral effects.\n\nObjectiveThe primary goal was to determine tissue THC levels in the lobster after exposure to THC vapor. Secondary goals were to determine if THC vapor altered locomotor behavior or nociception.\n\nMethodsTissue samples were collected (including muscle, brain and hemolymph) from Homarus americanus (N=3 per group) following 30 or 60 minutes of exposure to vapor generated by an e-cigarette device using THC (100 mg/mL in a propylene glycol vehicle). Separate experiments assessed locomotor behavior and hot water nociceptive responses following THC vapor exposure.\n\nResultsTHC vapor produced duration-related THC levels in all tissues examined. Locomotor activity was decreased (distance, speed, time-mobile) by 30 min inhalation of THC. Lobsters exhibit a temperature-dependent withdrawal response to immersion of tail, antennae or claws in warm water; this is novel evidence of thermal nociception for this species. THC exposure for 60 minutes had only marginal effect on nociception under the conditions assessed.\n\nConclusionsVapor exposure of lobsters, using an e-cigarette based model, produces dose-dependent THC levels in all tissues and reduces locomotor activity. Hot water nociception was temperature dependent, but only minimal anti-nociceptive effect of THC exposure was confirmed.",

    "abstract": "DNA repair mechanisms fulfil a dual role, as they are essential for cell survival and genome maintenance. Here, we studied how cells regulate the interplay between DNA repair and mutation. We focused on the Escherichia coli adaptive response that increases resistance to DNA alkylation damage. Combination of single-molecule imaging and microfluidic-based single-cell microscopy showed that noise in the gene activation timing of the master regulator Ada is accurately propagated to generate a distinct subpopulation of cells in which all proteins of the adaptive response are absent. Although lack of these proteins causes extreme sensitivity to alkylation stress, cellular heterogeneity in DNA alkylation repair provides a functional benefit by increasing the evolvability of the whole population. We demonstrated this by monitoring the dynamics of nascent mutations during alkylation stress as well as the frequency of fixed mutations that are generated by the distinct subpopulations of the adaptive response. This highlighted that evolvability is a trade-off between mutability and cell survival. Stochastic modulation of DNA repair capacity by the adaptive response solves this trade-off through the generation of a viable hypermutable subpopulation of cells that acts as a source of genetic diversity in a clonal population.",

    "abstract": "The hallmark of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope is the presence of the outer membrane (OM). The OM is asymmetric, comprising lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the outer leaflet and phospholipids (PLs) in the inner leaflet; this critical feature confers permeability barrier function against external insults, including antibiotics. To maintain OM lipid asymmetry, the OmpC-Mla system is believed to remove aberrantly localized PLs from the OM and transport them to the inner membrane (IM). Key to the system in driving lipid trafficking is the MlaFEDB ABC transporter complex in the IM, but mechanistic details, including transport directionality, remain enigmatic. Here, we develop a sensitive point-to-point in vitro lipid transfer assay that allows direct tracking of [14C]-labelled PLs between the periplasmic chaperone MlaC and MlaFEDB reconstituted into nanodiscs. We reveal that MlaC spontaneously transfers PLs to the IM transporter in an MlaD-dependent manner that can be further enhanced by coupled ATP hydrolysis. In addition, we show that MlaD is important for modulating productive coupling between ATP hydrolysis and such retrograde PL transfer. We further demonstrate that spontaneous PL transfer also occurs from MlaFEDB to MlaC, but such anterograde movement is instead abolished by ATP hydrolysis. Our work uncovers a model where PLs reversibly partition between two lipid binding sites in MlaC and MlaFEDB, and ATP binding and/or hydrolysis shift this equilibrium to ultimately drive retrograde PL transport by the OmpC-Mla system. These mechanistic insights will inform future efforts towards discovering new antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens.\n\nSignificance StatementBiological membranes define cellular boundaries, allow compartmentalization, and represent a prerequisite for life. In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane (OM) prevents entry of toxic substances, conferring intrinsic resistance against many antibiotics. This barrier function requires unequal distribution of lipids across the OM bilayer, yet how such lipid asymmetry is maintained is not well understood. In this study, we established the directionality of lipid transport for a conserved membrane protein complex, and uncovered mechanistic insights into how ATP powers such transport from the OM to the inner membrane.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are a heterogeneous population of neoplasms that arise from hormone-secreting islet cells of the pancreas and have increased markedly in incidence over the past four decades. Non-functional PanNETs, which occur more frequently than hormone-secreting tumors, are often not diagnosed until later stages of tumor development and have poorer prognoses. Development of successful therapeutics for PanNETs has been slow, partially due to a lack of diverse animal models for pre-clinical testing. Here, we report development of an inducible, conditional mouse model of PanNETs by using a bitransgenic system for regulated expression of the aberrant activator of Cdk5, p25, specifically in {beta}-islet cells. This model produces a heterogeneous population of PanNETs that includes a subgroup of well-differentiated, non-functional tumors. The utility of this model is enhanced by ability to form tumor-derived allografts. Production of these tumors demonstrates the causative potential of aberrantly active Cdk5 for generation of PanNETs. Further, we show that human PanNETs express Cdk5 pathway components, are dependent on Cdk5 for growth, and share genetic and transcriptional overlap with the INS-p25OE model. This new model of PanNETs will facilitate molecular delineation of Cdk5-dependent PanNETs and the development of new targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "One conserved feature among angiosperms is the development of flat thin leaves. This developmental pattern optimizes light capture and gas exchange for photosynthesis. The blue light receptors phototropins are required for leaf flattening, with the null phot1phot2 mutant showing downwards curled leaves in Arabidopsis. However, key aspects of their function in leaf development remain unknown. Here, we performed a detailed spatiotemporal characterization of phototropin function in Arabidopsis leaves. We found that phototropins perceive light direction in the leaf blade, and similar to their role in hypocotyls they control the spatial pattern of auxin signaling possibly modulating auxin transport, to ultimately regulate cell expansion. Phototropin signaling components in the leaf partially differ from hypocotyls. Moreover, the light response on the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) sides of the leaf blade suggest a partially distinct requirement of phototropin signaling components on each side. In particular, NON PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH3) showed an adaxial-specific function. In addition, we show a prominent role of PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE 3 (PKS3) in leaf flattening. Among the auxin transporters tested, PINs and AUX/LAX influence the response most prominently. Overall, our results show that directional blue light perception by the phototropins is a key aspect of leaf development, integrating endogenous and exogenous signals.\n\nOne sentence summaryPhototropins perceive light direction in the leaf and control the auxin signaling pattern to regulate blade flattening.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this root growth promotion (RGP) activity remained unclear. Here, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis of A. thaliana roots inoculated with root-associated commensal bacteria of Rhizobiales and sister lineages and revealed common and strain/lineage-specific transcriptional response, possibly mediated by WRKY and ANAC family of transcription factors. We showed that the observed common response was also partly triggered by a wide range of non-pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and a multikingdom synthetic community (SynCom). This response was characterized by a down-regulation of genes related to intracellular redox regulation, suggesting distinctive redox status between pathogenic and non-pathogenic interactions. By integrating with developmental and cell biological experiments, we identified a crucial role of TYROSYLPROTEIN SULFOTRANSFERASE (TPST) in Rhizobiales RGP. Conversely, none of the known TPST-dependent sulfated peptide pathways appeared to be required for this activity, suggesting an unidentified component in the protein sulfation pathway targeted by Rhizobiales RGP. Finally, we show that TPST is needed for RGP exerted by Rhizobiales but not Pseudomonadales isolates, delineating lineage-specific mechanisms to manipulate host root development.",

    "abstract": "Efficient acquisition and use of available phosphorus from the soil is crucial for plant growth, development, and yield. With an ever-increasing acreage of croplands with suboptimal available soil phosphorus, genetic improvement of sorghum germplasm for enhanced phosphorus acquisition from soil is crucial to increasing agricultural output and reducing inputs, while confronted with a growing world population and uncertain climate. Sorghum bicolor is a globally important commodity for food, fodder, and forage. Known for robust tolerance to heat, drought, and other abiotic stresses, its capacity for optimal phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) is still being investigated for optimized root system architectures (RSA). Whilst a few RSA-influencing genes have been identified in sorghum and other grasses, the epigenetic impact on expression and tissue-specific activation of candidate PUE genes remains elusive. Here, we present transcriptomic, epigenetic, and regulatory network profiling of RSA modulation in the BTx623 sorghum background in response to limiting phosphorus (LP) conditions. We show that during LP, sorghum RSA is remodeled to increase root length and surface area, likely enhancing its ability to acquire P. Global DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels decrease in response to LP, while H3K4me3 peaks and DNA hypomethylated regions contain recognition motifs of numerous developmental and nutrient responsive transcription factors that display disparate expression patterns between different root tissues (primary root apex, elongation zone, and lateral root apex). Suggesting that epigenetic shifts during growth on LP results in targeted gene expression in a tissue-specific manner that optimizes the RSA for improved P uptake.\n\nSummaryIn response to low P, epigenetic and transcriptional changes stimulate lateral root growth in Sorghum bicolor BTx623, increasing the root surface area for enhanced \"mining\" of P from the soil.",

    "abstract": "The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway controls transposon expression in animal germ cells, thereby ensuring genome stability over generations. In Drosophila, piRNAs are intergenerationally inherited through the maternal lineage, and this has demonstrated importance in the specification of piRNA source loci and in silencing of I- and P-elements in the germ cells of daughters. Maternally inherited Piwi protein enters somatic nuclei in early embryos prior to zygotic genome activation and persists therein for roughly half of the time required to complete embryonic development. To investigate the role of the piRNA pathway in the embryonic soma, we created a conditionally unstable Piwi protein. This enabled maternally deposited Piwi to be cleared from newly laid embryos within 30 minutes and well ahead of the activation of zygotic transcription. Examination of RNA and protein profiles over time, and correlation with patterns of H3K9me3 deposition, suggests a role for maternally deposited Piwi in attenuating zygotic transposon expression in somatic cells of the developing embryo. In particular, robust deposition of piRNAs targeting roo, an element whose expression is mainly restricted to embryonic development, results in the deposition of transient heterochromatic marks at active roo insertions. We hypothesize that roo, an extremely successful mobile element, may have adopted a lifestyle of expression in the embryonic soma to evade silencing in germ cells.",

    "abstract": "Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) protein is one of the most evolving accessory proteins in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was previously reported that the ORF8 protein inhibits presentation of viral antigens by the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and interacts with host factors involved in pulmonary inflammation. The ORF8 protein assists SARS-CoV-2 to evade immunity and replication. Among many contributing mutations, Q27STOP, a mutation in the ORF8 protein defines the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, which is engendering the second wave of COVID-19. In the present study, 47 unique truncated ORF8 proteins (T-ORF8) due to the Q27STOP mutations were identified among 49055 available B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The results show that only one of the 47 T-ORF8 variants spread to over 57 geo-locations in North America, and other continents which includes Africa, Asia, Europe and South America. Based on various quantitative features such as amino acid homology, polar/non-polar sequence homology, Shannon entropy conservation, and other physicochemical properties of all specific 47 T-ORF8 protein variants, a collection of nine possible T-ORF8 unique variants were defined. The question of whether T-ORF8 variants work similarly to ORF8 has yet to be investigated. A positive response to the question could exacerbate future COVID-19 waves, necessitating severe containment measures.",

As the key immunogen, the spike protein is frequently mutated with conserved epitopes shielded by glycans.

We found that deletion of Resf1 in ESCs cultured in serum and LIF reduces self-renewal potential whereas episomal expression of RESF1 has a modest positive effect on ESC self-renewal. In addition, RESF1 is not required for the capacity of NANOG and its downstream target ESRRB to drive self-renewal in the absence of LIF.

    "abstract": "Comparing the evolution of distantly related viruses can provide insights into common adaptive processes related to shared ecological niches. Phylogenetic approaches, coupled with other molecular evolution tools, can help identify mutations informative on adaptation, whilst the structural contextualization of these to functional sites of proteins may help gain insight into their biological properties. Two zoonotic betacoronaviruses capable of sustained human-to-human transmission have caused pandemics in recent times (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), whilst a third virus (MERS-CoV) is responsible for sporadic outbreaks linked to animal infections. Moreover, two other betacoronaviruses have circulated endemically in humans for decades (HKU1 and OC43). To search for evidence of adaptive convergence between established and emerging betacoronaviruses capable of sustained human-to-human transmission (HKU1, OC43, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2), we developed a methodological pipeline to classify shared non-synonymous mutations as putatively denoting homoplasy (repeated mutations that do not share direct common ancestry) or stepwise evolution (sequential mutations leading towards a novel genotype). In parallel, we look for evidence of positive selection, and draw upon protein structure data to identify potential biological implications. We find 30 mutations, with four of these [codon sites 18121 (nsp14/residue 28), 21623 (spike/21), 21635 (spike/25) and 23948 (spike/796); SARS-CoV-2 genome numbering] displaying evolution under positive selection and proximity to functional protein regions.

While P-TEFb is regulated by 7SK snRNA in proliferating cells, it is absent in quiescent and terminally differentiated cells, which has remained unexplored. In these cells, we found that CycT1 not bound to CDK9 is rapidly degraded. Moreover, productive CycT1:CDK9 interactions require phosphorylation of two threonine residues (Thr143 and Thr149) in CycT1 by PKC. Conversely, PP1 dephosphorylates these sites. Thus, PKC inhibitors or removal of PKC by chronic activation results in P-TEFb disassembly and CycT1 degradation. This finding not only recapitulates P-TEFb depletion in resting CD4+ T cells but also in anergic T cells. Importantly, our studies reveal mechanisms of P-TEFb inactivation underlying T cell quiescence, anergy, and exhaustion as well as proviral latency and terminal differentiation of cells.",

Herein, we demonstrate that the formation of this complex depends on temperature and reaches a maximum ratio of about 1:1 at heat shock conditions, while almost no complex formation occurred below 4{degrees}C. In order to decipher the role of the two isoforms at elevated temperatures, we constructed L. monocytogenes ClpP1, ClpP2 and ClpP1/2 knockout strains and analyzed their protein regulation in comparison to the wild type (WT) strain via whole proteome mass-spectrometry (MS) at 37 {degrees}C and 42 {degrees}C. While {Delta}clpP1 strain only altered the expression of very few proteins, {Delta}clpP2 and {Delta}clpP1/2 strains revealed the dysregulation of many proteins at both temperatures. These effects were corroborated by crosslinking co-immunoprecipitation MS analysis. Thus, while ClpP1 serves as a mere enhancer of protein degradation in the heterocomplex, ClpP2 is essential for ClpX binding and thus functions as a gatekeeper for substrate entry. Applying an integrated proteomic approach combining whole proteome and co-immunoprecipitation datasets, several putative ClpP2 substrates were identified in the context of different temperatures and discussed with regards to their function in cellular pathways such as the SOS response.",

    "abstract": "The global efforts to control COVID-19 are threatened by the rapid emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that may display undesirable characteristics such as immune escape, increased transmissibility or pathogenicity. Early prediction for emergence of new strains with these features is critical for pandemic preparedness. We present Strainflow, a supervised and causally predictive model using unsupervised latent space features of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Strainflow was trained and validated on 0.9 million sequences for the period December, 2019 to June, 2021 and the frozen model was prospectively validated from July, 2021 to December, 2021. Strainflow captured the rise in cases two months ahead of the Delta and Omicron surges in most countries including the prediction of a surge in India as early as beginning of November, 2021. Entropy analysis of Strainflow unsupervised embeddings clearly reveals the explore-exploit cycles in genomic feature-space, thus adding interpretability to the deep learning based model. We also conducted codon-level analysis of our model for interpretability and biological validity of our unsupervised features. Strainflow application is openly available as an interactive web-application for prospective genomic surveillance of COVID-19 across the globe.",

    "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell receptor that the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 binds to and uses to enter and infect human cells. COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by the coronavirus, involves diverse pathologies beyond those of a respiratory disease, including micro-thrombosis (micro-clotting), cytokine storms, and inflammatory responses affecting many organ systems. Longer-term chronic illness can persist for many months, often well after the pathogen is no longer detected. A better understanding of the proteins that ACE2 interacts with can reveal information relevant to these disease manifestations and possible avenues for treatment. We have undertaken an approach to predict candidate ACE2 interacting proteins which uses evolutionary inference to identify a set of mammalian proteins that \"coevolve\" with ACE2. The approach, called evolutionary rate correlation (ERC), detects proteins that show highly correlated evolutionary rates during mammalian evolution. Such proteins are candidates for biological interactions with the ACE2 receptor. The approach has uncovered a number of key ACE2 protein interactions of potential relevance to COVID-19 pathologies. Some proteins have previously been reported to be associated with severe COVID-19, but are not currently known to interact directly with ACE2, while additional predicted novel ACE2 interactors are of potential relevance to the disease. Using reciprocal rankings of protein ERCs, we have identified strongly interconnected ACE2 associated protein networks relevant to COVID-19 pathologies. ACE2 has clear connections to coagulation pathway proteins, such as Coagulation Factor V and fibrinogen components FGG, FGB, and FGA, the latter possibly mediated through ACE2 connections to Clusterin (which clears misfolded extracellular proteins) and GPR141 (whose functions are relatively unknown). ACE2 also connects to proteins involved in cytokine signaling and immune response (e.g. IFNAR2, XCR1, and TLR8), and to Androgen Receptor (AR). The ERC prescreening approach has also elucidated possible functions for previously uncharacterized proteins and possible new functions for well-characterized ones. Suggestions are made for the validation of ERC predicted ACE2 protein interactions. We propose that ACE2 has novel protein interactions that are disrupted during SARS-CoV-2 infection, contributing to the spectrum of COVID-19 pathologies.",

Here we show that diffusivity contrast, widely used in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy at the ensemble level and in single-particle tracking on individual (but slowly diffusing) species, can be used as a general readout to determine the binding state of single DNA molecules with unlabeled proteins in solution. We first describe the technical basis of drift-free single-molecule diffusivity measurements in an Anti-Brownian ELetrokinetic (ABEL) trap. We then cross-validate our method with protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE), a popular technique to detect protein binding on nucleic acid substrates with single-molecule sensitivity. We extend an existing hydrodynamic modeling framework to link measured diffusivity to particular DNA-protein structures and obtain good agreement between the measured and predicted diffusivity values. Finally, we show that combining diffusivity contrast with PIFE allows simultaneous mapping of binding stoichiometry and location on individual DNA-protein complexes, potentially enhancing single-molecule views of relevant biophysical processes.",

Strikingly, neurological symptoms were exclusive to, and ubiquitous in, patients that exhibited moderate to high ACE2 expression in peri-vascular cells. Viral particles were identified in the vascular wall and paralleled by peri-vascular inflammation, as signified by T cell and macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, fibrinogen leakage indicated compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid from an additional 16 individuals (n = 8 COVID-19, median age = 67 years; and n = 8 control, median age = 69,5 years) exhibited significantly lower levels of the pericyte marker PDGFR{beta} in SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, indicative of disrupted pericyte homeostasis.\n\nWe conclude that pericyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 underlies virus entry into the privileged central nervous system space, as well as neurological symptomatology due to peri-vascular inflammation and a locally compromised blood-brain barrier.",

Optogenetics, in principle, offers such possibility. Here, we developed an initial version of a photo-switchable isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) aimed at controlling the metabolic flux through the citric acid cycle in budding yeast. By inserting a protein-based light switch (LOV2) into computationally identified active/regulatory-coupled sites of IDH and by using in vivo screening in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we obtained a number of IDH enzymes whose activity can be switched by light. Subsequent in-vivo characterization and optimization resulted in an initial version of photo-switchable (PS) IDH. While further improvements of the enzyme are necessary, our study demonstrates the efficacy of the overall approach from computational design, via in vivo screening and characterization. It also represents one of the first few examples, where optogenetics were used to control the activity of a metabolic enzyme.",

Sensory deprivation experiments are ideally suited to unravel the plasticity mechanisms which shape circuit connectivity, but have yet to consider the role of different inhibitory subtypes. We investigate how synaptic changes due to monocular deprivation affect the firing rate dynamics in a microcircuit network model of the visual cortex. We demonstrate that, in highly recurrent networks, deprivation-induced plasticity generates fundamentally different activity changes depending on interneuron composition. Considering parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) interneuron subtypes can capture the experimentally observed independent modulation of excitatory and inhibitory activity during sensory deprivation when SST+ feedback is sufficiently strong. Our model also applies to whisker deprivation in the somatosensory cortex revealing that these mechanisms are general across sensory cortices. Therefore, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the differential role of interneuron subtypes in regulating cortical dynamics during deprivation-induced plasticity.",

In accordance with the functional changes, transcriptomic profiling revealed perturbations in gene sets associated with glutamatergic synaptic function. At the molecular level, we identified specific changes in the cAMP/PKA pathway pointing toward a hyperactive cAMP pathway in SETD1A+/- neurons.

Disruption in ECs is an early and active component of vascular pathogenesis. However, our ability to selectively target ECs in the CNS for identification and manipulation is limited. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we utilized a recently developed AAV-BR1 system to identify distinct classes of ECs along the vascular tree using a GFP reporter. We then developed an inducible EC-specific ectopic Connexin 43 (Cx43) expression system using AAV-BR1-CAG-DIO-Cx43-P2A-DsRed2 in combination with a mouse line carrying inducible CreERT2 in ECs. We targeted Cx43 because its loss has been implicated in microvascular impariment in numerous diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and vascular edema. GFP-labeled ECs were numerous, evenly distributed along the vascular tree and their morphology was polarized with respect to the direction of blood flow. After tamoxifen induction, ectopic Cx43 was specifically expressed in ECs. Similarly to endogenous Cx43, ectopic Cx43 was localized at the membrane contacts of ECs and it did not affect tight junction proteins. The ability to enhance gap junctions in ECs provides a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, an early pathology in numerous diseases.",

We found that virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells display heterogeneous expression of the extracellular ATP sensor P2RX7. P2RX7-high expression is confined, at peak effector phase, to CD62L+ memory precursors which preferentially form Tcm cells. Among early effector CD8+ T cells, asymmetrical P2RX7 distribution correlated with distinct transcriptional signatures, with P2RX7-high cells enriched for memory and tissue-residency sets. P2RX7-high early effectors preferentially form both Tcm and Trm cells.

In two prospective cohorts, early non-neutralizing, afucosylated, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG predicted progression from mild, to more severe COVID-19. In contrast to the antibody structures that predicted disease progression, antibodies that were elicited by mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were low in Fc afucosylation and enriched in sialylation, both modifications that reduce the inflammatory potential of IgG. To study the biology afucosylated IgG immune complexes, we developed an in vivo model which revealed that human IgG-Fc{gamma}R interactions can regulate inflammation in the lung. Afucosylated IgG immune complexes induced inflammatory cytokine production and robust infiltration of the lung by immune cells. By contrast, vaccine elicited IgG did not promote an inflammatory lung response.

Legumain oxidation, which is enhanced by the ROS-promoting bacterial oncoprotein CagA, dysregulates intracellular legumain processing and localization and decreases legumain activity in H. pylori-infected cells. We further show that the site-specific loss of Cys219 reactivity increases tumor growth and mortality in a xenograft model.

    "abstract": "Productive transmission of malaria parasites hinges upon the execution of key transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory events. While much is now known about how specific transcription factors activate or repress sexual commitment programs, far less is known about the production of a preferred mRNA homeostasis following commitment and through the host-to-vector transmission event. Here we show that Plasmodium parasites have taken the unique approach to duplicate the NOT1 scaffold protein of the CAF1/CCR4/Not complex in order to dedicate one paralogue for essential transmission functions. Moreover, this NOT1-G paralogue is central to the sex-specific functions previously associated with its interacting partners, as deletion of not1-g in Plasmodium yoelii leads to a comparable or complete arrest phenotype for both male and female parasites. We show that, consistent with its role in other eukaryotes, PyNOT1-G localizes to cytosolic puncta throughout much of the Plasmodium life cycle. PyNOT1-G is essential to both the complete maturation of male gametes and to the continued development of the fertilized zygote originating from female parasites. Comparative transcriptomics of wild-type and pynot1-g- parasites shows that loss of PyNOT1-G leads to transcript dysregulation preceding and during gametocytogenesis, and shows that PyNOT1-G acts to preserve mRNAs that are critical to sexual and early mosquito stage development. Finally, we demonstrate that the tristetraprolin-binding domain, which acts as the typical organization platform for RNA decay (TTP) and RNA preservation (ELAV/HuR) factors is dispensable for PyNOT1-Gs essential blood stage functions but impacts host-to-vector transmission. Together, we conclude that Plasmodium has created and adapted a NOT1-G paralogue to fulfill the complex transmission requirements of both male and female parasites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHelicobacter pylori, a bacterium that infects approximately half of the worlds population, is associated with various gastrointestinal diseases, including peptic ulcers, non-ulcer dyspepsia, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric lymphoma. To combat the increasing antibiotic resistance of H. pylori, the need for new therapeutic strategies has become more pressing. Characterization of the interactions between H. pylori and the fecal microbiome, as well as the mechanisms underlying these interactions, may offer new therapeutic approaches. Exploration of changes in fatty acid metabolism associated with H. pylori-mediated alterations of the fecal microbiome may also reveal strategies to help prevent progression to neoplasia.\n\nAimTo characterize the gut microbiome and metabolome in H. pylori patients in a socioeconomically challenged and underprivileged inner-city community.\n\nMethodsStool samples from 19 H. pylori patients and 16 control subjects were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on normalized pooled amplicons using the Illumina MiSeq System using a MiSeq reagent kit v2. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed in QIIME 2. Non-targeted fatty acid analysis of the samples was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which measures the total content of 30 fatty acids in stool after conversion into their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) was performed on Bray-Curtis distance matrices created from both the metabolomics and microbiome datasets and a Procrustes test was performed on the metabolomics and microbiome MDS coordinates.\n\nResultsFecal microbiome analysis showed that alpha diversity was lowest in H. pylori patients over 40 years of age compared to control subjects of similar age group. Beta diversity analysis of the samples revealed significant differences in microbial community structure between H. pylori patients and control subjects. Thirty-eight and six taxa had lower and higher relative abundance in H. pylori patients, respectively. Taxa that were enriched in H. pylori patients included Atopobium, Gemellaceae, Micrococcaceae, Gemellales and Rothia (R. mucilaginosa). Notably, relative abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia was decreased in H. pylori patients compared to control subjects, suggesting disruption of the gut mucosal environment by H. pylori. Procrustes analysis showed a significant relationship between the microbiome and metabolome datasets. Stool samples from H. pylori patients showed increases in several fatty acids including the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) 22:4n6, 22:5n3, 20:3n6 and 22:2n6, while decreases were noted in other fatty acids including the PUFA 18:3n6. The pattern of changes in fatty acid concentration correlated to the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio determined by 16S rRNA gene analysis.\n\nConclusionAn individualized understanding of gut microbiome features among H. pylori patients will pave the way for improved community impact, reduced healthcare burdens of repeated treatment, and decreased mounting resistance.",

Propionate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by microbiota members, is proposed to mediate colonization resistance against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm). Here, we show that S. Tm overcomes the inhibitory effects of propionate by using it as a carbon source for anaerobic respiration. We determined that propionate metabolism provides an inflammation-dependent colonization advantage to S. Tm during infection. Such benefit was abolished in the intestinal lumen of Salmonella-infected germ-free mice. Interestingly, S. Tm propionate-mediated intestinal expansion was restored when germ-free mice were monocolonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta), a prominent propionate producer in the gut, but not when mice were monocolonized with a propionate production-deficient B. theta strain. Taken together, our results reveal a novel strategy used by S. Tm to mitigate colonization resistance by metabolizing microbiota-derived propionate.",

Polymerization of ATP-bound TnsC helical filaments explains how polarity information is passed to the transposase. Our Cryo-EM structure of TniQ-TnsC reveals that TniQ caps the TnsC filament, establishing a universal mechanism for target information transfer in Tn7/Tn7-like elements. Transposase-driven disassembly establishes delivery of the element only to unused protospacers. Finally, structures with the transition state mimic, ADP{middle dot}AlF3, reveals how TnsC transitions to define the fixed point of insertion.

Here, we aimed to determine which EGFR ligands mediate the ERK activation waves by gene knockout. Four of the seven known EGFR ligands are expressed in MDCK cells. We found that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-deficient cells exhibited lower basal ERK activity than the cells deficient in heparin-binding EGF (HBEGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF) or epiregulin (EREG), but all cell lines deficient in a single EGFR ligand retained the ERK activation waves. Therefore, we knocked out the EGFR ligand genes in decreasing order of expression. ERK activation waves were markedly suppressed, albeit incompletely, only when all four EGFR ligands were knocked-out. Re-expression of the EGFR ligands revealed that all but HBEGF could restore the ERK activation waves. Aiming at complete elimination of the ERK activation waves, we further attempted to knockout Nrg1, a ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4, and found that Nrg1 deficiency induced growth arrest in the absence of all four EGFR ligand genes expressed in MDCK cells. Collectively, these results showed that EGFR ligands exhibit remarkable redundancy in the propagation of ERK activation waves during collective cell migration.",

Here we present a robust method for visual immunoprecipitation of cytosolic protein complexes by use of an artificial transmembrane bait construct in combination with micropatterned antibody arrays on cyclic olefin polymer (COP) substrates. The method was used to characterize Grb2-mediated signalling pathways downstream the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Ternary protein complexes (Shc1:Grb2:SOS1 and Grb2:Gab1:PI3K) were identified and we found that EGFR downstream signalling is based on constitutively bound (Grb2:SOS1 and Grb2:Gab1) as well as on agonist-dependent protein associations with transient interaction properties (Grb2:Shc1 and Grb2:PI3K). Spatiotemporal analysis further revealed significant differences in stability and exchange kinetics of protein interactions. Furthermore, we could show that this approach is well suited to study the efficacy and specificity of SH2 and SH3 protein domain inhibitors in a live cell context. Altogether, this method represents a significant enhancement of quantitative subcellular micropatterning approaches as an alternative to standard biochemical analyses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTransient receptor potential channel 5 (TRPC5) is a non-selective cationic ion channel expressed in brain, kidney and other organs where its activation underlies podocyte injury in chronic kidney diseases. Specifically, it has been suggested that a podocyte TRPC5 plasma membrane relocation and channel activation following injury results from activation of Rac-1, propagating podocyte dysfunction and proteinuria. However, previous TRPC5 transgenic mouse studies had questioned a pathogenic role for TRPC5 in podocytes. This investigation was designed to specifically evaluate podocyte Rac-1 activation in the context of functional TRPC5 or a TRPC5 pore mutant to assess effects on proteinuria.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe employed single cell patch-clamp studies of cultured podocytes and studied proteinuria in transgenic mouse models to characterize the effects of TRPC5 following podocyte Rac-1 activation.\n\nResultsInhibition of TRPC5 by small molecules reportedly ameliorated proteinuria in murine models of proteinuric kidney diseases. In order to directly examine TRPC5 function following Rac-1-induced podocyte injury, we analyzed TRPC5 inhibition in podocyte specific Rac-1 (active) transgenic mice. In addition, we generated a double-transgenic mouse constitutively overexpressing either TRPC5 (TRPC5WT) or a TRPC5 dominant-negative pore mutant (TRPC5DN) in concert with podocyte specific and inducible activation of active Rac-1 (Rac-1Dtg). In electrophysiological experiments, active TRPC5 was detected in primary podocytes overexpressing TRPC5 but not in podocytes with endogenous TRPC5 expression, nor with Rac-1 overexpressing podocytes. TRPC5 inhibition did not change proteinuria in mice with active podocyte Rac-1, nor did an increase or loss of TRPC5 activity affected podocyte injury in Rac-1Dtg animals. Administration of TRPC5 inhibitors, ML204 and AC1903, did not alleviate podocyte Rac-1 induced proteinuria.\n\nConclusionTRPC5 inhibition did not modify podocyte Rac-1 induced proteinuria in mice.\n\nSignificance StatementTRPC5 is a calcium conducting ion channel involved in a plethora of biological functions in the brain, kidney and other organs. In proteinuric kidney diseases, others proposed a model that links activation of small GTPase Rac-1 in podocytes to activation of TRPC5 channels propagating cellular injury and eventually leading to progressive kidney disease. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a novel transgenic mouse model that employs podocyte Rac-1 activation in the presence or absence of a functional TRPC5 channel. Our data shows that transgenic mice with activated Rac-1 in podocytes did not enhance endogenous TRPC5 expression or its activity. Furthermore, TRPC5 blockade or activation did not modify Rac-1 induced proteinuria in mice.",

    "abstract": "Developmental regulation of bone formation in the jaw skeleton is essential to species-specific adaptation. The jaws are derived from neural crest mesenchyme (NCM), a progenitor population that directs skeletal patterning by exerting temporal and spatial control over molecular and cellular programs for osteogenesis. One important NCM-mediated gene is Runx2, which is a transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation. RUNX2 protein binds many target genes involved in the deposition and resorption of bone. To determine the extent to which changes in Runx2 structure, function, and expression underlie the evolution of the jaw skeleton, we compare Runx2 across vertebrates and within birds. Runx2 contains two alternative promoters, tandem repeats of glutamine and alanine with variable lengths in different species, a conserved DNA-binding domain, an exon that is alternatively spliced, as well as two possible C-termini. Such alternative splicing produces eight potential isoforms that show distinct stage- and species-specific patterns in the jaw primordia of chick, quail and duck embryos. We also find that certain isoforms are strongly induced by TGF{beta} signaling whereas others are not. Overexpressing Runx2 isoforms in NCM reveals that some are transcriptionally activating, while others are repressive. But context appears to be relevant since species-specific polymorphisms in the promoter of target genes like Mmp13, can modulate the effects of different isoforms. Overall, our study indicates that the structure and species-specific deployment of Runx2 isoforms affect the transcriptional activity of target genes in ways that may have played a generative and regulatory role in the evolution of the avian jaw skeleton.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins are involved in key processes of chromosome structure and dynamics. SMC1{beta} was identified as a component of the meiotic cohesion complex in vertebrates, which aids in keeping sister chromatids together prior to segregation in meiosis II and is involved in association of homologous chromosomes in meiosis I. The role of SMC1{beta} in meiosis has primarily been studied in mice, where mutant male and female mice are infertile due to germ cell arrest at pachytene and metaphase II stages, respectively. Here, we investigate the function of zebrafish Smc1b to understand the role of this protein more broadly in vertebrates. We found that zebrafish smc1b is necessary for fertility and has important roles in meiosis, yet has no other apparent roles in development. Therefore, smc1b functions primarily in meiosis in both fish and mammals. In zebrafish, we showed that smc1b mutant spermatocytes initiated telomere clustering in leptotene, but failed to complete this process and progress into zygotene. Furthermore, mutant spermatocytes displayed a complete failure of homolog pairing and synapsis. Interestingly, meiotic DNA double strand breaks occurred in the absence of Smc1b despite failed pairing and synapsis. Overall, our findings point to an essential role of Smc1b in the leptotene to zygotene transition during zebrafish spermatogenesis. In addition, ovarian follicles failed to form in smc1b mutants, suggesting an essential role in female meiosis as well. Our results indicate that there are some key differences in Smc1b requirement in meiosis among vertebrates: while Smc1b is not required for homologue pairing and synapsis in mice, it is essential for these processes in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Much can be learned from 1.2 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2 generated during the last 15 months. Out of the overwhelming number of mutations sampled so far, only few rose to prominence in the viral population. Many of these emerged recently and independently in multiple lineages. Such a textbook example of convergent evolution at the molecular level is not only curiosity but a guide to uncover the basis for adaptive advantage behind these events. Focusing on the extent of the convergent evolution in the spike (S) protein, our report confirms that the most concerning SARS-CoV-2 lineages carry the heaviest burden of convergent S-protein mutations, suggesting their fundamental adaptive advantage. The great majority (21/25) of S-protein sites under convergent evolution tightly cluster in three functional domains; N-terminal domain, receptor-binding domain, and Furin cleavage site. We further show that among the S-protein receptor-binding motif mutations, ACE2 affinity-improving substitutions are favored. While the probed mutation space in the S protein covered all amino-acids reachable by single nucleotide changes, substitutions requiring two nucleotide changes or epistatic mutations of multiple-residues have only recently started to emerge. Unfortunately, despite their convergent emergence and physical association, most of these adaptive mutations and their combinations remain understudied. We aim to promote research of current variants which are currently understudied but may become important in the future.",

The current model of translational regulation by uORFs posits that when a ribosome scans an mRNA and encounters a uORF, translation of that uORF can prevent ribosomes from reaching the mORF and cause decreased mORF translation. In this study, we first observed that rare variants in the 5 UTR dysregulate protein abundance. Upon further investigation, we found that rare variants near the start codon of uORFs can repress or derepress mORF translation, causing allelic changes in protein abundance. This finding holds for common variants as well, and common variants that modify uORF start codons also contribute disproportionately to metabolic and whole-plant phenotypes, suggesting that translational regulation by uORFs serves an adaptive function. These results provide evidence for the mechanisms by which natural sequence variation modulates gene expression, and ultimately, phenotype.",

Here, we observed an abrupt transition of bacterial CRISPR-Cas abundance at around 45{degrees}C. Phylogenetic comparative analyses confirmed that the abundance correlates with growth temperature only at the temperature range around 45{degrees}C. Meanwhile, we noticed that the diversities of cellular predators have a precipitous decline at this temperature range. The grazing risk faced by bacteria reduces substantially at around 45{degrees}C and almost disappears above 60{degrees}C. So viral lysis would become the dominating factor of bacterial mortality, and antivirus immunity has a higher priority. In temperature ranges where the abundance of cellular predators does not change with temperature, temperatures would have negligible effects on CRISPR-Cas abundance. The hypothesis predicts that bacteria should also be rich in CRISPR-Cas systems if they live in other extreme conditions inaccessible to grazing predators.",

    "abstract": "Present in all kingdoms of life, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters couple ATP hydrolysis to mechanical force and facilitate trafficking of diverse substrates across biological membranes. Although many ABC transporters are promising drug targets, their mechanisms of regulation by small molecule inhibitors remain largely unknown. Herein, we used the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) flippase MsbA, a prototypical ABC exporter, as a model system to probe mechanisms of allosteric modulation by compounds binding to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Recent chemical screens have identified intriguing LPS transport inhibitors targeting MsbA: the ATPase stimulator TBT1 and the ATPase inhibitor G247. Despite preliminary biochemical and structural data, it is unclear how TBT1 and G247 bind to the MsbA TMDs yet induce opposite allosteric effect in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Through single-particle EM, mutagenesis and activity assay, we show that TBT1 and G247 bind adjacent yet separate locations in the TMDs, inducing drastic changes in TMD conformation and NBD positioning. Two TBT1 molecules asymmetrically occupy the LPS binding site to break the symmetry of MsbA, resulting in disordered transmembrane helices and decreased NBD distance. In this novel inhibited ABC transporter state, decreased distance between the NBDs causes stimulation of ATP hydrolysis yet LPS transport blockage. In contrast, G247 acts as a TMDs wedge, symmetrically increasing NBD separation and preventing conformational transition of MsbA. Our study uncovers the distinct mechanisms of the first-generation MsbA-specific inhibitors and demonstrates that rational design of substrate-mimicking compounds can be exploited to develop useful ABC transporter modulators.",

Here we construct a microbiome-focused, integrated mass-spectrometry pipeline to accelerate the identification of microbiota-dependent metabolites (MDMs) in diverse sample types. We report the metabolic profiles of 178 gut microbe strains using our library of 833 metabolites. Leveraging this metabolomics resource we establish deviations in the relationships between phylogeny and metabolism, use machine learning to discover novel metabolism in Bacteroides, and employ comparative genomics-based discovery of candidate biochemical pathways. MDMs can be detected in diverse biofluids in gnotobiotic and conventional mice and traced back to corresponding metabolomic profiles of cultured bacteria. Collectively, our microbiome-focused metabolomics pipeline and interactive metabolomics profile explorer are a powerful tool for characterizing microbe and microbe-host interactions.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a human pathogenic bacterium, binds to sialylated oligosaccharides and glides on host cell surfaces via a unique mechanism. Gliding motility is essential for initiating the infectious process. In the present study, we measured the stall force of an M. pneumoniae cell carrying a bead that was manipulated using optical tweezers on two strains. The stall forces of M129 and FH strains were averaged to be 23.7 and 19.7 pN, respectively, much weaker than those of other bacterial surface motilities. The binding activity and gliding speed of the M129 strain on sialylated oligosaccharides were eight and two times higher than those of the FH strain, respectively, showing that binding activity is not linked to gliding force. Gliding speed decreased when cell binding was reduced by addition of free sialylated oligosaccharides, indicating the existence of a drag force during gliding. We detected stepwise movements, likely caused by a single leg under 0.2-0.3 mM free sialylated oligosaccharides. A step size of 14-19 nm showed that 25-35 propulsion steps per second are required to achieve the usual gliding speed. The step size was reduced to less than half with the load applied using optical tweezers, showing that a 2.5 pN force from a cell is exerted on a leg. The work performed in this step was 16%-30% of the free energy of the hydrolysis of ATP molecules, suggesting that this step is linked to the elementary process of M. pneumoniae gliding.\n\nIMPORTANCEHuman mycoplasma pneumonia is caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This tiny bacterium, shaped like a missile, binds to human epithelial surfaces and spreads using a unique gliding mechanism to establish infection. Here, we analyzed the movements and force of this motility using a special setup: optical tweezers. We then obtained detailed mechanical data to understand this mechanism. Furthermore, we succeeded in detecting small steps of nanometers in its gliding, which is likely linked to the elementary process of the core reaction: chemical to mechanical energy conversion. These data provide critical information to both control this human pathogen and explore new ideas for artificial molecular machines.",

    "abstract": "The cytokinetic contractile ring (CR) was first described some 50 years ago, however our understanding of the assembly and structure of the animal cell CR remains incomplete. We recently reported that mature CRs in sea urchin embryos contain myosin II mini-filaments organized into aligned concatenated arrays, and that in early CRs myosin II formed discrete clusters that transformed into the linearized structure over time. The present study extends our previous work by addressing the hypothesis that these myosin II clusters also contain the crucial scaffolding proteins anillin and septin, known to help link actin, myosin II, RhoA, and the membrane during cytokinesis. Super-resolution imaging of cortices from dividing embryos indicates that within each cluster, anillin and septin2 occupy a centralized position relative to the myosin II mini-filaments. As CR formation progresses, the myosin II, septin and anillin containing clusters enlarge and coalesce into patchy and faintly linear patterns. Our super-resolution images provide the initial visualization of anillin and septin nanostructure within an animal cell CR, including evidence of a septin filament network. Furthermore, Latrunculin-treated embryos indicated that the localization of septin or anillin to the myosin II clusters in the early CR was not dependent on actin filaments. These results highlight the structural progression of the CR in sea urchin embryos from an array of clusters to a linearized purse string, the association of anillin and septin with this process, and provide, for the first time, the visualization of septin filament higher order structure in an animal cell CR.",

    "abstract": "Despite their comparatively low abundance, phosphoinositides play a central role in membrane traffic and signalling. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 are uniquely important, as they promote cell growth, survival, and migration. Pathogenic organisms have developed means to subvert phosphoinositide metabolism to promote successful infection and their survival within host organisms. We demonstrate that PtdIns(3,4)P2 is generated in host cells by effectors of the enteropathogenic bacteria Salmonella and Shigella. Pharmacological, gene silencing and heterologous expression experiments revealed that, remarkably, the biosynthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P2 occurs independently of phosphoinositide 3-kinases. Instead, we found that the Salmonella effector SopB, heretofore believed to be a phosphatase, generates PtdIns(3,4)P2 de novo via a phosphotransferase/phosphoisomerase mechanism. Recombinant SopB is capable of generating PtdIns(3,4)P2 from PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a cell-free system. Through a remarkable instance of convergent evolution, bacterial effectors acquired the ability to synthesize 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides by an ATP- and kinase-independent mechanism, thereby subverting host signaling to gain entry and even provoke oncogenic transformation.",

    "abstract": "Adult stem cells are indispensable for tissue regeneration. Tissue-specific stem cells reside in a specialized location called their niche, where they are in constant cross talk with neighboring niche cells and circulatory signals from their environment. Aging has a detrimental effect on the number and the regenerative function of various stem cells. However, whether the loss of stem cell function is a cause or consequence of their aging niche is unclear. Using skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) as a model, we decouple cell-intrinsic from niche-mediated extrinsic effects of aging on their transcriptome. By combining in vivo MuSC heterochronic transplantation models and computational methods, we show that on a genome-wide scale, age-related altered genes fall into two distinct categories regarding their response to the niche environment. Genes that are inelastic in their response to the niche exhibit altered chromatin accessibility and are associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between young and aged cells. On the other hand, genes that are restorable by niche exposure exhibit altered transcriptome but show no change in chromatin accessibility or DMRs. Taken together, our data suggest that the niche environment plays a decisive role in controlling the transcriptional activity of MuSCs, and exposure to a young niche can reverse approximately half of all age-associated changes that are not epigenetically encoded. The muscle niche therefore serves as an important therapeutic venue to mitigate the negative consequence of aging on tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Cassava plantations in an area of 458 ha spanning five provinces along the Thailand- Cambodia border were surveyed from October 2018 to July 2019 to determine the prevalence of cassava mosaic disease (CMD) caused by Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV) in the region. CMD prevalence was 40% in the whole area and 80% in Prachinburi, 43% in Sakaeo, 37% in Burium, 25% in Surin, and 19% in Sisaket provinces. Disease severity was generally scored as 2-3. The highest average disease severity was in Sakaeo province (3.7), followed by Buriram (3.6), Prachinburi (2.88), Surin (2.5), and Sisaket (2.4) provinces. Asymptomatic plants were identified in Surin (12%), Prachinburi (5%), Sakaeo (0.2%), and Buriram (0.1%) by PCR analysis. Interestingly, cassava cultivars CMR-89 and Rayong 11 were susceptible to CMD. In approximately 95% of cases, the infection was transmitted by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), which had a high population density in Prachinburi but was sparse in Surin, with the largest populations observed in May and June. Nucleotide sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (mtCO1) gene of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) in Thailand revealed a similarity to the Asia II 1 whitefly gene. Furthermore, the AV1 gene--which encodes the capsid protein--showed 90% nucleotide identity with SLCMV. Phylogenetic analysis of completed nucleotide sequences of DNA-A and DNA-B components of the SLCMV genome determined by rolling circle amplification (RCA) indicated that they were similar to the nucleotide sequence of SLCMV isolates from Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. These results provide important insights into the distribution, impact, and spread of CMD and SLCMV in Thailand.",

    "abstract": "Biological engineers seek to have better control and a more complete understanding of the process of translation initiation within cells so that they may produce proteins more efficiently, as well as to create orthogonal translation systems. Previously, initiator tRNA variants have been created that initiate translation from non-AUG start codons, but their orthogonality has never been measured and the detailed characteristics of proteins produced from them have not been well defined. In this study we created an initiator tRNA mutant with anticodon altered to AAC to be complementary to GUU start codons. We deploy this i-tRNA(AAC) into E. coli cells and measure translation initiation efficiency against all possible start codons. Using parallel reaction monitoring targeted mass spectrometry we identify the N-terminal amino acids of i-tRNA(AAC)-initiated reporter proteins and show these proteins have altered stability within cells. We also use structural modeling of the peptide deformylase enzyme interaction with position 1 valine peptides to interrogate a potential mechanism for accumulation of formylated-valine proteins observed by mass spectrometry. Our results demonstrate that mutant initiator tRNAs have potential to initiate translation more orthogonally than the native initiator tRNA but their interactions with cellular formyltransferases and peptide deformylases can be inefficient because of the amino acid they are charged with. Additionally, engineered initiator tRNAs may enable tuning of in vivo protein stability through initiation with non-methionine amino acids that alter their interaction with cellular proteases.",

Most mutations caused defective RELN secretion in vitro and, when ectopically expressed in the embryonic mouse cortex, affected neuronal aggregation and/or migration in vivo. We determined the de novo heterozygous mutations acted as dominant negative and demonstrated that RELN mutations mediate not only recessive, but also dominant NMDs.

    "abstract": "Endogenous adenosine plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis and adenosine levels are tightly regulated across neural circuits. In the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) adenosine inhibits neurotransmitter release, but the source and mechanism underlying its accumulation are largely unknown. Opioids also inhibit neurotransmitter release in the DMS and influences adenosine accumulation after prolonged exposure. However, how these two neurotransmitter systems interact acutely is also largely unknown. This study demonstrates that activation of opioid receptors (MORs), but not {delta} opioid receptors (DORs) or {kappa} opioid receptors (KORs), inhibits tonic activation of adenosine A1Rs via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent mechanism in both male and female mice. Further, selectively knocking-out MORs from presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that activation of MORs on D1R positive MSNs, but not D2R positive MSNs, is necessary to inhibit tonic adenosine signaling on presynaptic terminals. Given the role of D1R positive MSNs in movement and motivated behaviors, these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which these neurons regulate their own synaptic inputs.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding interactions between neuromodulatory systems within brain circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The present work uncovers a novel role of opioids in acutely inhibiting adenosine accumulation and subsequent adenosine receptor signaling in the striatum by inhibiting the production of cAMP. Adenosine receptor signaling regulates striatal neurotransmitters including glutamate, GABA, dopamine and acetylcholine. Furthermore, interactions between adenosine2A receptors and numerous other GPCRs, including D2 dopamine and CB1 cannabinoid receptors, suggest that endogenous adenosine broadly modulates striatal GPCR signaling. Additionally, this work discovered that resting endogenous adenosine is released by D1, but not D2 receptor positive MSNs, suggesting that opioid signaling and manipulation of D1R-expressing MSN cAMP activity can broadly affect striatal function and behavior.",

    "abstract": "The piriform cortex (PCx) is essential for learning of odor information. The current view postulates odor learning in the PCx is mainly due to plasticity in intracortical (IC) synapses, while odor information from the olfactory bulb carried via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) is \"hardwired\". Here we revisit this notion by studying location and pathway dependent plasticity rules. We find that in contrast to the prevailing view, synaptic and optogenetically activated LOT synapses undergo strong and robust long-term potentiation (LTP) mediated by only few local NMDA-spikes delivered at theta frequency, while global spike timing dependent plasticity protocols (STDP) failed to induce LTP in these distal synapses. An inverse result was observed for more proximal apical IC synapses; they undergo plasticity with STDP but are refractive to local NMDA-spike protocols. These results are consistent with a self-potentiating mechanism of odor information via NMDA-spikes which can form branch-specific memory traces of odors.",

    "abstract": "Chronic adversity in early childhood is associated with increased anxiety and a propensity for substance abuse later in adulthood, yet the effects of early life stress (ELS) on brain development remains poorly understood. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a powerful model for studying neurodevelopment and stress. Here, we describe a zebrafish model of ELS and identify a role for glucocorticoid signaling during a critical window in development that leads to long-term changes in brain function. Larval fish subjected to chronic stress in early development exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and elevated glucocorticoid levels later in life. Increased stress-like behavior was only observed when fish were subjected to ELS within a precise time window in early development, revealing a temporal critical window of sensitivity. Moreover, enhanced anxiety-like behavior only emerges after two months post-ELS, revealing a developmentally specified delay in the effects of ELS. ELS leads to increased levels of baseline cortisol, and resulted in a dysregulation of cortisol receptors, suggesting long-term effects on cortisol signaling. Together, these findings reveal a  critical window for ELS to affect developmental reprogramming of the glucocorticoid receptor pathway, resulting in chronic elevated stress.",

    "abstract": "The visualization of biological processes using fluorescent proteins and dyes in living organisms has enabled numerous scientific discoveries. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a widely used model organism for live imaging studies since the transparent nature of the worm enables imaging of nearly all tissues within a whole, intact animal. While current techniques are optimized to enable the immobilization of hermaphrodite worms for live imaging, many of these approaches fail to successfully restrain the smaller male worms. To enable live imaging of worms of both sexes, we developed a new genetic, conditional immobilization tool that uses the auxin inducible degron (AID) system to immobilize both hermaphrodites and male worms for live imaging. Based on chromosome location, mutant phenotype, and predicted germline consequence, we identified and AID-tagged three candidate genes (unc-18, unc-104, and unc-52). Strains with these AID-tagged genes were placed on auxin and tested for mobility and germline defects. Among the candidate genes, auxin-mediated depletion of UNC-18 caused significant immobilization of both hermaphrodite and male worms that was also partially reversible upon removal from auxin. Notably, we found that male worms require a higher concentration of auxin for a similar amount of immobilization as hermaphrodites, thereby suggesting a potential sex-specific difference in auxin absorption and/or processing. In both males and hermaphrodites, depletion of UNC-18 did not largely alter fertility, germline progression, nor meiotic recombination. Finally, we demonstrate that this new genetic tool can successfully immobilize both sexes enabling live imaging studies of sexually dimorphic features in C. elegans.\n\nARTICLE SUMMARYC. elegans is a powerful model system for visualizing biological processes in live cells. In addition to the challenge of suppressing the worm movement for live imaging, most immobilization techniques only work with hermaphrodites. Here, we describe a new genetic immobilization tool that conditionally immobilizes both worm sexes for live imaging studies. Additionally, we demonstrate that this tool can be used for live imaging the C. elegans germline without causing large defects to germline progression or fertility in either sex.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo compare the timing and efficiency of the development of non-human primate (NHP) derived retinal organoids in comparison to those derived from human embryonic stem cells.\n\nMethodsHuman embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced-pluripotent stem cells (rhiPSCs) derived from non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) were differentiated into retinal organoids by using an established differentiation protocol. Briefly, embryoid bodies were formed from pluripotent stem cells and induced into a neural lineage with neural induction media with the addition of BMP4. Thereafter, self-formation of optic vesicles was allowed to form in a 2D culture in retinal differentiation media (RDM). Optic vesicles were then manually harvested and cultured in suspension in 3D-RDM media until analysis. Differences in the timing of differentiation and efficiency of retinal organoid development were assessed by light microscopy, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, and single-cell transcriptomics.\n\nResultsGeneration of retinal organoids was achieved from both human and several NHP pluripotent stem cells lines. All rhiPSC lines resulted in retinal differentiation with the formation of optic vesicle-like structures similar to what has been observed in hESC retinal organoids. NHP retinal organoids had laminated structure and were composed of mature retinal cell types including cone and rod photoreceptors. Single cell RNA sequencing was conducted at two time points, which allowed identification of cell types and characterization of developmental trajectory in the developing organoid. Important differences between rhesus and human cells were measured regarding the timing and efficiency of retinal organoid differentiation. While the culture of NHP-derived iPSCs is relatively difficult compared to human stem cells, the generation of retinal organoids is feasible and may be less time consuming due to an intrinsically faster timing of retinal differentiation.\n\nConclusionsRetinal organoids produced from iPSCs derived from Rhesus monkey using established protocols differentiate through the stages of organoid development faster than those derived from human stem cells. The production of NHP retinal organoids may be advantageous to reduce experimental time and cost for basic biology studies in retinogenesis as well as for preclinical trials in NHPs studying retinal allograft transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Cell-surface receptors control how cells respond to their environment. Many cell-surface receptors recycle from endosomes to the plasma membrane via a recently discovered pathway, which includes sorting-nexin SNX17, Retriever, WASH and CCC complexes. Here we discover that PIKfyve and its upstream PI3-kinase VPS34 positively regulate this pathway. VPS34 produces PI3P, which is the substrate for PIKfyve to generate PI3,5P2. We show that PIKfyve controls recycling of cargoes including integrins, receptors that control cell migration. Furthermore, endogenous PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17, Retriever, WASH and CCC complexes on endosomes. Importantly, PIKfyve inhibition causes a loss of Retriever and CCC from endosomes, and mutation of the lipid binding site on a CCC subunit impairs its endosomal localization and delays integrin recycling. In addition, we show that recruitment of SNX17 is an early step and requires VPS34. These discoveries suggest that VPS34 and PIKfyve coordinate an ordered pathway to regulate recycling from endosomes and suggest how PIKfyve functions in cell migration.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the histories of complex adaptations and identifying the evolutionary mechanisms underlying their origins are two of the primary goals of evolutionary biology. Taricha newts, which contain high concentrations of the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX) as an antipredator defense, have evolved resistance to self-intoxication, which is a complex adaptation requiring changes in six paralogs of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) gene family, the physiological target of TTX. Here, we reconstruct the origins of TTX self-resistance by sequencing the entire Nav gene family in newts and related salamanders. We show that moderate TTX resistance evolved early in the salamander lineage in three of the six Nav paralogs, preceding the proposed appearance of tetrodotoxic newts by [~]100 million years. TTX-bearing newts possess additional unique substitutions across the entire Nav gene family that provide physiological TTX resistance. These substitutions coincide with signatures of positive selection and relaxed purifying selection, as well as gene conversion events, that together likely facilitated their evolution. We also identify a novel exon duplication within Nav1.4 encoding an expressed TTX-binding site. Two resistance-conferring changes within newts appear to have spread via nonallelic gene conversion: in one case, one codon was copied between paralogs, and in the second, multiple substitutions were homogenized between the duplicate exons of Nav1.4. Our results demonstrate that gene conversion can accelerate the coordinated evolution of gene families in response to a common selection pressure.",

    "abstract": "Wild birds often require rehabilitation after collisions, even with no apparent injury. Information about aftermath of collisions is still scares. Here, we investigated external characteristics and clinical features of the internal organs of wild birds that experienced collision and compared them with birds admitted to rehabilitation center for other reasons. Necropsy was performed on 55 bird carcasses from Passeriformes and Coraciiform. Five external characteristics were recorded before necropsy including; cause of admission, keel score, life stage, fat score, and number of days before death. The median survival time was calculated by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Data on external and internal features were compared using univariate and multivariate multinomial regressions. There was no significant difference in the median survival time among the causes of admission: 1 day for collision, 2 days for trauma, and 2 days for malnutrition. Kidney discoloration was more significantly associated with collision than with other trauma (p = 0.01). Although no apparent kidney abnormality (including enlargement) were observed, anterior lobe was significantly larger than posterior lobe with collision compared with malnutrition (p = 0.045). Birds that experienced collision exhibited a higher fat score than malnourished birds (p = 0.03). Our results suggested that wild birds with abundant fat were more likely to be admitted due to collision. The gross characteristics of collision included kidney discoloration and anterior lobe extension, which was possibly due to rupture of renal blood vessels by blunt external force. From these findings, it was considered that collision caused major axis of anterior lobe significantly larger than posterior lobe, even though no abnormal finding in renal size such as hypertrophy was recognized. This was the first study to evaluate the cause of admission, necropsy results, and external characteristics in wild birds admitted to rehabilitation centers. Absolute cage rest should be adhered to restore renal function for those birds admitted due to collision, and handling and treatment should be minimized to avoid excess movement of the birds.",
