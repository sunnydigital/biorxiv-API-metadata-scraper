    "abstract": "Congenital cataract is a rare but severe paediatric visual impediment, often caused by variants in one of several crystallin genes that produce the bulk of structural proteins in lens. Here we describe a pedigree with autosomal dominant isolated congenital cataract and linkage to the crystallin gene cluster on chromosome 22. No rare single nucleotide variants or short indels were identified by whole-exome sequencing, yet copy number variant analysis revealed a duplication spanning both CRYBB1 and CRYBA4. While the CRYBA4 duplication was complete, the CRYBB1 duplication was not, with the duplicated CRYBB1 product predicted to create a gain of function allele. This association suggests a new genetic mechanism for the development of isolated congenital cataract.\\n\\nGrant informationSupported by the National Health and Medical Research Council\\n\\nConflict of interestthe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "O_LIPremise of research: Natural populations of many mosses appear highly female-biased based on the presence of reproductive structures. This bias could be caused by increased male mortality, lower male growth rate, or a higher threshold for achieving sexual maturity in males. Here we test these hypotheses using samples from two populations of the Mojave Desert moss Syntrichia caninervis.\\nC_LIO_LIMethods: We used double digest restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to identify candidate sex-associated loci in a panel of sex-expressing plants. Next, we used putative sex-associated markers to identify the sex of individuals without sex structures.\\nC_LIO_LIKey results: We found an 18:1 phenotypic female: male sex ratio in the higher elevation site (Wrightwood), and no sex expression at the low elevation site (Phelan). In contrast, based on genetic data we found a 2:1 female bias in the Wrightwood site and only females in the Phelan site. The area occupied by male and female genets was indistinguishable.\\nC_LIO_LIConclusions: These data suggest that both differential mortality and sexual dimorphism in thresholds for sex expression likely contribute to population genetic and phenotypic sex ratio biases, and that phenotypic sex expression alone fails to capture the extent of actual sex ratio bias present in natural populations of S. caninervis.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Scratch assays are used to study how a population of cells re-colonises a vacant region on a two-dimensional substrate after a cell mono-layer is scratched. These experiments are used in many applications including drug design for the treatment of cancer and chronic wounds. To provide insights into the mechanisms that drive scratch assays, solutions of continuum reaction-diffusion models have been calibrated to data from scratch as-says. These models typically include a logistic source term to model carrying capacity-limited proliferation, however the choice of using a logistic source term is often made without examining whether it is valid. Here we study the proliferation of PC-3 prostate cancer cells in a scratch assay, and we focus on the proliferation of these cells far away from the scratch. All experimental results for the scratch assay are compared with equivalent results from a proliferation assay where the cell monolayer is not scratched. Visual inspection of the evolution of the cell density as a function of time reveals a series of sigmoid curves that could be naively calibrated to the solution of the logistic growth model. However, careful analysis of the per capita growth rate as a function of density reveals several key differences between the proliferation of cells in scratch and proliferation assays. The per capita growth rate in the proliferation assay decreases, approximately linearly, with density in the proliferation assay suggesting that the logistic growth model is valid for the entire duration of the proliferation assay. However, the per capita growth rate in the scratch assay increases with density when the density is sufficiently small in the scratch assay, suggesting that the logistic growth model does not apply. Instead, guided by data, we find that there are two phases of proliferation in a scratch assay. At short time we have a disturbance phase where proliferation is not logistic, and this is followed by a growth phase where proliferation appears to be logistic. Accounting for the differences in the growth and disturbance phase, we obtain biologically realistic estimates of the proliferation rate and carrying capacity density. In contrast, simply calibrating the solution of the logistic growth equation to all data from the scratch assays, we obtain an excellent match between the data and the model, but the parameter estimates vary wildly and are not biologically realistic. Overall our study shows that simply calibrating the solution of a continuum model to a scratch assay might produce misleading parameter estimates, and this issue can be resolved by making a distinction between the disturbance and growth phases. Repeating our procedure for other scratch assays will provide insight into the roles of the disturbance and growth phases for different cell lines and scratch assays performed on different substrates.",

Here we explore how mutations in the essential enzyme Adenylate Kinase (Adk) of E. coli affect multiple phases of population growth. We introduce a biophysical fitness landscape for these phases, showing how they depend on molecular and cellular properties of Adk. We find that Adk catalytic capacity in the cell (product of activity and abundance) is the major determinant of mutational fitness effects. We show that bacterial lag times are at a well-defined optimum with respect to Adks catalytic capacity, while exponential growth rates are only weakly affected by variation in Adk. Direct pairwise competitions between strains show how environmental conditions modulate the outcome of a competition where growth rates and lag times have a tradeoff, altogether shedding light on the multidimensional nature of fitness and its importance in the evolutionary optimization of enzymes.",

Yet we know little about how the attentional modulations of single RFs contribute to the encoding of an entire visual scene. Addressing this issue requires (1) measuring a group of RFs that tile a continuous portion of visual space, (2) constructing a population-level measurement of spatial representations based on these RFs, and (3) linking how different types of RF attentional modulations change the population-level representation. To accomplish these aims, we used fMRI to characterize the responses of thousands of voxels in retinotopically organized human cortex. First, we found that the response modulations of voxel RFs (vRFs) depend on the spatial relationship between the RF center and the visual location of the attended target. Second, we used two analyses to assess the spatial encoding quality of a population of voxels. We found that attention increased fine spatial discriminability and representational fidelity near the attended target. Third, we linked these findings by manipulating the observed vRF attentional modulations and recomputing our population measures. Surprisingly, we discovered that attentional enhancements of population-level representations largely depend on position shifts of vRFs, rather than changes in size or gain. Our data suggest that position shifts of single RFs are a principal mechanism by which attention enhances population-level representations in visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) neuron subtypes modulate specific physiological functions and are involved in distinct neurological disorders. Embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived DA neurons have the potential to aid in the study of disease mechanisms, drug discovery, and possibly cell replacement therapies. DA neurons can be generated from ESCs in vitro, but the subtypes of ESC-derived DA neurons have not been investigated in detail despite the diversity of DA neurons observed in vivo. Due to cell culture heterogeneity, sampling methods applied to ESC-derived cultures can be ambiguous and potentially biased. Therefore, we developed a quantification method to capture the depth of DA neuron production in vitro by estimating the error associated with systematic random sampling. Using this method, we quantified calbindin+ and calretinin+ subtypes of DA neurons generated from mouse ESCs. We found a higher production of the calbindin+ subtype (11-27%) compared to the calretinin+ subtype (2-13%) of DA neuron; in addition, DA neurons expressing neither subtype marker were also generated. We then examined whether exogenous sonic hedgehog (SHH) and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) affected subtype generation. Our results demonstrate that exogenous SHH and FGF8 did not alter DA neuron subtype generation in vitro. These findings suggest that a deeper understanding DA neuron derivation inclusive of mechanisms that govern the in vitro subtype specification of ESC-derived DA neurons is required.\\n\\nNoteAll research was planned and conducted while members were at Brown University\\n\\nResearch fundingNIH/NCRR/NIGMS RI Hospital COBRE Center for Stem Cell Biology (8P20GM103468-04) (MZ) Brown Institute for Brain Science Pilot Grant (4-63662) (MZ/DHK)",

    "abstract": "A supercritical fluid chromatography-based targeted purification workflow using tandem mass spectrometry and molecular networking was developed to analyze, annotate and isolate secondary metabolites from complex mixture. This approach was applied for targeted isolation of new antiviral diterpene esters from Euphorbia semiperfoliata whole plant extract. The analysis of bioactive fractions revealed that unknown diterpene esters, including jatrophane esters and phorboids esters, were present in the samples. The purification procedure using semi-preparative-supercritical fluid chromatography led to the isolation and identification of two jatrophane esters (13 and 14) and four 4-deoxyphorbol esters (15-18). Compound 16 was found to display antiviral activity against chikungunya virus (EC50 = 0.45 {micro}M), while compound 15 was found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in a recombinant virus assay (EC50 = 13 nM). This study showed that supercritical fluid chromatography-based workflow and molecular networking can facilitate and accelerate the discovery of bioactive small molecules by targeted molecules of interest, while minimizing the use of toxic solvents.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/106153_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (23K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@191802aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1755ab8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@196edf5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e0a1e0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Suppressed recombination around a sex-determining locus allows divergence between homologous sex chromosomes and the functionality of their genes. Here, we reveal patterns of the earliest stages of sex-chromosome evolution in the diploid dioecious herb Mercurialis annua on the basis of cytological analysis, de novo genome assembly and annotation, genetic mapping, exome resequencing of natural populations, and transcriptome analysis. Both genetic mapping and exome resequencing of individuals across the species range independently identified the largest linkage group, LG1, as the sex chromosome. Although the sex chromosomes of M. annua are karyotypically homomorphic, we estimate that about a third of the Y chromosome has ceased recombining, a region containing 568 transcripts and spanning 22.3 cM in the corresponding female map. Patterns of gene expression hint at the possible role of sexually antagonistic selection in having favored suppressed recombination. In total, the genome assembly contained 34,105 expressed genes, of which 10,076 were assigned to linkage groups. There was limited evidence of Y-chromosome degeneration in terms of gene loss and pseudogenization, but sequence divergence between the X and Y copies of many sex-linked genes was higher than between M. annua and its dioecious sister species M. huetii with which it shares a sex-determining region. The Mendelian inheritance of sex in interspecific crosses, combined with the other observed pattern, suggest that the M. annua Y chromosome has at least two evolutionary strata: a small old stratum shared with M. huetii, and a more recent larger stratum that is probably unique to M. annua and that stopped recombining about one million years ago.\n\nArticle summaryPlants that evolved separate sexes (dioecy) recently are ideal models for studying the early stages of sex-chromosome evolution. Here, we use karyological, whole genome and transcriptome data to characterize the homomorphic sex chromosomes of the annual dioecious plant Mercurialis annua. Our analysis reveals many typical hallmarks of dioecy and sex-chromosome evolution, including sex-biased gene expression and high X/Y sequence divergence, yet few premature stop codons in Y-linked genes and very little outright gene loss, despite 1/3 of the sex chromosome having ceased recombination in males. Our results confirm that the M. annua species complex is a fertile system for probing early stages in the evolution of sex chromosomes.",

However, genetic manipulation of hPSCs is challenging and a method to simultaneously activate multiple genomic sites in a controllable manner is sorely needed. Here, we constructed a CRISPR-ON system to efficiently upregulate endogenous genes in hPSCs. A doxycycline (Dox) inducible dCas9-VP64-p65-Rta (dCas9-VPR) transcription activator and a reverse Tet transactivator (rtTA) expression cassette were knocked into the two alleles of the AAVS1 locus to generate an iVPR hESC line. We showed that the dCas9-VPR level could be precisely and reversibly controlled by addition and withdrawal of Dox. Upon transfection of multiplexed gRNA plasmid targeting the NANOG promoter and Dox induction, we were able to control NANOG gene expression from its endogenous locus. Interestingly, an elevated NANOG level did not only promote naive pluripotent gene expression but also enhanced cell survival and clonogenicity, and it enabled integration of hESCs with the inner cell mass (ICM) of mouse blastocysts in vitro. Thus, iVPR cells provide a convenient platform for gene function studies as well as high-throughput screens in hPSCs.",

    "abstract": "PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their associated PIWI proteins play an important role in repressing transposable elements in animal germlines. However, little is known about the function of PIWI proteins and piRNAs in the developing brain. Here, we investigated the role of an important PIWI family member, Piwi-like protein 1 (Piwil1; also known as Miwi in mouse) in the developing mouse neocortex. Using a Piwil1 knock-out (Piwil1 KO) mouse strain, we found that Piwil1 is essential for several steps of neocorticogenesis, including neocortical cell cycle, neuron migration and dendritogenesis. Piwil1 deletion resulted in increased cell cycle re-entry at embryonic day 17 (E17) when predominantly intracortically projecting neurons are being produced. Prenatal Piwil1 deletion increased the number of Pax6+ radial glia at postnatal day 0 (P0). Furthermore, Piwil1 deletion disrupted migration of Satb2+ neurons within deep layers at E17, P0 and P7. Satb2+ neurons showed increased co-localization with Bcl11b (also known as Ctip2), marker of subcortically projecting neurons. Piwil1 knockouts had disrupted neocortical circuitry represented by thinning of the corpus callosum and altered dendritogenesis. We further investigated if Piwil1 deletion disrupted expression levels of neocortical piRNAs by small RNA-sequencing in neocortex. We did not find differential expression of piRNAs in the neocortices of Piwil1 KO, while differences were observed in other Piwil1 KO tissues. This result suggests that Piwil1 may act independently of piRNAs and have novel roles in higher cognitive centers, such as neocortex. In addition, we report a screen of piRNAs derived from tRNA fragments in developing neocortices. Our result is the first report of selective subsets of piRNAs and tRNA fragments in developing prenatal neocortices and helps clarify some outstanding questions about the role of the piRNA pathway in the brain.",
