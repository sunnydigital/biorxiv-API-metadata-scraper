    "abstract": "The ability to replace genes coding for cellular proteins with DNA that codes for fluorescent protein-tagged versions opens the way to counting the number of molecules of each protein component of macromolecular assemblies in vivo by measuring fluorescence microscopically. Converting fluorescence to absolute numbers of molecules requires a fluorescent standard whose molecular composition is known precisely. In this report the construction, properties, and mode of using a set of fluorescence calibration standards are described. The standards are based on an icosahedral virus engineered to contain exactly 240 copies of one of seven different fluorescent proteins. Two applications of the fluorescent standards to counting molecules in the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii are described. Methods for improving the preciseness of the measurements and minimizing potential inaccuracies are emphasized.\\n\\nLay AbstractA broad goal of modern biology is to understand how the machines within living cells work. It is nowadays routine to identify the individual protein components of a machine, but not yet straightforward to tell how many copies of each component are needed to build a functional assembly. In many types of cells it is now possible to substitute for the native proteins within cells altered versions that are fluorescent. If one knew how much fluorescence is generated by a single molecule of the altered protein, then one could use a light microscope to count the number of copies of the protein in a cellular machine by simply measuring the total fluorescence coming from that part of the cell. This paper describes the construction and methods for using a set of fluorescent virus particles that can be used to determine how much fluorescence is contributed by one molecule of fluorescent protein. The virus particles were chosen for this role because the particular icosahedral symmetry of their structure guarantees that each particle contains exactly 240 copies of one fluorescent protein.",

    "abstract": "During development and pregnancy, the human mammary gland undergoes extensive remodeling in processes driven by populations of stem and progenitor cells. We recently reported that breast cancers are also hierarchically organized and driven by distinct populations of cancer stem cells characterized as CD44+CD24low/- or by expression of Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). These sets of markers identify largely non-overlapping mesenchymal and epithelial populations, each of which is capable of tumor initiation when transplanted into immunosuppressed mice. Less is known about these two populations, individually or their overlap, in the normal human mammary gland. The goal of this study was to understand the biology of the ALDH+ and CD44+CD24- populations in the normal human breast, using flow cytometry based sorting paired with functional ex vivo analyses, RNA-sequencing, and single cell RNA expression profiling. ALDH+ cells and ALDH-CD44+CD24- cells, generally, have epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like characteristics, respectively. Despite this, there are substantial similarities in the biological pathways activated in both populations when compared to differentiated cells. Additionally, we found a substantial proportion of cells that simultaneously express ALDH+ and CD44+CD24- whose abundance varies between individuals. At the single cell level, these cells have the greatest mammosphere forming capacity and express high levels of stemness and EMT-associated genes including ID1, SOX2, TWIST1, and ZEB2. Through unbiased analysis of individual ALDH+ cells, we find cells with either epithelial or mesenchymal expression phenotypes. We also identify a subpopulation of cells with a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal expression phenotype that overexpress genes associated with aggressive triple negative breast cancers. These results highlight the utility of single cell analyses to characterize tissue heterogeneity, even in marker enriched cell populations, and further identifies the genes and pathways that define this heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Brain computations depend on how neurons transform inputs to spike outputs. Here, to understand input-output transformations in cortical networks, we recorded spiking responses from visual cortex (V1) of awake mice of either sex while pairing sensory stimuli with optogenetic perturbation of excitatory and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons. We found V1 neurons average responses were primarily additive (linear). We used a recurrent cortical network model to determine if these data, as well as past observations of nonlinearity, could be described by a common circuit architecture. The model showed cortical input-output transformations can be changed from linear to sublinear with moderate ([~]20%) strengthening of connections between inhibitory neurons, but this change depends on the presence of feedforward inhibition. Thus, feedforward inhibition, a common feature of cortical circuitry, enables networks to flexibly change their spiking responses via changes in recurrent connectivity.\\n\\nSignificance statementBrains are made up of neural networks that process information by receiving input activity and transforming those inputs into output activity. We use optogenetic manipulations in awake mice to expose how a transformation in a cortical network depends on internal network activity. Combining numerical simulations with our observations uncovers that transformation depend critically on feedforward inhibition - the fact that inputs to the cortex often make strong connections on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.",

While several tools exist to intersect and visualize sets of genes, similar tools dedicated to the visualization of genomic region sets are currently limited.\\n\\nResultsTo address this gap, we have developed the Intervene tool, which provides an easy and automated interface for the effective intersection and visualization of genomic region or list sets, thus facilitating their analysis and interpretation. Intervene contains three modules: venn to generate Venn diagrams of up to six sets, upset to generate UpSet plots of multiple sets, and pairwise to compute and visualize intersections of multiple sets as clustered heat maps. Intervene, and its interactive web ShinyApp companion, generate publication-quality figures for the interpretation of genomic region and list sets.\\n\\nConclusionsIntervene and its web application companion provide an easy command line, and an interactive web interface to compute intersections of multiple genomic and list sets. They also have the capacity to plot intersections using easy-to-interpret visual approaches. Intervene is developed and designed to meet the needs of both computer scientists and biologists.

    "abstract": "Understanding the forebrain neuromodulation by the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is fundamental for cognitive and systems neuroscience. The diffuse projections of individual LC neurons and presumably their synchronous spiking have long been perceived as features of the global nature of noradrenergic neuromodulation. Yet, the commonly referenced \\\"synchrony\\\" underlying global neuromodulation, has never been assessed in a large population, nor has it been related to projection target specificity. Here, we recorded up to 52 single units simultaneously (3164 unit pairs in total) in rat LC and characterized projections by stimulating 15 forebrain sites. Spike count correlations were low and, surprisingly, only 13% of pairwise spike trains had synchronized spontaneous discharge. Notably, even noxious sensory stimulation did not activate the entire population, only evoking synchronized responses in ~16% of units on each trial. We also identified novel infra-slow (0.01-1 Hz) fluctuations of LC unit spiking that were asynchronous across the population. A minority, synchronized possibly by gap junctions, was biased toward restricted (non-global) forebrain projection patterns. Finally, we characterized two types of LC single units differing by waveform shape, propensity for synchronization, and interactions with cortex. These cell types formed finely-structured ensembles. Our findings suggest that the LC conveys a highly complex, differentiated, and potentially target-specific neuromodulatory signal.",

Pathogens were identified using a rapid computational pipeline to analyze the non-host sequences obtained from DNA-seq. Clinical samples were de-identified and laboratory personnel handling the samples and interpreting the data were masked.\\n\\nResultsMetagenomic DNA sequencing detected 87% of positive reference samples. In the presumed negative reference samples, DNA-seq detected an additional 6 different pathogens in 8 samples (22% of negative samples) that were either not detected or not targeted with pathogen-specific PCR assays. Infectious agents identified only with DNA-seq were Candida dubliniensis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Discordant samples were independently verified in CLIA-certified laboratories. CMV sequences were compared against the antiviral mutation database and 3 of the samples were found to have mutations conferring ganciclovir resistance.\\n\\nConclusionsMetagenomic DNA sequencing was highly concordant with pathogen-directed PCRs. The unbiased nature of metagenomics DNA sequencing allowed an expanded scope of pathogen detection, including bacteria, fungal species, and viruses, resolving 22% of cases that had previously escaped detection by routine pathogen-specific PCRs. The detection of drug resistance mutations highlights the potential for unbiased sequencing to provide clinically actionable information beyond pathogen species detection.",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of genetic variation within proteins is shaped by evolutionary constraint and thus can provide insights into the functional importance of protein regions and the potential pathogenicity of protein alterations. Here, we comprehensively evaluate the 3D spatial patterns of constraint on human germline and somatic variation in 4,568 solved protein structures. Different classes of coding variants have significantly different spatial distributions. Neutral missense variants exhibit a range of 3D constraint patterns, with a general trend of spatial dispersion driven by constraint on core residues. In contrast, germline and somatic disease-causing variants are significantly more likely to be clustered in protein structure space. We demonstrate that this difference in the spatial distributions of disease-associated and benign germline variants provides a signature for accurately classifying variants of unknown significance (VUS) that is complementary to current approaches for VUS classification. We further illustrate the clinical utility of our approach by classifying new mutations identified from patients with familial idiopathic pneumonia (FIP) that segregate with disease.",

    "abstract": "Immunocompromised individuals are at high risk of developing Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapy for refractory or recurrent CDAD and, despite safety concerns, has recently been offered to immunocompromised patients. We investigated the genomics of bacterial composition following FMT in immunocompromised patients over a 1-year period. Metagenomic, strain and gene-level bacterial dynamics were characterized in two CDAD-affected hematopoietic stem cell (HCT) recipients following FMT. We found alterations in gene content, including loss of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. These alterations were accompanied by long-term bacterial divergence at the species and strain levels. Our findings suggest limited durability of the specific bacterial consortium introduced with FMT and indicate that alterations of the functional potential of the microbiome are more complex than can be inferred by taxonomic information alone. Our observation that FMT alone cannot induce long-term donor-like alterations of the microbiota of HCT recipients suggests that FMT cannot indefinitely supersede environmental and/or host factors in shaping bacterial composition.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) provides unparalleled resolution on the abundance and localization of nascent and mature transcripts in single cells. Gene expression dynamics are typically inferred by measuring mRNA abundance in small numbers of fixed cells sampled from a population at multiple time-points after induction. The sparse data that arise from the small number of cells obtained using smFISH present a challenge for inferring transcription dynamics. Here, we developed a computational pipeline (BayFish) to infer kinetic parameters of gene expression from smFISH data at multiple time points after induction. Given an underlying model of gene expression, BayFish uses a Monte Carlo method to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability of the model parameters and quantify the parameter uncertainty given the observed smFISH data. We tested BayFish on smFISH measurements of the neuronal activity inducible gene Npas4 in primary neurons. We showed that a 2-state promoter model can recapitulate Npas4 dynamics after induction and we inferred that the transition rate from the promoter OFF state to the ON state is increased by the stimulus.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGene expression can exhibit cell-to-cell variability due to the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions. Single cell assays (e.g. smFISH) directly quantify stochastic gene expression by measuring the number of active promoters and transcripts per cell in a population of cells. The data are distributions and their shape and time-evolution contain critical information on the underlying process of gene expression. Recent work has combined models of stochastic gene expression with maximum likelihood methods to infer kinetic parameters from smFISH distributions. However, these approaches do not provide a probability distribution or likelihood of model parameters inferred from the smFISH data. This information is useful because it indicates which parameters are loosely constrained by the data and suggests follow up experiments. We developed a suite of MATLAB programs (BayFish) that estimate the Bayesian posterior probability of model parameters from smFISH data. The user specifies an underlying model of stochastic gene expression with unknown parameters ({theta}) and provides smFISH data (Y). BayFish uses a Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability P({theta}|Y) of model parameters. BayFish is easily modified and can be applied to other models of stochastic gene expression and smFISH data sets.",

We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 110 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions; our phylogenetic evidence suggests rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil and multiple introductions of outbreak strains into Puerto Rico, Honduras, Colombia, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in multiple regions for many months before the first locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the importance of viral surveillance.
