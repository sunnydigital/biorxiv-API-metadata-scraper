    "abstract": "The shapes of evolutionary trees are influenced by the nature of the evolutionary process, but comparisons of trees from different processes are hindered by the challenge of completely describing tree shape. We present a full characterization of the shapes of rooted branching trees in a form that lends itself to natural tree comparisons. The resulting metric distinguishes trees from random models known to produce different tree shapes. It separates trees derived from tropical vs USA influenza A sequences, which reflect the differing epidemiology of tropical and seasonal flu. We extend the shape metric to incorporate summary features such as asymmetry, or statistics on branch lengths. Our approach allows us to construct addition and multiplication on trees, and to create a convex metric on tree shapes which formally allows computation of average trees.",

    "abstract": "Canonical ancient sex chromosome pairs consist of a gene rich X (or Z) chromosome and a male- (or female-) limited Y (or W) chromosome that is gene poor. In contrast to highly differentiated sex chromosomes, nascent sex chromosome pairs are homomorphic or very similar in sequence content. Nascent sex chromosomes arise frequently over the course of evolution, as evidenced by differences in sex chromosomes between closely related species and sex chromosome polymorphisms within species. Sex chromosome turnover typically occurs when an existing sex chromosome becomes fused to an autosome or an autosome acquires a new sex-determining locus/allele. Previously documented sex chromosome transitions involve changes to both members of the sex chromosome pair (X and Y, or Z and W). The House fly has sex chromosomes that resemble the ancestral fly karyotype that originated 100 million years ago, and therefore house fly is expected to have X and Y chromosomes with different gene content. We tested this hypothesis using whole genome sequencing and transcriptomic data, and we discovered little evidence for genetic differentiation between the X and Y in house fly. We propose that house fly has retained the ancient X chromosome, but the ancestral Y was replaced by an X chromosome carrying a male determining gene. Our proposed hypothesis provides a mechanisms for how one member of a sex chromosome pair can experience evolutionary turnover while the other member remains unaffected.",

Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difficult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to ten other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6-times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efficiency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the dataset. The significant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will significantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a significant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications.",

    "abstract": "The regulated assembly of multiple filamentous actin (F-actin) networks from an actin monomer pool is important for a variety of cellular processes. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga expressing a conventional and divergent actin that is an emerging system for investigating the complex regulation of actin polymerization. One actin network that contains exclusively conventional F-actin in Chlamydomonas is the fertilization tubule, a mating structure at the apical cell surface in gametes. In addition to two actin genes, Chlamydomonas expresses a profilin (PRF1) and four formin genes (FOR1-4), one of which (FOR1) we have characterized for the first time. We found that unlike typical profilins, PRF1 prevents unwanted actin assembly by strongly inhibiting both F-actin nucleation and barbed end elongation at equimolar concentrations to actin. However, FOR1 stimulates the assembly of rapidly elongating actin filaments from PRF1-bound actin. PRF1 further favors FOR1-mediated actin assembly by potently inhibiting Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. Furthermore, for1 and prf1-1 mutants, as well as the small molecule formin inhibitor SMIFH2, prevent fertilization tubule formation in gametes, suggesting that polymerization of F-actin for fertilization tubule formation is a primary function of FOR1. Together, these findings indicate that FOR1 and PRF1 cooperate to selectively and rapidly assemble F-actin at the right time and place.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe Chlamydomonas reinhardtii formin FOR1 initiates rapid assembly of fertilization tubule actin filaments from monomers associated with the actin-assembly inhibitor profilin PRF1.",

In SYNseq, each neuron is labeled with a unique random nucleotide sequence--an RNA \\\"barcode\\\"--which is targeted to the synapse using engineered proteins. Barcodes in pre- and postsynaptic neurons are then associated through protein-protein crosslinking across the synapse, extracted from the tissue, and then joined into a form suitable for sequencing.

We recovered a draft Paratyphi C genome from the 800-year-old skeleton of a young woman in Trondheim, Norway, who likely died of enteric fever. Analysis of this genome against a new, significantly expanded database of related modern genomes demonstrated that Paratyphi C is descended from the ancestors of swine pathogens, serovars Choleraesuis and Typhisuis, together forming the Para C Lineage.

As a result, reference gene collections remain incomplete: many gene models are fragmentary, while thousands more remain uncatalogued-particularly for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To accelerate lncRNA annotation, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS), combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. We present an experimental re-annotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA population in matched human and mouse tissues, resulting in novel transcript models for 3574 / 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubles the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enable us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter- and gene-structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus CLS removes a longstanding bottleneck of transcriptome annotation, generating manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Although transport, concentration, and detection of target molecules have been demonstrated, controllability of transport directions is still a major challenge. To define multiple moving directions for selective molecular transport, we integrated the bottom-up molecular design of microtubules and the top-down design of a microfluidic device. The surface charge density and stiffness of microtubules were controlled, allowing us to create three different types of microtubules with different gliding directions corresponding to their electrical and mechanical properties. The measured curvature of gliding microtubules enabled us to optimize the size and design of the device for molecular sorting in a top-down approach. The integrated bottom-up and top-down design achieved separation of stiff microtubules from negatively-charged soft microtubules with approximately 80% efficiency under an electric field. Our method is the first to sort multiple microtubules by integrating molecular control and microfluidic device design, and is applicable to multiplexed molecular sorters.",

    "abstract": "Linear analysis of kinetic models of metabolism can help in understanding the dynamic response of metabolic networks. Central to linear analysis of these models are two key matrices: the Jacobian matrix (J) and its modal matrix (M-1). The modal matrix contains dynamically independent motions of the kinetic model, and it is sparse in practice. Understanding the sparsity structure of the modal matrix provides insight into metabolic network dynamics. In this study, we analyze the relationship between J and M-1. First, we show that diagonal dominance occurs in a substantial fraction of the rows of J, resulting in simple modal structures within M-1. Dominant diagonal elements in J approximate the eigenvalues corresponding to these simple modes, in which a single metabolite is driven back to its reference state on a characteristic timescale. Second, we analyze more complicated mode structures in M-1, in which two or more variables move in a certain ratio relative to one another on defined time scales. We show that complicated modes originate from sub-matrices of topologically connected elements of similar magnitude in J. Third, we describe the origin of these mode structure features based on the network stoichiometric matrix S and the reaction kinetic gradient matrix G. We demonstrate that the topologically-connected reaction sensitivities of similar magnitude in G play a central role in determining the mode structure. Ratios of these reaction sensitivities represent equilibrium balances of half reactions that are defined by linearization of the bilinear mass action rate laws followed by enzymatic reactions. These half-reaction equilibrium ratios are key determinants of modal structure for both simple and complicated modes. The work presented here helps to establish a foundation for understanding the dynamics of kinetic models of metabolism, which are rooted in the network structure and the kinetic properties of reactions.",

    "abstract": "Independent reproducibility is essential to the generation of scientific knowledge. Optimizing experimental protocols to ensure reproducibility is an important aspect of scientific work. Genetic or pharmacological lifespan extensions are generally small compared to the inherent variability in mean lifespan even in isogenic populations housed under identical conditions. This variability makes reproducible detection of small but real effects experimentally challenging. In this study, we aimed to determine the reproducibility of C. elegans lifespan measurements under ideal conditions, in the absence of methodological errors or environmental or genetic background influences. To accomplish this, we generated a parametric model of C. elegans lifespan based on data collected from 5,026 wild-type N2 animals. We use this model to predict how different experimental practices, effect sizes, number of animals, and how different  shapes of survival curves affect the ability to reproduce real longevity effects. We find that the chances of reproducing real but small effects are exceedingly low and would require substantially more animals than are commonly used. Our results indicate that many lifespan studies are underpowered to detect reported changes and that, as a consequence, stochastic variation alone can account for many failures to reproduce longevity results. As a remedy, we provide power of detection tables that can be used as guidelines to plan experiments with statistical power to reliably detect real changes in lifespan and limit spurious false positive results. These considerations will improve best-practices in designing lifespan experiment to increase reproducibility.",

We propose a novel heuristic based on machine-learning techniques (GraBLD) to boost the predictive performance of polygenic risk scores. Gradient boosted regression trees were first used to optimize the weights of SNPs included in the score, followed by a novel regional adjustment for linkage disequilibrium. A calibration set with sample size of ~200 individuals was sufficient for optimal performance. GraBLD yielded prediction R2 of 0.239 and 0.082 using GIANT summary association statistics for height and BMI in the UK Biobank study (N=130K; 1.98M SNPs), explaining 46.9% and 32.7% of the overall polygenic variance, respectively. For diabetes status, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.602 in the UK Biobank study using summary-level association statistics from the DIAGRAM consortium. GraBLD outperformed other polygenic score heuristics for the prediction of height (p<2.2x10-16) and BMI (p<1.57x10-4), and was equivalent to LDpred for diabetes. Results were independently validated in the Health and Retirement Study (N=8,292; 688,398 SNPs). Our report demonstrates the use of machine-learning techniques, coupled with summary-level data from large genome-wide meta-analyses to improve the prediction of polygenic traits.",

    "abstract": "Replication stress is a characteristic feature of cancer cells, which is resulted from sustained proliferative signaling induced by activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressors. In cancer cells, oncogene-induced replication stress manifests as replication-associated lesions, predominantly double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). An essential mechanism utilized by cells to repair replication-associated DSBs is homologous recombination (HR). In order to overcome replication stress and survive, cancer cells often require enhanced HR repair capacity. Therefore, the key link between HR repair and cellular tolerance to replication-associated DSBs provides us with a mechanistic rationale for exploiting synthetic lethality between HR repair inhibition and replication stress. Our studies showed that DNA2 nuclease is an evolutionarily conserved essential component of HR repair machinery. Here we demonstrate that DNA2 is indeed overexpressed in pancreatic cancers, one of the deadliest and more aggressive forms of human cancers, where mutations in the KRAS are present in 90%-95% of cases. In addition, depletion of DNA2 significantly reduces pancreatic cancer cell survival and xenograft tumor growth, suggesting the therapeutic potential of DNA2 inhibition. Finally, we develop a robust high-throughput biochemistry assay to screen for inhibitors of the DNA2 nuclease activity. The top inhibitors were shown to be efficacious against both yeast Dna2 and human DNA2. Treatment of cancer cells with DNA2 inhibitors recapitulates phenotypes observed upon DNA2 depletion, including decreased DNA end resection and attenuation of HR repair. Similar to genetic ablation of DNA2, chemical inhibition of DNA2 selectively attenuates the growth of various cancer cells with oncogene-induced replication stress. Taken together, our findings open a new avenue to develop a new class of anti-cancer drugs by targeting druggable nuclease DNA2. We 4, 16.

In this article, we introduce mathematical models of the neural circuitry in the dorsal horn responsible for processing nerve fiber inputs from noxious stimulation of peripheral tissues and generating the resultant pain signal. The differential equation models describe the average firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations, as well as the wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons whose output correlates with the pain signal. The temporal profile of inputs on the different afferent nerve fibers that signal noxious and innocuous stimulation and the excitability properties of the included neuronal populations are constrained by experimental results. We consider models for the spinal cord circuit in isolation and when top-down inputs from higher brain areas that modulate pain processing are included. We validate the models by replicating experimentally observed phenomena of A fiber inhibition of pain and wind-up. We then use the models to investigate mechanisms for the observed phase shift in circadian rhythmicity of pain that occurs with neuropathic pain conditions. Our results suggest that changes in neuropathic pain rhythmicity can occur through dysregulation of inhibition within the dorsal horn circuit.",

A critical parameter for membrane molecular organization is how the membrane lipids are packed (or ordered). Polarity sensitive dyes are powerful tools to characterize such lipid membrane order, employing for example confocal and two-photon microscopy. The investigation of potential lipid nanodomains, however, requires the use of super resolution microscopy. Here, we test the performance of the polarity sensitive membrane dyes Di-4-ANEPPDHQ, Di-4-AN(F)EPPTEA and NR12S in super resolution STED microscopy. Measurements on cell-derived membrane vesicles, in the plasma membrane of live cells, and on single virus particles show the high potential of these dyes for probing nanoscale membrane heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Many different evolutionary processes may be responsible for explaining natural variation within genomes, some of which include natural selection at the molecular level and changes in population size. Fungi are highly adaptable organisms, and their relatively small genomes and short generation times make them pliable for evolutionary genomic studies. However, adaptation in wild populations has been relatively less documented compared to experimental or clinical studies. Here, we analyzed DNA sequences from 502 putative single-copy orthologous genes in 63 samples that represent seven recently diverged North American Amanita (jacksonii-complex) lineages. For each gene and each species, we measured the genealogical sorting index (gsi) and infinite-site-based summary statistics, such as [Formula], [Formula] and DTaj in coding and intron regions. MKT-based approaches and likelihood-ratio-test Kn/Ks models were used to measure natural selection in all coding sequences. Multi-locus (Extended) Bayesian Skyline Plots (eBSP) were used to model intraspecific demographic changes through time based on unlinked, putative neutral regions (introns). Most genes show evidence of long-term purifying selection, likely reflecting a functional bias implicit in single-copy genes. We find that two species have strongly negatively skewed Tajimas D, while three other have a positive skew, corresponding well with patterns of demographic expansion and contraction. Standard MKT analyses resulted in a high incidence of near-zero  with a tendency towards negative values. In contrast,  estimates based on the distribution of fitness effects (DFE), which accounts for demographic effects and slightly deleterious mutations, suggest a higher proportion of sites fixed by positive selection. The difference was more notorious in species with expansion signatures or with historically low population sizes, evidencing the concealing effects of specific demographic histories. Finally, we attempt to mitigate Gene Ontology term overrepresentation, highlighting the potential adaptive or ecological roles of some genes under positive selection.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable mechanical performance of biological materials is based on intricate structure-function relationships. Nanoindentation has become the primary tool for characterising biological materials, as it allows to relate structural changes to variations in mechanical properties on small scales. However, the respective theoretical background and associated interpretation of the parameters measured via indentation derives largely from research on  traditional engineering materials such as metals or ceramics. Here, we discuss the functional relevance of indentation hardness in biological materials by presenting a meta-analysis of its relationship with indentation modulus. Across seven orders of magnitude, indentation hardness was directly proportional to indentation modulus, illustrating that hardness is not an independent material property. Using a lumped parameter model to deconvolute indentation hardness into components arising from reversible and irreversible deformation, we establish criteria which allow to interpret differences in indentation hardness across or within biological materials. The ratio between hardness and modulus arises as a key parameter, which is a proxy for the ratio between irreversible and reversible deformation during indentation, and the materials yield strength. Indentation hardness generally increases upon material dehydration, however to a larger extend than expected from accompanying changes in indentation modulus, indicating that water acts as a  plasticiser. A detailed discussion of the role of indentation hardness, modulus and toughness in damage control during sharp or blunt indentation yields comprehensive guidelines for a performance-based ranking of biological materials, and suggests that quasi-plastic deformation is a frequent yet poorly understood damage mode, highlighting an important area of future research.",

    "abstract": "The number of times an organism reproduces (i.e. its mode of parity) is a fundamental life-history character, and evolutionary and ecological models that compare the relative fitness of strategies are common in life history theory and theoretical biology. Despite the success of mathematical models designed to compare intrinsic rates of increase between annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous reproductive schedules, there is widespread evidence that variation in reproductive allocation among semelparous and iteroparous organisms alike is continuous. This paper reviews the ecological and molecular evidence for the continuity and plasticity of modes of parity--that is, the idea that annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous life histories are better understood as endpoints along a continuum of possible strategies. I conclude that parity should be understood as a continuum of different modes of parity, which differ by the degree to which they disperse or concentrate reproductive effort in time. I further argue that there are three main implications of this conclusion: (1) That seasonality should not be conflated with parity; (2) that mathematical models purporting to explain the evolution of semelparous life histories from iteroparous ones (or vice versa) should not assume that organisms can only display either an annual-semelparous life history or a perennial-iteroparous one; and (3) that evolutionary ecologists should examine the physiological or molecular basis of traits underlying different modes of parity, in order to obtain a general understanding of how different life history strategies can evolve from one another.",

    "abstract": "Background: The rapid growth of the number of mathematical models in Systems Biology fostered the development of many tools to simulate and analyse them. The reliability and precision of these tasks often depend on multiple repetitions and they can be optimised if executed as pipelines. In addition, new formal analyses can be performed on these repeat sequences, revealing important insights about the accuracy of model predictions.\\n\\nResults: Here we introduce SBpipe, an open source software tool for automating repetitive tasks in model building and simulation. Using basic configuration files, SBpipe builds a sequence of repeated model simulations or parameter estimations, performs analyses from this generated sequence, and finally generates a LaTeX/PDF report. The parameter estimation pipeline offers analyses of parameter profile likelihood and parameter correlation using samples from the computed estimates. Specific pipelines for scanning of one or two model parameters at the same time are also provided. Pipelines can run on multicore computers, Sun Grid Engine (SGE), or Load Sharing Facility (LSF) clusters, speeding up the processes of model building and simulation. SBpipe can execute models implemented in Copasi, Python or coded in any other programming language using Python as a wrapper module. Future support for other software simulators can be dynamically added without affecting the current implementation.\\n\\nConclusions: SBpipe allows users to automatically repeat the tasks of model simulation and parameter estimation, and extract robustness information from these repeat sequences in a solid and consistent manner, facilitating model development and analysis.

    "abstract": "Functional Connectivity (FC) during resting-state or task conditions is not fixed but inherently dynamic. Yet, there is no consensus on whether fluctuations in FC may resemble isolated transitions between discrete FC states rather than continuous changes. This quarrel hampers advancing the study of dynamic FC. This is unfortunate as the structure of fluctuations in FC can certainly provide more information about developmental changes, aging, and progression of pathologies. We merge the two perspectives and consider dynamic FC as an ongoing network reconfiguration, including a stochastic exploration of the space of possible steady FC states. The statistical properties of this random walk deviate both from a purely \"order-driven\" dynamics, in which the mean FC is preserved, and from a purely \"randomness-driven\" scenario, in which fluctuations of FC remain uncorrelated over time. Instead, dynamic FC has a complex structure endowed with long-range sequential correlations that give rise to transient slowing and acceleration epochs in the continuous flow of reconfiguration. Our analysis for fMRI data in healthy elderly revealed that dynamic FC tends to slow down and becomes less complex as well as more random with increasing age. These effects appear to be strongly associated with age-related changes in behavioural and cognitive performance.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) at rest and during cognitive task performs a \"complex\" (anomalous) random walk.\nC_LIO_LISpeed of dFC slows down with aging.\nC_LIO_LIResting dFC replaces complexity by randomness with aging.\nC_LIO_LITask performance correlates with the speed and complexity of dFC.\nC_LI",

Here, we present a scalable method for parameter-free simulation of mechanistic signal transduction networks. It is based on rxncon and uses a bipartite Boolean logic with separate update rules for reactions and states. Using two generic update rules, we enable translation of any rxncon model into a unique Boolean model, which can be used for network validation and simulation - allowing the prediction of system level function directly from molecular mechanistic data. Through scalable model definition and simulation, and the independence of quantitative parameters, it opens up for simulation and validation of mechanistic genome-scale models of signal transduction networks.",

We sequenced coding and regulatory elements for 608 genes implicated in OCD from humans and two animal models (mouse and dog). Using a new method, PolyStrat, which prioritizes variants disrupting evolutionarily conserved, functional regions, we found four strongly associated genes when comparing 592 cases to 560 controls. These results were validated in a second, larger cohort. NRXN1 and HTR2A are enriched for coding variants altering postsynaptic protein-binding domains, while CTTNBP2 (synapse maintenance) and REEP3 (vesicle trafficking) are enriched for regulatory variants. The rare coding variant burden in NRXN1 achieves genomewide significance (p=6.37x10-11) when we include public data for 33,370 controls. Of 17 regulatory variants identified in CTTNBP2 and REEP3, we show that at least six alter transcription factor-DNA binding in human neuroblastoma cells.

We report that single neurons can represent multiple different stimuli by interleaving different signals across time. We record single units in an auditory region, the inferior colliculus, while monkeys localize 1 or 2 simultaneous sounds. During dual-sound trials, we find that some neurons fluctuate between firing rates observed for each single sound, either on a whole-trial or on a sub-trial timescale. These fluctuations are correlated in pairs of neurons, can be predicted by the state of local field potentials prior to sound onset, and, in one monkey, can predict which sound will be reported first. We find corroborating evidence of fluctuating activity patterns in a separate data set involving responses of inferotemporal cortex neurons to multiple visual stimuli. Alternation between activity patterns corresponding to each of multiple items may therefore be a general strategy to enhance the brain processing capacity, potentially linking such disparate phenomena as variable neural firing, neural oscillations, and limits in attentional/memory capacity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThere is considerable interest in comparing functional genomic data across species. One goal of such work is to provide an integrated understanding of genome and phenotype evolution. Most comparative functional genomic studies have relied on multiple pairwise comparisons between species, an approach that does not incorporate information about the evolutionary relationships among species. The statistical problems that arise from not considering these relationships can lead pairwise approaches to the wrong conclusions, and are a missed opportunity to learn about biology that can only be understood in an explicit phylogenetic context. Here we examine two recently published studies that compare gene expression across species with pairwise methods, and find reason to question the original conclusions of both. One study interpreted pairwise comparisons of gene expression as support for the ortholog conjecture, the hypothesis that orthologs tend to be more similar than paralogs. The other study interpreted pairwise comparisons of embryonic gene expression across distantly related animals as evidence for a distinct evolutionary process that gave rise to phyla. In each study, distinct patterns of pairwise similarity among species were originally interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary processes, but instead we find they reflect species relationships. These reanalyses concretely demonstrate the inadequacy of pairwise comparisons for analyzing functional genomic data across species. It will be critical to adopt phylogenetic comparative methods in future functional genomic work. Fortunately, phylogenetic comparative biology is also a rapidly advancing field with many methods that can be directly applied to functional genomic data.\\n\\nSignificanceComparisons of genome function between species are providing important insight into the evolutionary origins of diversity. Here we demonstrate that comparative functional genomics studies can come to the wrong conclusions if they do not take the relationships of species into account and instead rely on pairwise comparisons between species, as is common practice. We re-examined two previously published studies and found problems with pairwise comparisons that draw both their original conclusions into question. One study had found support for the ortholog conjecture and the other had concluded that the evolution of gene expression was different between animal phyla than within them. Our results demonstrate that to answer evolutionary questions about genome function, it is critical to consider evolutionary relationships.",

    "abstract": "The monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus 1758) is a charismatic butterfly known for its multi-generational migration in Eastern North America, and is emerging as an important system in the study of evolutionary genetics. Assigning genes or genetic elements to chromosomes is an important step when considering how genomes evolved. The monarch butterfly has a reported haploid chromosome number of 30. The specimens that this count is based on are from Madras, India where D. plexippus does not occur. As a consequence the reported haplotype for the D. plexippus is incorrect. A literature review revealed that the specimens this count was based on were most likely Danaus genutia (Cramer 1779), which Linnaeus and others conflated with D. plexippus. In a 1954 Opinion (#282) the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature decided that the name D. genutia refers to specimens originating from the Orient and D. plexippus to those from North America. To clarify the haplotype number of D. plexippus from North America I conducted chromosome squashes of male 5th instar larvae. All specimens examined had a haploid chromosome count of n = 28. Following these new data, I then reconstructed the evolution of haplotypes throughout the Danainae subfamily to provide a testable hypothesis on the evolution of chromosome number for this group.",

    "abstract": "Hsp90 is a homodimeric ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that remodels its substrate \\\"client\\\" proteins, facilitating their folding and activating them for biological function. Despite decades of research, the mechanism connecting ATP hydrolysis and chaperone function remains elusive. Particularly puzzling has been the apparent lack of cooperativity in hydrolysis of the ATP in each protomer. A crystal structure of the mitochondrial Hsp90, TRAP1, revealed that the catalytically active state is closed in a highly-strained asymmetric conformation. This asymmetry, unobserved in other Hsp90 homologs, is due to buckling of one of the protomers and is most pronounced at the broadly conserved client-binding region. Here, we show that rather than being cooperative or independent, ATP hydrolysis on the two protomers is sequential and deterministic. Moreover, dimer asymmetry sets up differential hydrolysis rates for each protomer, such that the buckled conformation favors ATP hydrolysis. Remarkably, after the first hydrolysis, the dimer undergoes a flip in the asymmetry while remaining in a closed state for the second hydrolysis. From these results, we propose a model where direct coupling of ATP hydrolysis and conformational flipping rearranges client-binding sites, providing a paradigm of how energy from ATP hydrolysis can be used for client remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Humans tend to form social relationships with others who resemble them. Whether this sorting of like with like arises from historical patterns of migration, meso-level social structures in modern society, or individual-level selection of similar peers remains unsettled. Recent research has evaluated the possibility that unobserved genotypes may play an important role in the creation of homophilous relationships. We extend this work by using data from 9,500 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine genetic similarities among pairs of friends. While there is some evidence that friends have correlated genotypes, both at the whole-genome level as well as at trait-associated loci (via polygenic scores), further analysis suggests that meso-level forces, such as school assignment, are a principal source of genetic similarity between friends. We also observe apparent social-genetic effects in which polygenic scores of an individuals friends and schoolmates predict the individuals own educational attainment. In contrast, an individuals height is unassociated with the height genetics of peers.\\n\\nSignificanceOur study reported significant findings of a \\\"social genome\\\" that can be quantified and studied to understand human health and behavior. In a national sample of more than 9,000 American adolescents, we found evidence of social forces that act to make friends and schoolmates more genetically similar to one another as compared to random pairs of unrelated individuals. This subtle genetic similarity was observed across the entire genome and at sets of genomic locations linked with specific traits--educational attainment and body-mass index--a phenomenon we term \\\"social-genetic correlation.\\\" We also find evidence of a \\\"social-genetic effect\\\" such that the genetics of a persons friends and schoolmates influenced their own education, even after accounting for the persons own genetics.",

    "abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in studying how genes work is understanding their effect on the physiology and anatomy of the body. Existing tools try to address this using indirect features, such as expression levels and biochemical pathways. Here, we present Gene ORGANizer (geneorganizer.huji.ac.il), a phenotype-based tool that directly links human genes to the body parts they affect. It is built upon an exhaustive curated database that links more than 7,000 genes to [~]150 anatomical parts using >150,000 gene-organ associations. The tool offers user-friendly platforms to analyze the anatomical effects of individual genes, and identify trends within groups of genes. We demonstrate how Gene ORGANizer can be used to make new discoveries, showing that chromosome X is enriched with genes affecting facial features, that positive selection targets genes with more constrained phenotypic effects, and more. We expect Gene ORGANizer to be useful in a variety of evolutionary, medical and molecular studies aimed at understanding the phenotypic effects of genes.",

    "abstract": "Myosin Vc (myoVc) is unique among vertebrate class V myosin isoforms in that it requires teams of motors to transport cargo. Single molecules of myoVc cannot take multiple steps on single actin filaments, in stark contrast to the well-studied myosin Va (myoVa) isoform. Consistent with in vivo studies (1), only teams of myoVc motors can move continuously on actin bundles at physiologic ionic strength (2), raising the question of how motor-motor interactions cause this preference. Here, using DNA nanostructures as synthetic cargos for linking defined numbers of myoVa or myoVc molecules, we compared the stepping behavior of myoVa versus myoVc teams, and myoVc stepping patterns on single actin filaments versus actin bundles. Run lengths of both myoVa and myoVc teams increased with motor number, but the run lengths of myoVc teams were longer on actin bundles than on filaments. By resolving the stepping behavior of individual myoVc motors with a Qdot bound to the motor domain, we found that coupling of two myoVc molecules significantly decreases futile back/side steps, which were frequently observed for single myoVc motors. Data showing how changes in the inter-motor distance of two coupled myoVc motors affected stepping dynamics suggested that mechanical tension coordinates the stepping behavior of two molecules for efficient directional motion. Our study thus provides a molecular basis to explain how teams of myoVc motors are suited to transport cargos such as zymogen granules on actin bundles.",

    "abstract": "DNA (meta)barcoding is used to study biodiversity and is available for standardised assessments. However, it suffers from PCR bias, which can lead to the loss of specific taxa. PCR-free techniques such as shotgun metagenomics are therefore thought to be more suited for biodiversity assessments, but are currently limited by incomplete reference libraries.\\n\\nThe technique of  mitogenome-skimming or  mitogenomics, in which complete mitochondrial genomes are sequenced, is ideal to bridge the techniques of (meta)barcoding and metagenomics. However, without the enrichment of mitochondria, roughly 99 % of all sequencing reads are of non-mitochondrial origin and mostly useless for common applications, e.g. species identification.\\n\\nHere, we present a simple centrifugation protocol that leads to an average 140-fold enrichment of mitochondrial DNA. By sequencing six  mock- communities - comprising the freshwater taxa Corbicula fluminea, Gammarus roeselii and Hydropsyche exocellata each - we recovered whole mitochondrial genomes of these species and the acanthocephalan endoparasite Pomphorhynchus laevis.\\n\\nThe presented protocol will greatly speed up building reference libraries for whole mitochondrial genomes, as dozens of species could be sequenced on a single MiSeq run. Subsequently, it will also allow biodiversity assessments using mitogenomics at greatly reduced costs in comparison to mitogenomic approaches without prior enrichment for mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen has been widely used to interrogate gene functions. However, the analysis remains challenging and rules to design better libraries beg further refinement. Here we present MAGeCK-NEST, which integrates protein-protein interaction (PPI), improves the inference accuracy when fewer guide-RNAs (sgRNAs) are available, and assesses screen qualities using information on PPI. MAGeCK-NEST also adopts a maximum-likelihood approach to remove sgRNA outliers, which are characterized with higher G-nucleotide counts, especially in regions distal from the PAM motif. Using MAGeCK-NEST, we found that choosing non-targeting sgRNAs as negative controls lead to strong bias, which can be mitigated by sgRNAs targeting the \\\"safe harbor\\\" regions. Custom-designed screens confirmed our findings, and further revealed that 19nt sgRNAs consistently gave the best signal-to-noise separation. Collectively, our method enabled robust calling of CRISPR screen hits and motivated the design of an improved genome-wide CRISPR screen library.",

    "abstract": "1Codon usage bias (CUB), where certain codons are used more frequently than expected by chance, is a ubiquitous phenomenon and occurs across the tree of life. The dominant paradigm is that the proportion of preferred codons is set by weak selection. While experimental changes in codon usage have at times shown large phenotypic effects in contrast to this paradigm, genome-wide population genetic estimates have supported the weak selection model. Here we use deep genomic sequencing of two Drosophila melanogaster populations to measure selection on synonymous sites in a way that allowed us to estimate the prevalence of both weak and strong selection. We find that selection in favor of preferred codons ranges from weak (|Nes| [~] 1) to strong (|Nes| > 10). While previous studies indicated that selection at synonymous sites could be strong, this is the first study to detect and quantify strong selection specifically at the level of CUB. We suggest that the level of CUB in the genome is determined by the proportion of synonymous sites under no, weak, and strong selection. This model challenges the standard Li-Bulmer model and explains some of the longest-standing puzzles in the field.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium chimaera is an opportunistic environmental mycobacterium, belonging to the Mycobacterium intracellulare complex. Although most commonly associated with pulmonary disease, there has been growing awareness of invasive M. chimaera infections following cardiac surgery. Investigations suggest world-wide spread of a specific M. chimaera clone, associated with contaminated hospital heater-cooler units used during the surgery. Given the global dissemination of this clone, its potential to cause invasive disease, and the laboriousness of current culture-based diagnostic methods, there is a pressing need to develop rapid and accurate diagnostic assays, specific for M. chimaera. Here, we assessed 354 mycobacterial genome sequences and confirmed that M. chimaera is a phylogenetically coherent group. In silico comparisons indicated six DNA regions present only in M. chimaera. We targeted one of these regions and developed a TaqMan qPCR assay for M. chimaera with a detection limit of 10 CFU in whole blood. In vitro screening against DNA extracted from 40 other mycobacteria and 22 bacterial species from 21 diverse genera confirmed in silico predicted specificity for M. chimaera. Screening 33 water samples from heater cooler units with this assay highlighted the increased sensitivity of PCR compared to culture, with 15 of 23 culture negative samples positive by M. chimaera qPCR. We have thus developed a robust molecular assay that can be readily and rapidly deployed to screen clinical and environmental specimens for M. chimaera.",

    "abstract": "Mobilisation of retrotransposons to new genomic locations is a significant driver of mammalian genome evolution. In humans, retrotransposon mobilisation is mediated primarily by proteins encoded by LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons, which mobilise in pluripotent cells early in development. Here we show that TEX19.1, which is induced by developmentally programmed DNA hypomethylation, can directly interact with the L1-encoded protein L1-ORF1p, stimulate its polyubiquitylation and degradation, and restrict L1 mobilisation. We also show that TEX19.1 likely acts, at least in part, through promoting the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2 towards L1-ORF1p. Moreover, we show that loss of Tex19.1 increases L1-ORF1p levels and mobilisation of L1 reporters in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells implying that Tex19.1 prevents new retrotransposition-mediated mutations from arising in the germline genome. These data show that post-translational regulation of L1 retrotransposons plays a key role in maintaining trans-generational genome stability in the epigenetically dynamic developing mammalian germline.",
