    "abstract": "Scalable, integrative methods to understand mechanisms that link genetic variants with phenotypes are needed. Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations were tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "In many genomic applications, hypotheses tests are performed by aggregating test-statistics across units within naturally defined classes for powerful identification of signals. Following class-level testing, it is naturally of interest to identify the lower level units which contain true signals. Testing the individual units within a class without taking into account the fact that the class was selected using an aggregate-level test-statistic, will produce biased inference. We develop a hypothesis testing framework that guarantees control for false positive rates conditional on the fact that the class was selected. Specifically, we develop procedures for calculating unit level p-values that allows rejection of null hypotheses controlling for two types of conditional error rates, one relating to family wise rate and the other relating to false discovery rate. We use simulation studies to illustrate validity and power of the proposed procedure in comparison to several possible alternatives. We illustrate the power of the method in a natural application involving whole-genome expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis across 17 tissue types using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project.",

    "abstract": "Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry is a powerful tool to study protein-protein interactions and protein conformations. Two linked peptides are ionized and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum. In such an experiment, a tandem mass spectrum contains ions from two peptides. The peptide identification problem becomes a peptide-peptide pair identification problem. Currently, most existing tools dont search all possible pairs due to the quadratic time complexity. Consequently, a significant percentage of linked peptides are missed. In our earlier work, we developed a tool named ECL to search all pairs of peptides exhaustively. While ECL does not miss any linked peptides, it is very slow due to the quadratic computational complexity, especially when the database is large. Furthermore, ECL uses a score function without statistical calibration, while researchers1,2 have demonstrated that using a statistical calibrated score function can achieve a higher sensitivity than using an uncalibrated one.\\n\\nHere, we propose an advanced version of ECL, named ECL 2.0. It achieves a linear time and space complexity by taking advantage of the additive property of a score function. It can analyze a typical data set containing tens of thousands of spectra using a large-scale database containing thousands of proteins in a few hours. Comparison with other five state-of-the-art tools shows that ECL 2.0 is much faster than pLink, StavroX, ProteinProspector, and ECL. Kojak is the only one tool that is faster than ECL 2.0. But Kojak does not exhaustively search all possible peptide pairs. We also adopt an e-value estimation method to calibrate the original score. Comparison shows that ECL 2.0 has the highest sensitivity among the state-of-the-art tools. The experiment using a large-scale in vivo cross-linking data set demonstrates that ECL 2.0 is the only tool that can find PSMs passing the false discovery rate threshold. The result illustrates that exhaustive search and well calibrated score function are useful to find PSMs from a huge search space.",

    "abstract": "Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is an ongoing public health problem in Ecuador and throughout the tropics, yet we have a limited understanding of the disease transmission dynamics in these regions. The objective of this study was to characterize the spatial dynamics and social-ecological risk factors associated with a recent dengue outbreak in Guayaquil, Ecuador. We examined georeferenced dengue cases (n = 4,248) and block-level census data variables to identify potential social-ecological variables associated with the presence and burden of dengue fever in Guayaquil in 2012. We applied LISA and Morans I tests to analyze hotspots of dengue cases and used multimodel selection in R computing language to identify covariates associated with dengue incidence at the census zone level. Significant hotspots of dengue transmission were found near the North Central and Southern portions of Guayaquil. Significant risk factors for presence of dengue included poor housing conditions (e.g., poor condition of ceiling, floors, and walls), access to paved roads, and receipt of remittances. Counterintuitive positive correlations with dengue presence were observed with several municipal services such as garbage collection and access to piped water. Risk factors for the increased burden of dengue included poor housing conditions, garbage collection, receipt of remittances, and sharing a property with more than one household. Social factors such as education and household demographics were negatively correlated with increased dengue burden. Our findings elucidate underlying differences with dengue presence and burden and indicate the potential to develop dengue vulnerability and risk maps to inform disease prevention and control - information that is also relevant for emerging epidemics of chikungunya and zika.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIIn 2012, Guayaquil, Ecuador had a large outbreak of dengue cases\\nC_LIO_LIDengue case presence and burden exhibited spatial heterogeneity at the census block level\\nC_LIO_LISocial-ecological drivers of case presence and burden differed in this outbreak, highlighting the need to model both types of epidemiological data\\nC_LIO_LIAccess to municipal resources such as garbage collection and piped water had counterintuitive relationships with dengue presence, but poor housing, garbage collection and remittances correlated to dengue burden.\\nC_LIO_LIOur findings inform risk mapping and vector control and surveillance allocation, relevant to this and other concurrent emergent epidemics such as chikungunya and zika\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In the adult hippocampus, neural stem cells (NSCs) continuously produce new neurons that integrate into the neuronal network to modulate learning and memory. The amount and quality of newly generated neurons decline with age, which can be counteracted by increasing intrinsic Wnt activity in NSCs. However, the precise cellular changes underlying this age-related decline or its rescue through Wnt remain unclear. The present study combines development of a mathematical model and experimental data to address features controlling stem cell dynamics. We show that available experimental data fit a model in which quiescent NSCs can either become activated to divide or undergo depletion events, consisting of astrocytic transformation and apoptosis. Additionally, we demonstrate that aged NSCs remain longer in quiescence and have a higher probability to become re-activated versus being depleted. Finally, our model explains that high NSC-Wnt activity leads to longer time in quiescence while augmenting the probability of activation.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing variation in the rate of recombination across the genome is important for understanding many evolutionary processes. The landscape of recombination has been studied previously in the house mouse, Mus musculus, and it is known that the different subspecies exhibit different suites of recombination hotspots. However, it is not established whether broad-scale variation in the rate of recombination is conserved between the subspecies. In this study, we construct a fine-scale recombination map for the Eastern house mouse subspecies, M. m. castaneus, using 10 individuals sampled from its ancestral range. After inferring phase, we use LDhelmet to construct recombination maps for each autosome. We find that the spatial distribution of recombination rate is strongly positively between our castaneus map and a map constructed using inbred lines of mice derived predominantly from M. m. domesticus. We also find that levels of genetic diversity in M. m. castaneus are positively correlated with the rate of recombination, consistent with pervasive natural selection acting in the genome. Our study suggests that recombination rate variation is conserved at broad scales between M. musculus subspecies.",

    "abstract": "Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1/TTK) is a protein kinase essential in mitotic checkpoint signalling, preventing anaphase until all chromosomes are properly attached to spindle microtubules. Mps1 has emerged as a potential target for cancer therapy, and a variety of compounds have been developed to inhibit its kinase activity. Mutations in the catalytic domain of Mps1 that give rise to inhibitor resistance, but retain catalytic activity and do not display cross-resistance to other Mps1 inhibitors, have been described. Here we characterize the interactions of two such mutants, Mps1 C604Y and C604W, which raise resistance to two closely related compounds, NMS-P715 and its derivative Cpd-5, but not to the well-characterised Mps1 inhibitor, reversine. We show that estimates of the IC50 (employing a novel specific and efficient assay that utilizes a fluorescently labelled substrate) and of the binding affinity (KD) indicate that in both mutants, Cpd-5 should be better tolerated than the closely related NMS-P715. To gain further insight, we determined the crystal structure of the Mps1 kinase mutants bound to Cpd-5 and NMS-P715, and compare the binding modes of Cpd-5, NMS-P715 and reversine. The difference in steric hindrance between Tyr/Trp604 and the trifluoromethoxy moiety of NMS-P715, the methoxy moiety of Cpd-5, and complete absence of such a group in reversine, account for differences we observe in vitro. Our analysis enforces the notion that inhibitors targeting Mps1 drug-resistant mutations can emerge as a feasible intervention strategy based on existing scaffolds, if the clinical need arises.\\n\\nSummary statementThe inhibition of specific Mps1 kinase inhibitors towards the wild-type protein and inhibitor-resistant mutants is explained by a novel specific activity assay, biophysical characterisation, and X-ray structures.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Past population sizes for these plots are estimated from genetic data, without a priori assumptions on the mathematical function defining the shape of the demographic trajectory. Because of this flexibility in shape, skyline plots can, in principle, provide realistic descriptions of the complex demographic scenarios that occur in natural populations. Currently, demographic estimates needed for skyline plots are estimated using coalescent samplers or a composite likelihood approach. Here, we provide a way to estimate historical effective population sizes using an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. We assess its performance using simulated and actual microsatellite datasets. Our method correctly retrieves the signal of contracting, constant and expanding populations, although the graphical shape of the plot is not always an accurate representation of the true demographic trajectory, particularly for recent changes in size and contracting populations. Because of the flexibility of ABC, similar approaches can be extended to other types of data, to multiple populations, or to other parameters that can change through time, such as the migration rate.",

    "abstract": "Many biological molecules exist in multiple variants, such as proteins with different post-translational modifications, DNAs with different sequences, and phospholipids with different chain lengths. Representing these variants as distinct species, as most biochemical simulators do, leads to the problem that the number of species, and chemical reactions that interconvert them, typically increase combinatorially with the number of ways that the molecules can vary. This can be alleviated by \\\"rule-based modeling methods,\\\" in which software generates the chemical reaction network from relatively simple \\\"rules.\\\" This article presents a new approach to rule-based modeling. It is based on wildcards that match to species names, much as wildcards can match to file names in computer operating systems. It is much simpler to use than the formal rule-based modeling approaches developed previously but can also lead to unintended consequences if not used carefully. This article demonstrates rule-based modeling with wildcards through examples for: signaling systems, protein complexation, polymerization, nucleic acid sequence copying and mutation, the \\\"SMILES\\\" chemical notation, and others. The method is implemented in Smoldyn, a spatial and stochastic biochemical simulator, for both the generate-first and on-the-fly expansion, meaning whether the reaction network is generated before or during the simulation.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the potential for acclimatization or adaptation of corals to ocean acidification and even less about the molecular mechanisms underpinning these processes. Here we examine global gene expression patterns in corals and their intracellular algal symbionts from two replicate population pairs in Papua New Guinea that have undergone long-term acclimatization to natural variation in pCO2. In the coral host, only 61 genes were differentially expressed in response to pCO2 environment, but the pattern of change was highly consistent between replicate populations, likely reflecting the core expression homeostasis response to ocean acidification. Functional annotations highlight lipid metabolism and a change in the stress response capacity of corals as a key part of this process. Specifically, constitutive downregulation of molecular chaperones was observed, which may impact response to combined climate-change related stressors. Elevated CO2 has been hypothesized to benefit photosynthetic organisms but expression changes of in hospite Symbiodinium in response to acidification were greater and less consistent among reef populations. This population-specific response suggests hosts may need to adapt not only to an acidified environment, but also to changes in their Symbiodinium populations that may not be consistent among environments. This process adds another challenging dimension to the physiological process of coping with climate change.",

    "abstract": "A functioning gene drive system could fundamentally change our strategies for the control of vector-borne diseases by facilitating rapid dissemination of transgenes that prevent pathogen transmission or reduce vector capacity. CRISPR/Cas9 gene drive promises such a mechanism, which works by converting cells that are heterozygous for the drive construct into homozygotes, thereby enabling super-Mendelian inheritance. Though CRISPR gene drive activity has already been demonstrated, a key obstacle for current systems is their propensity to generate resistance alleles. In this study, we developed two CRISPR gene drive constructs based on the nanos and vasa promoters that allowed us to illuminate the different mechanisms by which resistance alleles are formed in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We observed resistance allele formation at high rates both prior to fertilization in the germline and post-fertilization in the embryo due to maternally deposited Cas9. Assessment of drive activity in genetically diverse backgrounds further revealed substantial differences in conversion efficiency and resistance rates. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of resistance will likely impose a severe limitation to the effectiveness of current CRISPR gene drive approaches, especially when applied to diverse natural populations.",

I have initially developed the programs for the specific problem of selecting training populations for genomic prediction or association problems, therefore I give discussion of the theory behind optimal design of experiments to explain the default optimization criteria in STPGA, and illustrate the use of the programs in this endeavor.

    "abstract": "A signaling pathway transmits information from an upstream system to downstream systems, ideally in a unidirectional fashion. A key obstacle to unidirectional transmission is retroactivity, the additional reaction flux that affects a system once its species interact with those of downstream systems. This raises the fundamental question of whether signaling pathways have developed specialized architectures that overcome retroactivity and transmit unidirectional signals. Here, we propose a general procedure based on mathematical analysis that provides an answer to this question. Using this procedure, we analyze the ability of a variety of signaling architectures to transmit one-way (from upstream to downstream) signals, as key biological parameters are tuned. We find that single stage phosphorylation and phosphotransfer systems that transmit signals from a kinase show a stringent design trade-off that hampers their ability to overcome retroactivity. Interestingly, cascades of these architectures, which are highly represented in nature, can overcome this trade-off and thus enable unidirectional transmission. By contrast, phosphotransfer systems, and single and double phosphorylation cycles that transmit signals from a substrate are unable to mitigate retroactivity effects, even when cascaded, and hence are not well suited for unidirectional information transmission. Our results identify signaling architectures that, allowing unidirectional transmission of signals, embody modular processes that conserve their input/output behavior across multiple contexts. These findings can be used to decompose natural signal transduction networks into modules, and, at the same time, they establish a library of devices that can be used in synthetic biology to facilitate modular circuit design.",

    "abstract": "The dissemination of carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli has major implications for the management of common human infections. blaKPC, encoding a transmissible carbapenemase (KPC), has historically largely been associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, a predominant plasmid (pKpQIL), and a specific transposable element (Tn4401, ~10kb). Here we characterize the genetic features of the emergence of blaKPC in global E. coli, 2008-2013, using both long-and short-read whole genome sequencing.\\n\\nAmongst 43/45 successfully sequenced blaKPC-E. coli strains, we identified high strain (n=21 sequence types, 18% of annotated genes in the core genome); plasmid ([&ge;]9 replicon types); and blaKPC-associated, mobile genetic element (MGE) diversity (50% not within complete Tn4401 elements). We also found evidence of interspecies, regional and international plasmid spread. In several cases blaKPC was found on high copy number, small Col-like plasmids, previously associated with horizontal transmission of resistance genes in the absence of antimicrobial selection pressures.\\n\\nE. coli is a common human pathogen, but also a commensal in a multiple environmental and animal reservoirs, and easily transmissible. The association of blaKPC with a range of MGEs previously linked to the successful spread of widely endemic resistance mechanisms (e.g. blaTEM, blaCTX-M) suggests that it is likely to become similarly prevalent.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged single molecule imaging in live cells requires labels that do not aggregate, have high contrast, and are photo-stable. To address these requirements, we have generated arrays of modular protein domains that function as fluorophore recruitment platforms. ArrayG, a linear repeat of GFP-nanobodies, recruits free monomeric wild-type GFP, which brightens ~15-fold upon binding the array. The fluorogenic ArrayG tag effectively eliminates background fluorescence from free binders, a major impediment to high-throughput acquisition of long trajectories in recruitment based imaging strategies. The photo-stability of ArrayG and consistently low background made it possible to continuously track single integrins for as long as 105 seconds (2100 frames). Prolonged tracking of both kinesin and integrin revealed repeated state-switching events, a measurement capability that is crucial to a mechanistic understanding of complex cellular processes. We also report an orthogonal array tag, based on a DHFR-nanobody, for prolonged dual color imaging of single molecules.",

Intracellularly, ISG15 can be covalently linked and modify the function of target proteins (ISGylation). In addition, free unconjugated ISG15 can be released from cells. We found that ISG15 is released in the serum of Toxoplasma gondii infected mice early after infection in a type-I IFN independent manner. Once in the extracellular space, free ISG15 forms dimers and enhances the release of key cytokines involved in the immune response to the parasite: IL-12, IFN-{gamma}, and IL-1{beta}. Its action is dependent on an actively invading and replicating live parasite. ISG15 induces an increase of IL-1{beta} later during infection by leading to increased IL-1{beta} producing CD8+ dendritic cells at the site of infection. Here, we define for the first time the molecular determinants of active free ISG15 and link ISG15 to IL-1{beta} production by CD8+ dendritic cells. Thus we define ISG15 as a novel secreted modulator of the cytokine response during Toxoplasma infection.",

A 3D ultrastructural reconstruction based on CLEM of in vivo assembled specks revealed a compact network of highly intercrossed filaments, whereas PYD or CARD alone formed filamentous aggregates. The effector caspase is recruited through PYD, whose overexpression induced pyroptosis, but after substantial delay.

    "abstract": "Interleukin 18 (IL18) is known to induce the expression of interferon-{gamma} (IFNG), but its effects on T cell proliferation and costimulation are not completely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of IL18 in CART cells caused significant T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced antitumor effects in xenograft models. Moreover, IL18 mediated T cell expansion required neither tumor antigen nor CAR expression, and produced severe GVHD in NSG mice. Furthermore, recombinant IL18 costimulated IFNG secretion and proliferation of anti-CD3 beads treated T cells. Interestingly, IL18 costimulation could expand purified CD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells. However, CD8 T cells proliferated greater than CD4 T cells in magnitude within bulk T cells, suggesting CD4 help effect was involved. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we confirmed that IL18-driven expansion was both TCR and IL18 receptor (IL18R) dependent. Importantly, we demonstrated that TCR-deficient, IL18-expressing CD19 CART cells exhibited remarkable proliferation and persistent antitumor activity against CD19-expressing tumor cells in vivo, without eliciting any detectable GVHD symptom. Finally, we describe APACHE T cells, a novel strategy for coupling IL18 expression in CART cells to antigen stimulation, thereby limiting potential toxicity associated with persistent IL18 production. In sum, our study supports human IL18 as a T cell costimulatory cytokine for fueling CART therapy.",

To facilitate understanding the building blocks of cognition we incorporate the idea that task-induced functional connectivity modulation with respect to its underlying resting state functional connectivity is task-specific. Here, we introduce a framework incorporating task potency, providing direct access to task-specificity through enabling direct comparison between task paradigms. In particular, to study functional connectivity modulations related to cognitive involvement in a task we define task potency as the amplitude of connectivity modulations away from the brains baseline functional connectivity architecture as observed during a resting state acquisition. We demonstrate the use of our framework by comparing three tasks (visuo-spatial working memory, reward processing, and stop signal task) available within a large cohort. Using task potency, we demonstrate that cognitive operations are supported by a common baseline of within-network interactions, supplemented by connections between large-scale networks in order to solve a specific task.\\n\\nHighlights- Task potency framework defines modulation of functional connectivity away from baseline resting state\\n- More within-than between-network modulations are induced by task performance\\n- Between-network modulations are task-specific\\n- Edges modulated by multiple tasks are mostly within-network\\n- The task potency can be used to define the most potent task",

Not only the local concentration but also duration of morphogen exposure is critical for correct cell fate decisions. Yet, how and when cells temporally integrate signals from a morphogen remains unclear. Here, we use optogenetic manipulation to switch off Bicoid-dependent transcription in the early Drosophila embryo with high temporal resolution, allowing time-specific and reversible manipulation of morphogen signalling. We find that Bicoid transcriptional activity is dispensable for embryonic viability in the first hour after fertilization, but persistently required throughout the rest of the blastoderm stage. Short interruptions of Bicoid activity alter the most anterior cell fate decisions, while prolonged inactivation expands patterning defects from anterior to posterior. Such anterior susceptibility correlates with high reliance of anterior gap gene expression on Bicoid. Therefore, cell fates exposed to higher Bicoid concentration require input for longer duration, demonstrating a previously unknown aspect of morphogen decoding.",

Social learning strategies such as conformity can be broadly adaptive, but may also retard the spread of adaptive innovations. Strategies like payoff-biased learning, in contrast, are effective at diffusing new behaviour but may perform poorly when adaptive behaviour is common. We present a field experiment in a wild primate, Cebus capucinus, that introduced a novel food item and documented the innovation and diffusion of successful extraction techniques. We develop a multilevel, Bayesian statistical analysis that allows us to quantify individual-level evidence for different social and individual learning strategies. We find that payoff-biased social learning and age-biased social learning are primarily responsible for the diffusion of new techniques. We find no evidence of conformity; instead rare techniques receive slightly increased attention. We also find substantial and important variation in individual learning strategies that is patterned by age, with younger individuals being more influenced by both social information and their own individual experience. The aggregate cultural dynamics in turn depend upon the variation in learning strategies and the age structure of the wild population.",

    "abstract": "Cholera emergence is strongly linked to local environmental and ecological context. The 1991-2004 pandemic emerged in Peru and spread north into Ecuadors El Oro province, making this a key site for potential re-emergence. Machala, El Oro, is a port city of 250,000, near the Peruvian border. Many livelihoods depend on the estuarine system, from fishing for subsistence and trade, to domestic water use. In 2014, we conducted biweekly sampling for 10 months in five estuarine locations, across a gradient of human use, and ranging from inland to ocean. We measured water characteristics implicated in V. cholerae growth and persistence: pH, temperature, salinity, and algal concentration, and evaluated samples in five months for pathogenic and non-pathogenic Vibrio cholerae, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found environmental persistence of strains O1 and O139, but no evidence for toxigene presence. V. cholerae presence was coupled to algal and salinity concentration, and sites exhibited considerable seasonal and spatial heterogeneity. This study indicates that environmental conditions in Machala are optimal for human cholera re-emergence, with risk peaking during September, and higher risk near urban periphery low-income communities. This highlights a need for surveillance of this coupled cholera- estuarine system to anticipate potential future outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Cell size, cell growth and the cell cycle are necessarily intertwined to achieve robust bacterial replication. Yet, a comprehensive and integrated view of these fundamental processes is lacking. Here, we describe an image-based quantitative screen of the single-gene knockout collection of Escherichia coli, and identify many new genes involved in cell morphogenesis, population growth, nucleoid (bulk chromosome) dynamics and cell division. Functional analyses, together with high-dimensional classification, unveil new associations of morphological and cell cycle phenotypes with specific functions and pathways. Additionally, correlation analysis across ~4,000 genetic perturbations shows that growth rate is surprisingly not predictive of cell size. Growth rate was also uncorrelated with the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell constriction. Rather, our analysis identifies scaling relationships between cell size and nucleoid size and between nucleoid size and the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell division. These connections suggest that the nucleoid links cell morphogenesis to the cell cycle.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/101832_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (43K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@63d469org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7117org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22a436org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b0167_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genome resequencing have led to increased interest in prediction of the functional consequences of genetic variants. Variants at phylogenetically conserved sites are of particular interest, because they are more likely than variants at phylogenetically variable sites to have deleterious effects on fitness and contribute to phenotypic variation. Numerous comparative genomic approaches have been developed to predict deleterious variants, but the approaches are nearly always assessed based on their ability to identify known disease-causing mutations in humans. Determining the accuracy of deleterious variant predictions in nonhuman species is important to understanding evolution, domestication, and potentially to improving crop quality and yield. To examine our ability to predict deleterious variants in plants we generated a curated database of 2,910 Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with known phenotypes. We evaluated seven approaches and found that while all performed well, their relative ranking differed from prior benchmarks in humans. We conclude that deleterious mutations can be reliably predicted in A. thaliana and likely other plant species, but that the relative performance of various approaches does not necessarily translate from one species to another.",

    "abstract": "The application of 2-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) techniques to measure the dynamics of cellular calcium signals in populations of neurons is an extremely powerful technique for characterizing neural activity within the central nervous system. The use of TPLSM on awake and behaving subjects promises new insights into how neural circuit elements cooperatively interact to form sensory perceptions and generate behavior. A major challenge in imaging such preparations is animal and tissue movement, which leads to shifts in the imagine location (jitter). Although there are surgical and technical approaches to minimize brain motion under these conditions, it is generally unavoidable. The presence of image motion can lead to artifacts, especially since quantification of TPLSM images involves analysis of fluctuations in fluorescence intensities for each neuron, determined from small regions of interest (ROIs) Here, we validated a new motion correction approach to compensate for motion of TPLSM images in the superficial layers of auditory cortex of awake mice. We use a nominally uniform fluorescent signal as a secondary signal to complement the dynamic signals from genetically encoded calcium indicators. We tested motion correction for single plane time lapse imaging a; well as multiplane (i.e. volume) time lapse imaging of cortical tissue. Our procedure of motion compensation relies on locating the brightest neurons and tracking their positions over time using established techniques of particle finding and tracking. The performance of our techniques both for 2D (single plane) and 3D (volume) image sequences is comparable to established techniques in its ability to suppress false neural signals. Object tracking based motion compensation thus offers an alternative approach for motion compensation, one that is we suited for real time feedback control and for analysis of tissue distortions.",

However, germline transmission has been rare following conventional homologous recombination and clonal selection. Here we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target genomic mutations and insertions. We first evaluated utility for directed mutagenesis and recovered clones with biallelic deletions in Lef1. Mutant cells exhibited reduced sensitivity to glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibition during self-renewal. We then generated a non-disruptive knock-in of DsRed at the Sox10 locus. Two clones produced germline chimaeras. Comparative expression of DsRed and Sox10 validated the fidelity of the reporter. To illustrate utility, oligodendrocyte lineage cells were visualised by live imaging of DsRed in neonatal brain slices and subjected to patch clamp recording. Overall these results show that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in germline competent rat ES cells is enabling for in vitro studies and for generating genetically modified rats.",

Tracing the causes of poor water quality back to land-use change is necessary to target catchment management for coastal zone management. However, existing models for tracing the sources of pollution require extensive data-sets which are not available for many of the worlds coral reef regions that may have severe water quality issues. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses freely available satellite data to infer the connection between land-uses in catchments and water clarity in coastal oceans. We apply the model to estimate the influence of land-use change on water clarity in Fiji. We tested the models predictions against underwater surveys, finding that predictions of poor water quality are consistent with observations of high siltation and low coverage of sediment-sensitive coral genera. The model thus provides a means to link land-use change to declines in coastal water quality.",

The Drosophila gene CG13442 encodes a predicted ubiquitin E3 ligase involved in the regulation of tubulin glycylation and glutamylation. Homologous to mammalian MARCH8, CG13442/dMARCH8 is required for male fertility. Sperm in dMARCH8 mutant testes appear to undergo a normal individualization process but fail to be transferred to the seminal vesicle. This phenotype is very similar to that of mutants in the Ntl gene, shown here to be a glycine transporter using a [3H]glycine uptake assay. Mutations in dMARCH8 are associated with a reduction of both polyglutamylation and polyglycylation of sperm tubulin. Polyglutamylation of tubulin is significantly increased in the Ntl- background, and recovers to wild-type levels in the Ntl--dMARCH8- double mutant background, indicating that glycine and glutamate compete for some common site(s) on tubulin molecules in this system. By analogy to the regulation of the mammalian glycine transporter GlyT2 through ubiquitin-mediated trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosome, dMARCH8 may target Ntl and glutamate transporters, or other upstream regulators of these proteins.",

This novel variation extends the pattern of variation catalogued in the 1000 Genomes and Exome Sequencing Projects to a spectrum of populations representing the wide range of West African genomic diversity. These individuals from CAAPA also comprise a large swath of the African Diaspora population and incorporate historical genetic diversity covering nearly the entire Atlantic coast of the Americas. Here we show the results of designing and producing such a microchip array. This novel array covers African specific variation far better than other commercially available arrays, and will enable better GWAS analyses for researchers with individuals of African descent in their study populations. A recent study1 cataloging variation in continental African populations suggests this type of African-specific genotyping array is both necessary and valuable for facilitating large-scale GWAS in populations of African ancestry.",

Limiting the potential for telomere maintenance in cancer cells has been long been proposed as a therapeutic target.

Four independent BRD4 inhibitors blocked telomere elongation, in a dose dependent manner, in mouse cells overexpressing telomerase. Long-term treatment with BRD4 inhibitors caused telomere shortening in both mouse and human cells, suggesting BRD4 plays a role in telomere maintenance in vivo. Telomerase enzymatic activity was not directly affected by BRD4 inhibition. BRD4 is in clinical trials for a number of cancers, but its effects on telomere maintenance have not been previously reported investigated.",

The efficient degradation of sphingolipids in the lysosome requires lipid-binding saposin proteins and hydrolytic enzymes.

This enzyme requires the saposin SapA for lipid processing and defects in either of these proteins causes a severe neurodegenerative disorder, Krabbe disease. Here we present the structure of a glycosphingolipid-processing complex, revealing how SapA and GALC form a heterotetramer with an open channel connecting the enzyme active site to the SapA hydrophobic cavity. This structure defines how a soluble hydrolase can cleave the polar glycosyl headgroups of these essential lipids from their hydrophobic ceramide tails. Furthermore, the molecular details of this interaction reveal how specificity of saposin binding to hydrolases is encoded.",

The meeting included neuroimaging experts (clinical and non-clinical), computer scientists, epidemiologists, clinicians, ethicists, and lawyers involved in creating brain image banks. The meeting followed a structured format to discuss current and emerging brain image banks; applications such as atlases; conceptual and statistical problems (e.g. defining  normality); legal, ethical and technological issues (e.g. consents, potential for data linkage, data security, harmonisation, data storage and enabling of research data sharing). We summarise the lessons learned from the experiences of a wide range of individual image banks, and provide practical recommendations to enhance creation, use and reuse of neuroimaging data. Our aim is to maximise the benefit of the image data, provided voluntarily by research participants and funded by many organisations, for human health.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn editorial expression of concern (EEoC) is issued by editors or publishers to draw attention to potential problems in a publication, without itself constituting a retraction or correction.\\n\\nMethodsWe searched PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Google Scholar to identify EEoCs issued for publications in PubMed and PMC up to 22 August 2016. We also searched the archives of the Retraction Watch blog, some journal and publisher websites, and studies of EEoCs. In addition, we searched for retractions of EEoCs and affected articles in PubMed up to 8 December 2016. We analyzed overall historical trends, as well as reported reasons and subsequent editorial actions related to EEoCs issued between August 2014 and August 2016.\\n\\nResultsAfter screening 5,076 records, we identified 230 EEoCs that affect 300 publications indexed in PubMed, the earliest issued in 1985. Half of the primary EEoCs were issued between 2014 and 2016 (52%). We found evidence of some EEoCs that had been removed by the publisher without leaving a record and some were not submitted for PubMed or PMC indexing. A minority of publications affected by EEoCs had been retracted by early December 2016 (25%). For the subset of 92 EEoCs issued between August 2014 and August 2016, affecting 99 publications, the rate of retraction was similar (29%). The majority of EEoCs were issued because of concerns with validity of data, methods, or interpretation of the publication (68%), and 31% of cases remained open. Issues with images were raised in 40% of affected publications. Ongoing monitoring after the study identified another 17 EEoCs to years end in 2016, increasing the number of EEoCs to 247 and publications in PubMed known to be affected by EEoCs to 320 at the end of 2016.\\n\\nConclusionsEEoCs have been rare publishing events in the biomedical literature, but their use has been increasing. Most have not led to retractions, and many remain unresolved. Lack of prominence and inconsistencies in management of EEoCs reduce the ability of these notices to alert the scientific community to potentially serious problems in publications. EEoCs will be made identifiable in PubMed in 2017.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, life-science research has become increasingly data-intensive and computational. Nevertheless, basic bioinformatics and data stewardship are still only rarely taught in life-science degree programmes, creating a widening skills gap that spans educational levels and career roles. To better understand this situation, we ran surveys to determine how the skills dearth is affecting the need for bioinformatics training worldwide. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that respondents wanted more short courses to help boost their expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation. However, it was evident that most respondents appreciated their need for training only after designing their experiments and collecting their data. This is clearly rather late in the research workflow, and suboptimal from a training perspective, as skills acquired to address a specific need at a particular time are seldom retained, engendering a cycle of low confidence in trainees. To ensure that such skill gaps do not continue to create barriers to the progress of research, we argue that universities should strive to bring their life-science curricula into the digital-data era. Meanwhile, the demand for point-of-need training in bioinformatics and data stewardship will grow. While this situation persists, international groups like GOBLET are increasing their efforts to enlarge the community of trainers and quench the global thirst for bioinformatics training.",
