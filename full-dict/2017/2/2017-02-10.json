    "abstract": "We report the discovery of a neo-sex chromosome in Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, and several of its close relatives. Z-linked scaffolds in the D. plexippus genome assembly were identified via sex-specific differences in Illumina sequencing coverage. Additionally, a majority of the D. plexippus genome assembly was assigned to chromosomes based on counts of 1-to-1 orthologs relative to the butterfly Melitaea cinxia (with replication using two other lepidopteran species), in which genome scaffolds have been mapped to linkage groups. Sequencing-coverage based assessments of Z-linkage combined with homology based chromosomal assignments provided strong evidence for a Z-autosome fusion in the Danaus lineage, involving the autosome homologous to chromosome 21 in M. cinxia. Coverage analysis also identified three notable assembly errors resulting in chimeric Z-autosome scaffolds. Cytogenetic analysis further revealed a large W-chromosome that is partially euchromatic, consistent with being a neo-W chromosome. The discovery of a neo-Z and the provisional assignment of chromosome linkage for >90% of D. plexippus genes lays the foundation for novel insights concerning sex chromosome evolution in this female-heterogametic model species for functional and evolutionary genomics.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic axis extension is a complex multi-tissue morphogenetic process responsible for the formation of the posterior part of the amniote body. Cells located in the caudal part of the embryo divide and rearrange to participate in the elongation of the different embryonic tissues (e.g. neural tube, axial and paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate, ectoderm, endoderm). We previously identified the paraxial mesoderm as a crucial player of axis elongation, but how movements and growth are coordinated between the different posterior tissues to drive morphogenesis remain largely unknown. Here we use the quail embryo as a model system to quantify cell behavior and movements in the various tissues of the elongating embryo. We first quantify the tissue-specific contribution to axis elongation by using 3D volumetric techniques, then quantify tissue-specific parameters such as cell density and proliferation at different embryonic stages. To be able to study cell behavior at a multi-tissue scale we used high-resolution 4D imaging of transgenic quail embryos expressing constitutively expressed fluorescent proteins. We developed specific tracking and image analysis techniques to analyze cell motion and compute tissue deformations in 4D. This analysis reveals extensive sliding between tissues during axis extension. Further quantification of \\\"tissue tectonics\\\" showed patterns of rotations, contractions and expansions, which are coherent with the multi-tissue behavior observed previously. Our results confirm the central role of the PSM in axis extension; we propose that the PSM specific cell proliferation and migration programs control the coordination of elongation between tissues during axis extension.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is an abundant environmental bacterium that can efficiently colonize the intestinal tract and trigger severe diarrheal illness. Motility, and the production of colonization factors and cholera toxin, are fundamental for the establishment of disease. In the aquatic environment, V. cholerae persists by forming avirulent biofilms on zooplankton, phytoplankton and chitin debris. Here, we describe the formation of artificial, biofilm-like communities, driven by exposure of planktonic bacteria to synthetic polymers. This recruitment is extremely rapid and charge-driven, and leads to the formation of initial \\\"seed clusters\\\" which then recruit additional bacteria to extend in size. Bacteria that become entrapped in these \\\"forced communities\\\" undergo transcriptional changes in motility and virulence genes, and phenotypically mimic features of environmental biofilm communities by forming a matrix that contains polysaccharide and extracellular DNA. As a result of this lifestyle transition, pathogenicity and in vivo host colonization decrease. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic polymers to disarm pathogens by modulating their lifestyle, without creating selective pressure favoring the emergence of antimicrobial resistant strains.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum invades human red blood cells by a series of interactions between host and parasite surface proteins. Here we analyse whole genome sequence data from worldwide human populations, including 765 new genomes from across sub-Saharan Africa, and identify a diverse array of large copy number variants affecting the host invasion receptor genes GYPA and GYPB. We find that a nearby reported association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural variant that involves the loss of GYPB and gain of two hybrid genes, each with a GYPB extracellular domain and GYPA intracellular domain. This variant reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently risen in frequency in parts of Kenya. We show that the structural variant encodes the Dantu blood group antigen, and therefore a serologically distinct red cell phenotype. These findings demonstrate that structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors is associated with natural resistance to P. falciparum malaria.",

    "abstract": "Summary StatementHomeostatic interactions between muscle stem cells and fibres during myogenesis ensure the correct muscle size is formed independent of fibre number in zebrafish\\n\\nAbstractBalancing the number of stem cells and their progeny is crucial for tissue development and repair. Here we examine how muscle stem/precursor cell (MPC) numbers are tightly regulated during zebrafish somitic muscle development. MPCs expressing Pax7 are initially located in the dermomyotome (DM) external cell layer, adopt a highly stereotypical distribution and thereafter a proportion of MPCs migrate into the myotome. Regional variations in the proliferation and terminal differentiation of MPCs contribute to growth of the myotome. To probe the robustness of spatiotemporal regulation of MPCs, we compared the behaviour of wild type (wt) MPCs with those in mutant zebrafish that lack the muscle regulatory factor Myod. Myodfh261 mutants form one third fewer multinucleate fast muscle fibres than wt and show a significant expansion of the Pax7+ MPC population in the DM. Subsequently, myodfh261 mutant fibres generate more cytoplasm per nucleus, leading to recovery of muscle bulk. In addition, relative to wt siblings, there is an increased number of MPCs in myodfh261 mutants and these migrate prematurely into the myotome, differentiate and contribute to the hypertrophy of existing fibres. Thus, homeostatic reduction of the excess MPCs returns their number to normal levels, but fibre numbers remain low. The GSK3 antagonist BIO prevents MPC migration into the deep myotome, suggesting that canonical Wnt pathway activation maintains the DM in zebrafish, as in amniotes. BIO does not, however, block recovery of the myodfh261 mutant myotome, indicating that homeostasis acts on fibre intrinsic growth to maintain muscle bulk. The findings suggest the existence of a critical window for early fast fibre formation followed by a period in which homeostatic mechanisms regulate myotome growth by controlling fibre size.",

    "abstract": "Cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs) are responsible for significant cassava yield losses in eastern sub-Saharan Africa. In the present work, we inoculated CBSV-susceptible and -resistant cassava varieties with a mixed infection of CBSVs using top-cleft grafting. Virus titres in grafted scions were monitored in a time course experiment in both varieties. We performed RNA-seq of the two cassava varieties at the earliest time-point of full infection in the susceptible scions. Genes encoding proteins in RNA silencing and salicylic acid pathways were regulated in the susceptible cassava variety but transcriptional changes were limited in the resistant variety. After infection, genes related to callose deposition at plasmodesmata were regulated and callose deposition was significantly reduced in the susceptible cassava variety. We also show that {beta}-1,3-glucanase enzymatic activity is differentially regulated in the susceptible and resistant varieties. The differences in transcriptional responses to CBSV infection indicate that resistance involves callose deposition at plasmodesmata but does not trigger typical anti-viral defence responses. A meta-analysis of the current RNA-seq dataset and selected, previously reported, host-potyvirus and virus-cassava RNA-seq datasets revealed comparable host responses across pathosystems only at similar time points after infection or infection of a common host.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTOur results suggest that resistance to CBSV in cassava involves callose deposition at the plasmodesmata and our meta-analysis of multiple virus-crop RNA-seq studies suggests that conserved responses across different host-virus systems are limited and depend greatly on time after infection.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific diversity informs the demographic and evolutionary histories of populations, and should be a main conservation target. Although approaches exist for identifying relevant biological conservation units, attempts to identify priority conservation areas for intraspecific diversity are scarce, especially within a multi-specific framework. We used neutral molecular data on six European freshwater fish species (Squalius cephalus, Phoxinus phoxinus, Barbatula barbatula, Gobio occitaniae, Leuciscus burdigalensis and Parachondrostoma toxostoma) sampled at the riverscape scale (i.e. the Garonne-Dordogne River basin, France) to determine hot- and cold-spots of genetic diversity, and to identify priority conservation areas using a systematic conservation planning approach. We demonstrate that systematic conservation planning is efficient for identifying priority areas representing a predefined part of the total genetic diversity of a whole landscape. With the exception of private allelic richness, classical genetic diversity indices (allelic richness, genetic uniqueness) were poor predictors for identifying priority areas. Moreover, we identified weak surrogacies among conservation solutions found for each species, implying that conservation solutions are highly species-specific. Nonetheless, we showed that priority areas identified using intraspecific genetic data from multiple species provide more effective conservation solutions than areas identified for single species or on the basis of traditional taxonomic criteria.",

Although transport, concentration, and detection of target molecules have been demonstrated, controllability of transport directions is still a major challenge. To define multiple moving directions for selective molecular transport, we integrated the bottom-up molecular design of microtubules and the top-down design of a microfluidic device. The surface charge density and stiffness of microtubules were controlled, allowing us to create three different types of microtubules with different gliding directions corresponding to their electrical and mechanical properties. The measured curvature of gliding microtubules enabled us to optimize the size and design of the device for molecular sorting in a top-down approach. The integrated bottom-up and top-down design achieved separation of stiff microtubules from negatively-charged soft microtubules with approximately 80% efficiency under an electric field. Our method is the first to sort multiple microtubules by integrating molecular control and microfluidic device design, and is applicable to multiplexed molecular sorters.",

    "abstract": "The number of times an organism reproduces (i.e. its mode of parity) is a fundamental life-history character, and evolutionary and ecological models that compare the relative fitness of strategies are common in life history theory and theoretical biology. Despite the success of mathematical models designed to compare intrinsic rates of increase between annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous reproductive schedules, there is widespread evidence that variation in reproductive allocation among semelparous and iteroparous organisms alike is continuous. This paper reviews the ecological and molecular evidence for the continuity and plasticity of modes of parity--that is, the idea that annual-semelparous and perennial-iteroparous life histories are better understood as endpoints along a continuum of possible strategies. I conclude that parity should be understood as a continuum of different modes of parity, which differ by the degree to which they disperse or concentrate reproductive effort in time. I further argue that there are three main implications of this conclusion: (1) That seasonality should not be conflated with parity; (2) that mathematical models purporting to explain the evolution of semelparous life histories from iteroparous ones (or vice versa) should not assume that organisms can only display either an annual-semelparous life history or a perennial-iteroparous one; and (3) that evolutionary ecologists should examine the physiological or molecular basis of traits underlying different modes of parity, in order to obtain a general understanding of how different life history strategies can evolve from one another.",

We assessed essential gene function in a Cas9-inducible human B-cell lymphoma cell line using an extended knockout (EKO) library of 278,754 sgRNAs that targeted 19,084 RefSeq genes, 20,852 alternatively-spliced exons and 3,872 hypothetical genes. A new statistical analysis tool called RANKS identified 2,280 essential genes, 234 of which had not been reported previously. Essential genes exhibited a bimodal distribution across 10 cell lines screened in different studies, consistent with a continuous variation in essentiality as a function of cell type. Genes essential in more lines were associated with more severe fitness defects and encoded the evolutionarily conserved structural cores of protein complexes. Genes essential in fewer lines tended to form context-specific modules and encode subunits at the periphery of essential complexes. The essentiality of individual protein residues across the proteome correlated with evolutionary conservation, structural burial, modular domains, and protein interaction interfaces. Many alternatively-spliced exons in essential genes were dispensable and tended to encode disordered regions. We also detected a significant fitness defect for 44 newly evolved hypothetical reading frames. These results illuminate the nature and evolution of essential gene functions in human cells.",

Living cells integrate extremely robust circuits that exhibit significant heterogeneity, but still respond to external stimuli in predictable ways. This phenomenon allows us to introduce a network inference methodology that integrates measurements of protein activation from perturbation experiments. The methodology relies on logic-based networks to provide a predictive approximation of the transfer of signals in a network. The approach presented was validated in silico with a set of test networks and applied to investigate the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling of a breast epithelial cell line, MFC10A. In our analysis, we predict the potential signaling circuitry most likely responsible for the experimental readouts of several proteins in the mitogen activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways.

We found that conotoxin gene superfamilies are composed of 1-6 exons and adjacent noncoding regions are not enriched for simple repetitive elements. Additionally, we provided further evidence for several genetic factors shaping venom composition in cone snails, including positive selection, extensive gene turnover, expression regulation, and potentially, presence-absence variation. Using comparative phylogenetic methods, we found that while diet specificity did not predict patterns of conotoxin gene superfamily size evolution, dietary breadth was positively correlated with total conotoxin gene diversity. These results continue to emphasize the importance of dietary breadth in shaping venom evolution, an underappreciated ecological correlate in venom biology. Finally, the targeted sequencing technique demonstrated here has the potential to radically increase the pace at which venom gene families are sequenced and studied, reshaping our ability to understand the impact of genetic changes on ecologically relevant phenotypes and subsequent diversification.",

    "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing and informatics have revolutionised biology over the past four decades, but technological limitations have left many applications unexplored1,2. Recently, portable, real-time, nanopore sequencing (RTnS) has become available. This offers opportunities to rapidly collect and analyse genomic data anywhere3-5. However, the generation of datasets from large, complex genomes has been constrained to laboratories6,7. The portability and long DNA sequences of RTnS offer great potential for field-based species identification, but the feasibility and accuracy of these technologies for this purpose have not been assessed. Here, we show that a field-based RTnS analysis of closely-related plant species (Arabidopsis spp.)8 has many advantages over laboratory-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods for species level identification-by-sequencing and de novo phylogenomics. Samples were collected and sequenced in a single day by RTnS using a portable, \\\"al fresco\\\" laboratory. Our analyses demonstrate that correctly identifying unknown reads from matches to a reference database with RTnS reads enables rapid and confident species identification. Individually annotated RTnS reads can be used to infer the evolutionary relationships of A. thaliana. Furthermore, hybrid genome assembly with RTnS and HTS reads substantially improved upon a genome assembled from HTS reads alone. Field-based RTnS makes real-time, rapid specimen identification and genome wide analyses possible. These technological advances are set to revolutionise research in the biological sciences9 and have broad implications for conservation, taxonomy, border agencies and citizen science.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors prevent neural cell death in in vivo models of cerebral ischaemia, brain injury and neurodegenerative disease. One mechanism by which HDAC inhibitors may do this is by suppressing the excessive inflammatory response of chronically activated microglia. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this anti-inflammatory effect and the specific HDAC responsible are not fully understood. Recent data from in vivo rodent studies has shown that inhibition of class I HDACs suppresses neuroinflammation and is neuroprotective. In our study we have identified that selective HDAC inhibition with inhibitors apicidin, MS-275 or MI-192, or specific knockdown of HDAC1 or 2 using siRNA, suppresses the expression of cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in BV2 murine microglia activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, we found that in the absence of HDAC1, HDAC2 is upregulated and these increased levels are compensatory, suggesting these two HDACs have redundancy in regulating the inflammatory response of microglia. Investigating the possible underlying anti-inflammatory mechanisms suggests an increase in protein expression is not important. Taken together, this study supports the idea that inhibitors selective towards HDAC1 or HDAC2, may be therapeutically useful for targeting neuroinflammation in brain injuries and neurodegenerative disease.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe number of patients suffering a stroke or a neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimers is increasing These conditions are severely debilitating and are leading causes of mortality, with neural cell death and loss of brain tissue being a major feature. A number of mechanisms contribute to neuronal death, including inflammation in the brain, but we still lack clinical therapies to inhibit this. The work presented here provides further insight into potential molecular therapeutic targets called histone deacetylases (HDACs), which are thought to contribute to neural cell death by promoting inflammation. We show that down regulation of HDAC1 and 2 is sufficient to reduce this inflammatory response. Our findings have clinical relevance because they identify HDAC1 and 2 as promising targets for therapy.",

    "abstract": "I.Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have proven to be a powerful tool to identify genes associated with human diseases by aggregating cis-regulatory effects on gene expression. However, TWAS relies on building predictive models of gene expression, which are sensitive to the sample size and tissue on which they are trained. The Gene Tissue Expression Project has produced reference transcriptomes across 53 human tissues and cell types; however, the data is highly sparse, making it difficult to build polygenic models in relevant tissues for TWAS. Here, we propose fQTL, a multi-tissue, multivariate model for mapping expression quantitative trait loci and predicting gene expression. Our model decomposes eQTL effects into SNP-specific and tissue-specific components, pooling information across relevant tissues to effectively boost sample sizes. In simulation, we demonstrate that our multi-tissue approach outperforms single-tissue approaches in identifying causal eQTLs and tissues of action. Using our method, we fit polygenic models for 13,461 genes, characterized the tissue-specificity of the learned cis-eQTLs, and performed TWAS for Alzheimers disease and schizophrenia, identifying 107 and 382 associated genes, respectively.",

The framework reduces dramatically storage requirements for connectome evaluation methods, with up to 40x compression factors.

    "abstract": "Nicotine, the signature alkaloid of Nicotiana species responsible for the addictive properties of human tobacco smoking, functions as a defensive neurotoxin against attacking herbivores. However, the evolution of the genetic features that contributed to the assembly of the nicotine biosynthetic pathway remains unknown. We sequenced and assembled genomes of two wild tobaccos, Nicotiana attenuata (2.5 Gb) and N. obtusifolia (1.5 Gb), two ecological models for investigating adaptive traits in nature. We show that after the Solanaceae whole genome triplication event, a repertoire of rapidly expanding transposable elements (TEs) bloated these Nicotiana genomes, promoted expression divergences among duplicated genes and contributed to the evolution of herbivory-induced signaling and defenses, including nicotine biosynthesis. The biosynthetic machinery that allows for nicotine synthesis in the roots evolved from the stepwise duplications of two ancient primary metabolic pathways: the polyamine and nicotinic acid dinucleotide (NAD) pathways. While the duplication of the former is shared among several Solanaceous genera which produce polyamine-derived tropane alkaloids, the innovation and efficient production of nicotine in the genus Nicotiana required lineage-specific duplications within the NAD pathway and the evolution of root-specific expression of the duplicated Solanaceae-specific ethylene response factor (ERF) that activates the expression of all nicotine biosynthetic genes. Furthermore, TE insertions that incorporated transcription factor binding motifs also likely contributed to the coordinated metabolic flux of the nicotine biosynthetic pathway. Together, these results provide evidence that TEs and gene duplications facilitated the emergence of a key metabolic innovation relevant to plant fitness.",

Understanding how such forces are mechanically converted into cell shape changes is essential to our understanding of morphogenesis. Here we use Myosin II pulsatile activity during Drosophila embryogenesis to study how transient forces generate irreversible cell shape changes. Analyzing the dynamics of junction shortening and elongation resulting from Myosin II pulses, we find that long pulses yield less reversible deformations, typically a signature of dissipative mechanics. This is consistent with a simple viscoelastic description, which we use to model individual shortening and elongation events. The model predicts that dissipation typically occurs on the minute timescale, a timescale commensurate with that of force generation by Myosin II pulses. We test this estimate by applying time-controlled forces on junctions with optical tweezers. Our results argue that active junctional deformation is stabilized by dissipation. Hence, tissue morphogenesis requires coordination between force generation and dissipation.",

    "abstract": "Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants probability of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions time, but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a \\\"stochastic satisficing\\\" (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen options thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence. We further tested and verified the predictions of this model in a second experiment. Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions. Finally, we discuss how the stochastic satisficing account of decision confidence serves psychological and social purposes associated with the evaluation, communication and justification of decision-making.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEvery day we make several choices under uncertainty, like choosing a queue in a supermarket. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such decisions remain unknown. For example, how does one choose between an option with unreliable high expected reward, like the volatile express queue, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward in the standard queue? Inspired by bounded rationality and the notion of  satisficing, i.e. settling for a good enough option, we propose that such decisions are made by comparing the likelihood of different actions to surpass an acceptability threshold. When facing uncertain decisions, our participants confidence ratings were not consistent with the expected outcomes rewards, but instead followed the satisficing heuristic proposed here. Using an acceptability threshold may be especially useful when evaluating and justifying decisions under uncertainty.",

We show that C. elegans changes how it processes sensory information according to the oxygen environment it experienced recently. C.elegans acclimated to 7% O2 are aroused by CO2 and repelled by pheromones that attract animals acclimated to 21% O2. This behavioral plasticity arises from prolonged activity differences in a circuit that continuously signals O2 levels. A sustained change in the activity of O2 sensing neurons reprograms the properties of their post-synaptic partners, the RMG hub interneurons. RMG is gap-junctionally coupled to the ASK and ADL pheromone sensors that respectively drive pheromone attraction and repulsion. Prior O2 experience has opposite effects on the pheromone responsiveness of these neurons. These circuit changes provide a physiological correlate of altered pheromone valence. Our results suggest C. elegans stores a memory of recent O2 experience in the RMG circuit and illustrate how a circuit is flexibly sculpted to guide behavioral decisions in a context-dependent manner.",

Hybridization can spur adaptive radiations3, transfer adaptive variation across species boundaries4, and generate species with novel niches5. Yet, the limits to viable hybrid genome formation are poorly understood. Here we investigated to what extent hybrid genomes are free to evolve or whether they are restricted to a specific combination of parental alleles by sequencing the genomes of four isolated island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae6,7. Based on 61 Italian sparrow genomes from Crete, Corsica, Sicily and Malta, and 10 genomes of each of the parent species P. domesticus and P. hispaniolensis, we report that a variety of novel and fully functional hybrid genomic combinations have arisen on the different islands, with differentiation in candidate genes for beak shape and plumage colour. There are limits to successful genome fusion, however, as certain genomic regions are invariably inherited from the same parent species. These regions are overrepresented on the Z-chromosome and harbour candidate incompatibility loci, including DNA-repair and mito-nuclear genes; loci that may drive the general reduction of introgression on sex chromosomes8. Our findings demonstrate that hybridization is a potent process for generating novel variation, but variation is limited by DNA-repair and mito-nuclear genes, which play an important role in reproductive isolation and thus contribute to speciation.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a potent evolutionary force. Though additive genetic variation and novel combinations of parental genes theoretically increase the potential for hybrid species to adapt, few empirical studies have investigated the adaptive potential within a hybrid species. Here, we investigate factors promoting phenotypic divergence using genomically diverged island populations of the homoploid hybrid Italian sparrow Passer italiae from Crete, Corsica, and Sicily. We address whether genomic contingencies, adaptation to climate or diet best explain divergence in beak morphology. Populations vary significantly in beak morphology, both between and within islands of origin. Temperature seasonality best explains population divergence in beak size. Interestingly, beak shape along all significant dimensions of variation was best explained by annual precipitation, genomic composition and their interaction, suggesting a role for contingencies. Moreover, beak shape similarity to a parent species correlates with proportion of the genome inherited from that species, consistent with the presence of contingencies. In conclusion, adaptation to local conditions and genomic contingencies arising from putatively independent hybridization events jointly explain beak morphology in the Italian sparrow. Hence, hybridization may induce contingencies and restrict evolution in certain directions dependent on the genetic background.",

    "abstract": "Both gene expression levels and eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) are partially tissue-specific, complicating the detection of eQTLs in tissues with limited sample availability, such as the brain. However, eQTL overlap between tissues might be non-trivial, allowing for inference of eQTL functioning in the brain via eQTLs measured in readily accessible tissues, e.g. whole blood. Using Stratified Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (SLDSR), we quantify the enrichment in GWAS signal of blood and brain eQTLs in genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 11 complex traits (schizophrenia, BMI, educational attainment, Crohns disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, age at menarche, coronary artery disease, height, LDL levels, and smoking behavior). Our analyses established significant enrichment of blood and brain eQTLs in their effects across all traits. As we do not know the true number of causal eQTLs, it is difficult to determine the precise magnitude of enrichment. We found no evidence for tissue-specific enrichment in GWAS signal for either eQTLs uniquely seen in the brain or whole blood. To follow up on our findings, we tested tissue-specific enrichment of eQTLs discovered in 44 tissues by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium, and, again, found no tissue-specific eQTL effects. We further integrated the GTEx eQTLs with SNPs associated with tissue-specific histone modifiers, and interrogate its effect on rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia. We observed substantially enriched effects on schizophrenia, though again not tissue-specific. Finally, we extracted eQTLs in tissue-specific differentially expressed genes, and determined their effects on rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia. We conclude that, while eQTLs are strongly enriched in GWAS signal, the enrichment is not specific to the tissue used in eQTL discovery. Therefore, working with relatively accessible tissues, such as whole blood, as proxy for eQTL discovery is sensible; and restricting lookups for GWAS hits to a specific tissue might not be advisable.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells take a variable lag time and maintain a multi-drug tolerant non-growing state before resuming growth when encountering growth-supportive conditions. Some of them exhibit an extraordinarily long lag, as pathogenic persisters do. It remains unknown on what determines lag time duration. Here, we unveiled a subcellular structure, termed quiescent body, that is formed in bacterial cells entering non-growing state and sequesters selected proteins essential for cell growth. Their formation occurs progressively in each cell and heterogeneously among individual cells. They only dissolve in re-growing cells to release proteins for immediate re-functioning when conditions become fit. Quiescent body, whose degree of formation is highly correlated with duration of lag time or level of antibiotic tolerance, apparently functions as a biological timer for bacterial growth resumption. Further, suppressing their formation, which directly relies on cellular respiration complexes, or promoting their dissolution might be a viable strategy to eradicate persisters.",

    "abstract": "Seed systems have an important role in the distribution of high quality seed and improved varieties. The structure of seed networks also helps to determine the epidemiological risk for seedborne disease. We present a new method for evaluating the epidemiological role of nodes in seed networks, and apply it to a regional potato farmer consortium (CONPAPA) in Ecuador. We surveyed farmers to estimate the structure of networks of farmer seed tuber and ware potato transactions, and farmer information sources about pest and disease management. Then we simulated pathogen spread through seed transaction networks to identify priority nodes for disease detection. The likelihood of pathogen establishment was weighted based on the quality and/or quantity of information sources about disease management. CONPAPA staff and facilities, a market, and certain farms are priorities for disease management interventions, such as training, monitoring and variety dissemination. Advice from agrochemical store staff was common but assessed as significantly less reliable. Farmer access to information (reported number and quality of sources) was similar for both genders. Women had a smaller amount of the market share for seed-tubers and ware potato, however. Understanding seed system networks provides input for scenario analyses to evaluate potential system improvements.",

    "abstract": "Seed systems are critical for deployment of improved varieties, but also serve as major conduits for the spread of seed-borne pathogens. We evaluated the structure of an informal sweetpotato seed system for its vulnerability to the spread of epidemics, and its utility for disseminating improved varieties. During the 2014 growing season, vine sellers were surveyed weekly in the Gulu Region of Northern Uganda. Our analysis draws on tools from network theory to evaluate the potential for epidemic spread in this region. Using empirical seed transaction data and estimated spatial spread, we constructed a network of seed and pathogen movement. We modeled the introduction of a pathogen, and evaluated the influence of both epidemic starting point and quarantine treatments on epidemic progress. Quarantine of 30 out of 99 villages reduced epidemic progress by up to 66%, when compared to the control (no quarantine), over 20 time steps. The starting position in the network was critical for epidemic progress and final epidemic outcomes, and influenced the percent control conferred by quarantine treatments. Considering equal likelihood of any node being an introduction point for a new epidemic, villages of particular utility for disease monitoring were identified. Sensitivity analysis identified important parameters and priorities for future data collection. The efficacy of node degree, closeness, and eigenvector centrality was similar for selecting quarantine locations, while betweenness had more limited utility. This analysis framework can be applied to provide recommendations for a wide variety of seed systems.",

Our approach used the Maxwell(R) 16 LEV simplyRNA Tissue Kit and GoTaq(R) 2-Step RT-qPCR System for gene expression analysis from single neurons of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, a model system to study the generation of rhythmic motor patterns. We used double-stranded RNA to knockdown expression of a putative neuromodulator-activated sodium channel. We then examined the electrophysiological responses to known neuromodulators and confirmed that the response was reduced. Finally, we measured how mRNA levels of several ion channel genes changed in response. Our results provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the generation and modulation of rhythmic motor patterns.",

    "abstract": "Understanding mechanosensation and other sensory behavior in genetic model systems such as C. elegans is relevant to many human diseases. These studies conventionally require immobilization by glue and manual delivery of stimuli, leading to low experimental throughput and high variability. Here we present a microfluidic platform that delivers precise mechanical stimuli robustly. The system can be easily used in conjunction with functional imaging and optical interrogation techniques, as well as other capabilities such as sorting or more sophisticated fluid delivery schemes. The platform is fully automated, thereby greatly enhancing the throughput and robustness of experiments. We show that behavior of the well-known gentle and harsh touch neurons and their receptive fields can be recapitulated in our system. Using calcium dynamics as a readout, we demonstrate the ability to perform a drug screen in vivo. Furthermore, using an integrated chip platform that can deliver both mechanical and chemical stimuli, we examine sensory integration in interneurons in response to multimodal sensory inputs. We envision that this system will be able to greatly accelerate the discovery of genes and molecules involved in mechanosensation and multimodal sensory behavior, as well as the discovery of therapeutics for related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture first reached the Iberian Peninsula around 5700 BCE. However, little is known about the genetic structure and changes of prehistoric populations in different geographic areas of Iberia. In our study, we focused on the maternal genetic makeup of the Neolithic ([~] 5500-3000 BCE), Chalcolithic ([~] 3000-2200 BCE) and Early Bronze Age ([~] 2200-1500 BCE). We report ancient mitochondrial DNA results of 213 individuals (151 HVS-I sequences) from the northeast, central, southeast and southwest regions and thus on the largest archaeogenetic dataset from the Peninsula to date. Similar to other parts of Europe, we observe a discontinuity between hunter-gatherers and the first farmers of the Neolithic. During the subsequent periods, we detect regional continuity of Early Neolithic lineages across Iberia, however the genetic contribution of hunter-gatherers is generally higher than in other parts of Europe and varies regionally. In contrast to ancient DNA findings from Central Europe, we do not observe a major turnover in the mtDNA record of the Iberian Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, suggesting that the population history of the Iberian Peninsula is distinct in character.",

    "abstract": "The geographic pattern of cropland is an important risk factor for invasion and saturation by crop-specific pathogens and arthropods. Understanding cropland networks supports smart pest sampling and mitigation strategies. We evaluate global networks of cropland connectivity for key vegetatively-propagated crops (banana and plantain, cassava, potato, sweetpotato, and yam) important for food security in the tropics. For each crop, potential movement between geographic location pairs was evaluated using a gravity model, with associated uncertainty quantification. The highly-linked hub and bridge locations in cropland connectivity risk maps are likely priorities for surveillance and management, and for tracing intra-region movement of pathogens and pests. Important locations are identified beyond those locations that simply have high crop density. Cropland connectivity risk maps provide a new risk component for integration with other factors - such as climatic suitability, genetic resistance, and trade routes - to inform Pest Risk Assessment and mitigation.",
