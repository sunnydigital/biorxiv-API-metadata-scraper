    "abstract": "We propose a new readout architecture for echo state networks where multiple linear readout modules are activated at distinct time points to varying degrees by a separate controller module. The controller module, like the reservoir of the echo state network, can be initialized randomly. All linear readout modules are trained through simple linear regression, which is the only adaptive step in the modified algorithm. The resulting architecture provides modest improvements on a variety of time series processing tasks (between 5 to 50% in performance metric depending on the task studied). The novel architecture is guaranteed to perform at least as accurately as a conventional linear readout. It can be utilized as a general purpose readout method when augmentations to performance relative to the standard method is needed.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Tp, 07.05.Mh",

    "abstract": "1In a novel approach to diagnose Obstructive Sleep Apnea, electronic components, such as an Arduino Mega, a Bluetooth Transceiver, an accelerometer, and a air-quality sensor, were put together to create a wearable that would detect the frequency of apnea events, detect and diagnose the disorder, and sound an alarm when necessary. A primary consideration was to make the mechanism accessible and affordable, and in doing so, lower the cases of Obstructive Sleep Apnea that go undiagnosed due to the cost and inconvenience associated with the traditional diagnosis method--a Polysomnogram. Bluetooth capability was an additional consideration so that the device would transmit data directly to an android smartphone, eliminating the need for an additional output mechanism. The total cost of the device, quite surprisingly, did not exceed $30, and therein rendered the device an accessible, affordable mechanism for diagnosis. Tests of the device on diagnosed patients yielded data consistent with the diagnosis, with a few false positives as a result of the excessive sensitivity of the sensors.",

    "abstract": "The search for biomarkers has been one of the leading endeavors in biological psychiatry; nevertheless, in spite of hundreds of publications, it has yet to make an impact in clinical practice. To study how biomarker research has progressed over the years, we performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate (a) the most studied peripheral molecular markers in major psychiatric disorders, (b) the main features of studies in which they are proposed as biomarkers and (c) whether their patterns of variation are similar across disorders. Out of the six molecules most commonly present as keywords in articles studying plasmatic markers of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, five (BDNF, TNF-alpha, IL-6, C-reactive protein and cortisol) were the same across the three diagnoses. An analysis of the literature on these molecules showed that, while 65% of studies were cross-sectional and 66% compared biomarker levels between patients and controls in specific disorders, only 10% presented an objective measure of diagnostic or prognostic efficacy. Meta-analyses showed that variation in the levels of these molecules was robust across studies, but also similar among disorders, suggesting them to reflect transdiagnostic systemic consequences of psychiatric illness rather than diagnostic markers. Based on this, we discuss how current publication practices have led to research fragmentation across diagnoses, and what steps can be taken in order to increase clinical translation in the field.",

Production area has recently increased dramatically in New Zealand, primarily for non-lactating cow feed during winter but increasingly for other animals and times of the year.\\n\\nCurrently, establishing fodder beet requires intensive land cultivation and precision sowing of pelleted seed. It is generally regarded as a difficult crop to grow successfully. Competition from early season weeds means that multiple herbicide applications are commonly applied. Delaying the sowing date, until soil temperatures have risen enough for germination, limits the flexibility of this crop within farm rotations.\\n\\nTransplanting is a plant establishment technique common in both forestry and vegetable crops. It simplifies establishment and reduces the risk of poor establishment.\\n\\nHere we demonstrate that transplanting of fodder beet can be conducted successfully with low variability observed within the transplanted crop. Individual root volume and dry matter content are similar, whether crops are precision-drilled or transplanted. Our results suggest that transplanting is a financially feasible option for fodder beet establishment.",

    "abstract": "In the last few decades, the idea that people routinely and implicitly predict upcoming words during language comprehension has turned from a controversial hypothesis to a widely-accepted assumption. Current theories of language comprehension1-3 posit prediction, or context-based pre-activation, as an essential mechanism occurring at all levels of linguistic representation (semantic, morpho-syntactic and phonological/orthographic) and facilitating the integration of words into the unfolding discourse representation. The strongest evidence to date for phonological pre-activation comes from DeLong, Urbach and Kutas4, who monitored participants electrophysiological brain responses as they read sentences, presented one word at a time, with expected/unexpected indefinite article + noun combinations like, \\\"The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly a kite/an airplane\\\". The sentences varied expectations ( cloze probability) for a consonant- or vowel-initial noun, as determined in a sentence-completion task using other participants. Expectedly, the amplitude of the N400 event-related potential (ERP) decreased (became less negative) with increasing cloze reflecting ease of processing5-6. Whereas the decreased N400 at the noun could be due to its pre-activation or because high-cloze nouns are easier to integrate, crucially, N400s at the immediately-preceding article a or an showed the same relationship with cloze, i.e., encountering an indefinite article that mismatched a highly-expected word (e.g., an when expecting kite) also elicited a larger N400. This led to the claim that participants pre-activated highly-expected nouns, including their initial phonemes, based on the preceding context, with larger N400s on mismatching articles reflecting disconfirmation of this prediction.\\n\\nThe Delong et al. study warranted stronger conclusions than related results available at the time. Unlike previous work, it did not rely on the precursory visual-depiction of upcoming nouns, clearly de-confounded prediction and integration effects, and tested for graded phonological pre-activation of specific word form. Correspondingly, the study has been enthusiastically received as strong evidence for probabilistic phonological pre-activation, receiving over 650 citations to date and featuring in authoritative reviews2-3. However, there is good cause to question the soundness of the original finding (and the appropriateness of the analysis used). Attempts to replicate the critical article-effect have failed7. Moreover, an earlier, alternative analysis of the same data by the authors8 failed to reach statistical significance, but was omitted from the published report.\\n\\nTo obtain more definitive evidence, we conducted a direct replication study spanning 9 laboratories (Ntotal = 334). We pre-registered one replication analysis that was faithful to the original, and one single-trial analysis that modeled subject- and item-level variance using linear mixed-effects models. Applying the replication analysis to our article data (Figure 1a), the original finding did not replicate: no laboratory observed a significant negative relationship between cloze and N400 at central-parietal electrodes. In contrast, the negative relationship was successfully replicated for the nouns: 6 laboratories observed such an effect and 2 laboratories observed relatively strong but non-significant effects in the expected direction (range r = .30 to .50). In the single-trial analysis (Fig. 1b-c), there was no statistically significant effect of cloze on article-N400s, also with stricter control for pre-article voltage levels (Supplementary Fig. 1). Crucially, there was a strong and significant cloze effect on noun-N400s (in all laboratories), which was significantly different from that on article-N400s. We observed no significant differences between laboratories for article or noun effects. Exploratory Bayesian analyses with priors based on DeLong et al. further support our conclusions (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, a control experiment confirmed our participants sensitivity to the a/an rule during online language comprehension (Supplementary Fig. 3).\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=173 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/111807_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (72K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1231330org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0eb43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95a28forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e38ee6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1C_FLOATNO A multi-lab failure to replicate evidence for probabilistic pre-activation of phonology.

All three tests reduced the initially observed effect of article-cloze (200 ms baseline, = .25, CI [-.12, .62], {chi}2(1) = 1.35, p = .19; 500 ms baseline, = .14, CI [-.25, .53], {chi}2(1) = 0.46, p = .50; 0.1 Hz filter: = 0.09, CI [-.22, .41], {chi}2(1) = 0.33, p = .56).

Combined, these results suggest that the results obtained with the pre-registered analysis at least partly reflected the effects of slow signal drift that existed before the articles were presented.\\n\\nC_FIG O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/111807_figS2.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 2\\\">\\nView larger version (35K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@124ffa2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af29aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd69d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e3b98_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOSupplementary Figure 2.C_FLOATNO Results from exploratory Bayesian mixed-effects model analyses, represented by posterior distributions for the effect of cloze on ERP amplitudes in the N400 window. The x-axis shows cloze effect sizes (i.e., changes in microvolts associated with an increase from 0% cloze probability to 100% cloze probability). The black line indicates the posterior distribution of effects; higher values of the posterior density at a given effect size indicate higher probability that this is the true effect size in the population. The peak of the posterior distribution roughly corresponds to the point estimate of the effect size (the regression coefficient) fitted from the Bayesian mixed effect model, i.e., the most likely value of the true effect size. The middle 95% of the posterior distribution, shaded in pink, corresponds to a two-tailed 95% credible interval for the effect sizei.e., an interval that we can be 95% confident contains the true effect. The green dotted line indicates the prior distribution (i.e., our expectation about where the true effect would lie before the data were collected), which is centered on 1.25V, the effect observed by Delong and colleagues (2005). The black connected dots illustrate the ratio between the posterior and prior distribution (i.e., the Bayes Factor) at the effect size of 0V; for example, a Bayes Factor of 4 suggests we can be 4 times more certain that the true effect is zero after having conducted this experiment than before, or, in other words, that the data increased our confidence in the null effect of zero fourfold. We performed these analyses for each of the linear mixed-effects model analysis we performed. We note that in all the article-analyses, the posterior probability of the estimated effect being greater than zero is around 80 or 90%, but this is also the case for the pre-stimulus variable, suggesting that the observed patterns arise before the articles are seen. In none of our article-analyses did zero lie outside the obtained credible interval, whereas for the nouns, zero lay outside the credible interval. These results are consistent with a failure to replicate the DeLong et al. article-effect and successful replication of the noun-effect.\\n\\nC_FIG O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/111807_figS3.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 3\\\">\\nView larger version (25K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab14forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fed126org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55369corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@747668_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOSupplementary Figure 3.C_FLOATNO P600 effects at electrode Pz per lab associated with flouting of the English a/an rule in the control experiment.

This control experiment followed in the same experimental session as the main experiment and was carried to rule out that an observed lack of a statistically significant, article-elicited prediction effect in the main experiment reflected a general insensitivity of our participants to the a/an rule. In each laboratory, nouns following incorrect articles elicited a late positive-going waveform compared to nouns following correct articles, starting at about 500 ms after word onset and strongest at parietal electrodes. This standard P600 effect was confirmed in a single-trial analysis, {chi}2(1) = 83.09, p < .001, and did not significantly differ between labs, {chi}2(8) = 8.98, p = .35.\\n\\nC_FIG\\n\\nDespite a sample size 10 times larger than the original and improved statistical analysis, we observed no statistically significant effect of cloze on article-N400s, while replicating the strong and statistically significant effect of cloze on noun-N400s4,6. The effect of cloze on article-N400s, if existent, must be very small to evade detection given our expansive approach. Whether such an effect would constitute convincing evidence for routine phonological pre-activation as assumed in theories of language comprehension3 can be questioned, but, more generally, such an effect cannot be meaningfully studied in typical small-scale studies. Consequently, current theoretical positions may be based on potentially unreliable findings and require revision. In particular, the strong prediction view that claims that pre-activation routinely occurs across all - including phonological - levels3, can no longer be viewed as having strong empirical support.\\n\\nOur results do not constitute evidence against prediction in general. We note a lack of convincing evidence specifically for phonological pre-activation, which would have to be measured before a noun appears and unobscured by processes instigated by the noun itself.\\n\\nHowever, our results neither support nor necessarily exclude phonological pre-activation. Unlike gender-marked articles9 (e.g., in Dutch or Spanish) that agree with nouns irrespective of intervening words, English a/an articles index the subsequent word, which is not always a noun. Maybe our participants did not use mismatching articles to disconfirm predicted nouns, possibly because it was not a viable strategy (American and British English corpus data show a mere 33% chance that a noun follows such articles). Perhaps a revision of the predicted meaning is required to trigger differential ERPs.\\n\\nDeLong et al. recently described filler-sentences in their experiment10, cf. 7, which were omitted from their original report, and were neither provided nor mentioned to us upon our request for their stimuli. DeLong used the existence of these filler-sentences to dismiss an alternative explanation of their results, namely that an unusual experimental context wherein every sentence contains an article-noun combination leads participants to strategically predict upcoming nouns. Importantly, we failed to replicate their article-effects despite an experimental context that could inadvertently encourage strategic prediction. Therefore, the difference between their experiment and ours cannot explain the different results, and may even strengthen our conclusions.\\n\\nIn sum, our findings do not support a strong prediction view involving routine and probabilistic pre-activation of phonological word form based on preceding context.\\n\\nMoreover, our results further highlight the importance of direct replication, large sample size studies, transparent reporting and of pre-registration to advance reproducibility and replicability in the neurosciences.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of polytopic membrane proteins are inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes by the general secretory (Sec) pathway. However, a subset of monotopic proteins that contain non-covalently-bound redox cofactors depend on the twin-arginine translocase (Tat) machinery for membrane integration. Recently actinobacterial Rieske iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins were identified as an unusual class of membrane proteins that require both the Sec and Tat pathways for the insertion of their three transmembrane domains (TMDs). The Sec pathway inserts the first two TMDs of these proteins co-translationally, but releases the polypeptide prior to the integration of TMD3 to allow folding of the cofactor-containing domain and its translocation by Tat. Here we have investigated features of the Streptomyces coelicolor Rieske polypeptide that modulate its interaction with the Sec and Tat machineries. Mutagenesis of a highly conserved loop region between Sec-dependent TMD2 and Tat-dependent TMD3 shows that it plays no significant role in coordinating the activities of the two translocases, but that a minimum loop length of approximately eight amino acids is required for the Tat machinery to recognise TMD3. Instead we show that a combination of relatively low hydrophobicity of TMD3, coupled with the presence of C-terminal positively-charged amino acids, results in abortive insertion of TMD3 by the Sec pathway and its release at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Bioinformatic analysis identified two further families of polytopic membrane proteins that share features of dual Sec-Tat-targeted membrane proteins. A predicted heme-molybdenum cofactor-containing protein with five TMDs, and a polyferredoxin also with five predicted TMDs, are encoded across bacterial and archaeal genomes. We demonstrate that membrane insertion of representatives of each of these newly-identified protein families is dependent on more than one protein translocase, with the Tat machinery recognising TMD5. Importantly, the combination of low hydrophobicity of the final TMD and the presence of multiple C-terminal positive charges that serve as critical Sec-release features for the actinobacterial Rieske protein also dictate Sec release in these further protein families. Therefore we conclude that a simple unifying mechanism governs the assembly of dual targeted membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii is a clinical threat to human health, causing major infection outbreaks worldwide. As new drugs against Gram-negative bacteria do not seem to be forthcoming, and due to the microbial capability of acquiring multi-resistance, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Here we have derived a list of new potential targets by means of metabolic reconstruction and modelling of A. baumannii ATCC 19606. By integrating constraint-based modelling with gene expression data, we simulated microbial growth in normal and stressful conditions (i.e. following antibiotic exposure). This allowed us to describe the metabolic reprogramming that occurs in this bacterium when treated with colistin (the currently adopted last-line treatment) and identify a set of genes that are primary targets for developing new drugs against A. baumannii, including colistin-resistant strains. It can be anticipated that the metabolic model presented herein will represent a solid and reliable resource for the future treatment of A. baumannii infections.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases of wildlife are typically studied using data on antibody and pathogen presence/level. In order to interpret these data, it is necessary to know the course of antibodies and pathogen presence/levels after infection. Such data are typically collected using experimental infection studies in which host individuals are inoculated in the laboratory and sampled over an extended period, but because laboratory conditions are controlled and much less variable than natural conditions, the immune response and pathogen dynamics may differ. Here, we compared Morogoro arenavirus infection patterns between naturally and experimentally infected multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis). Longitudinal samples were collected during three months of bi-weekly trapping in Morogoro, Tanzania, and antibody titer and viral RNA presence were determined to assess whether the natural temporal patterns are similar to those previously observed in the laboratory. A good match with laboratory data was found for 52% of naturally infected individuals, while most of the mismatches can be explained by the presence of chronically infected individuals (35%), maternal antibodies (10%) and an antibody detection limit (25%). These results suggest that while laboratory data are useful for interpreting field samples, there can still be differences due to conditions that were not tested in the laboratory.\\n\\nImportant noticeThis is a pre-print version of the manuscript, made available through bioRxiv.org.

    "abstract": "Modern advances in neurotechnology rely on effectively harnessing physical tools and insights towards remote neural control, thereby creating major new scientific and therapeutic opportunities. Specifically, rapid temperature pulses were shown to increase membrane capacitance, causing capacitive currents that explain neural excitation, but the underlying biophysics is not well understood. Here, we show that an intramembrane thermal-mechanical effect wherein the phospholipid bilayer undergoes axial narrowing and lateral expansion accurately predicts a potentially universal thermal capacitance increase rate of ~0.3%/{degrees}C. This capacitance increase and concurrent changes in the surface charge related fields lead to predictable exciting ionic displacement currents. The new theorys predictions provide an excellent agreement with multiple experimental results and indirect estimates of latent biophysical quantities. Our results further highlight the role of electro-mechanics in neural excitation; they may also help illuminate sub-threshold and novel physical cellular effects, and could potentially lead to advanced new methods for neural control.",

    "abstract": "During the generation and evolution of the eukaryotic cell, a proteobacterial endosymbiont was refashioned into the mitochondrion, an organelle that appears to have been present in the ancestor of all present-day eukaryotes. Mitochondria harbor proteomes derived from coding information located both inside and outside the organelle, and the rate-limiting step toward the formation of eukaryotic cells may have been development of an import apparatus allowing protein entry to mitochondria. Currently, a widely conserved translocon allows proteins to pass from the cytosol into mitochondria, but how proteins encoded outside of mitochondria were first directed to these organelles at the dawn of eukaryogenesis is not clear. Because several proteins targeted by a carboxyl-terminal tail anchor (TA) appear to have the ability to insert spontaneously into the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM), it is possible that self-inserting, tail-anchored polypeptides obtained from bacteria might have formed the first gate allowing proteins to access mitochondria from the cytosol. Here, we tested whether bacterial TAs are capable of targeting to mitochondria. In a survey of proteins encoded by the proteobacterium Escherichia coli, predicted TA sequences were directed to specific subcellular locations within the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Importantly, TAs obtained from DUF883 family members ElaB and YqjD were abundantly localized to and inserted at the mitochondrial OM. Our results support the notion that eukaryotic cells are able to utilize membrane-targeting signals present in bacterial proteins obtained by lateral gene transfer, and our findings make plausible a model in which mitochondrial protein translocation was first driven by tail-anchored proteins.",

    "abstract": "Explanations based on low level interacting elements are valuable and powerful since they contribute to identify the key mechanisms of biological functions. However, many dynamic systems based on low level interacting elements with unambiguous, finite and complete information of initial states generate future states that cannot be predicted, implying an increase of complexity and open-ended evolution (oee). Such systems are like Turing machines, that overlap with dynamical systems that cannot halt. We argue that organisms find halting conditions by distorting these mechanisms, creating conditions for a constant creativity that drives evolution. We introduce a modulus of elasticity to measure the changes in these mechanisms in response to changes in the computed environment. We test this concept in a population of predators and predated cells with chemotactic mechanisms and demonstrate how the selection of a given mechanism depends on the entire population. We finally explore this concept in different frameworks and postulate that the identification of predictive mechanisms is only successful with small elasticity modulus.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal synapses contain dozens of protein species whose expression levels and localizations are key determinants of synaptic transmission and plasticity. The spectral properties of fluorophores used in conventional microscopy limit the number of measured proteins to four species within a given sample. The ability to perform high-throughput confocal or super-resolution imaging of many proteins simultaneously without limitation in target number imposed by this spectral limit would enable large-scale characterization of synaptic protein networks in situ. Here, we introduce PRISM: Probe-based Imaging for Sequential Multiplexing, a method that sequentially utilizes either high affinity Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) or low affinity DNA probes to enable diffraction-limited confocal and PAINT-based super-resolution imaging. High-affinity LNA probes offer high-throughput, confocal-based imaging compared with PAINT, which uses low affinity probes to realize localization-based super-resolution imaging. Simultaneous immunostaining of all targets is performed prior to imaging, followed by sequential LNA/DNA probe exchange that requires only minutes under mild wash conditions. We apply PRISM to quantify the co-expression levels and nanometer-scale organization of one dozen cytoskeletal and synaptic proteins within individual neuronal synapses. Our approach is scalable to dozens of target proteins and is compatible with high-content screening platforms commonly used to interrogate phenotypic changes associated with genetic and drug perturbations in a variety of cell types.",

Ecological mechanisms underlying these impacts are well studied but the role of evolutionary processes is rarely assessed. Using a long-term field experiment, we tested whether natural selection in plant communities increased the effects of biodiversity on productivity. We re-assembled communities with 8-year co-selection history adjacent to communities with identical species composition but no history of co-selection (\\\"naive communities\\\"). Monocultures and in particular mixtures of two to four co-selected species were more productive than their corresponding naive communities over four years in soils with or without co-selected microbial communities. At the highest diversity level of eight plant species, no such differences were observed. Our findings suggest that plant community evolution can lead to rapid increases in ecosystem functioning at low diversity but may take longer at high diversity. This effect was not modified by treatments that simulated additional co-evolutionary processes between plants and soil organisms.",

Despite the tissue specific nature of DNA methylation, the inaccessibility of human brain samples necessitates the frequent use of surrogate tissues such as blood, in studies of associations between DNA methylation and brain function and health. Results from studies of surrogate tissues in humans are difficult to interpret in this context, as the connection between blood-brain DNA methylation is tenuous and not well documented. Here we aimed to provide a resource to the community to aid interpretation of blood based DNA methylation results in the context of brain tissue. We used paired samples from 16 individuals from three brain regions and whole blood, run on the Illumina 450K Human Methylation Array to quantify the concordance of DNA methylation between tissues. From these data we have made available metrics on: the variability of CpGs in our blood and brain samples, the concordance of CpGs between blood and brain, and estimations of how strongly a CpG is affected by cell composition in both blood and brain through the web application BECon (Blood-Brain Epigenetic Concordance; https://redgar598.shinyapps.io/BECon/).

The ability to simultaneously measure thousands of genes at single cell resolution allows, among other prospects, for the possibility of learning gene regulatory networks at large scales. However, scRNA-seq technologies suffer from many sources of significant technical noise, the most prominent of which is  dropout due to inefficient mRNA capture. This results in data that has a high degree of sparsity, with typically only ~10% non-zero values. To address this, we developed MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells), a method for imputing missing values, and restoring the structure of the data. After MAGIC, we find that two- and three-dimensional gene interactions are restored and that MAGIC is able to impute complex and non-linear shapes of interactions. MAGIC also retains cluster structure, enhances cluster-specific gene interactions and restores trajectories, as demonstrated in mouse retinal bipolar cells, hematopoiesis, and our newly generated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition dataset.",

    "abstract": "Our species is characterized by a great degree of cultural variation, both within and between populations. Understanding how group-level patterns of culture emerge from individual-level behaviour is a long-standing question in the biological and social sciences. We develop a simulation model capturing demographic and cultural dynamics relevant to human cultural evolution, focusing on the interface between population-level patterns and individual-level processes. The model tracks the distribution of variants of cultural traits across individuals in a population over time, conditioned on different pathways for the transmission of information between individuals. From these data we obtain theoretical expectations for a range of statistics commonly used to capture population-level characteristics (e.g. the degree of cultural diversity). Consistent with previous theoretical work, our results show that the patterns observed at the level of groups are rooted in the interplay between the transmission pathways and the age structure of the population. We also explore whether, and under what conditions, the different pathways can be distinguished based on their group-level signatures, in an effort to establish theoretical limits to inference. Our results show that the temporal dynamic of cultural change over time retains a stronger signature than the cultural composition of the population at a specific point in time. Overall, the results suggest a shift in focus from identifying the one individual-level process that likely produced the observed data to excluding those that likely did not. We conclude by discussing the implications for empirical studies of human cultural evolution.",

After several decades of research, the molecular mechanism of how asbestos induce cancers is not well understood. Different fibres, including asbestos, can penetrate the membrane and introduce DNA in both, bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Incubating Escherichia coli with sepiolite, a clayey material, and asbestos under friction forces, both fibres cause double-strand breaks in bacteria. Since antibiotics and clays are used together in animal husbandry, the mutagenic effect of these fibres might constitute a pathway to antibiotic resistance due to the friction provided by peristalsis of the gut from farm animals in addition to the previously proposed horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, we raise the possibility that the same mechanism could generate bacteria diversity in natural scenarios with a role in the evolution of species. Finally, we provide a new model on how asbestos may promote mutagenesis and cancer based on the observed mechanical genotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Postcopulatory sexual selection (PCSS) is a potent evolutionary force that can drive rapid changes of reproductive genes within species, and thus has the potential to generate reproductive incompatibilities between species. Male seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are major players in postmating interactions, and likely the main targets of PCSS in males. The virilis subgroup of Drosophila exhibits strong interspecific gametic incompatibilities, and can serve as a model to study the genetic basis of PCSS and gametic isolation. However, reproductive genes in this group have not been characterized. Here we use short-read RNA sequencing of male reproductive organs to examine the evolutionary dynamics of reproductive genes in members of the virilis subgroup: D. americana, D. lummei, D. novamexicana, and D. virilis. For each of the three male reproductive organs (accessory glands, ejaculatory bulb, and testes), we identify genes that show strong expression bias in a given tissue relative to the remaining tissues. We find that the majority of male reproductive transcripts are testes-biased, accounting for ~15% of all annotated genes. Ejaculatory bulb-biased transcripts largely code for lipid metabolic enzymes, and contain orthologs of the D. melanogaster ejaculatory bulb protein, Peb-me, which is involved in mating-plug formation. In addition, we identify 71 candidate SFPs, and show that this set of genes has the highest rate of nonsynonymous codon substitution relative to testes- and ejaculatory bulb-biased genes. Furthermore, these SFPs are underrepresented on the X chromosome and are enriched for proteolytic enzymes, which is consistent with SFPs in other insect species. Surprisingly, we find 35 D. melanogaster SFPs with conserved accessory gland expression in the virilis group, suggesting these genes may have conserved reproductive roles in Drosophila. Finally, we show that several of the SFPs that have the highest rate of nonsynonymous codon substitutions reside on the centromeric half of chromosome 2, which contributes to paternal gametic incompatibility between species. Our results suggest that SFPs are under strong selection in the virilis group, and likely play a major role in PCSS and/or gametic isolation.",

Further scrutiny of the oil palm genes revealed 210 candidate resistance genes involved in pathogen defense. Fatty acids have diverse applications ranging from food to industrial feedstock, and we identified 42 key genes involved in fatty-acid biosynthesis in oil palm mesocarp and kernel. These results provide an important resource for studies on plant genomes and a theoretical foundation for marker-assisted breeding of oil palm and related crops.",

    "abstract": "Across metazoans, innate immunity is vital in defending organisms against viral infection. In mammals, antiviral innate immunity is orchestrated by interferon signaling, activating the STAT transcription factors downstream of the JAK kinases to induce expression of antiviral effector genes. In the nematode C. elegans, which lacks the interferon system, the major antiviral response so far described is RNA interference but whether additional gene expression responses are employed is not known. Here we show that, despite the absence of both interferon and JAK, the C. elegans STAT homologue STA-1 orchestrates antiviral immunity. Intriguingly, mutants lacking STA-1 show increased resistance to antiviral infection. Using gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation we show that, in contrast to the mammalian pathway, STA-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor. Thus STA-1 might act to suppress a constitutive antiviral response in the absence of infection. Using a reverse genetic screen we identify the SID-3 as a kinase upstream of STA-1 in the response to infection. Together, our work identifies a novel STAT regulatory cascade controlling its activity in antiviral resistance, illustrating the complex evolutionary trajectory displayed by innate immune signaling pathways across metazoan organisms.",

    "abstract": "Egocentric neural coding has been observed in parietal cortex (PC), but its topographical and laminar organization is not well characterized. We used multi-site recording to look for evidence of local clustering and laminar consistency of linear and angular velocity encoding in multi-neuronal spiking activity (MUA) and in the high-frequency (300-900 Hz) component of the local field potential (HF-LFP), believed to reflect local spiking activity. Rats were trained to run many trials on a large circular platform, either to LED-cued goal locations or as a spatial sequence from memory. Tuning to specific self-motion states was observed consistently, and exhibited distinct cortical depth-invariant coding properties. These patterns of collective local and laminar activation during behavior were reactivated in compressed form during post-experience sleep, and temporally coupled to hippocampal sharp wave ripples. Thus, PC neuron motion encoding is consistent across cortical laminae, and this consistency is maintained during memory reactivation.\\n\\nHighlights O_LIParietal cortex MUA encodes specific movements coherently across laminae.\\nC_LIO_LIThis organizational scheme is maintained during subsequent memory reactivation\\nC_LIO_LIMUA and HF-LFP showed similar self-motion tuning and memory reactivation dynamics\\nC_LIO_LIThis establishes the utility of MUA and HF-LFP for human memory reactivation studies\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Approximately 76,000 discovered makes terpenoids the largest family of natural products in nature with widespread applications. The wide-spectrum of structural diversity of the terpenoids were largely due to the variable skeletons generated by terpene synthases. The number of terpene skeletons found in nature, however, were so much more than those conceivably generated from known terpene synthases and the limited characterized terpene synthases also make no chance for some useful terpenoids overproduction in microbe. Here, we first demonstrated that the promiscuous synthases in vivo can produce more variable terpenoid products by converting precursors of different lengths (C10, C15, C20, C25). This discovery was prompted by the development of an efficient in vivo platform by combining the two promiscuous terpene synthases and three prenyltransferases to generate 50 terpenoids, at least 3 ring systems of which were completely new. Furthermore, protein engineering was further integrated to enhance product diversity. Clearly, the work is expected to dramatically reshape the terpenoid research by widening the flexibility of the terpene synthases for the fresh discovery or creation of the new terpenoid compounds by skeleton reframing.",
