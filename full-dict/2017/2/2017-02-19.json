    "abstract": "1In a novel approach to diagnose Obstructive Sleep Apnea, electronic components, such as an Arduino Mega, a Bluetooth Transceiver, an accelerometer, and a air-quality sensor, were put together to create a wearable that would detect the frequency of apnea events, detect and diagnose the disorder, and sound an alarm when necessary. A primary consideration was to make the mechanism accessible and affordable, and in doing so, lower the cases of Obstructive Sleep Apnea that go undiagnosed due to the cost and inconvenience associated with the traditional diagnosis method--a Polysomnogram. Bluetooth capability was an additional consideration so that the device would transmit data directly to an android smartphone, eliminating the need for an additional output mechanism. The total cost of the device, quite surprisingly, did not exceed $30, and therein rendered the device an accessible, affordable mechanism for diagnosis. Tests of the device on diagnosed patients yielded data consistent with the diagnosis, with a few false positives as a result of the excessive sensitivity of the sensors.",

    "abstract": "As cancer cell populations evolve, they accumulate a number of somatic mutations, resulting in heterogeneous subclones in the final tumor. Understanding the mechanisms that produce intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is important for selecting the best treatment. Although some studies have involved ITH simulations, their model settings differed substantially. Thus, only limited conditions were explored in each. Herein, we developed a general framework for simulating ITH patterns and a simulator (tumopp). Tumopp offers many setting options so that simulations can be carried out under various settings. Setting options include how the cell division rate is determined, how daughter cells are placed, and how driver mutations are treated. Furthermore, to account for the cell cycle, we introduced a gamma function for the waiting time involved in cell division. Tumopp also allows simulations in a hexagonal lattice, in addition to a regular lattice that has been used in previous simulation studies. A hexagonal lattice produces a more biologically reasonable space than a regular lattice. Using tumopp, we investigated how model settings affect the growth curve and ITH pattern. It was found that, even under neutrality (with no driver mutations), tumopp produced dramatically variable patterns of ITH and tumor morphology, from tumors in which cells with different genetic background are well intermixed to irregular shapes of tumors with a cluster of closely related cells. This result suggests a caveat in analyzing ITH data with simulations with limited settings, and tumopp will be useful to explore ITH patterns in various conditions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding the mechanisms that produce intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) is important for selecting the best treatment. Despite a growing body of data and tools for analyzing ITH, the spatial structure and its evolution are poorly understood because of the lack of well established theoretical framework. Herein, we provide a general framework for simulating ITH patterns, under which a simulator (tumopp) is developed. Tumopp offers many setting options so that simulations can be carried out under various settings. Simulations using tumopp demonstrate that dramatically variable patterns of ITH and tumor morphology can be produced depending on the model setting. The present work provides a guideline for future simulation studies of cancer cell populations.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, fairly far-reaching claims have been repeatedly made about how niche construction, the modification by organisms of their environment, and that of other organisms, represents a vastly neglected phenomenon in ecological and evolutionary thought. The proponents of this view claim that the niche construction perspective greatly expands the scope of standard evolutionary theory and that niche construction deserves to be treated as a significant evolutionary process in its own right, almost at par with natural selection. Claims have also been advanced about how niche construction theory represents a substantial extension to, and re-orientation of, standard evolutionary theory, which is criticized as being narrowly gene-centric and ignoring the rich complexity and reciprocity of organism-environment interactions. We examine these claims in some detail and show that they do not stand up to scrutiny. We suggest that the manner in which niche construction theory is sought to be pushed in the literature is better viewed as an exercise in academic niche construction whereby, through incessant repetition of largely untenable claims, and the deployment of rhetorically appealing but logically dubious analogies, a receptive climate for a certain sub-discipline is sought to be manufactured within the scientific community. We see this as an unfortunate, but perhaps inevitable, nascent post-truth tendency within science.",

    "abstract": "PurposeOur group recently identified a ten gene pattern of differential expression in peripheral blood which may have utility for detection of stroke. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic capacity and temporal stability of this stroke-associated transcriptional signature in an independent patient population.\\n\\nMethodsPublically available whole blood microarray data generated from 23 ischemic stroke patients at 3, 5, and 24 hours post-symptom onset, along with 23 cardiovascular disease controls were obtained via the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus. Expression levels of the ten candidate genes were extracted, compared between groups, and evaluated for their discriminatory ability at each time point.\\n\\nResultsWe observed a largely identical pattern of differential expression between stroke patients and controls across the ten candidate genes as reported in our prior work. Furthermore, the coordinate expression levels of the ten candidate genes were able to discriminate between stroke patients and controls with levels of sensitivity and specificity upwards of 90% across all three time points.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings confirm the diagnostic robustness of the previously identified pattern of differential expression in independent patient population, and further suggest that it is temporally stable over the first 24 hours of stroke pathology.",

    "abstract": "The T-cell receptor (TCR) triggers the elimination of pathogens and tumors by T lymphocytes. In order for this to avoid damage to the host, the receptor has to discriminate between thousands of peptide ligands presented by each host cell. Exactly how the TCR does this is unknown. In resting T-cells, the TCR is largely unphosphorylated due to the dominance of phosphatases over kinases expressed at the cell surface. When agonist peptides are presented to the TCR by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), very fast receptor triggering occurs, leading to TCR phosphorylation. Recent work suggests that this depends on the local exclusion of the phosphatases from regions of contact of the T cells with the APCs. Here, we develop and test a quantitative treatment of receptor triggering reliant only upon TCR dwell-time in phosphatase-depleted cell-cell contacts constrained in area by cell topography. Using the model and experimentally-derived parameters, we find that ligand discrimination is possible but that it depends crucially on individual contacts being 400 nm in diameter or smaller, i.e. the size generated by microvilli. The model not only correctly predicts the relative signaling potencies of known agonists and non-agonists, but achieves this in the absence of conventional, multi-step kinetic proof-reading. Our work provides a simple, quantitative and predictive molecular framework for understanding why TCR triggering is so selective and fast, and reveals that for some receptors, cell topography crucially influences signaling outcomes.\\n\\nSignificance statementOne approach to testing biological theories is to determine if they are predictive. A simple, theoretical treatment of TCR triggering suggests that ligand discrimination by the receptor relies on just two physical principles: (1) the time TCRs spend in cell-cell contacts depleted of large tyrosine phosphatases; and (2) constraints on contact size imposed by T cells using finger-like protrusions to interrogate their targets. The theory not only allows agonistic and non-agonistic TCR ligands to be distinguished but predicts the relative signalling potencies of agonists with remarkable accuracy. This suggests that the theory captures the essential features of receptor triggering.",

    "abstract": "The PML (promyelocytic leukemia) protein is a member of the TRIM family, a large group of proteins that show high diversity in functions but possess a common tripartite motif giving the family its name. We and others recently reported that both murine PML (mPML) and human PML (hPML) strongly restrict the early stages of infection by HIV-1 and other lentiviruses when expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This restriction activity was found to contribute to the type I interferon (IFN-I)-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 in MEFs. Additionally, PML caused transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 promoter in MEFs. By contrast, the modulation of the early stages of HIV-1 infection of human cells by PML has been investigated by RNAi with unclear results. In order to conclusively determine whether PML restricts HIV-1 or not in human cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out its gene in epithelial, lymphoid and monocytic human cell lines. Infection challenges showed that PML knockout had no effect on the permissiveness of these cells to HIV-1 infection. IFN-I treatments inhibited HIV-1 equally whether PML was expressed or not. Over-expression of individual hPML isoforms, or of mPML, in a human T cell line did not restrict HIV-1. The presence of PML was not required for the restriction of nonhuman retroviruses by TRIM5 was inhibited by arsenic trioxide through a PML-independent mechanism. We conclude that PML is not a restriction factor for HIV-1 in human cell lines representing diverse lineages.\\n\\nImportancePML is involved in innate immune mechanisms against both DNA and RNA viruses. Although the mechanism by which PML inhibits highly divergent viruses is unclear, it was recently found that it can increase the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, whether human PML inhibits HIV-1 has been debated. Here we provide unambiguous, knockout-based evidence that PML does not restrict the early post-entry stages of HIV-1 infection in a variety of human cell types and does not participate in the inhibition of HIV-1 by IFN-I. Although this study does not exclude the possibility of other mechanisms by which PML may interfere with HIV-1, we nonetheless demonstrate that PML does not generally act as an HIV-1 restriction factor in human cells and that its presence is not required for IFN-I to stimulate the expression of anti-HIV-1 genes. These results contribute to uncovering the landscape of HIV-1 inhibition by ISGs in human cells.",
