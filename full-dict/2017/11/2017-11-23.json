    "abstract": "What is the ultimate limiting nutrient in the ocean? The dominant theory, which was first proposed by Redfield and later formalized by Tyrrell[1, 2], states that despite the scarcity of fixed nitrogen (N) in the surface ocean, phosphorus (P) availability ultimately determines primary productivity. Two recent findings directly challenge the assumptions of the Redfield-Tyrrell paradigm: the discovery of systematic variations of phytoplankton cellular N:P:Fe and widespread iron-limitation of phytoplankton. Here we use a simple model of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron (Fe) cycling to show how the resource demand ratios and biogeography of phytoplankton interact with external resource supply ratios to govern nutrient cycling and primary productivity. We find that all three nutrients can limit global primary productivity, and that the ratio of geochemical supply to biological demand of each nutrient in each ocean region determines the limiting nutrients, with nitrogen N fixation providing a mechanism for the cycles to interact. These results have important consequences for our understanding of biogeochemical cycles, ocean-atmosphere interactions, marine ecology, and the response of ocean ecosystems to climate change. Our work demonstrates the importance of resource ratios and suggests that future studies of the physiological and geochemical regulation of these ratios are indispensable to building accurate theories and future predictions of nutrient cycling and primary productivity.",

    "abstract": "The Yeonsan Ogye (Ogye) is a rare Korean domestic chicken breed, the entire body of which, including its feathers and skin, has a unique black coloring. Although some protein-coding genes related to this unique feature have been examined, non-coding elements have not been globally investigated. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing and DNA methylation sequencing were performed to dissect the expression landscape of 14,264 Ogye protein-coding and 6900 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes along with DNA methylation landscape in twenty different Ogye tissues. About 75% of Ogye lncRNAs showed tissue-specific expression whereas about 45% of protein-coding genes did. For some genes, the tissue-specific expression levels were inversely correlated with DNA methylation levels in their promoters. About 39% of the tissue-specific lncRNAs displayed functional association with proximal or distal protein-coding genes. In particular, heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2)-associated lncRNAs were discovered to be functionally linked to protein-coding genes that are specifically expressed in black skin tissues, tended to be more syntenically conserved in mammals, and were differentially expressed in black tissues relative to white tissues. Our results not only facilitate understanding how the non-coding genome regulates unique phenotypes but also should be of use for future genomic breeding of chickens.",

    "abstract": "The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single worldwide archive of experimentally-determined three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and nucleic acids. As of January 2017, the PDB housed more than 125,000 structures and was growing by more than 11,000 structures annually. Since the 3D structure of a protein is vital to understand the mechanisms of biological processes, diseases, and drug design, correct oligomeric assembly information is of critical importance. For example, it makes a difference if the protein is normally a dimer and not a monomer or a trimer or a tetramer or a hexamer in nature. Unfortunately, the biologically relevant oligomeric form of a 3D structure is not directly obtainable by X-ray crystallography. Instead, this information may be provided by the PDB Depositor as metadata coming from additional experiments, be inferred by sequence-sequence comparisons with similar proteins of known oligomeric state, or predicted using software, such as PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) or EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein Protein Interface Classifier). Despite significant efforts by professional PDB Biocurators during data deposition, there remain a number of structures in the archive with incorrect quaternary structure descriptions (or annotations). Further investigation is, therefore, needed to evaluate the correctness of quaternary structure annotations. In this study, we aim to identify the most probable oligomeric states for proteins represented in the PDB. Our approach evaluated the performance of four independent prediction methods, including text mining of primary publications, inference from homologous protein structures, and two computational methods (PISA and EPPIC). Aggregating predictions to give consensus results outperformed all four of the independent prediction methods, yielding 86% correct, 9% incorrect, and 5% inconclusive predictions, when tested with a well-curated benchmark dataset. We have developed a freely-available web-based tool to make this approach accessible to researchers and PDB Biocurators (http://quatstruct.rcsb.org).",

    "abstract": "Vernal pool clam shrimp (Eulimnadia texana) are a promising model due to ease of culturing, short generation time, modest genome size, and obligate desiccated diapaused eggs. We collected Illumina data (Poolseq) from eleven pooled wild vernal pool clam shrimp populations. We hypothesized that restricted gene flow between vernal pools, separated by distances of 0.36 to 253 km, in concert with Poolseq data from each population, could be used to identify genes important in local adaptation. We adapted Bayenv2 to genome-wide Poolseq data and detected thirteen genomic regions showing a strong excess of population subdivision relative to a genome-wide background. We identified a set of regions that appear to be significantly diverged in allele frequency, above what is expected based on the relationships amongst the populations. Regions identified as significant were on average 9.5 kb in size and harbored 3.8 genes. We attempted to identify correlations between allele frequencies at each genomic region and environmental variables that may influence local adaptation in the sequences populations, but found that there were too many confounding environmental variables to draw strong conclusions. One such genomic region harbored an ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster CG10413, a gene predicted to have sodium/potassium/chloride activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the identified regions could not have been found with less powerful statistics, i.e. FST, or with a less contiguous genome assembly.",

    "abstract": "Speciation is a complex process that leads to the progressive establishment of reproductive isolation barriers between diverging populations. Genome-wide comparisons between closely related species have revealed the existence of heterogeneous divergence patterns, dominated by genomic islands of increased divergence supposed to contain reproductive isolation loci. However, this divergence landscape only provides a static picture of the dynamic process of speciation, during which confounding mechanisms unlinked to speciation can interfere. Here, we used haplotype-resolved whole-genome sequences to identify the mechanisms responsible for the formation of genomic islands between Atlantic and Mediterranean sea bass lineages. We show that genomic islands first emerged in allopatry through the effect of linked selection acting on a heterogeneous recombination landscape. Upon secondary contact, preexisting islands were strongly remolded by differential introgression, revealing variable fitness effects among regions involved in reproductive isolation. Interestingly, we found that divergent regions containing ancient polymorphisms conferred the strongest resistance to introgression.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is widely used and cost-effective. Depending on the specific methods, NGS can have limitations detecting certain technically challenging variant types even though they are both prevalent in patients and medically important. These types are underrepresented in validation studies, hindering the uniform assessment of test methodologies by laboratory directors and clinicians. Specimens containing such variants can be difficult to obtain; thus, we evaluated a novel solution to this problem in which a diverse set of technically challenging variants was synthesized and introduced into a known genomic background. This specimen was sequenced by 7 laboratories using 10 different NGS workflows. The specimen was compatible with all 10 workflows and presented biochemical and bioinformatic challenges similar to those of patient specimens. Only 10 of 22 challenging variants were correctly identified by all 10 workflows, and only 3 workflows detected all 22. Many, but not all, of the sensitivity limitations were bioinformatic in nature. We conclude that Synthetic controls can provide an efficient and informative mechanism to augment studies with technically challenging variants that are difficult to obtain otherwise. Data from such specimens can facilitate inter-laboratory methodologic comparisons and can help establish standards that improve communication between clinicians and laboratories.",

    "abstract": "Vernal pool clam shrimp (Eulimnadia texana) are a promising model system due to their ease of lab culture, short generation time, modest sized genome, a somewhat rare stable androdioecious sex determination system, and a requirement to reproduce via desiccated diapaused eggs. We generated a highly contiguous genome assembly using 46X of PacBio long read data and 216X of Illumina short reads, and annotated using Illumina RNAseq obtained from adult males or hermaphrodites. 85% of the 120Mb genome is contained in the largest 8 contigs, the smallest of which is 4.6Mb. The assembly contains 98% of transcripts predicted via RNAseq. This assembly is qualitatively different from scaffolded Illumina assemblies: it is produced from long reads that contain sequence data along their entire length, and is thus gap free. The contiguity of the assembly allows us to order the HOX genes within the genome, identifying two loci that contain HOX gene orthologs, and which approximately maintain the order observed in other arthropods. We identified a partial duplication of the Antennapedia gene adjacent to the few genes homologous to the Bithorax locus. Because the sex chromosome of an androdioecious species is of special interest, we used existing allozyme and microsatellite markers to identify the E. texana sex chromosome, and find that it comprises nearly half of the genome of this species. Linkage patterns indicate that recombination is extremely rare and perhaps absent in hermaphrodites, and as a result the location of the sex determining locus will be difficult to refine using recombination mapping.",

    "abstract": "Exome capture is an effective tool for surveying the genome for loci under selection. However, traditional methods require annotated genomic resources. Here, we present a method for creating cDNA probes from expressed mRNA, which are then used to enrich and capture genomic DNA for exon regions. This approach, called \\\"EecSeq\\\", eliminates the need for costly probe design and synthesis. We tested EecSeq in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, using a controlled exposure experiment. Four adult oysters were heat shocked at 36{degrees} C for 1 hour along with four control oysters kept at 14{degrees} C. Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared for two individuals from each treatment and pooled. Half of the combined library was used for probe synthesis and half was sequenced to evaluate capture efficiency. Genomic DNA was extracted from all individuals, enriched via captured probes, and sequenced directly. We found that EecSeq had an average capture sensitivity of 86.8% across all known exons and had over 99.4% sensitivity for exons with detectable levels of expression in the mRNA library. For all mapped reads, over 47.9% mapped to exons and 37.0% mapped to expressed targets, which is similar to previously published exon capture studies. EecSeq displayed relatively even coverage within exons (i.e. minor \\\"edge effects\\\") and even coverage across exon GC content. We discovered 5,951 SNPs with a minimum average coverage of 80X, with 3,508 SNPs appearing in exonic regions. We show that EecSeq provides comparable, if not superior, specificity and capture efficiency compared to costly, traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Humans are able to identify and track a target speaker amid a cacophony of acoustic interference, which is often referred to as the cocktail party phenomenon. Results from several decades of studying this phenomenon have culminated in recent years in various promising attempts to decode the attentional state of a listener in a competing-speaker environment from non-invasive neuroimaging recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, most existing approaches compute correlation-based measures by either regressing the features of each speech stream to the M/EEG channels (the decoding approach) or vice versa (the encoding approach). These procedures operate in an offline fashion, i.e., require the entire duration of the experiment and multiple trials to provide robust results. Therefore, they cannot be used in emerging applications such as smart hearing aid devices, where a single trial must be used in real-time to decode the attentional state. In this paper, we close this gap by developing an algorithmic pipeline for real-time decoding of the attentional state. Our proposed framework consists of three main modules: 1) Real-time and robust estimation of encoding or decoding coefficients, achieved by sparse adaptive filtering, 2) Extracting reliable markers of the attentional state, and thereby generalizing the widely-used correlation-based measures thereof, and 3) Devising a near real-time state-space estimator that translates the noisy and variable attention markers to robust and reliable estimates of the attentional state with minimal delay. Our proposed algorithms integrate various techniques including forgetting factor-based adaptive filtering, {ell}1-regularization, forward-backward splitting algorithms, fixed-lag smoothing, and Expectation Maximization. We validate the performance of our proposed framework using comprehensive simulations as well as application to experimentally acquired M/EEG data. Our results reveal that the proposed real-time algorithms perform nearly as accurate as the existing state-of-the-art offline techniques, while providing a significant degree of adaptivity, statistical robustness, and computational savings.",

    "abstract": "Since the middle of the 1990s, studies of resting-state fMRI/BOLD data have explored the correlation patterns of activity across the whole brain, which is referred to as functional connectivity (FC). Among the many methods that have been developed to interpret FC, a recently proposed model-based approach describes the propagation of fluctuating BOLD activity within the recurrently connected brain network by inferring the effective connectivity (EC). In this model, EC quantifies the strengths of directional interactions between brain regions, viewed from the proxy of BOLD activity. In addition, the tuning procedure for the model provides estimates for the local variability (input variances) to explain how the observed FC is generated. Generalizing, the network dynamics can be studied in the context of an input-output mapping - determined by EC - for the second-order statistics of fluctuating nodal activities. The present paper focuses on the following detection paradigm: observing output covariances, how discriminative is the (estimated) network model with respect to various input covariance patterns? An application with the model fitted to experimental fMRI data - movie viewing versus resting state - illustrates that changes in excitability and changes in brain coordination go hand in hand.",

The presence of apical membrane is thought to have a profound influence on maintaining the stem cell state. With the onset of neurogenesis cells lose their polarization and the concomitant loss of the apical domain coincides with a loss of the stem cell identity. Very little is known about the molecular signals controlling apical membrane size. Here we use two neuroepithelial cell systems, one derived from regenerating axolotl spinal cord and the other from human ESCs to identify a conserved molecular signalling pathway initiated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) that controls apical membrane size and consequently controls and maintains epithelial organization and lumen size in neuroepithelial rosettes. This apical domain size increase occurs independently of effects on proliferation and involves a SRF-dependent transcriptional induction of junctional and apical membrane components.",

    "abstract": "The thoughts and feelings people have about pain (referred to as  pain expectations) are known to alter the perception of pain. However little is known about the cognitive processes that underpin pain expectations, or what drives the differing effect that pain expectations have between individuals. This paper details the testing of a model of pain perception which formalises the response to pain in terms of a Bayesian prior-to-posterior updating process. Using data acquired from a short and deception-free predictive cue task, it was found that this Bayesian model predicted ratings of pain better than other, simpler models. At the group level, the results confirmed two core predictions of predictive coding; that expectation alters perception and that increased uncertainty in the expectation reduces its impact on perception. The addition to the model of parameters relating to trait differences in pain expectation, improved its fit, suggesting that such traits play a significant role in perception beyond those expectations triggered by the pain cue. When model parameters were allowed to vary by participant, the models fit improved further. This final model produced a characterisation of each individuals sensitivity to pain expectations. This model is relevant for the understanding of the cognitive basis of pain expectations and could potentially act as a useful tool for guiding patient stratification and clinical experimentation.",

Grenache showed stronger adjustments of leaf, plant, and root hydraulic conductances to decreased soil moisture and a steeper correlation of stomatal conductance (gs) to [ABA]xylem than Syrah resulting in greater conservation of soil moisture, but not necessarily more isohydric behaviour. Under well-watered conditions, changes in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) had a strong influence on gs in both cultivars with adjustments of leaf hydraulic conductance. Grenache was more sensitive to decreases in soil water availability compared to Syrah that rather responded to VPD. There were stronger correlations between plant hydraulic parameters and changes in aquaporin gene expression in leaves and roots of Grenache. Overall, the results reinforce the hypothesis that both hydraulic and chemical signals significantly contribute to the differences in water conservation behaviours of the two cultivars.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPseudogenes are non-functional sequences in the genome with homologous sequences that are functional (i.e. genes). They are abundant in eukaryotes where they have been extensively investigated, while in prokaryotes they are significantly scarcer and less well studied. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of pseudogenes in prokaryotes. For this analysis we consider a broad range of bacteria, but also focus on the leprosy pathogen Mycobacterium leprae, which contains an unusually large number of pseudogenes which comprise approximately 40% of its entire genome.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed an informatics-based approach to characterize the evolution of pseudogenes. This approach combines tools from phylogenomics, genomics, and transcriptomics. The results we obtain suggest the presence of two mechanisms for pseudogene formation: failed horizontal gene transfer events and disruption of native genes.\\n\\nConclusionsWe conclude that while in most bacteria the former is most likely responsible for the majority of pseudogenization events, in mycobacteria, and in particular in M. leprae with its exceptionally high pseudogene numbers, the latter predominates. We believe that our study sheds new light on the evolution of pseudogenes in bacteria, by utilizing new methodologies that are applied to the unusually abundant M. leprae pseudogenes and their orthologs. As such, we anticipate that it will be of broad interest to both evolutionary biologists as well as microbiologists.",

    "abstract": "Most neurons of the mammalian brain display intrinsic resonance with frequency selectivity (fR) for inputs within the theta-range (4-10 Hz). Variations in network oscillation along this range depend on the animal behavior; however, whether neurons can dynamically tune their fR has not been addressed. Using slice electrophysiology, dynamic clamping and computer modeling we studied three types of cortical neurons, finding that the input resistance (Rin) inversely sets fR into the theta range, following a power law. We demonstrate that physiological changes in Rin modulate fR and response phase, serving as a mechanism that instantaneously tunes oscillatory responses. Moreover, these modulations are translated into spiking regimes, modifying spike frequency and timing. Since synaptic inputs reduce Rin, this modulation provides a mean for adjusting the frequency and timing of firing of individual neurons in interplay with the network fluctuations. This might be a widespread property among resonant neurons.",

    "abstract": "There is much debate about the mechanisms by which molecular motions influence catalysis in enzymes. This work investigates the connection between stochastic protein dynamics and function for the enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA) in wild-type (WT) form, and three variants that features several mutations that are distal from the active site. Previous biophysical studies have suggested that conformational exchange between a  major active and a  minor inactive state on millisecond time scales plays a key role in catalysis for CypA. Here this hypothesis was addressed by a variety of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation techniques. The simulations reproduce X-ray crystallography derived evidence for a shift in populations of major and minor active site conformations between the wild-type and mutant forms. Strikingly, exchange between these active site conformations occurs at a rate that is 5 to 6 orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed. Further analyses indicate that the minor active site conformation is catalytically impaired, and that decreased catalytic activity of the mutants may be explained by changes in Phe113 motions on a ns-s time scale. Therefore previously described millisecond time scale motions may not be necessary to explain allosteric effects in CypA mutants.",

    "abstract": "A structural characterization of the interaction between T cell receptors (TCR) and cognate peptide-MHC (pMHC) is central to understanding adaptive T cell mediated immunity. X-ray crystallography, although the source of much structural data, traditionally provides only a static snapshot of the protein. Given the emerging evidence for the important role of conformational dynamics in protein function, we interrogated 309 crystallographic structures of pMHC complexes using ensemble refinement, a technique that can extract dynamic information from the X-ray data. We found that in a large number of systems ensemble methods were able to uncover previously hidden evidence of significant conformational plasticity, thereby revealing additional information that can build upon and significantly enhance functional interpretations that are based on a single static structure. Notable examples include the interpretation of differences in the disease association of HLA subtypes, the relationship between peptide prominence and TCR recognition, the role of conformational flexibility in vaccine design, and discriminating between induced fit and conformational selection models of TCR binding. We show that the currently widespread practise of analyzing pMHC interactions via the study of a single crystallographic structure does not make use of pertinent and easily accessible information from X-ray data concerning alternative protein conformations. This new analysis therefore not only highlights the capacity for ensemble methods to significantly enrich the interpretation of decades of structural data, but also provides previously missing information concerning the dynamics of existing characterized TCR-pMHC interactions.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in both positive and negative regulation of transcription. Long ncRNAs are often enriched in the nucleus and at chromatin but whether chromatin-release plays a functional role is unknown. Here, we used epigenetic marks, expression level and strength of chromatin interactions to group long ncRNAs and find that those engaged in strong chromatin interactions are less enriched at chromatin in MCF-7 cells, suggesting a functional involvement of chromatin-release of long ncRNAs in transcriptional regulation. To study this further, we identify the long ncRNA A-ROD, an activating regulator of the Wnt signaling inhibitor DKK1. We show that A-ROD enhances transcription elongation of DKK1 in an RNA-dependent manner and that A-ROD recruits EBP1 to the DKK1 promoter. Our data suggest that the activating function depends on the release of A-ROD from chromatin, and further identify a functional regulatory interaction mediated by A-ROD in the transcription activation of DKK1. We propose that the release of a subset of long ncRNAs is important for their function, adding a new mechanistic perspective to the subcellular localization of long ncRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is a state of immobility characterized by three key criteria: an increased threshold of arousal, rapid reversal to an alert state, and evidence of homeostatic \\\"rebound sleep\\\" in which there is an increase of time spent in this quiescent state following sleep deprivation. Common European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, show states of quiescence during which they meet the last two of these three criteria, yet also show spontaneous bursts of arm and eye movements that accompany rapid changes in chromatophore patterns in the skin. Here we report that this rapid-eye-movement (REM)-like state is cyclic in nature. Iterations of the REM-like state last 2.42 {+/-} 0.22 min ({+/-}SE) and alternate with 34.01 {+/-} 1.49 min of the quiescent sleep-like state. These states alternate for durations lasting 176.89 {+/-} 36.71 min. We found clear evidence that this REM-like state (i) occurs in animals younger than previously reported; (ii) follows an ultradian pattern; (iii) includes intermittent dynamic chromatophore patterning, representing fragments of normal patterning seen in the waking state for a wide range of signaling and camouflage; and (iv) shows variability in the intensity of expression of these skin patterns between and within individuals. These data suggest that cephalopods, which are molluscs with an elaborate brain and complex behavior, possess a sleep-like state that resembles behaviorally the vertebrate REM sleep state, although the exact nature and mechanism of this form of sleep may differ from that of vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a measure of the evolutionary legacy of a group of species, which can be used to define conservation priorities. It has been shown that an important loss of species diversity can sometimes lead to a much less important loss of PD, depending on the topology of the species tree and on the distribution of its branch lengths. However, the rate of decrease of PD strongly depends on the relative depths of the nodes in the tree and on the order in which species become extinct. We introduce a new, sampling-consistent, three-parameter model generating random trees with covarying topology, clade relative depths and clade relative extinction risks. This model can be seen as an extension to Aldous one parameter splitting model {beta}, which controls for tree balance) with two additional parameters: a new parameter  quantifying the correlation between the richness of a clade and its relative depth, and a parameter{eta} quantifying the correlation between the richness of a clade and its frequency (relative abundance or range), taken herein as a proxy for its overall extinction risk. We show on simulated phylogenies that loss of PD depends on the combined effect of all three parameters, {beta},  and{eta} . In particular, PD may decrease as fast as species diversity when high extinction risks are clustered within small, old clades, corresponding to a parameter range that we term the  thin ice zone ({beta} < -1 or  < 0;{eta} > 1). Besides, when high extinction risks are clustered within large clades, the loss of PD can be higher in trees that are more balanced ({beta} > 0), in contrast to the predictions of earlier studies based on simpler models. We propose a Monte-Carlo algorithm, tested on simulated data, to infer all three parameters. Applying it to a real dataset comprising 120 bird clades (class Aves) with known range sizes, we show that parameter estimates precisely fall close to close to a  thin ice zone: the combination of their ranking tree shape and non-random extinctions risks makes them prone to a sudden collapse of PD.",

When the tissue is stressed by exercise or by an acute or chronic insult, the different cell types are activated, exchange signals and initiate a finely-orchestrated regeneration process to prevent the loss of muscle mass. This cell variety is exacerbated by an additional intra population heterogeneity, where the cell population boundaries often lose their significance. Here, we applied a high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry analysis to solve the cellular and molecular complexity of the muscle tissue in different physiological and pathological conditions. Taken together, our results provide a comprehensive picture both of muscle cell population homeostasis during ageing and of the changes induced by a perturbation of the system, be it chronic (dystrophy) or acute (cardiotoxin).",

    "abstract": "In Chesapeake Bay, the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria (thin-shelled, deep-burrowing) exhibits population declines when predators are active and persists at low densities. In contrast, the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria (thick-shelled, shallow-burrowing) has a stable population and age distribution. We examined the potential for habitat and predators to control densities and distributions of bivalves in a field caging experiment (Mya only) and laboratory mesocosm experiments (both species). In the field, clams exposed to predators experienced 76.3% greater mortality as compared to caged individuals, and blue crabs were likely responsible for most of the mortality of juvenile Mya. In mesocosm experiments, Mya had lower survival in sand and seagrass than in shell hash or oyster shell habitats. However, crabs often missed one or more prey in seagrass, shell, and oyster shell habitats. Predator search times and encounter rates declined when prey were at low densities, likely due to the added cost of inefficient foraging; however, this effect was more pronounced for Mya than for Mercenaria. Mercenaria had higher survival than Mya in mesocosm experiments, likely because predators feeding on Mercenaria spent less time foraging than those feeding on Mya. Mya may retain a low-density refuge from predation even with the loss of structurally complex habitats, though a loss of habitat refuge may result in clam densities that are not sustainable. A better understanding of density-dependent predator-prey interactions is necessary to prevent loss of food-web integrity and to conserve marine resources.",

    "abstract": "The high mutation rates of RNA viruses lead to rapid genetic diversification, which can enable cooperative interactions between variants in a viral population. We previously described two distinct variants of H3N2 influenza virus that cooperate in cell culture. These variants differ by a single mutation, D151G, in the neuraminidase protein. The D151G mutation reaches a stable frequency of about 50% when virus is passaged in cell culture. However, it is unclear whether selection for the cooperative benefits of D151G is a cell-culture phenomenon, or whether the mutation is also sometimes present at appreciable frequency in virus populations sampled directly from infected humans. Prior work has not detected D151G in unpassaged clinical samples, but these studies have used methods like Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing that are relatively insensitive to low-frequency variation. We identified nine samples of human H3N2 influenza collected between 2013 to 2015 in which Sanger sequencing had detected a high frequency of the D151G mutation following one to three passages in cell culture. We deep-sequenced the unpassaged clinical samples to identify low-frequency viral variants. The frequency of D151G did not exceed the frequency of library preparation and sequencing errors in any of the sequenced samples. We conclude that passage in cell culture is primarily responsible for the frequent observations of D151G in recent H3N2 influenza strains.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEViruses mutate rapidly, and recent studies of RNA viruses have shown that related viral variants can sometimes cooperate to improve each others growth. We previously described two variants of H3N2 influenza virus that cooperate in cell culture. The mutation responsible for cooperation is often observed when human samples of influenza virus are grown in the lab before sequencing, but it is unclear whether the mutation also exists in human infections or is exclusively the result of lab passage. We identified nine human isolates of influenza that had developed the cooperating mutation after being grown in the lab, and performed highly sensitive deep-sequencing of the unpassaged clinical samples to determine whether the mutation existed in the original human infections. We found no evidence of the cooperating mutation in the unpassaged samples, suggesting that the cooperation primarily arises in laboratory conditions.",
