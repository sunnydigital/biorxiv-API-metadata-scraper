    "abstract": "Identifying what drives individual heterogeneity has been of long interest to ecologists, evolutionary biologists and biodemographers, because only such identification provides deeper understanding of ecological and evolutionary population dynamics. In natural populations one is challenged to accurately decompose the drivers of heterogeneity among individuals as genetically fixed or selectively neutral. Rather than working on wild populations we present here data from a simple bacterial system in the lab, Escherichia coli. Our system, based on cutting-edge microfluidic techniques, provides high control over the genotype and the environment. It therefore allows to unambiguously decompose and quantify fixed genetic variability and dynamic stochastic variability among individuals. We show that within clonal individual variability (dynamic heterogeneity) in lifespan and lifetime reproduction is dominating at about 82-88%, over the 12-18% genetically (adaptive fixed) driven differences. The genetic differences among the clonal strains still lead to substantial variability in population growth rates (fitness), but, as well understood based on foundational work in population genetics, the within strain neutral variability slows adaptive change, by enhancing genetic drift, and lowering overall population growth. We also revealed a surprising diversity in senescence patterns among the clonal strains, which indicates diverse underlying cell-intrinsic processes that shape these demographic patterns. Such diversity is surprising since all cells belong to the same bacteria species, E. coli, and still exhibit patterns such as classical senescence, non-senescence, or negative senescence. We end by discussing whether similar levels of non-genetic variability might be detected in other systems and close by stating the open questions how such heterogeneity is maintained, how it has evolved, and whether it is adaptive.\\n\\nData depositionThe processed image analysis data, R code, as well as the Leslie matrices will be archived at Dryad.org.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells take a variable lag time and maintain a multi-drug tolerant non-growing state before resuming growth when encountering growth-supportive conditions. Some of them exhibit an extraordinarily long lag, as pathogenic persisters do. It remains unknown on what determines lag time duration. Here, we unveiled a subcellular structure, termed quiescent body, that is formed in bacterial cells entering non-growing state and sequesters selected proteins essential for cell growth. Their formation occurs progressively in each cell and heterogeneously among individual cells. They only dissolve in re-growing cells to release proteins for immediate re-functioning when conditions become fit. Quiescent body, whose degree of formation is highly correlated with duration of lag time or level of antibiotic tolerance, apparently functions as a biological timer for bacterial growth resumption. Further, suppressing their formation, which directly relies on cellular respiration complexes, or promoting their dissolution might be a viable strategy to eradicate persisters.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the forebrain neuromodulation by the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is fundamental for cognitive and systems neuroscience. The diffuse projections of individual LC neurons and presumably their synchronous spiking have long been perceived as features of the global nature of noradrenergic neuromodulation. Yet, the commonly referenced \\\"synchrony\\\" underlying global neuromodulation, has never been assessed in a large population, nor has it been related to projection target specificity. Here, we recorded up to 52 single units simultaneously (3164 unit pairs in total) in rat LC and characterized projections by stimulating 15 forebrain sites. Spike count correlations were low and, surprisingly, only 13% of pairwise spike trains had synchronized spontaneous discharge. Notably, even noxious sensory stimulation did not activate the entire population, only evoking synchronized responses in ~16% of units on each trial. We also identified novel infra-slow (0.01-1 Hz) fluctuations of LC unit spiking that were asynchronous across the population. A minority, synchronized possibly by gap junctions, was biased toward restricted (non-global) forebrain projection patterns. Finally, we characterized two types of LC single units differing by waveform shape, propensity for synchronization, and interactions with cortex. These cell types formed finely-structured ensembles. Our findings suggest that the LC conveys a highly complex, differentiated, and potentially target-specific neuromodulatory signal.",

    "abstract": "Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204 (N=32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and {Omega}nyx).\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe describe Latent change score modelling as a flexible statistical tool\\nC_LIO_LIKey developmental questions can be readily formalized using LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWe provide accessible open source code and software examples to fit LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWhite matter structural change is negatively correlated with processing speed gains\\nC_LIO_LIFrontal lobe thinning in adolescence is more variable in males than females\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During asymmetric cell division, dynein generates forces, which position the spindle to reflect polarity and ensure correct daughter cell fates. The transient cortical localization of dynein raises the question of its targeting. We found that it accumulates at the microtubule plus-ends like in budding yeast, indirectly hitch-hiking on EBP-2EB1 likely via dynactin. Importantly, this mechanism, which modestly accounts for cortical forces, does not transport dynein, which displays the same binding/unbinding dynamics as EBP-2EB1. At the cortex, dynein tracks can be classified as having either directed or diffusive-like motion. Diffusive-like tracks reveal force-generating dyneins. Their densities are higher on the posterior tip of the embryos, where GPR-1/2LGN concentrate, but their durations are symmetric. Since dynein flows to the cortex are non-polarized, we suggest that this posterior enrichment increases dynein binding, thus accounts for the force imbalance reflecting polarity, and supplements the regulation of mitotic progression via the non-polarized detachment rate.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfers between ancient species contain information about the relative timing of species diversification. Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers is detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result, often, no ranking of the species tree is compatible with the full set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers. Here we propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of (possibly inconsistent) time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum cumulated confidence score. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the potential of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency. MaxTiC is freely available, distributed along with a documentation and several examples: https://github.com/ssolo/ALE/tree/master/maxtic.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors are thought to generate force and directional motion via nonequilibrium switching between energy surfaces. Because all enzymes can undergo such switching, we hypothesized that the ability to generate rotary motion and torque is not unique to highly adapted biological motor proteins, but is instead a common feature of enzymes. We used molecular dynamics simulations to compute energy surfaces for hundreds of torsions in three enzymes, adenosine kinase, protein kinase A, and HIV-1 protease, and used these energy surfaces within a kinetic model that accounts for intersurface switching and intrasurface probability flows. When substrate is out of equilibrium with product, we find computed torsion rotation rates up ~140 cycle s-1, with stall torques up to ~2 kcal mol-1 cycle-1, and power outputs up to ~50 kcal mol-1 s-1. We argue that these enzymes are instances of a general phenomenon of directional probability flows on asymmetric energy surfaces for systems out of equilibrium. Thus, we conjecture that cyclic probability fluxes, corresponding to rotations of torsions and higher-order collective variables, exist in any chiral molecule driven between states in a non-equilibrium manner; we call this the Asymmetry-Directionality conjecture. This is expected to apply as well to synthetic chiral molecules switched in a nonequilibrium manner between energy surfaces by light, redox chemistry, or catalysis.",

    "abstract": "We address the issue of reliably detecting and quantifying cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in neural time series. Based on non-linear auto-regressive models, the proposed method provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content of the signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a score of the model \\\"goodness of fit\\\" via the likelihood, enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; this data-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtained with invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans and rodents, we demonstrate that these models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics, but also reveal new insights such as the influence of the amplitude of the slow oscillation. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our parametric method can reveal neural couplings with shorter signals than non-parametric methods. We also show how the likelihood can be used to find optimal filtering parameters, suggesting new properties on the spectrum of the driving signal, but also to estimate the optimal delay between the coupled signals, enabling a directionality estimation in the coupling.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeural oscillations synchronize information across brain areas at various anatomical and temporal scales. Of particular relevance, slow fluctuations of brain activity have been shown to affect high frequency neural activity, by regulating the excitability level of neural populations. Such cross-frequency-coupling can take several forms. In the most frequently observed type, the power of high frequency activity is time-locked to a specific phase of slow frequency oscillations, yielding phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC). Even when readily observed in neural recordings, such non-linear coupling is particularly challenging to formally characterize. Typically, neuroscientists use band-pass filtering and Hilbert transforms with ad-hoc correlations. Here, we explicitly address current limitations and propose an alternative probabilistic signal modeling approach, for which statistical inference is fast and well-posed. To statistically model PAC, we propose to use non-linear auto-regressive models which estimate the spectral modulation of a signal conditionally to a driving signal. This conditional spectral analysis enables easy model selection and clear hypothesis-testing by using the likelihood of a given model. We demonstrate the advantage of the model-based approach on three datasets acquired in rats and in humans. We further provide novel neuroscientific insights on previously reported PAC phenomena, capturing two mechanisms in PAC: influence of amplitude and directionality estimation.",

However, the molecular basis of how these endosomal NHEs control endocytic trafficking is unclear. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we conducted cell-free organelle fusion assays to show that transport activity of the orthologous endosomal NHE Nhx1 is important for multivesicular body (MVB)-vacuolar lysosome fusion, the last step of endocytosis required for surface protein degradation. We find that deleting Nhx1 disrupts the fusogenicity of the MVB, not vacuole, by targeting pH-sensitive machinery downstream of the Rab-GTPase Ypt7 needed for SNARE-mediated lipid bilayer merger.

Overexpression and mislocalization of CENP-A has been observed in cancers and leads to aneuploidy in yeast, flies, and human cells. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cse4 by E3 ligases such as Psh1 and Sumo-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase (STUbL) Slx5 prevent mislocalization of Cse4. Previously, we identified Siz1 and Siz2 as the major E3 ligases for sumoylation of Cse4. In this study, we identify lysine 65 (K65) in Cse4 as a SUMO site and show that sumoylation of Cse4 K65 regulates its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by Slx5. Strains expressing cse4 K65R exhibit reduced levels of sumoylated and ubiquitinated Cse4 in vivo. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal reduced interaction of cse4 K65R with Slx5. Defects in sumoylation of cse4 K65R contribute to increased stability and mislocalization of cse4 K65R under normal physiological conditions. Based on the increased stability of cse4 K65R in psh1{triangleup} strains but not in slx5{triangleup} strains, we conclude that Slx5 targets sumoylated Cse4 K65 for ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis independent of Psh1. In summary, we have identified and characterized the physiological role of Cse4 sumoylation and determined that sumoylation of Cse4 K65 regulates ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and prevents mislocalization of Cse4 which is required for genome stability.",

    "abstract": "Individual alpha frequency (IAF) is a promising electrophysiological marker of interindividual differences in cognitive function. IAF has been linked with trait-like differences in information processing and general intelligence, and provides an empirical basis for the definition of individualised frequency bands. Despite its widespread application, however, there is little consensus on the optimal method for estimating IAF, and many common approaches are prone to bias and inconsistency. Here, we describe an automated strategy for deriving two of the most prevalent IAF estimators in the literature: peak alpha frequency (PAF) and centre of gravity (CoG). These indices are calculated from resting-state power spectra that have been smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (SGF). We evaluate the performance characteristics of this analysis procedure in both empirical and simulated EEG datasets. Applying the SGF technique to resting-state data from n = 63 healthy adults furnished 61 PAF, and 62 CoG estimates. The statistical properties of these estimates were consistent with previous reports. Simulation analyses revealed that the SGF routine was able to reliably extract target alpha components, even under relatively noisy spectral conditions. The routine consistently outperformed a simpler method of automated peak detection that did not involve spectral smoothing. The SGF technique is fast, open-source, and available in two popular programming languages (MATLAB and Python), and thus can easily be integrated within the most popular M/EEG toolsets (EEGLAB, FieldTrip and MNE-Python). As such, it affords a convenient tool for improving the reliability and replicability of future IAF-related research.",

We examined genetic correlations of PA with other traits and diseases, as well as tissue-specific gene expression patterns.

Variants in CADM2, a gene recently implicated in risk-taking behavior and other personality and cognitive traits, were found to be associated with regular engagement in strenuous sports or other exercises.

    "abstract": "Most transcription factors (TFs) can bind to a population of sequences closely related to a single optimal site. However, some TFs can bind to two distinct sequences that represent two local optima in the Gibbs free energy of binding ({Delta}G). To determine the molecular mechanism behind this effect, we solved the structures of human HOXB13 and CDX2 bound to their two optimal DNA sequences, CAATAAA and TCGTAAA. Thermodynamic analyses by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that both sites were bound with similar {Delta}G. However, the interaction with the CAA sequence was driven by change in enthalpy ({Delta}H), whereas the TCG site was bound with similar affinity due to smaller loss of entropy ({Delta}S). The common presence of at least two local optima is general to all macromolecular interactions, as {Delta}G depends on two partially independent variables {Delta}H and {Delta}S according to the central equation of thermodynamics, {Delta}G = {Delta}H - T{Delta}S.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of nociceptor activity is important for the prevention of spontaneous pain and hyperalgesia. To identify the critical K+ channels that regulate nociceptor excitability we performed a forward genetic screen using a Drosophila larval nociception paradigm. Knockdown of three K+ channel loci, the small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK), seizure and tiwaz, resulted in marked hypersensitive nociception behaviors. In more detailed studies of SK, we found that hypersensitive phenotypes could be recapitulated with a genetically null allele. Importantly, the null mutant phenotype could be rescued with tissue specific expression of an SK cDNA in nociceptors. Optical recordings from nociceptive neurons showed a significant increase in mechanically activated Ca2+ signals in SK mutant nociceptors. SK showed expression in peripheral neurons. Interestingly SK proteins localized to axons of these neurons but were not detected in dendrites. Our findings suggest a major role for SK channels in the regulation of nociceptor excitation and they are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the important site of action is within dendrites.\\n\\nHighlights-Specific potassium channels regulate nociceptor excitability.\\n-SK channels have a critical function in nociception.\\n-SK channels specifically localize to sensory axons\\n-SK channels are not detectable in sensory dendrites.",

    "abstract": "Executive SummaryForests are important determinants of the carbon cycle, and they provide countless ecosystem services to support billions of people worldwide. Global-scale forest restoration is one of our most effective weapons in the fight against biodiversity loss, rural poverty and climate change. In this report, we generate a spatial map of tree density within the potential forest restoration areas delineated by the IUCN/WRIs \\\"Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities\\\" to estimate the potential number of trees that could be restored at a global scale. We also estimate the number of trees that might be saved by avoiding deforestation in currently forested areas.\\n\\nWe show that the restoration areas have the capacity to support a total of 1.33 trillion trees. However, given that a considerable proportion of these areas already contain forests, we estimate that 589 billion new trees (larger than 10 cm diameter) could be restored within these areas, which would have the potential to store 65-91 Gigatonnes of carbon after reaching forest maturation. These values will increase marginally over time, as deforestation is responsible for the removal of living trees within the restoration areas. However, if only 50% or 25% of the mosaic areas (the largest of the designated restoration types) are available for reforestation, this total number will fall to approximately 360, or 246 billion trees, respectively, with corresponding decreases in potential carbon storage. Given that anthropogenic carbon emissions are currently in the order of 9-12 Gigatonnes per year, effective global-scale restoration might potentially have a valuable impact on global-scale climate mitigation over the rest of this century.\\n\\nThis report was produced with funding from WWF-UK as part of the Trillion Trees programme with the Wildlife Conservation Society and BirdLife International",

    "abstract": "Protein function arises from a poorly defined pattern of cooperative energetic interactions between amino acid residues. Strategies for deducing this pattern have been proposed, but lack of benchmark data has limited experimental verification. Here, we extend deep-mutation technologies to enable measurement of many thousands of pairwise amino acid couplings in members of a protein family. The data show that despite great evolutionary divergence, homologous proteins conserve a sparse, spatially distributed network of cooperative interactions between amino acids that underlies function. This pattern is quantitatively captured in the coevolution of amino acid positions, especially as indicated by the statistical coupling analysis (SCA), providing experimental confirmation of the key tenets of this method. This work establishes a clear link between physical constraints on protein function and sequence analysis, enabling a general practical approach for understanding the structural basis for protein function.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is an 8-fold symmetrical channel providing selective transport of biomolecules across the nuclear envelope. Each NPC consists of ~30 different nuclear pore proteins (Nups) all present in multiple copies per NPC. Significant progress has recently been made in the characterization of the vertebrate NPC structure, however, because of the estimated size differences between the vertebrate and yeast NPC, it has been unclear whether the NPC architecture is conserved between species. Here, we have developed a quantitative image analysis pipeline, termed Nuclear Rim Intensity Measurement or NuRIM, to precisely determine copy numbers for almost all Nups within native NPCs of budding yeast cells. Our analysis demonstrates that the majority of yeast Nups are present at most in 16 copies per NPC. This reveals a dramatic difference to the stoichiometry determined for the human NPC suggesting that despite a high degree of individual Nup conservation, the yeast and human NPC architecture is significantly different. Furthermore, using NuRIM we examined the effects of mutations on NPC stoichiometry. We demonstrate for two paralog pairs of key scaffold Nups, Nup170/Nup157 and Nup192/Nup188 that their altered expression leads to significant changes in Nup stoichiometry inducing either voids in the NPC structure or substitution of one paralog by the other. Thus, our results not only provide accurate stoichiometry information for the intact yeast NPC but also reveal an intriguing compositional plasticity of the NPC architecture, which may explain how differences in NPC composition could arise in the course of evolution.\\n\\nSignificanceThe nuclear pore complex (NPC) is one of the largest protein complexes in eukaryotes comprising over 500 nucleoporin subunits. The NPC is essential for transport of biomolecules across the nuclear envelope, however, due to its enormous size, it has been a challenge to characterize its molecular architecture. Herein, we have developed a novel, widely applicable imaging pipeline to determine the absolute nucleoporin abundances in native yeast NPCs. This reveals that the NPC composition dramatically differs between yeast and human despite an overall conservation of individual subunits. We also applied our imaging pipeline to examine yeast mutants revealing a remarkable compositional plasticity of NPCs. Our stoichiometry analyses provide an important resource for the generation of high-resolution structure models of the NPC.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function variants in NOTCH1 cause left ventricular outflow tract obstructive defects (LVOTO) in a small percentage of families. Clinical surveys report an increased prevalence of missense variants in NOTCH1 in family members of individuals with LVOTO and other types of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, the risk conferred by rare variants in NOTCH1 for LVOTO remains largely uncharacterized. In a cohort of 49 families affected by hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a severe form of LVOTO, we discovered predicted loss of function NOTCH1 variants in 6% of individuals. Rare missense variants were found in an additional 16% of families. To make a quantitative estimate of the genetic risk posed by variants in NOTCH1 for LVOTO, we studied associations of 400 coding and non-coding variants in NOTCH1 in 271 adult cases and 333,571 controls from the UK Biobank. Two rare intronic variants in strong linkage disequilibrium displayed significant association with risk for LVOTO (g.chr9:139427582C>T, Odds Ratio 16.9, p=3.12e-6; g.chr9:139435649C>T, Odds Ratio 19.6, p = 2.44e-6) amongst European-ancestry British individuals. This result was replicated in an independent analysis of 51 cases and 68,901 controls of non-European and mixed ancestry. We conclude that carrying rare predicted loss of function variants or either of two intronic variants in NOTCH1 confer significant risk for LVOTO. Our approach demonstrates the utility of population-based datasets in quantifying the specific risk of individual variants for disease related phenotypes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryCongenital heart defects are the most common class of birth defect and are present in 1% of live births. Although CHD cases are often clustered in families, and thus the causal variant(s) are seemingly inherited, finding genetic variants causing these defects has been challenging. With the knowledge that variation in the NOTCH1 gene previously has been associated with CHDs affecting the left side of the heart, our aim was to further investigate the role of different types of NOTCH1 variants in left sided CHDs in two cohorts - a cohort of Finnish families with severe lesions affecting the left side of the heart, and the UK Biobank population including individuals with less severe left-sided lesions such as bicuspid aortic valve, congenital aortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta. We found a causal loss-of-function NOTCH1 variant in 6% of the families in the Finnish cohort and in the UK Biobank cohort, we identified two rare variants in the non-coding region of NOTCH1, associated with severe left-sided CHDs. These findings support screening of NOTCH1 loss-of-function variants in patients with severe left sided congenital heart defects and suggests that non-coding region variants in NOTCH1 play a role in CHDs.",

Interestingly, although BET inhibition by JQ1 led to complete reduction of BRD2 binding to chromatin, only local changes of H4K5acK8ac levels were observed. In addition, a remarkable number of BRD2-bound genes, including MYC and its downstream target genes, were transcriptionally upregulated upon JQ1 treatment. Using BRD2-enriched sites and transcriptional activity analysis, we identified candidate transcription factors potentially involved in the JQ1 response in BRD2-dependent and independent manner.",

    "abstract": "Plant aluminum activated malate transporters (ALMTs) are currently classified as anion channels; they are also known to be regulated by diverse signals leading to a range of physiological responses. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) regulation of anion flux through ALMT proteins requires the presence of a specific amino acid motif in ALMTs that shares similarity with a GABA-binding site in mammalian GABAA receptors. Here, we explore why TaALMT1-activation leads to a negative correlation between malate efflux and endogenous GABA concentrations ([GABA]i) in both wheat root tips and in heterologous expression systems. We show that TaALMT1 activation reduces [GABA]i because TaALMT1 facilitates GABA efflux. TaALMT1-expression also leads to GABA transport into cells, demonstrated by a yeast complementation assay and via 14CGABA uptake into TaALMT1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes; this was found to be a general feature of all ALMTs we examined. Mutation of the GABA motif (TaALMT1F213C) prevented both GABA influx and efflux, and uncoupled the relationship between malate efflux and [GABA]i. We conclude that ALMTs are likely to act as both GABA and anion transporters in planta. GABA and malate appear to interact with ALMTs in a complex manner regulating each others transport, suggestive of a role for ALMTs in communicating metabolic status.",

Moreover, computational tools to rapidly compile and update such databases to accommodate the rapid increase in new reference genomes do not exist. As a result, database-guided analyses often fail to profile a substantial fraction of metagenomic shotgun sequencing reads from complex microbiomes.\\n\\nResultsWe report pipelines that efficiently traverse all open access microbial genomes and assemble non-redundant genomic information. The pipelines result in two species-resolution microbial reference databases of relatively small sizes: reprDB, which assembles microbial representative or reference genomes, and panDB, for which we developed a novel iterative alignment algorithm to identify and assemble non-redundant genomic regions in multiple sequenced strains. With the databases, we managed to assign taxonomic labels and genome positions to the majority of metagenomic reads from human skin and gut microbiomes, demonstrating a significant improvement over a previous database-guided analysis on the same datasets.\\n\\nConclusionsreprDB and panDB leverage the rapid increases in the number of open access microbial genomes to more fully profile metagenomic samples.

    "abstract": "Bistable switches are common gene regulatory motifs directing two mutually exclusive gene expression states, and consequently distinct cell fates. Theoretical studies suggest that the simple circuitry of bistable switches is sufficient to encode more than two cell fates due to the non-equilibrium, heterogeneous cellular environment, allowing a high degree of adaptation and differentiation. However, new cell fates arising from a classic bistable switch without rewiring the circuitry have not been experimentally observed. By developing a new, dual single-molecule gene-expression reporting system in live E. coli cells, we investigated the expression dynamics of two mutually repressing transcription factors, CI and Cro, in the classic genetic switch of bacteriophage {lambda}. We found that in addition to the two expected high-Cro and high-CI production states, there existed two new ones, in which neither CI nor Cro was produced, or both CI and Cro were produced. We constructed the corresponding potential landscape and mapped the transition kinetics between the four production states, providing insight into possible state-switching rates and paths. These findings uncover new cell fate potentials beyond the classical picture of {lambda} switch, and open a new window to explore the genetic and environmental origins of the cell fate decision-making process in gene regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "O_LIIn animals, behavioural responses may play an important role in determining population persistence in the face of environmental changes. Body size is a key trait central to many life history traits and behaviours. While behaviours are typically assumed to be highly plastic, size correlations may impose constraints on their adaptive value when size itself is subject to environmental changes.\\nC_LIO_LIUrbanization is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing web-building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size, and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we disentangle direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity at two spatial scales.\\nC_LIO_LISpiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes. Spiders thus altered different components of their web-building behaviours independently in response to urbanization: mesh width and web surface decreased independently with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. These responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that responses in typically size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximisation in novel environments. The spatial scale of the behavioural responses to urbanization suggest contributions of both genetic adaptation and plasticity. Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, Araneus diadematus abundances were remarkably similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "SEC23 is a core component of the coat protein-complex II (COPII)-coated vesicle, which mediates transport of secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi1-3. Mammals express 2 paralogs for SEC23 (SEC23A and SEC23B). Though the SEC23 gene duplication dates back >500 million years, both SEC23s are ~85% identical at the amino acid sequence level. In humans, deficiency for SEC23A or SEC23B results in cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia4 or congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAII), respectively5. The disparate human syndromes and reports of secretory cargos with apparent paralog-specific dependence6,7, suggest unique functions for the two SEC23 paralogs. Here we show indistinguishable intracellular interactomes for human SEC23A and SEC23B, complementation of yeast SEC23 by both human and murine SEC23A/B paralogs, and the rescue of lethality resulting from Sec23b disruption in zebrafish by a Sec23a-expressing transgene. Finally, we demonstrate that the Sec23a coding sequence inserted into the endogenous murine Sec23b locus fully rescues the mortality and severe pancreatic phenotype previously reported with SEC23B-deficiency in the mouse8-10. Taken together, these data indicate that the disparate phenotypes of SEC23A and SEC23B deficiency likely result from evolutionary shifts in gene expression program rather than differences in protein function, a paradigm likely applicable to other sets of paralogous genes. These findings also suggest the potential for increased expression of SEC23A as a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of CDAII, with potential relevance to other disorders due to mutations in paralogous genes.",

    "abstract": "Meiosis is one of the most conserved molecular processes in eukaryotes. The fidelity of pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes has a major impact on the proper transmission of genetic information. Aberrant chromosomal transmission can have major phenotypic consequences, yet the mechanisms are poorly understood. Fungi are excellent models to investigate processes of chromosomal transmission, because many species have highly polymorphic genomes that include accessory chromosomes. Inheritance of accessory chromosomes is often unstable and chromosomal losses have little impact on fitness. We analyzed chromosomal inheritance in 477 progeny coming from two crosses of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. For this, we developed a high-throughput screening method based on restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) that generated dense coverage of genetic markers along each chromosome. We identified rare instances of chromosomal duplications (disomy) in core chromosomes. Accessory chromosomes showed high overall frequencies of disomy. Chromosomal rearrangements were found exclusively on accessory chromosomes and were more frequent than disomy. Accessory chromosomes present in only one of the parents in an analyzed cross were inherited at significantly higher rates than the expected 1:1 segregation ratio. Both the chromosome and the parental background had significant impacts on the rates of disomy, losses, rearrangements and segregation distortion. We found that chromosomes with higher sequence similarity and lower repeat content were inherited more faithfully. The large number of rearranged progeny chromosomes identified in this species will enable detailed analyses of the mechanisms underlying chromosomal rearrangement.",

Whereas the control of mRNA synthesis through transcription has been well characterized, less is known about the regulation of mRNA turnover, and a consensus model explaining the wide variations in mRNA decay rates remains elusive. Here, we combine non-invasive transcriptome-wide mRNA production and stability measurements with selective and acute perturbations to demonstrate that mRNA degradation is tightly coupled to the regulation of translation, and that a competition between translation initiation and mRNA decay -but not codon optimality or elongation- is the major determinant of mRNA stability in yeast. Our refined measurements also reveal a remarkably dynamic transcriptome with an average mRNA half-life of only 4.8 minutes - much shorter than previously thought. Furthermore, global mRNA destabilization by inhibition of translation initiation induces a dose-dependent formation of processing bodies in which mRNAs can decay over time.",

Failed vs. bountiful crops differentially influenced methylation in grandchildren of paternal grandparents exposed to feast or famine during their Slow Growth Period (SGP), a sensitive period preceding the pre-pubertal growth spurt. In this case-study of 8 tracked 75-year old progeny with differential ancestral exposure, we found, in 40 posited gene ontology pathways, 39 differentially methylated CpG regions (DMRs) related to famine, excess food and food-insecurity stress, 9 of which with DMRs above 5%. Three gene ontology terms (GOs) \\\"insulin processing\\\", \\\"adipose development\\\" and \\\"hypothalamus development\\\" were key, with DMRs >14%. An unbiased test of known pathways revealed four nuclear transcription factors upstream of promotors repressing the pathway following paternal grandparental famine experience, as well as 4 upregulated GOs with average DMRs >20%.

These tasks show a high variability in performance across healthy controls and the cerebral bases supporting this variability remain unknown. In this study we performed a voxel-based morphometry study to explore the relationships between semantic and shape categorization tasks and brain morphometric differences in 50 controls. We found significant correlation between categorization performance and the volume of the grey matter in the right anterior middle and inferior temporal gyri. Semantic categorization tasks were associated with more rostral temporal regions than shape categorization tasks. A significant relationship was also shown between white matter volume in the right temporal lobe and performance in the semantic tasks. Tractography revealed that this white matter region involved several projection and association fibers, including the arcuate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. These results suggest that categorization abilities are supported by the anterior portion of the right temporal lobe and its interaction with other areas.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAnterior temporal lobe morphometry correlates with categorization performances\\nC_LIO_LISemantic is associated with a more rostral temporal region than shape categorization\\nC_LIO_LISemantic categorization performances are associated with right temporal connections\\nC_LI",

To study cortical plasticity and communication between somatosensory and motor cortex, L6-Ntsr1 cells were chronically silenced using tetanus toxin and the effect this had on cortical activity and behavior was investigated. A 2 Hz stimulation protocol was used to potentiate whisker evoked local field potentials (LFP) in a layer-dependent manner in both cortices. Silencing L6 pyramidal cells, the LFP potentiation in both cortices was affected without a change in the spontaneous multi-unit activity. Animals with L6 chronically silenced used more low-amplitude whisks, which presumably compensates for a reduction in cortical excitability. These results suggest that L6 is not only an important cortical output layer that modulates sub-cortical circuits, but also that it controls cortical dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila ether-a-go-go (eag) is the founding member of a large family of voltage-gated K+ channels, the KCNH family, which includes Kv10, 11 and 12, (Ganetzky et al. 1999). Concurrent binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to N-and C-terminal sites inhibits mammalian EAG1 channels at sub-micromolar Ca2+ concentrations (Schonherr et al. 2000), likely by causing pore constriction (Whicher and MacKinnon 2016). Although the Drosophila EAG channel was believed to be Ca2+-insensitive (Schonherr et al. 2000), both the N-and C-terminal sites are conserved. Here we show that Drosophila EAG is inhibited by high Ca2+ concentrations that are only present at plasma membrane Ca2+ channel microdomains. To test the role of this regulation in vivo, we engineered mutations that block CaM-binding to the major C-terminal site of the endogenous eag locus, disrupting Ca2+-dependent inhibition. eag CaMBD mutants have reduced evoked release from larval motor neuron presynaptic terminals and show decreased Ca2+ influx in stimulated adult projection neuron presynaptic terminals, consistent with an increase in K+ conductance. These results are predicted by a conductance-based multi-compartment model of the presynaptic terminal in which some fraction of EAG is localized to the Ca2+ channel microdomains that control neurotransmitter release. The reduction of release in the larval neuromuscular junction drives a compensatory increase in motor neuron somatic excitability. This misregulation of synaptic and somatic excitability has consequences for systems-level processes and leads to defects in associative memory formation in adults.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyRegulation of excitability is critical to tuning the nervous system for complex behaviors. We demonstrate here that the EAG family of voltage-gated K+ channels exhibit conserved gating by Ca2+/CaM. Disruption of this inhibition in Drosophila results in decreased evoked neurotransmitter release due to truncated Ca2+ influx in presynaptic terminals. In adults, disrupted Ca2+ dynamics cripples memory formation. These data demonstrate that the biophysical details of channels have important implications for cell function and behavior.",

We further demonstrate that HopT1-1 physically interacts with Arabidopsis AGO1 through conserved glycine/tryptophan (GW) motifs. Importantly, this AGO-binding platform was found to be essential for the ability of HopT1-1 to suppress both miRNA activity and PAMP-Triggered Immunity (PTI). These results therefore indicate that the RNA silencing suppression activity of HopT1-1 is intimately coupled to its virulence function. Overall, these findings provide the first evidence that a bacterial effector has evolved to directly target an AGO protein to suppress PTI and cause disease.",

    "abstract": "Ramularia Leaf Spot (RLS) has emerged as a threat for barley production in many regions of the world. Late appearance of unspecific symptoms caused that Ramularia collo-cygni could only by molecular diagnostics be detected as the causal agent of RLS. Although recent research has shed more light on the biology and genomics of the pathogen, the cause of the recent global spread remains unclear.\\n\\nTo address urgent questions, especially on the emergence to a major disease, life-cycle, transmission, and quick adaptation to control measures, we de-novo sequenced the genome of R. collo-cygni (urug2 isolate). Additionally, we sequenced fungal RNA from 6 different conditions, which allowed for an improved genome annotation. This resulted in a high quality draft assembly of about 32 Mb, with only 78 scaffolds with an N50 of 2.1 Mb. The overall annotation enabled the prediction of 12.346 high confidence genes. Genomic comparison revealed that R. collo-cygni has significantly diverged from related Dothidiomycetes, including gain and loss of putative effectors, however without obtaining species-specific genome features.\\n\\nTo evaluate the species-wide genetic diversity, we sequenced the genomes of 19 R. collo-cygni isolates from multiple geographic locations and diverse hosts and mapped sequences to our reference genome. Admixture analyses show that R. collo-cygni is world-wide genetically uniform and that samples do not show a strong clustering on either geographical location or host species. To date, the teleomorph of R. collo-cygni has not been observed. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium shows that in the world-wide sample set there are clear signals of recombination and thus sexual reproduction, however these signals largely disappear when excluding three outliers samples, suggesting that the main global expansion of R. collo-cygni comes from mixed or clonally propagating populations. We further analysed the historic population size (Ne) of R. collo-cygni using Bayesian simulations.\\n\\nWe discuss how our genomic data and population genetics analysis can help understand the current R. collo-cygni epidemic and provide different hypothesis that are supported by our data. We specifically highlight how recombination, clonal spreading and lack of host-specificity could further support global epidemics of this increasingly recognized plant disease and suggest specific approaches to combat this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Earlier research has suggested that Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) makes it possible to fit simulator-based intractable birth-death models to investigate communicable disease outbreak dynamics with accuracy comparable to that of exact Bayesian methods. However, recent findings have indicated that key parameters such as the reproductive number R may remain poorly identifiable. Here we show that the identifiability issue can be resolved by taking into account disease-specific characteristics of the transmission process in closer detail. Using tuberculosis (TB) in the San Francisco Bay area as a case-study, we consider the situation where the genotype data are generated as a mixture of three stochastic processes, each with their distinct dynamics and clear epidemiological interpretation.\\n\\nThe ABC inference yields stable and accurate posterior inferences about outbreak dynamics from aggregated annual case data with genotype information. We also show that under the proposed model, the infectious population size can be reliably inferred from the data. The estimate is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller compared to assumptions made in the earlier ABC studies, and is much better aligned with epidemiological knowledge about active TB prevalence. Similarly, the reproductive number R related to the primary underlying transmission process is estimated to be nearly three-fold compared with the previous estimates, which has a substantial impact on the interpretation of the fitted outbreak model.",

    "abstract": "Chitin, abundant in nature, is a renewable resource with many possible applications in bioengineering. Biosensors, capable of label-free and in-line evaluation, play an important role in the investigation of chitin synthesis, degradation and interaction with other materials. This work presents a comparative study of the usefulness of a chitin surface preparation, either on gold (Au) or on polystyrene (PS). In both cases the most common method to dissolve chitin was used, followed by a simple spin-coating procedure. Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance (MP-SPR), modeling of the optical properties of the chitin layers, scanning electron microscopy, and contact angle goniometry were used to confirm: the thickness of the layers in air and buffer, the refractive indices of the chitin layers in air and buffer, the hydrophobicity, the binding properties of the chitin binding domain (CBD) of Bacillus circulans, and the split-intein capture process. Binding of the CBD differed between chitin on Au versus chitin on PS in terms of binding strength and binding specificity due to a less homogenous structured chitin-surface on Au in comparison to chitin on PS, despite a similar thickness of both chitin layers in air and after running buffer over the surfaces. The use of the simple method to reproduce chitin films on a thin polystyrene layer to study chitin as a biosensor and for chitin binding studies was obvious from the SPR studies and the binding studies of CBD as moiety of chitinases or as protein fusion partner. In conclusion, stable chitin layers for SPR studies can be made from chitin in a solution of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and lithium chloride (LiCl) followed by spin-coating if the gold surface is protected with PS.",

    "abstract": "Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a promising bioelectrochemical approach to produce biochemicals. A previous study showed that Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1 can directly use poised electrodes as electron donors for photoautotrophic growth at cathodic potentials that avoid electrolytic H2 production (photoelectroautotrophy). To make TIE-1 an effective biocatalyst for MES, we need to improve its electron uptake ability and growth under photoelectroautotrophic conditions. Because TIE-1 interacts with various forms of iron while using it as a source of electrons for photoautotrophy (photoferrotrophy), we tested the ability of iron-based redox mediators to enhance direct electron uptake. Our data show that soluble iron cannot act as a redox mediator for electron uptake by TIE-1 from a cathode poised at +100mV vs. Standard Hydrogen electrode. We then tested whether an immobilized iron-based redox mediator Prussian Blue (PB) can enhance electron uptake by TIE-1. Chronoamperometry indicates that cathodic current uptake by TIE-1 increased from 1.47 {+/-} 0.04 to 5.6 {+/-} 0.09 {micro}A/cm2 (3.8 times) and the production of the bioplastic, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) improved from 13.5 {+/-} 0.2 g/L to 18.8 {+/-} 0.5 g/L (1.4 times) on electrodes coated with PB.

    "abstract": "Calcimycocavitology deals with the study of hollowing out of spaces in hard calcareous seashells by the fungi called calcimycocavites. Endolithic fungi in the shells were first reported and named as the trace fossils in 1889 by Bornet and Flahault. Endolithic fungi bore inside the shell by the process of bioturbation by using organic acids (oxalic acid, citrate) and enzymes (proteases, dehydrogenases and oxidoreductases). Previous reports show the presence of tunnels formed by fungal hyphae in the shells. The present work reports preliminary results of calcimycocavitological studies on the seashells from beaches of north Goa, India. The calcareous sand samples were collected from Arambol, Ashvem, Morjim, Vagator, Anjuna, Baga and Miramar beaches by pool sampling method and were separated into different fractions by using standard sieves. Each fraction of sand was subjected to stereomicroscopic studies which revealed that the sand fraction between 150-250 m included irregular shell fragments showing positive colonization by calcimycocavites. Hydrochloric acid treatment was used to dissolve the shells and release calcimycocavites biomass which was stained with Congo Red and tentatively identified as distinct microfungal forms. SEM studies of the calcareous shell fragments revealed the microtunneling behavior of the fungi. Digital analysis of SEM images using Mountain premium 7.2 software revealed the fine topography of calcimycocavites hyphae along with unidentified presumptive biomineral encrustations. The ecological, biological and biogeochemical implications of the findings are presented with respect to possible role of calcimycocavites in Calcium and Carbon cycling by breakdown of the calcareous shells and release of inorganic and organic components in the ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "A neural correlate for saccadic reaction times (SRTs) in the gap saccade task is the level of preparatory activity in the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) just before visual target onset: greater levels of iSC preparatory activity precede shorter SRTs. The frontal eye fields (FEF) are one likely source of such iSC preparatory activity, since FEF preparatory activity is also inversely related to SRT. To better understand the FEFs role in saccade preparation, and the way in which such preparation relates to SRT, in two male rhesus monkeys we examined iSC preparatory activity during unilateral reversible cryogenic inactivation of the FEF. FEF inactivation increased contralesional SRTs, and lowered ipsilesional iSC preparatory activity. FEF inactivation also reduced fixation-related activity in the rostral iSC. Importantly, the distributions of SRTs generated with or without FEF inactivation overlapped, enabling us to conduct a novel population-level analyses examining iSC preparatory activity just before generation of SRT-matched saccades. These analyses revealed no change during FEF inactivation in the relationship between iSC preparatory activity and SRT-matched saccades across a range of SRTs, even for the occasional express saccade. Thus, while our results emphasize that the FEF has an overall excitatory influence on preparatory activity in the iSC, the communication between the iSC and downstream oculomotor brainstem is unaltered for SRT-matched saccades, suggesting that the integration of preparatory and visual signals in the SC just before saccade initiation is largely independent of the FEF for saccades generated in this task.\\n\\nSignificance statementHow does the brain decide when to move? Here, we investigate the role of two oculomotor structures, the superior colliculus (SC) and frontal eye fields (FEF), in dictating visually-guided saccadic reaction times (SRTs). In both structures, higher levels of preparatory activity precede shorter SRTs. Here, we show that FEF inactivation increases SRTs and decreases SC preparatory activity. Surprisingly, a population-level analysis of SC preparatory activity showed a negligible impact of FEF inactivation, providing one examines SRT-matched saccades. Thus, while the FEF is one source of preparatory input to the SC, it is not a critical source, and it is not involved in the integration of preparatory activity and visual signals that precedes saccade initiation in simple visually-guided saccade tasks.",

    "abstract": "Personality neuroscience aims to find associations between brain measures and personality traits. Findings to date have been severely limited by a number of factors, including small sample size and omission of out-of-sample prediction. We capitalized on the recent availability of a large database, together with the emergence of specific criteria for best practices in neuroimaging studies of individual differences. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 884 young healthy adults in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database. We attempted to predict personality traits from the \\\"Big Five\\\", as assessed with the NEO-FFI test, using individual functional connectivity matrices. After regressing out potential confounds (such as age, sex, handedness and fluid intelligence), we used a cross-validated framework, together with test-retest replication (across two sessions of resting-state fMRI for each subject), to quantify how well the neuroimaging data could predict each of the five personality factors. We tested three different (published) denoising strategies for the fMRI data, two inter-subject alignment and brain parcellation schemes, and three different linear models for prediction. As measurement noise is known to moderate statistical relationships, we performed final prediction analyses using average connectivity across both imaging sessions (1 h of data), with the analysis pipeline that yielded the highest predictability overall. Across all results (test/retest; 3 denoising strategies; 2 alignment schemes; 3 models), Openness to experience emerged as the only reliably predicted personality factor. Using the full hour of resting-state data and the best pipeline, we could predict Openness to experience (NEOFAC_O: r=0.24, R2=0.024) almost as well as we could predict the score on a 24-item intelligence test (PMAT24_A_CR: r=0.26, R2=0.044). Other factors (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) yielded weaker predictions across results that were not statistically significant under permutation testing. We also derived two superordinate personality factors (\\\"\\\" and \\\"{beta}\\\") from a principal components analysis of the NEO-FFI factor scores, thereby reducing noise and enhancing the precision of these measures of personality. We could account for 5% of the variance in the {beta} superordinate factor (r=0.27, R2=0.050), which loads highly on Openness to experience. We conclude with a discussion of the potential for predicting personality from neuroimaging data and make specific recommendations for the field.",

    "abstract": "Exploring the genetic diversity of microbes within the environment through metagenomic sequencing first requires classifying these reads into taxonomic groups. Current methods compare these sequencing data with existing biased and limited reference databases. Several recent evaluation studies demonstrate that current methods either lack sufficient sensitivity for species-level assignments or suffer from false positives, overestimating the number of species in the metagenome. Both are especially problematic for the identification of low-abundance microbial species, e. g. detecting pathogens in ancient metagenomic samples. We present a new method, SPARSE, which improves taxonomic assignments of metagenomic reads. SPARSE balances existing biased reference databases by grouping reference genomes into similarity-based hierarchical clusters, implemented as an efficient incremental data structure. SPARSE assigns reads to these clusters using a probabilistic model, which specifically penalizes non-specific mappings of reads from unknown sources and hence reduces false-positive assignments. Our evaluation on simulated datasets from two recent evaluation studies demonstrated the improved precision of SPARSE in comparison to other methods for species-level classification. In a third simulation, our method successfully differentiated multiple co-existing Escherichia coli strains from the same sample. In real archaeological datasets, SPARSE identified ancient pathogens with[&le;] 0.02% abundance, consistent with published findings that required additional sequencing data. In these datasets, other methods either missed targeted pathogens or reported non-existent ones. SPARSE and all evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/zheminzhou/SPARSE.",

    "abstract": "Active centromeres are defined by the presence of nucleosomes containing CENP-A, a histone H3 variant, which alone is sufficient to direct kinetochore assembly. Once assembled at a location CENP-A chromatin and kinetochores are maintained at that location though a positive feedback loop where kinetochore proteins recruited by CENP-A itself promote deposition of new CENP-A following replication. Although CENP-A chromatin itself is a heritable entity, it is normally associated with specific sequences. Intrinsic properties of centromeric DNA may favour the assembly of CENP-A rather than H3 nucleosomes. Here we investigate histone dynamics on centromeric DNA. We show that during S-phase histone H3 is deposited as a placeholder at fission yeast centromeres and is subsequently evicted in G2 when we detect deposition of the majority of new CENP-ACnp1. We also find that centromeric DNA has an innate property of driving high rates of turnover of H3 containing nucleosomes resulting in low nucleosome occupancy. When placed at an ectopic chromosomal location in the absence of any CENP-ACnp1 assembly, centromeric DNA retains its ability to impose S-phase deposition and G2 eviction of H3, suggesting that features within this DNA program H3 dynamics. As RNAPII occupancy on this centromere DNA coincides with H3 eviction in G2, we propose a model in which RNAPII-coupled chromatin remodelling promotes replacement of H3 with CENP-ACnp1 nucleosomes.",

    "abstract": "Ancient whole genome duplications (WGDs) are important in eukaryotic genome evolution, and are especially prominent in plants. Recent genomic studies from large vascular plant clades, including ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms suggest that WGDs may represent a crucial mode of speciation. Moreover, numerous WGDs have been dated to events coinciding with major episodes of global and climatic upheaval, including the mass extinction at the KT boundary (~65 Ma) and during more recent intervals of global aridification in the Miocene (~10-5 Ma). These findings have led to the hypothesis that polyploidization may buffer lineages against the negative consequences of such disruptions. Here, we explore WGDs in the large, and diverse flowering plant clade Malpighiales using a combination of transcriptomes and complete genomes from 42 species. We conservatively identify 22 ancient WGDs, widely distributed across Malpighiales subclades. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that WGD is an important mode of speciation in plants. Importantly, we also identify that these events are clustered around the Eocene-Paleocene Transition (~54 Ma), during which time the planet was warmer and wetter than any period in the Cenozoic. These results establish that the Eocene Climate Optimum represents another, previously unrecognized, period of prolific WGDs in plants, and lends support to the hypothesis that polyploidization promotes adaptation and enhances plant survival during major episodes of global change. Malpighiales, in particular, may have been particularly influenced by these events given their predominance in the tropics where Eocene warming likely had profound impacts owing to the relatively tight thermal tolerances of tropical organisms.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWhole genome duplications (WGDs) are hypothesized to generate adaptive variations during episodes of climate change and global upheaval. Using large-scale phylogenomic assessments, we identify an impressive 22 ancient WGDs in the large, tropical flowering plant clade Malpighiales. This supports growing evidence that ancient WGDs are far more common than has been thought. Additionally, we identify that WGDs are clustered during a narrow window of time, ~54 Ma, when the climate was warmer and more humid than during any period in the last ~65 Ma. This lends support to the hypothesis that WGDs are associated with surviving climatic upheavals, especially for tropical organisms like Malpighiales, which have tight thermal tolerances.",

Massive, genome-wide transcriptomic rewiring in response to genomic merger and doubling has been demonstrated in many allopolyploid systems, encompassing a diversity of phenomena, including homoeolog expression bias, genome dominance, expression-level dominance, and revamping of co-expression networks. Here we present an analytical framework to reconcile these patterns of regulatory novelty as governed by distinct sets of intra- and inter-subgenome cis-trans relationships. This approach is a novel extension of classic allele-specific expression analysis to incorporate and distinguish the separate effects of parental regulatory interactions as well as further complications at the allopolyploid level. We demonstrated that the cis-trans framework devised not only offers new perspective on disentangling genetic from epigenetic and higher-order effects that impact gene expression, but also provides the conceptual basis and tools to unify recently presented models for both genome-wide expression dominance and biased fractionation in allopolyploids.",

Although PKD2 is proposed to be an ion channel subunit, recordings of PKD2 ion channels conflict in their properties. Using a new ADPKD mouse model, we observe primary cilia are abnormally long in cells associated with cysts. Using primary cultures of collecting duct epithelial cells, we show that PKD2, but not PKD1, is a required subunit for primary cilia ion channel. The ciliary PKD2 channel conducts potassium and sodium ions, but little calcium. We also demonstrate that PKD2 is not constitutively active in the plasma membrane, but PKD2 channels are functional in primary cilia and are sensitized by high cilioplasmic [Ca2+]. We introduce a novel method for measuring PKD2 channels heterologously expressed in primary cilia of HEK-293 cells, which will have utility characterizing Pkd2 variants that cause ADPKD in their native ciliary membrane.",

    "abstract": "FDA approval of multiple drugs differing in chemical structures but targeting the same protein raises the question whether such drugs have sufficiently similar mechanisms of action to be considered functionally equivalent. In this paper we compare three recently approved inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4/6 - palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib - that are becoming important therapies for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast and potentially other cancers. We find that transcriptional and proteomic changes induced by the three drugs differ significantly and that abemaciclib has unique cellular activities including induction of cell death (even in pRb-deficient cells), arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and reduced drug adaptation. These activities appear to arise from inhibition of kinases other than CDK4/6 including CDK2/Cyclin A/E and CDK1/Cyclin B.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe target profiles of most drugs are established relatively early in their development and are not systematically revisited at the time of approval. Scattered reports suggest that palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib differ in pharmacokinetics, dosing, and adverse effects but the three drugs are generally regarded as similar. Our finding that the drugs differ substantially in mechanism of action - abemaciclib retains activities of the earlier-generation drug alvocidib - suggests the potential for different uses in the clinic: in particular, abemaciclib may show activity in patients progressing on palbociclib or ribociclib. More generally, our approach relying on data from five distinct phenotypic and biochemical assays strongly suggests that a multi-faceted approach is necessary to get a reliable picture the target spectrum of kinase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Cultured cell populations are composed of heterogeneous cells, and previous single-cell lineage tracking analysis of individual HeLa cells provided empirical evidence for significant heterogeneity of cell fates. Nevertheless, such cell lines have been used for investigations of cellular responses to various substances, resulting in incomplete characterizations. This problem caused by heterogeneity within cell lines could be overcome by analyzing the spatiotemporal responses of individual cells to a substance. However, no approach to investigate the responses using spatiotemporal data is currently available. Thus, the current study aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal responses of individual HeLa cells to cytotoxic, sub-cytotoxic, and non-cytotoxic doses of the well-characterized carcinogen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Although cytotoxic doses of MNNG are known to induce cell death, the single-cell tracking approach revealed that cell death occurred following at least four different cellular events, suggesting that cell death is induced via multiple processes. We also found that HeLa cells exposed to sub-cytotoxic doses of MNNG were in a state of equilibrium between cell proliferation and cell death, with cell death again induced through different processes. However, exposure of cells to non-cytotoxic doses of MNNG promoted growth by reducing the cell doubling time, thus promoting the growth of a sub-population of cells previously recognized as putative cancer stem cells. These results demonstrate that the responses of cells to MNNG can be analyzed precisely using spatiotemporal data, regardless of the presence of heterogeneity among cultured cells, suggesting that single-cell lineage tracking analysis can be used as a novel and accurate analytical method to investigate cellular responses to various substances.",

Although several methods have been recently developed, they utilize different characteristics of data and yield varying results in terms of both the number of clusters and actual cluster assignments.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present SAFE-clustering, Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) clustering, a flexible, accurate and robust method for clustering scRNA-Seq data. SAFE-clustering takes as input, results from multiple clustering methods, to build one consensus solution. SAFE-clustering currently embeds four state-of-the-art methods, SC3, CIDR, Seurat and t-SNE + k-means; and ensembles solutions from these four methods using three hypergraph-based partitioning algorithms. Extensive assessment across 12 datasets with the number of clusters ranging from 3 to 14, and the number of single cells ranging from 49 to 32,695 showcases the advantages of SAFE-clustering in terms of both cluster number (18.9 - 50.0% reduction in absolute deviation to the truth) and cluster assignment (on average 28.9% improvement, and up to 34.5% over the best of the four methods, measured by adjusted rand index). Moreover, SAFE-clustering is computationally efficient to accommodate large datasets, taking <10 minutes to process 28,733 cells.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationSAFE-clustering, including source codes and tutorial, is free available on the web at http://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/safe/.\\n\\nContactyunli@med.unc.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

We previously implicated membrane E-cadherin expression as both a marker and mechanism for resistance to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression of cancer cells; however, a transcriptome-profile-based biomarker signature for statin sensitivity has not yet been reported. Here, we utilized transcriptome data from fourteen NCI-60 cancer cell lines and their statin dose-response data to produce gene expression signatures that identify statin sensitive and resistant cell lines. We experimentally confirmed the validity of the identified biomarker signature in an independent set of cell lines and extended this signature to generate a proposed statin-sensitive subset of tumors listed in the TCGA database. Finally, we predicted drugs that would synergize with statins and found several predicted combination therapies to be experimentally confirmed. The combined bioinformatics-experimental approach described here can be used to generate an initial biomarker sensitivity for statin therapy.",

Many methods were developped for peak calling, but few were proposed for the downstream analysis of peak-like data, whereas the spatial structure of such data may contain relevant biological information, like binding constraints for instance. Associations between the occurrences of two genomic features are usually assessed by overlaps, but here we propose a statistical model to precisely quantify the spatial interactions between the location of binding events. Our methodology relies on a multivariate spatial process, the Hawkes model, that can also be interpreted in terms of a graphical model to highlight spatial dependencies between genomic features. Using our method, we explore the chromatinian landscape of replication origins, and we highlight attractive and repulsive patterns that can be related to the regulation of the spatial program of replication.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ability of finding complex associations in large omics datasets, assessing their significance, and prioritizing them according to their strength can be of great help in the data exploration phase. Mutual Information based measures of association are particularly promising, in particular after the recent introduction of the TICe and MICe estimators, which combine computational efficiency with good bias/variance properties. Despite that, a complete software implementation of these two measures and of a statistical procedure to test the significance of each association is still missing.\\n\\nFindingsIn this paper we present MICtools, a comprehensive and effective pipeline which combines TICe and MICe into a multi-step procedure that allows the identification of relationships of various degrees of complexity. MICtools calculates their strength assessing statistical significance using a permutation-based strategy. The performances of the proposed approach are assessed by an extensive investigation in synthetic datasets and an example of a potential application on a metagenomic dataset is also illustrated.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that MICtools, combining TICe and MICe, is able to highlight associations that would not be captured by conventional strategies.

Few studies have addressed the evolutionary trajectory of yeast genes that control the stable co-existence of these parasites with their host cell. In Saccharomyces yeasts, the retrovirus-like Ty retrotransposons must access the nucleus. We show that several genes encoding components of the yeast nuclear pore complex have experienced natural selection for substitutions that change the encoded protein sequence. By replacing these S. cerevisiae genes with orthologs from other Saccharomyces species, we discovered that natural sequence changes have affected the control of Ty retrotransposons. Specifically, changing the genetic sequence of NUP84 or NUP82 to what is found in other Saccharomyces species alters the retrotransposition of S. cerevisiae Ty1 and Ty3, respectively. Importantly, all tested housekeeping functions of NUP84 and NUP82 remained equivalent across species. The nuclear pore complex is the gatekeeper of the nucleus. It appears that nucleoporins are adapting to modulate the control of genetic parasites which access the nucleus, which is achieved despite the strict constraints imposed by host nuclear pore complex function.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of rare variants to disease burden has become an important focus in genetic epidemiology. These effects are difficult to detect in population-based datasets, and as a result, interest in family-based study designs has resurfaced. Linkage analysis tools will need to be updated to accommodate the scale of data generated by modern genotyping and sequencing technologies.\\n\\nIn conventional linkage analysis individuals in different pedigrees are assumed to be independent of each other. However, cryptic relatedness is often present in populations and haplotypes that harbor rare variants may be shared between pedigrees as well as within them.\\n\\nWith millions of polymorphisms, Identity-by-descent (IBD) states across the genome can now be inferred without use of pedigree information. This is done by identifying long runs of identical-by-state genotypes which are unlikely to arise without IBD. Previously, IBD had to be estimated in pedigrees from recombination events in a sparse set of markers.\\n\\nWe present a method for variance-components linkage that can incorporate large number of markers and allows for between-pedigree relatedness. We replace the IBD matrix generated from pedigree-based analysis with one generated from a genotype-based method. All pedigrees in a dataset are considered jointly, allowing between-pedigree IBD to be included in the model.\\n\\nIn simulated data, we show that power is increased in the scenario when there is a haplotype shared IBD between members of different pedigrees. If there is no between-pedigree IBD, the analysis reduces to conventional variance-components analysis. By determining IBD states by long runs of dense IBS genotypes, linkage signals can be determined from their physical position, allowing more precise localization.",

Therefore, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of TCF4 in neural-derived (SH-SY5Y) cells to identify genome-wide TCF4 binding sites, followed by data integration with SZ association findings. We identified 11,322 TCF4 binding sites overlapping in two ChIP-seq experiments. These sites are significantly enriched for the TCF4 Ebox binding motif (>85% having [&ge;]1 Ebox) and implicate a gene set enriched for genes down-regulated in TCF4 siRNA knockdown experiments, indicating the validity of our findings. The TCF4 gene set was also enriched among 1) Gene Ontology categories such as axon/neuronal development, 2) genes preferentially expressed in brain, in particular pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex, and 3) genes down-regulated in post-mortem brain tissue from SZ patients (OR=2.8, permutation p<4x10-5). Considering genomic alignments, TCF4 binding sites significantly overlapped those for neural DNA binding proteins such as FOXP2 and the SZ-associated EP300. TCF4 binding sites were modestly enriched among SZ risk loci from the Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (OR=1.56, p=0.03). In total, 130 TCF4 binding sites occurred in 39 of the 108 regions published in 2014. Thirteen genes within the 108 loci had both a TCF4 binding site {+/-}10kb and were differentially expressed in siRNA knockdown experiments of TCF4, suggesting direct TCF4 regulation.

    "abstract": "N-linked mannans (N-mannans) in the cell wall of Candida albicans are thought to mask {beta}-(1,3)-glucan from recognition by Dectin-1, contributing to innate immune evasion. Lateral cell wall exposures of glucan on Candida albicans are predominantly single receptor-ligand interaction sites and are restricted to nanoscale geometries. Candida species exhibit a range of basal glucan exposures and their mannans also vary in size and complexity at the molecular level. We used super resolution fluorescence imaging and a series of protein mannosylation mutants in C. albicans and C. glabrata to investigate the role of specific N-mannan features in regulating the nanoscale geometry of glucan exposure. Decreasing acid labile mannan abundance and -(1,6)-mannan backbone length correlated most strongly with increased density and nanoscopic size of glucan exposures in C. albicans and C. glabrata, respectively. Additionally, a C. albicans clinical isolate with high glucan exposure produced similarly perturbed N-mannan structures and exhibited similar changes to nanoscopic glucan exposure geometry. We conclude that acid labile N-mannan controls glucan exposure geometry at the nanoscale. Furthermore, variations in glucan nanoexposure characteristics are clinically relevant and are likely to impact the nature of the pathogenic surface presented to innate immunocytes at dimensions relevant to receptor engagement, aggregation and signaling.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a rapid, cost-effective, non-invasive biodiversity monitoring tool which utilises DNA left behind in the environment by organisms for species detection. The method is used as a species specific survey tool for rare or invasive species across a broad range of ecosystems. Recently, eDNA and  metabarcoding have been combined to describe whole communities rather than focusing on single target species. However, whether metabarcoding is as sensitive as targeted approaches for rare species detection remains to be evaluated. The great crested newt Triturus cristatus is a flagship pond species of international conservation concern and the first UK species to be routinely monitored using eDNA. We evaluate whether eDNA metabarcoding has comparable sensitivity to targeted real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cristatus detection. Extracted eDNA samples (N = 532) were screened for T. cristatus by qPCR and analysed for all vertebrate species using High-Throughput Sequencing technology. With qPCR and a detection threshold of 1/12 positive qPCR replicates, newts were detected in 50% of ponds. Detection decreased to 32% when the threshold was increased to 4/12 positive qPCR replicates. With metabarcoding, newts were detected in 34% of ponds without a detection threshold, and in 28% of ponds when a threshold (0.028%) was applied. Therefore, qPCR provided greater detection than metabarcoding but metabarcoding detection with no threshold was equivalent to qPCR with a stringent detection threshold. The proportion of T. cristatus sequences in each sample was positively associated with the number of positive qPCR replicates (qPCR score) suggesting eDNA metabarcoding may be indicative of eDNA concentration. eDNA metabarcoding holds enormous potential for holistic biodiversity assessment and routine freshwater monitoring. We advocate this community approach to freshwater monitoring to guide management and conservation, whereby entire communities can be initially surveyed to best inform use of funding and time for species-specific surveys.",

    "abstract": "The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is widely implicated in supporting episodic memory and navigation, but its precise functional role in organizing memory across time and space remains elusive. Here we examine the specific cognitive processes implemented by MTL structures (hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) to organize memory by using electrical brain stimulation, leveraging its ability to establish causal links between brain regions and features of behavior. We studied neurosurgical patients who performed spatial-navigation and verbal-episodic memory tasks while brain stimulation was applied in various regions during learning. During the verbal memory task, stimulation in the MTL disrupted the temporal organization of encoded memories such that items learned with stimulation tended to be recalled in a more randomized order. During the spatial task, MTL stimulation impaired subjects abilities to remember items using view-independent (allocentric) navigation strategies. These stimulation effects were specific to the MTL. Our findings thus provide the first causal demonstration in humans of the specific memory processes that are performed by the MTL to encode when and where events occurred.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNumerous studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in encoding spatial and temporal memories, but they have not been able to causally demonstrate the nature of the cognitive processes by which this occurs in real-time. Electrical brain stimulation is able to demonstrate causal links between a brain region and a given function with high temporal precision. By examining behavior in a memory task as subjects received MTL stimulation, we provide the first causal evidence demonstrating the role of the MTL in organizing the spatial and temporal aspects of episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Data from research on amnesia and epilepsy are equivocal with regards to the dissociation, shown in animal models, between rapid and slow long-term memory consolidation. Cancer treatments have lasting disruptive effects on memory and on brain structures associated with memory, but their acute effects on synaptic consolidation are unknown. We investigated the hypothesis that cancer treatment selectively impairs slow synaptic consolidation. Cancer patients and their matched controls were administered a novel list-learning task modelled on the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test. Learning, forgetting, and retrieval were tested before, and one day after patients first chemotherapy treatment. Due to difficulties recruiting cancer patients at that sensitive time, we were only able to study 10 patients and their matched controls. Patients exhibited treatment-dependent accelerated forgetting over 24 hours compared to their own pre-treatment performance and to the performance of control participants, in agreement with our hypothesis. The number of intrusions increased after treatment, suggesting retrieval deficits. Future research with larger samples should adapt our methods to distinguish between consolidation and retrieval causes for treatment-dependent accelerated forgetting. The presence of significant accelerated forgetting in our small sample is indicative of a potentially large acute effect of chemotherapy treatment on forgetting, with potentially clinically-relevant implications.",

    "abstract": "To cast valid predictions of future behavior or diagnose disorders, the reliable measurement of a \\\"biomarker\\\" such as the brain activation to prospective reward is a prerequisite. Surprisingly, only a small fraction of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies report or cite the reliability of brain activation maps involved in group analyses. Here, using simulations and exemplary longitudinal data of 126 healthy adolescents performing an intertemporal choice task, we demonstrate that reproducing a group activation map over time is not a sufficient indication of reliable measurements at the individual level. Instead, selecting regions based on significant main effects at the group level may yield estimates that fail to reliably capture individual variance in the subjective evaluation of an offer. Collectively, our results call for more attention on the reliability of supposed biomarkers at the level of the individual. Thus, caution is warranted in employing brain activation patterns prematurely for clinical applications such as diagnosis or tailored interventions before their reliability has been conclusively established by large-scale studies. To facilitate assessing and reporting of the reliability of fMRI contrasts in future studies, we provide a toolbox that incorporates common measures of global and local reliability.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHighly co-morbid mood and anxiety disorders are associated with aberrant fronto-limbic signalling during emotional processing. Animal models suggest that hypoactive prefrontal cortex weakens top-down control of limbic structures, causing heightened limbic and behavioural reactivity to negative information. Here we tested for this causal mechanism in human trait anxiety. We reasoned that if dorsolateral prefrontal cortex controls amygdala response to affective information, then stimulation of that brain region should reduce the hyperactive amygdala threat responsivity seen in trait anxiety.\\n\\nMethodsUsing a within-subjects design, sixteen high-trait anxious females received active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in counterbalanced order, with sessions timed to be at least one month apart. Each session was followed immediately by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan during which participants performed an attentional task with threat-related distractors.\\n\\nResultsAs predicted, compared to sham stimulation, active prefrontal cortex stimulation reduced amygdala threat reactivity and simultaneously increased activity in cortical regions associated with attentional control and improved task accuracy.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate a causal role for impoverished frontal regulation of amygdaloid function in attentional capture by threat in trait anxiety. The finding that prefrontal stimulation reduces amygdala threat reactivity acutely indicates a neurocognitive mechanism that could contribute to tDCS treatment effects in affective disorders.",

In this study, we describe such a framework that is suitable for many of the dynamic functional connectivity methods that have been proposed. Our overall intention was to derive a theoretical framework that was constructed such that a wide variety of dynamic functional connectivity techniques could be expressed and evaluated within the same framework. At the same time, care was given to the fact that key features of each technique could be easily illustrated within the framework and thus highlighting critical assumptions that are made. We aimed to create a common framework which should serve to assist comparisons between different analytical methods for dynamic functional brain connectivity and promote an understanding of their methodological advantages as well as potential drawbacks.\\n\\nHighlightsDifferent approaches to compute dynamic functional brain connectivity have been proposed, each with their own assumptions.\\n\\nWe present a theoretical framework that encompasses a large majority of proposed methods.\\n\\nOur common framework facilitates comparisons between different methods and illustrates their underlying assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) play an important role in angiogenesis and inflammatory responses. MCPIP (also known as Zc3h12a or Regnase-1), a newly identified suppressor of cytokine signaling, is expressed in endothelial cells. To directly test the role of endothelium-derived MCPIP in cardiovascular pathophysiology, we specifically targeted deletion of the murine MCPIP gene in the endothelium by using the loxP/Cre system. A floxed MCPIP knock in mouse line was crossbred with VEcadherin5-Cre mice to generate offspring with deletion of the MCPIP gene in ECs (ECKO). Ablation of MCPIP in ECs resulted in systemic inflammation, anemia, splenomegaly, increased vessel permeability, muscle wasting, endothelial dysfunction, thrombus formation, impaired blood perfusion, and reduced lifespan in these mice. Serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, and biomarkers of EC dysfunction were significantly elevated in the ECKO mice, suggesting a hypercytokinemia. These mice also were more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide-induced death. When subjected to ischemia, these mice showed defective post-ischemic angiogenesis and impaired blood flow recovery in hind limb ischemia and stroke models, as well as in wound healing. This effect was associated with an increased cellular infiltration, cytokine expression, and decreased angiogenic factors. Moreover, MCPIP-deficient ECs displayed decreased vascular sprouting and tube elongation in ex vivo aortic ring assay. MCPIP-knockdown in cultured ECs enhanced NF-{kappa}B activity and dysregulated synthesis of microRNAs linked with elevated cytokines and biomarkers of EC dysfunction. These data show, for the first time, that constitutive expression of MCPIP in ECs is essential to maintain ECs in a quiescent state by serving as an important negative feedback regulator that keeps the inflammatory signaling suppressed.",
