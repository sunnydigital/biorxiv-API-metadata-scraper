    "abstract": "The emerging single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the investigation of transcriptomic landscapes at single-cell resolution. The analysis of scRNA-seq data is complicated by excess zero or near zero counts, the so-called dropouts due to the low amounts of mRNA sequenced within individual cells. Downstream analysis of scRNA-seq would be severely biased if the dropout events are not properly corrected. We introduce scImpute, a statistical method to accurately and robustly impute the dropout values in scRNA-seq data. ScImpute automatically identifies gene expression values affected by dropout events, and only perform imputation on these values without introducing new bias to the rest data. ScImpute also detects outlier or rare cells and excludes them from imputation. Evaluation based on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data on mouse embryos, mouse brain cells, human blood cells, and human embryonic stem cells suggests that scImpute is an effective tool to recover transcriptome dynamics masked by dropout events. scImpute is shown to correct false zero counts, enhance the clustering of cell populations and subpopulations, improve the accuracy of differential expression analysis, and aid the study of gene expression dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The global evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus ultimately derive from processes that take place within and between infected individuals. Here we define the dynamics of influenza A virus populations in human hosts through next generation sequencing of 249 specimens from 200 individuals collected over 6290 person-seasons of observation. Because these viruses were collected over 5 seasons from individuals in a prospective community-based cohort, they are broadly representative of natural human infections with seasonal viruses. We used viral sequence data from 35 serially sampled individuals to estimate a within host effective population size of 30-70 and an in vivo mutation rate of 4x10-5 per nucleotide per cellular infectious cycle. These estimates are consistent across several models and robust to the models' underlying assumptions. We also identified 43 epidemiologically linked and genetically validated transmission pairs. Maximum likelihood optimization of multiple transmission models estimates an effective transmission bottleneck of 1-2 distinct genomes. Our data suggest that positive selection of novel viral variants is inefficient at the level of the individual host and that genetic drift and other stochastic processes dominate the within and between host evolution of influenza A viruses.",

    "abstract": "Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics1-4: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is irrelevant for the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and brain regions necessary for computing and using such priors are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory Parametric Working Memory (PWM) task, and found that rats displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioral effects of sensory stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans5,6 and monkeys7. Earlier proposals that PPC supports working memory8,9 predict that optogenetic silencing of this region would impair behavior in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, silencing PPC significantly improved performance. Quantitative analyses of behavior revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about sensory stimuli of previous trials than about stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of a given rats PPC, the greater the behavioral effect of sensory history in that rat, suggesting a tight link between behavior and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory stimulus history, and open a window for neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information.",

The limited ability to reproduce crucial features of the microenvironment, such as surrounding fluid flow and dynamic changes in biochemical stimuli, severely limits the types of experiments that can be carried out. Current equipment to achieve this, such as syringe and peristaltic pumps, is expensive, large, difficult to program and has limited potential for scalability. Here, we present a new pumping platform that is open-source, low-cost, modular, scalable, fully-programmable and easy to assemble that can be incorporated into cell culture systems to better recapitulate physiological environments. By controlling two commercially available piezoelectric pumps using a Raspberry Pi Zero microcontroller, the system is capable of producing arbitrary dynamic flow profiles with reliable flow rates ranging from 1 to 3,000 {micro}L/min as specified by an easily programmable Python-based script. We validated the accuracy of the flow rates, the use of time-varying profiles, and the practicality of the system by creating repeatable dynamic concentration profiles using a 3D-printed static micromixer.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic RNA molecules are increasingly used to alter cellular functions. These successful applications indicate that RNA-based therapeutics might be able to target currently undruggable genes. However, to achieve this promise, an effective method for delivering therapeutic RNAs into specific cells is required. Recently, RNA aptamers emerged as promising delivery agents due to their ability of binding specific cell receptors. Crucially, these aptamers can frequently be internalized into the cells expressing these receptors on their surfaces. This property is leveraged in aptamer based drug delivery systems by combining such receptor-specific aptamers with a therapeutic \\\"cargo\\\" such that the aptamer facilitates the internalization of the cargo into the cell. The advancement of this technology however is contingent on an efficient method to produce stable molecular complexes that include specific aptamers and cargoes. A recently proposed experimental procedure for obtaining such complexes relies on conjugating the aptamer and the cargo with complementary RNA strands so that when such modified molecules are incubated together, the complementary RNA strands hybridize to form a double-stranded \\\"sticky bridge\\\" connecting the aptamer with its cargo. However, designing appropriate sticky bridge sequences guaranteeing the formation and stability of the complex while simultaneously not interfering with the aptamer or the cargo as well as not causing spurious aggregation of the molecules during incubation has proven highly challenging. To fill this gap, we developed AptaBlocks, a computational method to design sticky bridges to connect RNA-based molecules (blocks). AptaBlocks relies on a biophysically inspired theoretical model capturing the complex objectives of the design and yet is simple enough to allow for efficient parameter estimation. Given this model, the sticky bridge sequence is optimized using a Monte Carlo algorithm based on heat-bath transitions. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been verified computationally and experimentally. AptaBlocks can be used in variety of experimental settings and its preliminary version has already been leveraged to design an aptamer based delivery system for a cytotoxic drug targeting Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. It is thus expected that AptaBlocks will play a substantial role in accelerating RNA-based drug delivery design.\\n\\nAptaBlocks is available at https://github.com/wyjhxq/AptaBlocks.",

    "abstract": "Exome capture is an effective tool for surveying the genome for loci under selection. However, traditional methods require annotated genomic resources. Here, we present a method for creating cDNA probes from expressed mRNA, which are then used to enrich and capture genomic DNA for exon regions. This approach, called \\\"EecSeq\\\", eliminates the need for costly probe design and synthesis. We tested EecSeq in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, using a controlled exposure experiment. Four adult oysters were heat shocked at 36{degrees} C for 1 hour along with four control oysters kept at 14{degrees} C. Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared for two individuals from each treatment and pooled. Half of the combined library was used for probe synthesis and half was sequenced to evaluate capture efficiency. Genomic DNA was extracted from all individuals, enriched via captured probes, and sequenced directly. We found that EecSeq had an average capture sensitivity of 86.8% across all known exons and had over 99.4% sensitivity for exons with detectable levels of expression in the mRNA library. For all mapped reads, over 47.9% mapped to exons and 37.0% mapped to expressed targets, which is similar to previously published exon capture studies. EecSeq displayed relatively even coverage within exons (i.e. minor \\\"edge effects\\\") and even coverage across exon GC content. We discovered 5,951 SNPs with a minimum average coverage of 80X, with 3,508 SNPs appearing in exonic regions. We show that EecSeq provides comparable, if not superior, specificity and capture efficiency compared to costly, traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Small RNAs are known to regulate gene expression during early development. However, the dynamics of interaction between small RNAs and polysomes during this process is largely unknown. 0-1h and 7-8h Drosophila embryos were fractionated on sucrose density gradients into four fractions based on A254 reading (1) translationally inactive messengerribonucleoprotein (mRNP); (2) 60S; (3) monosome; and (4) polysome. Comparative analysis of deep-sequencing reads from fractionated and un-fractionated 0-1h and 8-h embryos revealed development-specific co-sedimentation pattern of small RNAs with the cellular translation machinery. Although most miRNAs did not have a specific preference for any state of the translational machinery, we detected fraction-specific enrichment of some miRNAs such as miR-1-3p, -184-39, 5-5p and 263-5p. More interestingly, we observed dysregulation of a subset of miRNAs in fractionated embryos despite no measurable difference in their amount in unfractionated embryos. Transposon-derived endosiRNAs are over-expressed in 7-8h embryos and are associated mainly with the mRNP fraction. However, transposon-derived piRNAs, which are more abundant in 0-1h embryos, co-sediment primarily with the polysome fractions. These results suggest that there appears to be a complex interplay among the small RNAs with respect to their polysome-cosedimention pattern during early development in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is an enzyme responsible for the formation of cholesteryl esters from cholesterol (CHOL) and phospholipid (PL) molecules in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that play a crucial role in the reverse cholesterol transport and the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, it is poorly understood how LCAT interacts with lipoprotein surfaces and how apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) activates it. Thus, here we have studied the interactions between LCAT and lipids through extensive atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reveal mechanistic details behind the cholesterol esterification process catalyzed by LCAT. In addition, we studied the binding of LCAT to apoA-I derived peptides, and their effect on LCAT lipid association utilizing experimental surface sensitive biophysical methods. Our simulations show that LCAT anchors itself to lipoprotein surfaces by utilizing non-polar amino acids located in the membrane-binding domain and the active site tunnel opening. Meanwhile, the membrane anchoring hydrophobic amino acids attract cholesterol molecules next to them. The results also highlight the role of the lid-loop in the lipid binding and conformation of LCAT with respect to the lipid surface. The apoA-I derived peptides from the LCAT activating region bind to LCAT and promote its lipid surface interactions, although some of these peptides do not bind lipids individually. By means of free-energy calculations we provided a hypothetical explanation for this mechanism. We also found that the transfer free-energy of PL to the active site is consistent with the activation energy of LCAT. Furthermore, the entry of CHOL molecules into the active site becomes highly favorable by the acylation of SER181. The results provide substantial mechanistic insights concerning the activity of LCAT that may lead to the development of novel pharmacological agents preventing CHD in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer. Cancer cells utilize both aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production and biomass synthesis. Understanding the metabolic reprogramming in cancer can help design therapies to target metabolism and thereby to improve prognosis. We have previously argued that more malignant tumors are usually characterized by a more modular expression pattern of cancer-associated genes. In this work, we analyzed the expression patterns of metabolism genes in terms of modularity for 371 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that higher modularity significantly correlated with glycolytic phenotype, later tumor stages, higher metastatic potential, and cancer recurrence, all of which contributed to poorer prognosis. Among patients with recurred tumor, we found the correlation of higher modularity with worse prognosis during early to mid-progression. Furthermore, we developed metrics to calculate individual modularity, which was shown to be predictive of cancer recurrence and patients survival and therefore may serve as a prognostic biomarker. Our overall conclusion is that more aggressive HCC tumors, as judged by decreased host survival probability, had more modular expression patterns of metabolic genes. These results may be used to identify cancer driver genes and for drug design.",

Given the fitness advantage afforded by high standing genetic diversity in a population in a dynamic environment, it is possible that selection to explore a large fraction of the space of functional proteins also occurred. To determine whether selection for such a property played a role during the emergence of the nearly universal genetic code, we investigated the number of functional variants of the Escherichia coli PhoQ protein explored at different time scales under translation using different genetic codes. We found that the standard genetic code is highly optimal for exploring a large fraction of the space of functional PhoQ variants at intermediate time scales as compared to random codes. Environmental changes, in response to which genetic diversity in a population provides a fitness advantage, are likely to have occurred at these intermediate time scales. Our results indicate that the ability of the standard code to explore a large fraction of the space of functional sequence variants arises from a balance between robustness and flexibility and is largely independent of the property of the standard code to minimize the phenotypic effects of mutations. We propose that selection to explore a large fraction of the functional sequence space while minimizing the phenotypic effects of mutations contributed towards the emergence of the standard code as the universal genetic code.",

Activation of the complement system is balanced under homeostasis by regulators that protect healthy host-cells. Impairment of complement regulators tilts the balance, favoring activation and propagation that leads to inflammatory diseases. The most potent regulator of the complement system is Factor H (FH), and its impairment induces improper complement activation that leads to inflammatory diseases, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and age related macular degeneration. To understand the dynamics involved in the pivotal balance between activation and regulation, we have developed a comprehensive computational model of the alternative and classical pathways of the complement system. The model is composed of 290 ordinary differential equations with 142 kinetic parameters that describe the state of complement system under homeostasis and disorder through FH impairment. We have evaluated the state of the system by generating concentration-time profiles for the biomarkers C3, C3a-desArg, C5, C5a-desArg, Factor B (FB), Ba, Bb, and fC5b-9 that are influenced by complement dysregulation. We show that FH-mediated disorder induces substantial levels of complement activation compared to homeostasis, by generating reduced levels of C3 and FB, and to a lesser extent C5, and elevated levels of C3a-desArg, Ba, Bb, C5a-desArg, and fC5b-9. These trends are consistent with clinically observed biomarkers associated with complement-mediated diseases. Furthermore, we introduced therapy states by modeling known drugs of the complement system, a compstatin variant (C3 inhibitor) and eculizumab (a C5 inhibitor). Compstatin demonstrates strong restorative effects for early-stage biomarkers, such as C3a-desArg, FB, Ba, and Bb, and milder restorative effects for late-stage biomarkers, such as C5a-desArg and fC5b-9, whereas eculizumab has strong restorative effects on late-stage biomarkers, and negligible effects on early-stage biomarkers. These results highlight the need for patient-specific therapies that target early complement activation at the C3 level, or late-stage propagation of the terminal cascade at the C5 level, depending on the specific FH-mediated disease and the manifestations of a patients genetic profile in complement regulatory function.",

    "abstract": "The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a conserved eukaryotic translational and transcriptional program implicated in mammalian metabolism, memory and immunity. The ISR is mediated by stress-induced phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) that attenuates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. A chemical inhibitor of the ISR, ISRIB, a bis-O-arylglycolamide, reverses the attenuation of eIF2B by phosphorylated eIF2, protecting mice from neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury. We report on a cryo-electron microscopy-based structure of ISRIB-bound human eIF2B revealing an ISRIB-binding pocket at the interface between the {beta} and {delta} regulatory subunits. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of residues lining this pocket altered the hierarchical cellular response to ISRIB congeners in vivo and ISRIB-binding in vitro, thus providing chemogenetic support for the functional relevance of ISRIB binding at a distance from known eIF2-eIF2B interaction sites. Our findings point to a hitherto unexpected allosteric site in the eIF2B decamer exploited by ISRIB to regulate translation.",

Much of this research has focused on two measures of connectivity - modularity and flexibility - which frequently have been examined in isolation. By using resting state fMRI data from 52 young adults, we investigate the relationship between modularity, flexibility and performance on cognitive tasks. We show that flexibility and modularity are highly negatively correlated. However, we also demonstrate that flexibility and modularity make unique contributions to explain task performance, with modularity predicting performance for simple tasks and flexibility predicting performance on complex tasks that require cognitive control and executive functioning. The theory and results presented here allow for stronger links between measures of brain network connectivity and cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Forage plants are valuable because they maintain wild and domesticated herbivores, and sustain the delivery of meat, milk and other commodities. Forage plants contain different quantities of fibre, lignin, minerals and protein, and vary in the proportion of their tissue that can be digested by herbivores. These nutritive components are important determinants of consumer growth rates, reproductive success and behaviour. A dataset was compiled to quantify variation in forage plant nutritive values within- and between-plant species, and to assess variation between plant functional groups and bioclimatic zones. 1,255 geo-located records containing 3,774 measurements of nutritive values for 136 forage plant species grown in 30 countries were obtained from published articles. Spatial variability in forage nutritive values indicated that climate modified plant nutritive values. Forage plants grown in arid and equatorial regions generally contained less digestible material than those grown in temperate and tundra regions; containing more fibre and lignin, and less protein. These patterns may reveal why herbivore body sizes, digestion and migration strategies are different in warmer and drier regions. This dataset also revealed the capacity for variation in the nutrition provided by forage plants. The proportion of the plant tissue that was digestible ranged between species from 2-91%. The amount of fibre contained within plant material ranged by 23-90%, protein by 2-36%, lignin by 1-21% and minerals by 2-22%. Water contents also varied substantially; ranging from 3-89% of standing biomass. On average, grasses and tree foliage contained the most fibre, whilst herbaceous legumes contained the most protein and tree foliage contained the most lignin. However, there were individual species within each functional group that were highly nutritious. This dataset may be used to identify forage plant species with useful traits which can be cultivated to enhance livestock productivity and inform wild herbivore conservation strategies.",

Engineering efforts with these technologies have created modified bacteria for various medical, industrial, and environmental purposes, but organisms designed for specific functions require improvements in stability, longevity, or efficiency of function. Most bacteria live in multispecies communities, whose composition may be closely linked to the effect the community has on the environment. Bacterial engineering efforts will benefit from building communities with regulated compositions, which will enable more stable and powerful community functions.\\n\\nWe present a design of a synthetic two member bacterial community capable of maintaining its composition at a defined ratio of [cell type 1]: [cell type 2]. We have constructed the genetic motif that will act in each cell in the two member community, containing an AHL-based negative feedback loop that activates ccdB toxin, which caps population density with increasing feedback strength. It also contains one of two ccdB sequestration modules, either the ccdA protein antitoxin, or an RNA device which prevents transcription and translation of ccdB mRNA, that rescues capped population density with induction. We compare absorbance and colony counting methods of estimating bacterial population density, finding that absorbance-based methods overestimate viable population density when ccdB toxin is used to control population density.\\n\\nPrior modeling results show that two cell types containing this genetic circuit motif that reciprocally activate the others ccdB sequestration device will establish a steady state ratio of cell types. Experimental testing and tuning the full two member community will help us improve our modeling of multi-member bacterial communities, learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of our design for community composition control, and identify general principles of design of compositionally-regulated microbial communities.",

The fact that data sets vary widely in features such as cluster shape, cluster number, density distribution, background noise, outliers and degree of overlap, makes it difficult to find a single algorithm that can be broadly applied. One recent method, based on search of density peaks, can be applied successfully to cluster many kinds of data, but it is not fully automatic, and fails on some simple data distributions. We propose an alternative approach, which estimates density dips between points, and allows robust determination of cluster number and distribution across a wide array of data, without any manual parameter adjustment. We show that this method is able to solve a range of synthetic and experimental data sets, where the underlying structure is known, and identifies consistent and meaningful clusters in new behavioural data.\\n\\nSignificanceIt is common that natural phenomena produce groupings, or clusters, in data, that can reveal the underlying processes. However, the form of these clusters can vary arbitrarily, making it challenging to find a single algorithm that identifies their structure correctly, without prior knowledge of the number of groupings or their distribution. We describe a simple clustering algorithm that is fully automatic and is able to correctly identify the number and shape of groupings in data of many types. We expect this algorithm to be useful in finding unknown natural phenomena present in data from a wide range of scientific fields.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs are non-coding RNAs which down-regulate a large number of target mRNAs and modulate cell activity. Despite continued progress, bioinformatics prediction of microRNA targets remains a challenge since available softwares still suffer from a lack of accuracy and sensitivity. Moreover, these tools show fairly inconsistent results from one another. Thus, in an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, we aggregated all human results of three important prediction algorithms (miRanda, PITA and SVmicrO) showing additional characteristics in order to rerank them into a single list. This database is freely available through a webtool called miRabel (http://bioinfo.univ-rouen.fr/mirabel/) which can take either a list of miRNAs, genes or signaling pathways as search inputs. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves and Precision-Recall curves analysis carried out using experimentally validated data and very large datasets show that miRabel significantly improves the prediction of miRNA targets compared to the three algorithms used separatly. Moreover, using the same analytical methods, miRabel shows significantly better predictions than other popular algorithms such as MBSTAR and miRWalk. Interestingly, a F-score analysis revealed that miRabel also significantly improves the relevance of the top results. The aggregation of results from different databases is therefore a powerful and generalizable approach to many other species to improve miRNA target predictions. Thus, miRabel is an efficient tool to accurately identify miRNA targets and integrate them into a biological context.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe phenotypes of cancer cells are driven in part by somatic structural variants. Structural variants can initiate tumors, enhance their aggressiveness and provide unique therapeutic opportunities. Whole-genome sequencing of tumors can allow exhaustive identification of the specific structural variants present in an individual cancer, facilitating both clinical diagnostics and the discovery of novel mutagenic mechanisms. A plethora of somatic structural variant detection algorithms have been created to enable these discoveries, however there are no systematic benchmarks of them. Rigorous performance evaluation of somatic structural variant detection methods has been challenged by the lack of gold-standards, extensive resource requirements and difficulties arising from the need to share personal genomic information.\\n\\nResultsTo facilitate structural variant detection algorithm evaluations, we create a robust simulation framework for somatic structural variants by extending the BAMSurgeon algorithm. We then organize and enable a crowd-sourced benchmarking within the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge (SMC-DNA). We report here the results of structural variant benchmarking on three different tumors, comprising 204 submissions from 15 teams. In addition to ranking methods, we identify characteristic error-profiles of individual algorithms and general trends across them. Surprisingly, we find that ensembles of analysis pipelines do not always outperform the best individual method, indicating a need for new ways to aggregate somatic structural variant detection approaches.\\n\\nConclusionsThe synthetic tumors and somatic structural variant detection leaderboards remain available as a community benchmarking resource, and BAMSurgeon is available at https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon.",

The emergence and selection of replicating entities is a central problem in prebiotic evolution. Theoretical models have shown how populations of different types of replicating entities exclude or coexist with other classes of replicators. Models are typically kinetic, based on standard replicator equations. On the other hand, the presence of thermodynamical constrains for these systems remain an open question. This is largely due to the lack of a general theory of out of statistical methods for systems far from equilibrium. Nonetheless, a first approach to this problem has been put forward in a series of novel developements in non-equilibrium physics, under the rubric of the extended second law of thermodynamics. The work presented here is twofold: firstly, we review this theoretical framework and provide a brief description of the three fundamental replicator types in prebiotic evolution: parabolic, malthusian and hyperbolic. Finally, we employ these previously mentioned techinques to explore how replicators are constrained by thermodynamics.",

Little attention has been paid to the theoretical dynamic consequences of such change-points. Here we propose a change-point model of stochastic population dynamics. This investigation embodies a shift of attention from the problem of detecting when a change will occur, to another non-trivial puzzle: using ecological theory to understand and predict the post-breakpoint behavior of the population dynamics. The proposed model and the explicit expressions derived here predict and quantify how density dependence modulates the influence of the pre-breakpoint parameters into the post-breakpoint dynamics. Time series transitioning from one stationary distribution to another contain information about where the process was before the change-point, where is it heading and how long it will take to transition, and here this information is explicitly stated. Importantly, our results provide a direct connection of the strength of density dependence with theoretical properties of dynamic systems, such as the concept of resilience. Finally, we illustrate how to harness such information through maximum likelihood estimation for state-space models, and test the model robustness to widely different forms of compensatory dynamics. The model can be used to estimate important quantities in the theory and practice of population recovery.",

Bacteria and archaea with this system incorporate genetic material from invading viruses into their genomes, providing protection against future infection by similar viruses. The conditions for coexistence of prokaryots and viruses is an interesting problem in evolutionary biology. In this work, we show an intriguing phase diagram of the virus extinction probability, which is more complex than that of the classical predator-prey model. As the CRISPR incorporates genetic material, viruses are under pressure to evolve to escape the recognition by CRISPR. When bacteria have a small rate of deleting spacers, a new parameter region in which bacteria and viruses can coexist arises, and it leads to a more complex coexistence patten for bacteria and viruses. For example, when the virus mutation rate is low, the virus extinction probability changes non-montonically with the bacterial exposure rate. The virus and bacteria co-evolution not only alters the virus extinction probability, but also changes the bacterial population structure. Additionally, we show that recombination is a successful strategy for viruses to escape from CRISPR recognition when viruses have multiple proto-spacers, providing support for a recombination-mediated escape mechanism suggested experimentally. Finally, we suggest that the reentrant phase diagram, in which phages can progress through three phases of extinction and two phases of abundance at low spacer deletion rates as a function of exposure rate to bacteria, is an experimentally testable phenomenon.",

It is thought that complex epistatic interactions and developmental constraints impede the re-emergence of such a trait. Oviparous reproduction (egg-laying) requires the formation of an eggshell and represents an example of such a complex trait. In reptiles, viviparity (live-bearing) has evolved repeatedly but it is highly disputed if oviparity has re-evolved. Here, using up to 194,358 SNP loci and 1,334,760 bp of sequence, we reconstruct the phylogeny of viviparous and oviparous lineages of common lizards and infer the evolutionary history of parity modes. Our phylogeny strongly supports six main common lizard lineages that have been previously identified. We find very high statistical support for a topological arrangement that suggests a reversal to oviparity from viviparity. Our topology is consistent with highly differentiated chromosomal configurations between lineages, but disagrees with previous phylogenetic studies in some nodes. While we find high support for a reversal to oviparity, more genomic and developmental data are needed to robustly test this and assess the mechanism by which a reversal might have occurred.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSea lice are parasitic copepods that cause large economic losses to salmon aquaculture worldwide. Frequent chemotherapeutic treatments are typically required to control this parasite, and alternative measures such as breeding for improved host resistance are desirable. Insight into the host-parasite interaction and mechanisms of host resistance can lead to improvements in selective breeding, and potentially novel treatment targets. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to study the skin transcriptome of Atlantic salmon parasitized with sea lice (C. rogercresseyi). The overall aims were to compare the transcriptomic profile of skin at louse attachment sites and  healthy skin, and to assess differences between animals with varying levels of resistance to the parasite.\\n\\nResultsAtlantic salmon were challenged with C. rogercresseyi, growth and lice count measurements were taken for each fish. 21 animals were selected and RNA-Seq was performed on skin from a louse attachment site, and skin distal to attachment sites for each animal. These animals were classified into family-balanced groups according to the traits of resistance (high vs low lice count), and growth during infestation (an indication of tolerance). Overall comparison of skin from louse attachment sites versus healthy skin showed that 4,355 genes were differentially expressed, indicating local up-regulation of several immune pathways and activation of tissue repair mechanisms. Comparison between resistant and susceptible animals highlighted expression differences in several immune response and pattern recognition genes, and also myogenic and iron availability factors. Genomic regions showing signs of differentiation between resistant and susceptible fish were identified using an Fst analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsComparison of the skin transcriptome between louse attachment sites and healthy skin has yielded a detailed profile of genes and pathways with putative roles in the local host immune response to C. rogercresseyi. The difference in skin gene expression profile between resistant and susceptible animals led to the identification of several immune and myogenic pathways potentially involved in host resistance. Components of these pathways may be targets for studies aimed at improved or novel treatment strategies, or to prioritise candidate functional polymorphisms to enhance genomic selection for host resistance in commercial salmon farming.",

As a summary: 1) most fission yeast self-crosses do show low spore survival values; 2) clonally related strains show a high phenotypic variability in self-cross spore survival values; 3) differences in self-cross spore survival values can be detected when comparing zygotic and azygotic mattings; 4) self-cross spore survival values are highly affected by environmental factors, mainly producing a reduction in the spore survival values; 5) self-cross spore survival values are \\\"recovered\\\" when cells are subjected to several rounds of meiotic divisions; 6) signs of correlation between spore survival and vegetative cell survival (prior to the entry into meiosis) have been observed in this study. All those observations, among others, are discussed as part of an epigenetic variability that exist in fission yeast populations. A cyclical behaviour, of this epigenetic variability it is proposed, defining an underlying ratchet-like epigenetic mechanisms acting in all cells. In this manuscript, I propose that this mechanism, is, indeed, the main cause of the ageing process.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 ASD cases and 27,969 controls that identifies five genome-wide significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), seven additional loci shared with other traits are identified at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture we find both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes, in contrast to what is typically seen in other complex disorders. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD, just as it has been in a broad range of important psychiatric and diverse medical phenotypes.",

Previous studies of native or engineered sequences have remained limited in scale. Here, we use random sequences as an alternative, allowing us to measure the expression output of over 100 million synthetic yeast promoters. Random sequences yield a broad range of reproducible expression levels, indicating that the fortuitous binding sites in random DNA are functional. From these data we learn models of transcriptional regulation that predict over 94% of the expression driven from independent test data and nearly 89% from sequences from yeast promoters. These models allow us to characterize the activity of TFs and their interactions with chromatin, and help refine cis-regulatory motifs. We find that strand, position, and helical face preferences of TFs are widespread and depend on interactions with neighboring chromatin. Such massive-throughput regulatory assays of random DNA provide the diverse examples necessary to learn complex models of cis-regulatory logic.",

Here, the transcriptomic consequences of ZIKV infection were studied systematically firstly in human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages with high density RNA-sequencing. Analyses of the ZIKV genome revealed that the virus underwent genetic diversification and differential mRNA abundance was found in host cells during infection. Notably, there was a significant change in the cellular response with crosstalk between monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells as one of the highly identified pathway. Immune-phenotyping of peripheral blood from ZIKV-infected patients further confirmed the activation of NK cells during acute infection. ZIKV infection in peripheral blood cells isolated from healthy donors led to the induction of IFN{gamma} and CD107a -- two key markers of NK-cell function. Depletion of CD14+ monocytes from peripheral blood resulted in a reduction of these markers and reduced priming of NK cells during infection. This was complemented by the immunoproteomic changes observed.

    "abstract": "Several arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) diseases that are associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans. Accordingly, HF arenaviruses have been listed as top-priority emerging diseases for which countermeasures are urgently needed. Because arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) plays critical roles in both virus multiplication and immune-evasion, we used an unbiased proteomic approach to identify NP-interacting proteins in human cells. DDX3, a DEAD-box ATP-dependent-RNA-helicase, interacted with NP in both NP-transfected and virus-infected cells. Importantly, DDX3 deficiency compromised the propagation of both Old and New World arenaviruses, including the HF arenaviruses Lassa and Junin viruses. The DDX3 role in promoting arenavirus multiplication correlated with both a previously un-recognized DDX3 contribution to type I interferon suppression in arenavirus infected cells and a positive effect of DDX3 on viral RNA synthesis. Our results uncover novel mechanisms used by arenavirus to exploit the host machinery and subvert immunity, singling out DDX3 as a potential host target for developing new therapies against highly pathogenic arenaviruses.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYArenaviruses include severe clinical pathogens causing hemorrhagic fevers and have been recently incorporated by the World Health Organization in a list of critical emerging diseases for which additional research and identification of clinical targets is urgently required. A better understanding of how viral proteins interact with host cellular factors to favor arenavirus multiplication can illuminate novel pipelines on therapeutic strategies. Here we demonstrated that the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3 interacted with the arenavirus nucleoprotein, which displays fundamental functions in different steps of the viral-cycle. Our work also revealed an unexpected new biology on the role that DDX3 might play during viral infections. In sharp contrast to previous studies showing DDX3 enhancement of IFN-I induction, we demonstrated that DDX3 suppressed IFN-I production at late time points after arenavirus infection, contributing to a DDX3 pro-viral effect. We also showed that early after infection, DDX3 pro-viral role was IFN-I independent and was mediated by DDX3 facilitation of viral RNA synthesis without affecting RNA translation. Altogether, our study established DDX3 as a critical host interacting partner of the arenavirus nucleoprotein and demonstrated two previously unrecognized DDX3-dependent strategies by which these deadly viruses exploit the host cellular machinery and suppress immunity.",

    "abstract": "To fully characterize the activity patterns on the cerebral cortex as measured with fMRI, the spatial scale of the patterns must be ascertained. Here we address this problem by constructing steerable bandpass filters on the discrete, irregular cortical mesh, using an improved Gaussian smoothing in combination with differential operators of directional derivatives. We demonstrate the utility of the algorithm in two ways. First, using modelling we show that our algorithm yields superior results in numerical precision and spatial uniformity of filter kernels compared to the most widely adopted approach for cortical smoothing. An important interim insight hereby was that the effective scales of information differ from the nominal filter sizes applied to extract them, and thus need to be calculated separately to compare different algorithms on par. Second, we applied the algorithm to an fMRI dataset to assess the scale and pattern form of cortical encoding of information about visual objects in the ventral visual pathway. We found that filtering by our method improved the detection of discriminant information about experimental conditions over previous methods, that the level of categorization (subordinate versus superordinate) of objects was differentially related to the spatial scale of fMRI patterns, and that the spatial scale at which information was encoded increased along the ventral visual pathway. In sum, our results indicate that the proposed algorithm is particularly suited to assess and detect scale-specific information encoding in cortex, and promises further insight into the topography of cortical encoding in the human brain.",

Despite its importance, the early (decisional) stages of confidence processing remain underexplored. Here, we recorded simultaneous EEG/fMRI while participants performed a direction discrimination task and rated their confidence on each trial. Using multivariate single-trial discriminant analysis of the EEG, we identified a stimulus- and accuracy-independent component encoding confidence, appearing prior to subjects choice and explicit confidence report. The trial-to-trial variability in this EEG-derived confidence signal was uniquely associated with fMRI responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a region not typically associated with confidence for perceptual decisions. Furthermore, we showed that the VMPFC was functionally coupled with regions of the prefrontal cortex that support neural representations of confidence during explicit metacognitive report. Our results suggest that the VMPFC encodes an early confidence readout, preceding and potentially informing metacognitive evaluation and learning, by acting as an implicit value/reward signal.",

    "abstract": "Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has focused on analyzing the brain as a network, rather than as a collection of independent regions. Prior studies taking this approach have found that individual differences in the degree of modularity of the brain network relate to performance on cognitive tasks. However, inconsistent results concerning the direction of this relationship have been obtained, with some tasks showing better performance as modularity increases and other tasks showing worse performance. A recent theoretical model (Chen & Deem, 2015) suggests that these inconsistencies may be explained on the grounds that high-modularity networks favor performance on simple tasks whereas low-modularity networks favor performance on more complex tasks. The current study tests these predictions by relating modularity from resting-state fMRI to performance on a set of simple and complex behavioral tasks. Complex and simple tasks were defined on the basis of whether they did or did not draw on executive attention. Consistent with predictions, we found a negative correlation between individuals modularity and their performance on a composite measure combining scores from the complex tasks but a positive correlation with performance on a composite measure combining scores from the simple tasks. These results and theory presented here provide a framework for linking measures of whole brain organization from network neuroscience to cognitive processing.",

    "abstract": "The polyhydroxyalkanoates are a group of microbially-produced biopolymers that have been proposed as sustainable alternatives to several oil-derived plastics. However, polyhydroxyalkanoates are currently more expensive to produce than oil-derived plastics and therefore, more efficient production processes would be desirable. Cell-free transcription-translation-based metabolic engineering strategies have been previously used to optimise several different biosynthetic pathways but not the polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthetic pathways. Here we have developed several Escherichia coli cell-free transcription-translation-based systems for in vitro prototyping of polyhydroxyalkanoates biosynthetic operons, and also for screening relevant metabolite recycling enzymes. These cell-free transcription-translation reactions were customised through the addition of whey permeate, an industrial waste that has been previously used as a low-cost feedstock for optimising in vivo polyhydroxyalkanoates production. We found that the inclusion of an optimal concentration of whey permeate enhanced relative cell-free GFPmut3b production by ~20% compared to control reactions that did not include whey permeate. An analysis of pH in our cell-free reactions suggests that the observed increase in GFPmut3b production was likely through enhanced ATP generation, as a consequence of the glycolytic processing of lactose present in whey permeate. We also found that whey permeate enhanced cell-free reactions produced ~3M (R)-3HB-CoA, whilst, coupled cell-free biotransformation/transcription-translation reactions produced a ten-fold greater yield of (R)-3HB-CoA. These reactions were also used to characterise a Clostridium propionicum propionyl CoA transferase enzyme that can recycle Acetyl-CoA. Together our data demonstrate that cell-free approaches can be used to complement in vivo workflows for identifying additional strategies for optimising polyhydroxyalkanoates production.",

To accomplish this, cells have evolved methods to measure the presence and concentration of these small molecules in their environment and enact changes in gene expression or behavior. However, cells dont usually change their DNA in response to such outside stimuli. In this work, we have engineered a genetic circuit that can enact specific and controlled genetic changes in response to changing small molecule concentrations. Known DNA sequences can be repeatedly integrated into a genomic array such that their identity and order encodes information about past small molecule concentrations that the cell has experienced. To accomplish this, we use catalytically inactive CRISPR-Cas9 (dCas9) to bind to and block attachment sites for the integrase Bxb1. Therefore, through the co-expression of dCas9 and guide RNA, Bxb1 can be directed to integrate one of two engineered plasmids, which correspond to two orthogonal small molecule inducers that can be recorded with this system. We identified the optimal location of guide RNA binding to the Bxb1 attP integrase attachment site, and characterized the detection limits of the system by measuring the minimal small molecule concentration and shortest induction time necessary to produce measurable differences in array composition as read out by Oxford Nanopore long read sequencing technology.",

    "abstract": "SummaryPlastid ribosomes are very similar in structure and function to ribosomes of their bacterial ancestors. Since ribosome biogenesis is not thermodynamically favourable at biological conditions, it requires activity of many assembly factors. Here, we have characterized a homolog of bacterial rsgA in Arabidopsis thaliana and show that it can complement the bacterial homolog. Functional characterization of a strong mutant in Arabidopsis revealed that the protein is essential for plant viability, while a weak mutant produced dwarf, chlorotic plants that incorporated immature pre-16S ribosomal RNA into translating ribosomes. Physiological analysis of the mutant plants revealed smaller, but more numerous chloroplasts in the mesophyll cells, reduction of chlorophyll a and b, depletion of proplastids from the rib meristem and decreased photosynthetic electron transport rate and efficiency. Comparative RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis of the weak mutant and wild-type plants revealed that various biotic stress-related, transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional modification pathways were repressed in the mutant. Intriguingly, while nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded photosynthesis-related proteins were less abundant in the mutant, the corresponding transcripts were upregulated, suggesting an elaborate compensatory mechanism, potentially via differentially active retrograde signalling pathways. To conclude, this study reveals a new chloroplast ribosome assembly factor and outlines the transcriptomic and proteomic responses of the compensatory mechanism activated during decreased chloroplast function.\\n\\nSignificance statementAtRsgA is an assembly factor necessary for maturation of the small subunit of the chloroplast ribosome.
