    "abstract": "In the last few decades, the idea that people routinely and implicitly predict upcoming words during language comprehension has turned from a controversial hypothesis to a widely-accepted assumption. Current theories of language comprehension1-3 posit prediction, or context-based pre-activation, as an essential mechanism occurring at all levels of linguistic representation (semantic, morpho-syntactic and phonological/orthographic) and facilitating the integration of words into the unfolding discourse representation. The strongest evidence to date for phonological pre-activation comes from DeLong, Urbach and Kutas4, who monitored participants electrophysiological brain responses as they read sentences, presented one word at a time, with expected/unexpected indefinite article + noun combinations like, \\\"The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly a kite/an airplane\\\". The sentences varied expectations ( cloze probability) for a consonant- or vowel-initial noun, as determined in a sentence-completion task using other participants. Expectedly, the amplitude of the N400 event-related potential (ERP) decreased (became less negative) with increasing cloze reflecting ease of processing5-6. Whereas the decreased N400 at the noun could be due to its pre-activation or because high-cloze nouns are easier to integrate, crucially, N400s at the immediately-preceding article a or an showed the same relationship with cloze, i.e., encountering an indefinite article that mismatched a highly-expected word (e.g., an when expecting kite) also elicited a larger N400. This led to the claim that participants pre-activated highly-expected nouns, including their initial phonemes, based on the preceding context, with larger N400s on mismatching articles reflecting disconfirmation of this prediction.\\n\\nThe Delong et al. study warranted stronger conclusions than related results available at the time. Unlike previous work, it did not rely on the precursory visual-depiction of upcoming nouns, clearly de-confounded prediction and integration effects, and tested for graded phonological pre-activation of specific word form. Correspondingly, the study has been enthusiastically received as strong evidence for probabilistic phonological pre-activation, receiving over 650 citations to date and featuring in authoritative reviews2-3. However, there is good cause to question the soundness of the original finding (and the appropriateness of the analysis used). Attempts to replicate the critical article-effect have failed7. Moreover, an earlier, alternative analysis of the same data by the authors8 failed to reach statistical significance, but was omitted from the published report.\\n\\nTo obtain more definitive evidence, we conducted a direct replication study spanning 9 laboratories (Ntotal = 334). We pre-registered one replication analysis that was faithful to the original, and one single-trial analysis that modeled subject- and item-level variance using linear mixed-effects models. Applying the replication analysis to our article data (Figure 1a), the original finding did not replicate: no laboratory observed a significant negative relationship between cloze and N400 at central-parietal electrodes. In contrast, the negative relationship was successfully replicated for the nouns: 6 laboratories observed such an effect and 2 laboratories observed relatively strong but non-significant effects in the expected direction (range r = .30 to .50). In the single-trial analysis (Fig. 1b-c), there was no statistically significant effect of cloze on article-N400s, also with stricter control for pre-article voltage levels (Supplementary Fig. 1). Crucially, there was a strong and significant cloze effect on noun-N400s (in all laboratories), which was significantly different from that on article-N400s. We observed no significant differences between laboratories for article or noun effects. Exploratory Bayesian analyses with priors based on DeLong et al. further support our conclusions (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2). Finally, a control experiment confirmed our participants sensitivity to the a/an rule during online language comprehension (Supplementary Fig. 3).\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=173 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/111807_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (72K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1231330org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c0eb43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95a28forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e38ee6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1C_FLOATNO A multi-lab failure to replicate evidence for probabilistic pre-activation of phonology.

We performed tests which used longer baseline time windows (200 ms, upper left panel; 500 ms, upper right panel) to better control for pre-article voltage levels, or which used the pre-registered baseline and applied a 0.1 Hz high-pass filter (lower left panel) to better control for slow signal drift (while presumably not affecting N400 activity). All three tests reduced the initially observed effect of article-cloze (200 ms baseline, = .25, CI [-.12, .62], {chi}2(1) = 1.35, p = .19; 500 ms baseline, = .14, CI [-.25, .53], {chi}2(1) = 0.46, p = .50; 0.1 Hz filter: = 0.09, CI [-.22, .41], {chi}2(1) = 0.33, p = .56).

Combined, these results suggest that the results obtained with the pre-registered analysis at least partly reflected the effects of slow signal drift that existed before the articles were presented.\\n\\nC_FIG O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/111807_figS2.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 2\\\">\\nView larger version (35K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@124ffa2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af29aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bd69d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e3b98_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOSupplementary Figure 2.C_FLOATNO Results from exploratory Bayesian mixed-effects model analyses, represented by posterior distributions for the effect of cloze on ERP amplitudes in the N400 window. The x-axis shows cloze effect sizes (i.e., changes in microvolts associated with an increase from 0% cloze probability to 100% cloze probability). The black line indicates the posterior distribution of effects; higher values of the posterior density at a given effect size indicate higher probability that this is the true effect size in the population. The peak of the posterior distribution roughly corresponds to the point estimate of the effect size (the regression coefficient) fitted from the Bayesian mixed effect model, i.e., the most likely value of the true effect size. The middle 95% of the posterior distribution, shaded in pink, corresponds to a two-tailed 95% credible interval for the effect sizei.e., an interval that we can be 95% confident contains the true effect. The green dotted line indicates the prior distribution (i.e., our expectation about where the true effect would lie before the data were collected), which is centered on 1.25V, the effect observed by Delong and colleagues (2005). The black connected dots illustrate the ratio between the posterior and prior distribution (i.e., the Bayes Factor) at the effect size of 0V; for example, a Bayes Factor of 4 suggests we can be 4 times more certain that the true effect is zero after having conducted this experiment than before, or, in other words, that the data increased our confidence in the null effect of zero fourfold. We performed these analyses for each of the linear mixed-effects model analysis we performed. We note that in all the article-analyses, the posterior probability of the estimated effect being greater than zero is around 80 or 90%, but this is also the case for the pre-stimulus variable, suggesting that the observed patterns arise before the articles are seen. In none of our article-analyses did zero lie outside the obtained credible interval, whereas for the nouns, zero lay outside the credible interval. These results are consistent with a failure to replicate the DeLong et al. article-effect and successful replication of the noun-effect.\\n\\nC_FIG O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/111807_figS3.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 3\\\">\\nView larger version (25K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab14forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fed126org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@55369corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@747668_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOSupplementary Figure 3.C_FLOATNO P600 effects at electrode Pz per lab associated with flouting of the English a/an rule in the control experiment. Plotted ERPs show the grand-average difference waveform and standard deviation for ERPs elicited by ungrammatical expressions (an kite) minus those elicited by grammatical expressions (a kite). This control experiment followed in the same experimental session as the main experiment and was carried to rule out that an observed lack of a statistically significant, article-elicited prediction effect in the main experiment reflected a general insensitivity of our participants to the a/an rule. In each laboratory, nouns following incorrect articles elicited a late positive-going waveform compared to nouns following correct articles, starting at about 500 ms after word onset and strongest at parietal electrodes. This standard P600 effect was confirmed in a single-trial analysis, {chi}2(1) = 83.09, p < .001, and did not significantly differ between labs, {chi}2(8) = 8.98, p = .35.\\n\\nC_FIG\\n\\nDespite a sample size 10 times larger than the original and improved statistical analysis, we observed no statistically significant effect of cloze on article-N400s, while replicating the strong and statistically significant effect of cloze on noun-N400s4,6. The effect of cloze on article-N400s, if existent, must be very small to evade detection given our expansive approach. Whether such an effect would constitute convincing evidence for routine phonological pre-activation as assumed in theories of language comprehension3 can be questioned, but, more generally, such an effect cannot be meaningfully studied in typical small-scale studies. Consequently, current theoretical positions may be based on potentially unreliable findings and require revision. In particular, the strong prediction view that claims that pre-activation routinely occurs across all - including phonological - levels3, can no longer be viewed as having strong empirical support.\\n\\nOur results do not constitute evidence against prediction in general. We note a lack of convincing evidence specifically for phonological pre-activation, which would have to be measured before a noun appears and unobscured by processes instigated by the noun itself.\\n\\nHowever, our results neither support nor necessarily exclude phonological pre-activation. Unlike gender-marked articles9 (e.g., in Dutch or Spanish) that agree with nouns irrespective of intervening words, English a/an articles index the subsequent word, which is not always a noun. Maybe our participants did not use mismatching articles to disconfirm predicted nouns, possibly because it was not a viable strategy (American and British English corpus data show a mere 33% chance that a noun follows such articles). Perhaps a revision of the predicted meaning is required to trigger differential ERPs.\\n\\nDeLong et al. recently described filler-sentences in their experiment10, cf. 7, which were omitted from their original report, and were neither provided nor mentioned to us upon our request for their stimuli. DeLong used the existence of these filler-sentences to dismiss an alternative explanation of their results, namely that an unusual experimental context wherein every sentence contains an article-noun combination leads participants to strategically predict upcoming nouns. Importantly, we failed to replicate their article-effects despite an experimental context that could inadvertently encourage strategic prediction. Therefore, the difference between their experiment and ours cannot explain the different results, and may even strengthen our conclusions.\\n\\nIn sum, our findings do not support a strong prediction view involving routine and probabilistic pre-activation of phonological word form based on preceding context.\\n\\nMoreover, our results further highlight the importance of direct replication, large sample size studies, transparent reporting and of pre-registration to advance reproducibility and replicability in the neurosciences.",

    "abstract": "Cancer genomes often harbor hundreds of molecular aberrations. Such genetic variants can be drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis and, as a side effect, create new vulnerabilities for potential therapeutic exploitation. To systematically identify genotype-dependent vulnerabilities and synthetic lethal interactions, forward genetic screens in different genetic backgrounds have been conducted. We devised MINGLE, a computational framework that integrates CRISPR/Cas9 screens originating from many different libraries and laboratories to build genetic interaction maps. It builds on analytical approaches that were established for genetic network discovery in model organisms. We applied this method to integrate and analyze data from 85 CRISPR/Cas9 screens in human cancer cell lines combining functional data with information on genetic variants to explore the relationships of more than 2.1 million gene-background relationships. In addition to known dependencies, our analysis identified new genotype-specific vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Experimental validation of predicted vulnerabilities associated with aberrant Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling identified GANAB and PRKCSH as new positive regulators of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. By clustering genes with similar genetic interaction profiles, we drew the largest genetic network in cancer cells to date. Our scalable approach highlights how diverse genetic screens can be integrated to systematically build informative maps of genetic interactions in cancer, which can grow dynamically as more data is included.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we examine a new source of evidence that draws on data from archaic human genomes to support the hypothesis that vocal learning in Homo preceded the emergence of Anatomically Modern Humans. We build our claim on the evolutionary history of the SLITROBO GTPase 2 gene (SRGAP2). The SLIT-ROBO molecular pathway has been shown to have an important role in the context of vocal learning. Though the relevance of the SRGAP2 gene duplication in the emergence of some aspect of language has not gone completely unnoticed, recent results now allow us to articulate a mechanistic hypothesis of its role in the context of axon guidance. Specifically, SRGAP2C, a duplication of SRGAP2 crucially also found in Neanderthals and Denisovans, but not in extant mammals, inhibits the ancestral SRGAP2A, which in turn modulates the axon guidance function of the SLIT-ROBO molecular pathway. This, we claim, could have contributed to the establishment of the critical cortico-laryngeal connection of the vocal learning circuit. Our conclusions support the idea that complex vocal learning could already have been part of the arsenal of some of our extinct ancestors.",

    "abstract": "Genetic expression of fluorescently labeled proteins is essential to visualizing dynamic behavior within live cells. Recent advances in microscopy have increased resolution to the level where it is now possible to capture individual molecules interacting. However, the criteria for determining whether a fluorescent label perturbs protein function have not undergone a corresponding increase in resolution. The effects of protein labeling on cell function are still judged by whether populations of protein localize and interact with known binding partners. Here we use integrins, bidirectional signal adhesion molecules that regulate interactions between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton through a well-defined series of conformational changes to show that not all labeling strategies are the same. We found that labeling the beta subunit decreased the mobility of individual integrin molecules and the protrusive activity of the entire cell. While integrins with labeled alpha subunits behaved similarly to unlabeled integrins, labeling the beta subunit increased the size of adhesions by elevating integrin affinity and exposing the ligand induced binding domain to change the molecule conformation. Thus, our single molecule and cellular data indicate that the ability of labeled proteins to localize and interact with known binding partners does not guarantee it does not alter protein function. We propose that the behaviors of individual molecules rather than the ensemble behavior of populations need to be considered as criteria to determine if a probe is non-perturbative.",

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a dataset of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural networks based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource. Given the likely importance of phenology for forecasting the likelihood of future Ebola spillover events, our results highlight the need for cost-effective transect surveys to supply phenology data for predictive modelling efforts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSustainable Development Goals set a challenge for the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as a public health concern by the year 2030. Deployment of a robust prophylactic vaccine and enhanced interventions for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) are cornerstones of elimination strategy. However, in light of the estimated global burden of 290 million cases, enhanced efforts are required to underpin optimisation of public health strategy. Robust analysis of population epidemiology is particularly crucial for populations in Africa made vulnerable by HIV co-infection, poverty, stigma and poor access to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.\\n\\nMethodsWe here set out to evaluate the current and future role of HBV vaccination and PMTCT as tools for elimination. We first investigated the current impact of paediatric vaccination in a cohort of children with and without HIV infection in Kimberley, South Africa. Second, we used these data to inform a new model to simulate the ongoing impact of preventive interventions. By applying these two approaches in parallel, we are able to determine both the current impact of interventions, and the future projected outcome of ongoing preventive strategies over time.\\n\\nResultsExisting efforts have been successful in reducing paediatric prevalence of HBV infection in this setting to <1%, demonstrating the success of the existing vaccine campaign. Our model predicts that, if consistently deployed, combination efforts of vaccination and PMTCT can significantly reduce population prevalence (HBsAg) by 2030, such that a major public health impact is possible even without achieving elimination. However, the prevalence of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive carriers will decline more slowly, representing a persistent population reservoir. We show that HIV co-infection significantly reduces titres of vaccine-mediated antibody, but has a relatively minor role in influencing the projected time to elimination. Our model can also be applied to other settings in order to predict time to elimination based on specific interventions.\\n\\nConclusionsThrough extensive deployment of preventive strategies for HBV, significant positive public health impact is possible, although time to HBV elimination as a public health concern is likely to be substantially longer than that proposed by current goals.",

GRNs control different biological processes and have been instrumental to understand the organization and complexity of gene regulation. Although various experimental methods have been used to map GRNs in Arabidopsis thaliana, their limited throughput combined with the large number of TFs makes that for many genes our knowledge about regulating TFs is incomplete. We introduce TF2Network, a tool that exploits the vast amount of TF binding site information and enables the delineation of GRNs by detecting potential regulators for a set of co-expressed or functionally related genes. Validation using two experimental benchmarks reveals that TF2Network predicts the correct regulator in 75-92% of the test sets. Furthermore, our tool is robust to noise in the input gene sets, has a low false discovery rate, and shows a better performance to recover correct regulators compared to other plant tools. TF2Network is accessible through a web interface where GRNs are interactively visualized and annotated with various types of experimental functional information. TF2Network was used to perform systematic functional and regulatory gene annotations, identifying new TFs involved in circadian rhythm and stress response.",

The beneficial effects of CR have been proposed to work through epigenetic processes, but this is largely unexplored. We therefore tested whether life-long CR prevents age-related DNA methylation changes in the brain. Hippocampal DNA from young (3 months) and old (24 months) male mice fed ad libitum and 24 month old mice fed a 40% calorierestricted diet from 3 months of age were examined by genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to measure methylation with base-specificity. Over 27 million CG and CH (non-CG) sites were examined. Of the ~40,000 differentially methylated CGs (dmCGs) and ~80,000 CHs (dmCHs) with aging, >1/3 were prevented by CR and were found across genomic regulatory regions and gene pathways. CR also caused alterations to CG and CH methylation at sites not differentially methylated with aging, and these CR-specific changes demonstrated a different pattern of regulatory element and gene pathway enrichment than those affected by aging. CR-specific DNMT1 and TET3 promoter hypermethylation corresponded to reduced gene expression. These findings demonstrate that CR attenuates age-related CG and CH hippocampal methylation changes, in combination with CR-specific methylation that may also contribute to the neuroprotective effects of CR. The prevention of age-related methylation alterations is also consistent with the pro-longevity effects of CR working through an epigenetic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional mechanisms play a predominant role in the control of microRNA (miRNA) production. Recognition of the terminal loop of precursor miRNAs by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) influences their processing; however, the mechanistic and structural basis for how levels of individual or subsets of miRNAs are regulated is mostly unexplored. We previously described a role for hnRNP A1, an RBP implicated in many aspects of RNA processing, as an auxiliary factor that promotes the Microprocessor-mediated processing of pri-mir-18a. Here, we reveal the mechanistic basis for this stimulatory role of hnRNP A1 by combining integrative structural biology with biochemical and functional assays. We demonstrate that hnRNP A1 forms a 1:1 complex with pri-mir-18a that involves binding of both RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) to cognate RNA sequence motifs in the conserved terminal loop of pri-mir-18a. Terminal loop binding induces an allosteric destabilization of base-pairing in the pri-mir-18a stem that promotes its down-stream processing. Our results highlight terminal loop RNA recognition by RNA-binding proteins as a general principle of miRNA biogenesis and regulation.",

Here, we investigate the specific roles of these brain regions in learning rules that depend critically on the formation of abstract concepts as opposed to simpler input-output associations. To this aim, we tested monkeys with bilateral removals of either LPFC or OFC on a rapidly learned task requiring the formation of the abstract concept of same vs. different. While monkeys with OFC removals were significantly slower than controls at both acquiring and reversing the concept-based rule, monkeys with LPFC removals were not impaired in acquiring the task, but were significantly slower at rule reversal. Neither group was impaired in the acquisition or reversal of a delayed visual cue-outcome association task without a concept-based rule. These results suggest that OFC is essential for the implementation of a concept-based rule, whereas LPFC seems essential for its modification once established.",

    "abstract": "Human immunity influences the evolution and impact of novel influenza strains. Because individuals are infected with multiple influenza strains during their lifetime and each virus can generate a cross-reactive antibody response, it is challenging to quantify the processes that shape observed immune responses, or to reliably detect recent infection from serological samples. Using a Bayesian model of antibody dynamics at multiple timescales, we explain complex cross-reactive antibody landscapes by inferring participants histories of infection with serological data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of influenza A/H3N2 in southern China and Vietnam. We show an individuals influenza antibody profile can be explained by a short-lived, broadly cross-reactive response that decays within a year to leave a smaller long-term response acting against a narrower range of strains. We also demonstrate that accounting for dynamic immune responses can provide a more accurate alternative to traditional definitions seroconversion for the estimation of infection attack rates. Our work provides a general model for explaining mechanisms of influenza immunity acting at multiple timescales based on contemporary serological data, and suggests a two-armed immune response to influenza infection consistent with competitive dynamics between B cell populations. This approach to analysing multiple timescales for antigenic responses could also be applied to other multi-strain pathogens such as dengue and related flaviviruses.",

    "abstract": "Countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties. Only a few studies have explored how such variations influence how humans navigate or reason about space [1-7]. We predicted that these variations impact human cognition, resulting in an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people, sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-centre clinical trials using cognitive testing.",

    "abstract": "Reliable interpretation and quantification of cellular features in fluorescence microscopy requires an accurate estimate of microscope resolution. This is typically obtained by measuring the image of a non-biological proxy for a point-like object, such as a fluorescent bead. While appropriate for confocal microscopy, bead-based measurements are problematic for Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) and similar techniques where the resolution depends critically on the choice of fluorophore and acquisition parameters. We demonstrate that for a known geometry, e.g. tubules, the resolution can be accurately measured by fitting a model that accounts for both the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the fluorophore distribution. To address the problem of coupling between tubule diameter and PSF width, we developed a technique, Nested-loop Ensemble PSF (NEP) fitting. NEP fitting enables extraction of the size of cellular features and the PSF in fixed-cell and live-cell images without relying on beads or pre-calibration. We validate our technique using fixed microtubules and apply it to measure the diameter of endoplasmic reticulum tubules in live COS-7 cells. NEP fitting has been implemented as a plugin for the PYthon Microscopy Environment (PYME), a freely available and open source software.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDMicrobial arrays, with a large number of different strains on a single plate printed with robotic precision, underpin an increasing number of genetic and genomic approaches. These include Synthetic Genetic Array analysis, high-throughput Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis and 2-hybrid techniques. Measuring the growth of individual colonies within these arrays is an essential part of many of these techniques but is useful for any work with arrays. Measurement is typically done using intermittent imagery fed into complex image analysis software, which is not especially accurate and is challenging to use effectively. We have developed a simple and fast alternative technique that uses a pinning robot and a commonplace microplate reader to continuously measure the thickness of colonies growing on solid agar, complemented by a technique for normalizing the amount of cells initially printed to each spot of the array in the first place. We have developed software to automate the process of combining multiple sets of readings, subtracting agar absorbance, and visualizing colony thickness changes in a number of informative ways.\\n\\nRESULTSThe \\\"PHENOS\\\" pipeline (PHENotyping On Solid media), optimized for Saccharomyces yeasts, produces highly reproducible growth curves and is particularly sensitive to low-level growth. We have empirically determined a formula to estimate colony cell count from an absorbance measurement, and shown this to be comparable with estimates from measurements in liquid. We have also validated the technique by reproducing the results of an earlier QTL study done with conventional liquid phenotyping, and found PHENOS to be considerably more sensitive.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\\"PHENOS\\\" is a cost effective and reliable high-throughput technique for quantifying growth of yeast arrays, and is likely to be equally very useful for a range of other types of microbial arrays.

The central limit theorem approximation is unreliable for GWAS regression p-values, and measured phenotypes often have markedly non-normal distributions.

    "abstract": "Individual bacterial lineages stably persist for years in the human gut microbiome1-3. However, the potential of these lineages to adapt during colonization of healthy people is not well understood2,4. Here, we assess evolution within individual microbiomes by sequencing the genomes of 602 Bacteroides fragilis isolates cultured from 12 healthy subjects. We find that B. fragilis within-subject populations contain substantial de novo nucleotide and mobile element diversity, which preserve years of within-person evolutionary history. This evolutionary history contains signatures of within-person adaptation to both subject-specific and common selective forces, including parallel mutations in sixteen genes. These sixteen genes are involved in cell-envelope biosynthesis and polysaccharide utilization, as well as yet under-characterized pathways. Notably, one of these genes has been shown to be critical for B. fragilis colonization in mice5, indicating that key genes have not already been optimized for survival in vivo. This lack of optimization, given historical signatures of purifying selection in these genes, suggests that varying selective forces with discordant solutions act upon B. fragilis in vivo. Remarkably, in one subject, two B. fragilis sublineages coexisted at a stable relative frequency over a 1.5-year period despite rapid adaptive dynamics within one of the sublineages. This stable coexistence suggests that competing selective forces can lead to B. fragilis niche-differentiation even within a single person. We conclude that B. fragilis adapts rapidly within the microbiomes of individual healthy people, providing a new route for the discovery of key genes in the microbiome and implications for microbiome stability and manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Classic pulse-chase studies have shown that actin is conveyed in slow axonal transport, but the mechanistic basis for this movement is unknown. Recently, we reported that axonal actin was surprisingly dynamic, with focal assembly/dis-assembly events (\\\"hotspots\\\") and elongating polymers along the axon-shaft (\\\"trails\\\"). Using a combination of live imaging, super-resolution microscopy, and modeling, here we explore how these axonal actin dynamics can lead to processive transport. We found abundant actin nucleation, along with a slow, anterogradely-biased flow of actin in axon-shafts. Starting with first principles of monomer/filament assembly - and incorporating imaging data - we generated a quantitative model simulating axonal hotspots and trails. Our simulations predict that the axonal actin dynamics indeed lead to an anterogradely-biased flow of the population, at rates consistent with slow transport. Collectively, the data point to a surprising scenario where local assembly and biased polymerization generate the slow axonal transport of actin. This mechanism is distinct from polymer-sliding, and seems well suited to convey highly dynamic cytoskeletal cargoes.\\n\\nAcknowledgementsThis work was supported by an NIH grant to SR (R01NS075233).

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin remains unclear. To begin addressing this, we created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24h exposure to varying levels of doxorubicin. The transcriptomic response to doxorubicin is substantial, with the majority of genes being differentially expressed across treatments of different concentrations and over 6000 genes showing evidence of differential splicing. Overall, our observations indicate that splicing fidelity decreases in the presence of doxorubicin. We detect 376 response-expression QTLs and 42 response-splicing QTLs, i.e. genetic variants that modulate the individual transcriptomic response to doxorubicin in terms of expression and splicing changes respectively. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of cell damage measured in vitro using a cardiac troponin assay, which in turn is shown to be associated with in vivo ACT risk. Finally, the molecular QTLs we detected are enriched in lower ACT GWAS p-values, further supporting the in vivo relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.",

Genes have an intrinsic ability to either buffer or amplify the effects of high promoter activity. We present a coupled mathematical model and experimental system for quantifying this property. Promoter activity buffering can be encoded by sequences in both the open reading frame and 3end of genes, and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback loops and by titration of limiting trans regulators. We show experimentally that promoter activity buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misexpression. The response of genes to changes in [TF] is encoded by sequences outside of the promoter, and this effect can either insulate or amplify the effects of aneuploidy and misregulation on organismal fitness.",

Several recent evaluation studies demonstrate that current methods either lack sufficient sensitivity for species-level assignments or suffer from false positives, overestimating the number of species in the metagenome. Both are especially problematic for the identification of low-abundance microbial species, e. g. detecting pathogens in ancient metagenomic samples. We present a new method, SPARSE, which improves taxonomic assignments of metagenomic reads. SPARSE balances existing biased reference databases by grouping reference genomes into similarity-based hierarchical clusters, implemented as an efficient incremental data structure. SPARSE assigns reads to these clusters using a probabilistic model, which specifically penalizes non-specific mappings of reads from unknown sources and hence reduces false-positive assignments. Our evaluation on simulated datasets from two recent evaluation studies demonstrated the improved precision of SPARSE in comparison to other methods for species-level classification. In a third simulation, our method successfully differentiated multiple co-existing Escherichia coli strains from the same sample. In real archaeological datasets, SPARSE identified ancient pathogens with[&le;] 0.02% abundance, consistent with published findings that required additional sequencing data. In these datasets, other methods either missed targeted pathogens or reported non-existent ones. SPARSE and all evaluation scripts are available at https://github.com/zheminzhou/SPARSE.",

    "abstract": "The sensory recruitment hypothesis states that visual short term memory is maintained in the same visual cortical areas that initially encode a stimulus features. Although it is well established that the distance between features in visual cortex determines their visibility, a limitation known as crowding, it is unknown whether short term memory is similarly constrained by the cortical spacing of memory items. Here we investigated whether the cortical spacing between sequentially presented memoranda affects the fidelity of memory in humans (of both sexes). In a first experiment, we varied cortical spacing by taking advantage of the log-scaling of visual cortex with eccentricity, sequentially presenting memoranda in peripheral vision along either the radial or tangential visual axis with respect to the fovea. In a second experiment, we sequentially presented memoranda either within or beyond the critical spacing of visual crowding, a distance within which visual features cannot be perceptually distinguished due to their nearby cortical representations. In both experiments and across multiple measures, we found strong evidence that the ability to maintain visual features in memory is unaffected by cortical spacing. These results indicate that the neural architecture underpinning working memory has properties inconsistent with the known behaviour of sensory neurons in visual cortex. Instead, the dissociation between perceptual and memory representations supports a role of higher cortical areas, such as posterior parietal or prefrontal regions, or may involve an as yet unspecified mechanism in visual cortex in which stimulus features are bound to their temporal order.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAlthough much is known about the resolution with which we can remember visual objects, the cortical representation of items held in short term memory remains contentious. A popular hypothesis suggests that memory of visual features is maintained via the recruitment of the same neural architecture in sensory cortex that encodes stimuli. We investigated this claim by manipulating the spacing in visual cortex between sequentially presented memoranda such that some items shared cortical representations more than others, while preventing perceptual interference between stimuli. We found clear evidence that short term memory is independent of the intra-cortical spacing of memoranda, revealing a dissociation between perceptual and memory representations. Our data indicate that working memory relies on different neural mechanisms from sensory perception.",

    "abstract": "The premotor theory of attention postulates that spatial attention arises from the activation of saccade areas and that the deployment of attention is the consequence of motor programming. Yet, attentional and oculomotor processes have been shown to be dissociable at the neuronal level in covert attention tasks. To investigate a potential dissociation at the behavioral level, we instructed human participants to saccade towards one of two nearby, competing saccade cues. The spatial distribution of visual attention was determined using oriented Gabor stimuli presented either at the cue locations, between them or at several other equidistant locations. Results demonstrate that accurate saccades towards one of the cues were associated with presaccadic enhancement of visual sensitivity at the respective saccade endpoint compared to the non-saccaded cue location. In contrast, averaging saccades, landing between the two cues, were not associated with attentional facilitation at the saccade endpoint, ruling out an obligatory coupling of attentional deployment to the oculomotor program. Rather, attention before averaging saccades was equally distributed to the two cued locations. Taken together, our results reveal a spatial dissociation of visual attention and saccade programming. They suggest that the oculomotor program depends on the state of attentional selection before saccade onset, and that saccade averaging arises from unresolved attentional selection.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions, which are beneficial for both interacting species, are recurrently present in ecosystems. Observations of natural systems showed that, if we draw mutualistic relationships as binary links between species, the resulting bipartite network of interactions displays a widespread particular ordering called nestedness [1]. On the other hand, theoretical works have shown that a nested structure has a positive impact on a number of relevant features ranging from species coexistence [2], to a higher structural stability of communities and biodiversity [3,4]. However, how nestedness emerges and what are its determinants, are still open challenges that have led to multiple debates to date [5-7]. Here, we show, by applying a theoretical approach to the analysis of 167 real mutualistic networks, that nestedness is not an irreducible feature, but a consequence of the degree sequences of both guilds of the mutualistic network. Remarkably, we find that an outstanding majority of the analyzed networks does not show statistical significant nestedness. These findings point to the need of revising previous claims about the role of nestedness and might contribute to expand our understanding of how evolution shapes mutualistic interactions and communities by placing the focus on the local properties rather than on global quantities.",

    "abstract": "Zeta diversity provides the average number of shared species across n sites (or shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across n cases). It quantifies the variation in species composition of multiple assemblages in space and time to capture the contribution of the full suite of narrow, intermediate and wide-ranging species to biotic heterogeneity. Zeta diversity was proposed for measuring compositional turnover in plant and animal assemblages, but is equally relevant for application to any biological system that can be characterised by a row by column incidence matrix. Here we illustrate the application of zeta diversity to explore compositional change in empirical data, and how observed patterns may be interpreted. We use 10 datasets from a broad range of scales and levels of biological organisation - from DNA molecules to microbes, plants and birds - including one of the original data sets used by R.H. Whittaker in the 1960s to express compositional change and distance decay using beta diversity. The applications show (i) how different sampling schemes used during the calculation of zeta diversity may be appropriate for different data types and ecological questions, (ii) how higher orders of zeta may in some cases better detect shifts, transitions or periodicity, and importantly (iii) the relative roles of rare versus common species in driving patterns of compositional change. By exploring the application of zeta diversity across this broad range of contexts, our goal is to demonstrate its value as a tool for understanding continuous biodiversity turnover and as a metric for filling the empirical gap that exists on spatial or temporal change in compositional diversity.",

The brain solves this problem arguably by dividing a sequence into discrete chunks of contiguous items. While chunking has been accounted for by predictive uncertainty, alternative mechanisms have also been suggested, and the mechanism underlying chunking is poorly understood. Here, we propose a class of unsupervised neural networks for learning and identifying repeated patterns in sequence input with various degrees of complexity. In this model, a pair of reservoir computing modules, each of which comprises a recurrent neural network and readout units, supervise each other to consistently predict others responses to frequently recurring segments. Interestingly, this system generates neural responses similar to those formed in the basal ganglia during habit formation. Our model extends reservoir computing to higher cognitive function and demonstrates its resemblance to sequence processing by cortico-basal ganglia loops.",

The main challenge is to integrate these multiple levels of omics profiles and especially to analyze them across many cancers. Here we present AMARETTO, an algorithm that addresses both challenges in three steps. First, AMARETTO identifies potential cancer driver genes through integration of copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data. Then AMARETTO connects these driver genes with co-expressed target genes that they control, defined as regulatory modules. Thirdly, we connect AMARETTO modules identified from different cancer sites into a pancancer network to identify cancer driver genes. Here we applied AMARETTO in a pancancer study comprising eleven cancer sites and confirmed that AMARETTO captures hallmarks of cancer. We also demonstrated that AMARETTO enables the identification of novel pancancer driver genes.

RAD-Seq is a technique characterized by the sequencing of specific loci along the genome, that is widely employed in the field of evolutionary biology since it allows to exploit variants (mainly SNPs) information from entire populations at a reduced cost. Common RAD dedicated tools, as STACKS or IPyRAD, are based on all-versus-all read comparisons, which require consequent time and computing resources. Based on the variant caller DiscoSnp, initially designed for shotgun sequencing, DiscoSnp-RAD avoids this pitfall as variants are detected by exploring the De Bruijn Graph built from all the read datasets. We tested the implementation on RAD data from 259 specimens of Chiastocheta flies, morphologically assigned to 7 species. All individuals were successfully assigned to their species using both STRUCTURE and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction. Moreover, identified variants succeeded to reveal a within species structuration and the existence of two populations linked to their geographic distributions. Furthermore, our results show that DiscoSnp-RAD is at least one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools. The overall results show that DiscoSnp-RAD is suitable to identify variants from RAD data, and stands out from other tools due to his completely different principle, making it significantly faster, in particular on large datasets.\\n\\nLicenseGNU Affero general public license\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/GATB/DiscoSnp\\n\\nContactjeremy.gauthier@inria.fr",

Here, we studied the impact of structural centrosome aberrations, induced by deregulated expression of Ninein-like protein (NLP), on epithelial spheres grown in Matrigel matrices. We demonstrate that NLP-induced structural centrosome aberrations trigger the escape (budding) of living cells from epithelia. Remarkably, all cells disseminating into the matrix were undergoing mitosis. This invasive behavior reflects a novel mechanism that depends on the acquisition of two distinct properties. First, NLP-induced centrosome aberrations trigger a re-organization of the cytoskeleton, which stabilizes microtubules and weakens E-cadherin junctions during mitosis. Second, atomic force microscopy reveals that cells harboring these centrosome aberrations display increased stiffness. As a consequence, mitotic cells are pushed out of mosaic epithelia, particularly if they lack centrosome aberrations. We conclude that centrosome aberrations can trigger cell dissemination through a novel, non-cell autonomous mechanism, raising the prospect that centrosome aberrations contribute to the dissemination of metastatic cells harboring normal centrosomes.",

Surprisingly, we find that Mto1, a constitutively cytoplasmic protein, docks at nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), via interaction with exportin Crm1 and cytoplasmic FG-nucleoporin Nup146. Although Mto1 is not a nuclear export cargo, it binds Crm1 via a nuclear export signal-like sequence, and docking requires both Ran in the GTP-bound state and Nup146 FG repeats. In addition to determining the mechanism of MTOC formation at the NE, our results reveal a novel role for Crm1 and the nuclear export machinery in the stable docking of a cytoplasmic protein complex at NPCs.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive Entities Underpinning Task EpisodesAccounts of hierarchical cognition suggest that extended task episodes as one task entity and not individually execute their component acts. Such hierarchical execution is frequently thought to occur by first instantiating a sequence representation in working memory that then controls the identity and sequence of component steps. In contrast, we evidence hierarchical execution of extended behavior in situations where the identity and sequence of component steps was unknown and not linked to any sequence representation. Participants executed unpredictable trials wherein, depending on the margin color, they could either choose the smaller value or the font of the two numbers. Crucially, they were biased into construing a recurring instance of three or five trials as one task episode. Behavioral signs of hierarchy, identical to those seen previously with memorized sequence execution, were seen - High trial 1 RT, higher trial 1 RT before longer task episodes, and absence of trial level switch cost specifically across episode boundaries. This showed that hierarchical task sequence representations are not a requisite for hierarchical organization of cognition. Merely construing behavior to be executed as a task episode is enough for the accompanying cognition to be hierarchically organized. Task episodes are executed through the intermediation of episode related programs that are assembled at the beginning and control and organize cognition across time.",

    "abstract": "Figure-ground segregation is fundamental to listening in complex acoustic environments. An ongoing debate pertains to whether segregation requires attention or is  automatic and pre-attentive. In this magnetoencephalography (MEG) study we tested a prediction derived from Load Theory of attention1 that segregation requires attention, but can benefit from the automatic allocation of any  leftover capacity under low load. Complex auditory scenes were modelled with Stochastic Figure Ground stimuli (SFG2) which occasionally contained repeated frequency component  figures. Naive human subjects passively listened to these signals while performing a visual attention task of either low or high load. Whilst clear figure-related neural responses were observed under conditions of low load, high visual load essentially abolished the neural response to the figure in auditory cortex (Planum Temporale, Heschls gyrus). We conclude that fundamental figure-ground segregation in hearing is not automatic but draws on shared resources across vision and audition.",

    "abstract": "Kinetochores are multiprotein machines that drive chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes by maintaining persistent, load-bearing linkages between the chromosomes and the tips of dynamic spindle microtubules. Kinetochores in commonly studied eukaryotes are assembled from widely conserved components like the Ndc80 complex that directly binds microtubules. However, in evolutionarily-divergent kinetoplastid species such as Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness, the kinetochores assemble from a unique set of proteins lacking homology to any known microtubule-binding domains. Here we show that a kinetochore protein from T. brucei called KKT4 binds directly to microtubules, diffuses along the microtubule lattice, and tracks with disassembling microtubule tips. The protein localizes both to kinetochores and to spindle microtubules in vivo, and its depletion causes defects in chromosome segregation. We define a minimal microtubule-binding domain within KKT4 and identify several charged residues important for its microtubule-binding activity. Laser trapping experiments show that KKT4 can maintain load-bearing attachments to both growing and shortening microtubule tips. Thus, despite its lack of similarity to other known microtubule-binding proteins, KKT4 has key functions required for harnessing microtubule dynamics to drive chromosome segregation. We propose that it represents a primary element of the kinetochore-microtubule interface in kinetoplastids.",

Zebrafish xenografts have been widely used to monitor blood cancer cell dissemination and homing due to the optical clarity of embryos and larvae, which allow unrestricted in vivo visualization of migratory events. To broaden the scope of xenotransplantation studies in zebrafish, we have developed a technique that transiently generates hematopoietic tissue chimeras by transplanting murine bone marrow cells into zebrafish blastulae. This procedure leads to mammalian cell integration into the fish developmental hematopoietic program. Monitoring zebrafish chimeras at different time points post fertilization using in vivo time-lapse and confocal imaging showed murine cell co-localization with developing primitive and definitive hematopoietic tissues, intravasation into fish circulation, and dynamic hematopoietic cell-vascular endothelial and hematopoietic cell-niche interactions. Immunohistochemistry assays performed in chimeric animals showed that, after engraftment, murine cells expressed antigens related to i) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, ii) active cell proliferation, and iii) myeloid cell lineages. Lastly, xenografted zebrafish larvae infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae showed murine immune cells trafficking to bacterial foci and interacting with bacterial cells. Overall, these results show that mammalian bone marrow cells xenografted in zebrafish integrate into the host hematopoietic system revealing highly conserved molecular mechanisms of hematopoiesis between zebrafish and mammals. In addition, this procedure introduces a useful and simple method that improves and broadens the scope of hematopoietic tissue xenotransplantation studies in zebrafish.",

We describe the plant arrangement by a superposition of spatial point processes and in this framework we introduce an analytical function which represents the average spatial density of the Sorensen similarity between two infinitesimal plots at distance r. We see that the decay in similarity with the distance is essentially described by the pair correlation function of the superposed process and that it is governed by the most abundant species. We test our analytical model with empirical data obtained for the Barro Colorado Island and Pasoh rainforests. To this end we adopt the statistical estimator for the pair correlation function in [1] and we design a novel one for the Sorensen similarity. Furthermore, we test our analytical formula by modelling the forest study area with Neyman-Scott point processes. We conclude comparing the advantages of our approach with other ones existing in literature.",

However, efficient gene targeting by homologous recombination (HR) to date is only reported for photosynthetic organisms in their haploid life-cycle phase and there are no examples of efficient nuclease-meditated HR in any photosynthetic organism. Here, a CRISPR/Cas construct, assembled using Golden Gate cloning, enabled highly efficient HR for the first time in a diploid photosynthetic organism. HR was induced in T. pseudonana by means of sequence specific CRISPR/Cas, paired with a donor matrix, generating substitution of the silacidin gene by a resistance cassette (FCP:NAT). Approximately 85% of NAT resistant T. pseudonana colonies screened positive for HR using a nested PCR approach and confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products. The knockout of the silacidin gene in T. pseudonana caused a significant increase in cell size, confirming the role of this gene for cell-size regulation in centric diatoms. Highly efficient gene targeting by HR makes T. pseudonana as genetically tractable as Nannochloropsis and Physcomitrella, hence rapidly advancing functional diatom biology, bionanotechnology and any biotechnological application targeted on harnessing the metabolic potential of diatoms.",

    "abstract": "The somasteroids are Ordovician star-shaped animals widely regarded as ancestors of Asterozoa, the group of extant echinoderms that includes brittle stars and starfish. The phylogenetic position of somasteroids makes them critical for understanding the origin and early evolution of crown group Echinodermata. However, the early evolution of asterozoans, the origin of their distinctive body organization and their relationships with other Cambrian and Ordovician echinoderms, such as edrioasteroids, blastozoans, crinoids, and other asterozoans, remain problematic due to the difficulties of comparing the calcitic endoskeleton of these disparate groups. Here we describe the new somasteroid Cantabrigiaster fezouataensis from the Early Ordovician (Tremadocian) Fezouata Lagerstatte in Morocco. Cantabrigiaster shares with other somasteroids the presence of rod-like virgal ossicles that articulate with the ambulacrals, but differs from all other known asterozoans in the absence of adambulacral ossicles defining the arm margins. The unique arm construction evokes parallels with non-asterozoan echinoderms. Developmentally informed Bayesian and parsimony based phylogenetic analyses, which reflect the homology of the biserial ambulacral ossicles in Paleozoic echinoderms according to the Extraxial-Axial Theory, recover Cantabrigiaster as basal within stem group Asterozoa. Our results indicate that Cantabrigiaster is the earliest diverging stem group asterozoan, revealing the ancestral morphology of this major clade and clarifying the affinities of problematic Ordovician taxa. Somasteroids are resolved as a paraphyletic grade within stem and crown group Asterozoa (starfishes), whereas stenuroids are paraphyletic within stem group Ophiuroidea (brittle stars). Cantabrigiaster also illuminates the relationship between Ordovician crown group Echinodermata and its Cambrian stem lineage, which includes sessile forms with incipient radial symmetry such as edrioasteroids and blastozoans. The contentious Pelmatozoa hypothesis (i.e. monophyly of blastozoans and crinoids) is not supported; instead, blastozoans represent the most likely sister-taxon of crown group Echinodermata.\\n\\nAuthor summaryStarfish and brittle stars, collectively known as asterozoans, constitute a diverse and ecologically successful group of echinoderms that first appear in the fossil record some 480Ma. However, the early evolution of asterozoans, the origin of their distinctive body organization, and their phylogenetic relationships with Cambrian echinoderms remain largely unresolved. We describe Cantabrigiaster fezouataensis gen. et sp. nov., a primitive asterozoan from the Fezouata Lagerstatte, Morocco, with a unique endoskeletal arm organization that reveals the ancestral morphology of this major clade. Bayesian and parsimony based phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cantabrigiaster is the earliest diverging stem group asterozoan, and resolve the phylogenetic position of Ordovician asterozoans such as somasteroids. Our analyses clarify the origin of crown group echinoderms relative to their problematic Cambrian stem group representatives.",

    "abstract": "Virus capsid proteins reproducibly self-assemble into regularly-shaped, stable shells that protect the viral genome from external environmental assaults, while maintaining the high internal pressure of the tightly packaged viral genome. To elucidate how capsids maintain stability under harsh conditions, we investigated the capsid components of a hyperthermophilic virus, phage P74-26. We determined the structure of a capsid protein gp87 and show that it has the same fold as trimeric decoration proteins that enhance the structural stability of capsids in many other phage, despite lacking significant sequence homology. We also find that gp87 is significantly more stable than its mesophilic homologs, reflecting the high temperature environment in which phage P74-26 thrives. Our analysis of the gp87 structure reveals that the core domain of the decoration protein is conserved in trimeric capsid components across numerous dsDNA viruses, including human pathogens such as Herpesviruses. Moreover, this core {beta}-barrel domain is found in the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIC1, which suggests a mechanism for the evolution of this broad spectrum Cas9 inhibitor. Our work illustrates the principles for increased stability of a thermophilic decoration protein, and extends the evolutionary reach of the core trimeric decoration protein fold.",

Herein, we provide evidence that mutation of the gene GSH1 diminishes glutathione levels. Moreover, glutathione levels were higher with 0.5% than in 10% glucose in the gsh1{Delta} and WT strains. Interestingly, the chronological life span (CLS) was lowered in the gsh1{Delta} strain cultured with 10% glucose but not under dietary restriction. The gsh1{Delta} strain also showed an inhibition of the mitochondrial respiration in 0.5 and 10% of glucose but only increased the H2O2 levels under dietary restriction. These results correlate well with the GSH/GSSG ratio, which showed a decrease in gsh1{Delta} strain cultured with 0.5% glucose. Altogether these data indicate that glutathione has a major role in the function of electron transport chain (ETC) and is essential to maintain life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 10% glucose.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUpper middle income countries have made substantial progress towards universal health coverage. We investigated whether the coverage extended to diseases that incur catastrophic health spending, the contribution of pooled financing and the factors driving it in Malaysia.\\n\\nMethodsWe adapted the WHO definition of catastrophic health spending to define costly treatment as one that cost, at prevailing market price, more than 10% of the median annual household income in Malaysia. Coverage is defined as the proportion of patients in a year who were in need of a treatment and who received it. Data to estimate coverage and financing were extracted from the published and grey literature, as well as secondary data sources available on disease epidemiology and healthcare in Malaysia.\\n\\nResultsWe found coverage varies from universal for dialysis, cataract surgery, medicines for organ transplant and CML, to practically none for HCV, stroke, psoriasis and epilepsy surgery. Coverage of targeted therapies for solid cancers, knee replacement surgery, anti-TNF for arthritis and coagulation factors for haemophilia were poor while iron chelation for thalassemia, coronary revacularization, epoetin and anti-retrovirals were barely adequate. Coverage correlates negatively (r=-0.82) with health benefits foregone, and is entirely driven by the contribution of pooled financing (r=0.99 p<0.0001). The relative effectiveness of a treatment, its budget impact, media coverage and political influence of the disease area have little influence on financing. Only effectiveness of the leadership representing the therapy area is influential; an increase in one point on the leadership effectiveness scale is associated with 30% increase in the contribution of pooled financing.\\n\\nConclusionCoverage for catastrophically costly treatments is uneven and inequitable in Malaysia, despite most of these are affordable. Decisions on coverage are driven by political-economic consideration.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) are widely used for measuring DNA methylation levels on a genome-wide scale(1). Both methods have limitations: WGBS is expensive and prohibitive for most large-scale projects; RRBS only interrogates 6-12% of the CpGs in the human genome(16,19). Here, we introduce methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme bisulfite sequencing (MREBS) which has the reduced sequencing requirements of RRBS, but significantly expands the coverage of CpG sites in the genome. We built a multiple regression model that combines the two features of MREBS: the bisulfite conversion ratios of single cytosines (as in WGBS and RRBS) as well as the number of reads that cover each locus (as in MRE-seq(12)). This combined approach allowed us to estimate differential methylation across 60% of the genome using read count data alone, and where counts were sufficiently high in both samples (about 1.5% of the genome), our estimates were significantly improved by the single CpG conversion information. We show that differential DNA methylation values based on MREBS data correlate well with those based on WGBS and RRBS. This newly developed technique combines the sequencing cost of RRBS and DNA methylation estimates on a portion of the genome similar to WGBS, making it ideal for large-scale projects of mammalian genomes.",

    "abstract": "Collections of characterized promoters of different strengths are key resources for synthetic biology, but are not well established for many important organisms, including industrially-relevant Clostridium spp. When generating promoters, reporter constructs are used to measure expression, but classical fluorescent reporter proteins are oxygen-dependent and hence inactive in anaerobic bacteria like Clostridium. We directly compared oxygen-independent reporters of different types in Clostridium acetobutylicum and found that glucuronidase (GusA) from E. coli performed best. Using GusA, a library of synthetic promoters was first generated by a typical approach entailing complete randomization of a constitutive thiolase gene promoter (Pthl) except for the consensus -35 and -10 elements. In each synthetic promoter, the chance of each degenerate position matching Pthl was 25%. Surprisingly, none of the synthetic promoters from this library were functional in C. acetobutylicum, even though they functioned as expected in E. coli. Next, instead of complete randomization, we specified lower promoter mutation rates using oligonucleotide primers synthesized using custom mixtures of nucleotides. Using these primers, two promoter libraries were constructed in which the chance of each degenerate position matching Pthl was 79% or 58%, instead of 25% as before. Synthetic promoters from these  stringent libraries functioned well in C. acetobutylicum, covering a wide range of strengths. The promoters functioned similarly in the distantly-related species Clostridium sporogenes, and allowed predictable metabolic engineering of C. acetobutylicum for acetoin production. Besides generating the desired promoters and demonstrating their useful properties, this work indicates an unexpected  stringency of promoter sequences in Clostridium, not reported previously.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/216853_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1000\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@52f2borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5be460org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ee8b05org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e92801_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The preoperative PLR was recorded for all patients. Known VTE risk factors, including age, sex, smoking, BMI, prior VTE, and anticoagulation were also recorded. Risk factors were screened in univariate analysis using Wilcoxons rank sum test and {chi}2 test (Bonferroni corrected). Significant covariates were subsequently included in a multivariate regression model. Bootstrap techniques were used to obtain credible confidence intervals (CI).\\n\\nResultsThere were 306 patients enrolled with 7 cases of VTE (6 DVTs and 1 PE). On univariate analysis, length of stay (p = 0.0026), length of surgery (p = 0.0029), and PLR (p = 0.0002) were founded to have significant associations with VTE. A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed, that yielded an AUROC of 0.905 (95% CI: 0.82 - 0.98).

Mortality hazard rates describe individuals instantaneous ability to survive at different times, whereas survival probabilities are defined for time-intervals of a given length. In this commentary, we argue that it is often more meaningful to model and interpret interval-specific time-averaged mortality hazard rates than survival probabilities, also when using discrete-time models.\\nC_LIO_LIWe discuss three topics where the concept of hazard rates is essential for sound biological inference, but nevertheless often not used: (i) modelling of covariate effects on survival probabilities or mortality hazard rates, (ii) modelling of multiple sources of mortality and competing risks, and (iii) elasticity analyses of population growth rate to demographic parameters. To facilitate estimation of cause-specific mortality hazard rates, we provide amendments to R package  marked.\\nC_LIO_LIBy focusing on modelling mortality hazard rates, one avoids several inherent problems of comparing survival or mortality probabilities. In particular, interpretations about relative differences between mortality hazard rates (measurements on a ratio scale), or effects of relative changes in mortality hazard rates on population growth (elasticities), are more meaningful than similar interpretations involving survival (or mortality) probabilities or odds (measurements on an absolute scale).\\nC_LIO_LIThe concept of hazard rates is essential for understanding ecological and evolutionary processes and we give an intuitive explanation for this, using several examples. We provide some practical guidelines and suggestions for further methods developments.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "O_LIBiodiversity loss not only impairs ecosystem functioning but can also alter the selection for traits in plant communities. At high diversity selection favours traits that allow for greater niche partitioning, whereas at low diversity selection may favour greater defence against pathogens. However, it is unknown whether changes in plant diversity also select for altered interactions with soil organisms.\\nC_LIO_LIWe assessed whether the responses in plant growth and functional traits to their local arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities have been altered by the diversity of the plant communities from which both plants and AMF communities were obtained. We grew plants with AMF communities that originated from either plant monocultures or mixtures in a fully factorial design that included both negative and positive controls, by inoculating no AMF or a foreign AMF respectively.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that AMF from plant mixtures were more beneficial than monoculture AMF for two out of five plant species. Plants from mixtures generally grew better than those from monocultures, but suffered greater damage by leaf pathogens. Although plant growth and phenotypic responses were dependent on the AMF communities with which they associated, we found little evidence for plant growth responses specific to their local AMF communities and results differed between species and traits.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results show that plants from mixtures were selected for increased growth at the expense of reduced defence and vice versa for plants from monocultures, providing evidence for plant diversity-dependent selection on competitive growth vs. defence. Furthermore, our study suggests that effects of a common history between plants and AMF do not follow a general pattern leading to increased or decreased mutualism.\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: Here we provide evidence that biodiversity loss can alter evolutionary trajectories of plant phenotypes and responses to their local AMF communities. However, the selection for altered plant-AMF interactions differ between plant species. To understand how plant communities respond and evolve under a changing environment requires further knowledge about life strategies of plant species and their above-belowground interactions.\\nC_LI",

Here we show a blood transcriptional signature of active tuberculosis using RNA-Seq, confirming microarray results, that discriminates active tuberculosis from latently infected and healthy individuals, validating this signature in an independent cohort. Using an advanced modular approach, we utilise information from the entire transcriptome, which includes over-abundance of type I interferon-inducible genes and under-abundance of IFNG and TBX21, to develop a signature that discriminates active tuberculosis patients from latently infected individuals, or those with acute viral and bacterial infections. We suggest methods targeting gene selection across multiple discriminant modules can improve development of diagnostic biomarkers with improved performance.

    "abstract": "Ethanol is one of the worlds most abused drugs yet the impacts of chronic ethanol consumption are debated. Ethanol is a prevalent component in the diets of diverse animals and can act as a nutritional source, behavior modulator, and a toxin. The source of ethanol is microbes, which can both produce and degrade ethanol, and the gut microbiome has been associated with differential health outcomes in chronic alcoholism. To disentangle the various and potentially interacting roles of bacteria and ethanol on host health, we developed a model for chronic ethanol ingestion in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which naturally consumes a diet between 0 and 5% ethanol. We took advantage of the tractability of the fly microbiome, which can be experimentally removed to separate the direct and indirect effects of commensal microbes. We found that moderate to heavy ethanol ingestion decreased lifespan and reproduction, without causing inebriation. These effects were more pronounced in flies lacking a microbiome, but could not be explained by simple bacterial degradation of ethanol. However, moderate ethanol ingestion increased reproduction in bacterially-colonized flies, relative to bacteria-free flies. Ethanol decreased intestinal stem cell turnover in bacterially-colonized flies and decreased intestinal barrier failure and increased fat content in all flies, regardless of microbiome status. Analysis of host gene expression finds that ethanol triggers the innate immune response, but only in flies colonized with bacteria. Taken together we show that, chronic ethanol ingestion negatively impacts fly health in a microbiome-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) latency establishment is tightly controlled by promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) (or ND10), although their exact implication is still elusive. A hallmark of HSV-1 latency is the interaction between latent viral genomes and PML-NBs, leading to the formation of viral DNA-containing PML-NBs (vDCP-NBs). Using a replication-defective HSV-1-infected human primary fibroblast model reproducing the formation of vDCP-NBs, combined with an immuno-FISH approach developed to detect latent/quiescent HSV-1, we show that vDCP-NBs contain both histone H3.3 and its chaperone complexes, i.e., DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complex (HIRA, UBN1, CABIN1, and ASF1a). HIRA also co-localizes with vDCP-NBs present in trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons from HSV-1-infected wild type mice. ChIP-qPCR performed on fibroblasts stably expressing tagged H3.3 (e-H3.3) or H3.1 (e-H3.1) show that latent/quiescent viral genomes are chromatinized almost exclusively with e-H3.3, consistent with an interaction of the H3.3 chaperones with multiple viral loci. Depletion by shRNA of single proteins from the H3.3 chaperone complexes only mildly affects H3.3 deposition on the latent viral genome, suggesting a compensation mechanism. In contrast, depletion (by shRNA) or absence of PML (in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) pml-/- cells) significantly impacts the chromatinization of the latent/quiescent viral genomes with H3.3 without any overall replacement with H3.1. Consequently, the study demonstrates a specific epigenetic regulation of latent/quiescent HSV-1 through an H3.3-dependent HSV-1 chromatinization involving the two H3.3 chaperones DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complexes. Additionally, the study reveals that PML-NBs are major actors in latent/quiescent HSV-1 H3.3 chromatinization through a PML-NB/histone H3.3/H3.3 chaperone axis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAn understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to the persistence of a virus in its host is essential to be able to control viral reactivation and its associated diseases. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen that remains latent in the PNS and CNS of the infected host. However, the latency is unstable, and frequent reactivations of the virus are responsible for PNS and CNS pathologies. It is thus crucial to understand the physiological, immunological and molecular levels of interplay between latent HSV-1 and the host. Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) play a major role in controlling viral infections by preventing the onset of lytic infection. In previous studies, we showed a major role of PML-NBs in favoring the establishment of a latent state for HSV-1. A hallmark of HSV-1 latency establishment is the formation of PML-NBs containing the viral genome, which we called \\\"viral DNA-containing PML-NBs\\\" (vDCP-NBs). The genome entrapped in the vDCP-NBs is transcriptionally silenced. This naturally occurring latent/quiescent state could, however, be transcriptionally reactivated. Therefore, understanding the role of PML-NBs in controlling the establishment of HSV-1 latency and its reactivation is essential to design new therapeutic approaches based on the prevention of viral reactivation.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a recently discovered signaling molecule important for the survival of Firmicutes, a large bacterial group that includes notable pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. However, the exact role of this molecule has not been identified. dacA, the S. aureus gene encoding the diadenylate cyclase enzyme required for c-di-AMP production, cannot be deleted when bacterial cells are grown in rich medium, indicating that c-di-AMP is required for growth in this condition. Here, we report that an S. aureus dacA mutant can be generated in chemically defined medium. Consistent with previous findings, this mutant had a severe growth defect when cultured in rich medium. Using this growth defect in rich medium, we selected for suppressor strains with improved growth to identify c-di-AMP-requiring pathways. Mutations bypassing the essentiality of dacA were identified in alsT and opuD, encoding a predicted amino acid and osmolyte transporter, the latter of which we show here to be the main glycine betaine-uptake system in S. aureus. Inactivation of these transporters likely prevents the excessive osmolyte and amino acid accumulation in the cell, providing further evidence for a key role of c-di-AMP in osmotic regulation. Suppressor mutations were also obtained in hepS, hemB, ctaA and qoxB, coding for proteins required for respiration. Furthermore, we show that dacA is dispensable for growth in anaerobic conditions. Together, these finding reveal an essential role for the c-di-AMP signaling network in aerobic, but not anaerobic, respiration in S. aureus.",

    "abstract": "Koala retrovirus (KoRV) is unique amongst endogenous (inherited) retroviruses in that its incorporation to the host genome is still active, providing an opportunity to study what drives this fundamental process in vertebrate genome evolution. Animals in the southern part of the natural range of koalas were previously thought to be either virus free or to have only exogenous variants of KoRV with low rates of KoRV induced disease. In contrast, animals in the northern part of their range universally have both endogenous and exogenous KoRV with very high rates of KoRV induced disease such as lymphoma. This paper uses a combination of sequencing technologies, Illumina RNA sequencing of \"southern\" (south Australian) and \"northern\" (SE QLD) koalas and CRISPR enrichment and nanopore sequencing of DNA of \"southern\" (South Australian and Victorian animals) to retrieve full length loci and intregration sites of KoRV variants. We demonstrate that koalas that tested negative to the KoRV pol gene qPCR, used to detect replication competent KoRV, are not in fact KoRV free but harbour defective, presumably endogenous, \"RecKoRV\" variants that are not fixed between animals. This indicates that these populations have historically been exposed to KoRV and raises questions as to whether these variants have arisen by chance or whether they provide a protective effect from the infectious forms of KoRV. This latter explanation would offer the intriguing prospect of being able to monitor and selectively breed for disease resistance to protect the wild koala population from KoRV induced disease.",

    "abstract": "R-loops, which result from the formation of stable DNA:RNA hybrids, can both threaten genome integrity and act as physiological regulators of gene expression and chromatin patterning. To characterize R-loops in fission yeast, we used the S9.6 antibody-based DRIPc-seq method to sequence the RNA strand of R-loops and obtain strand-specific R-loop maps at near nucleotide resolution. Surprisingly, preliminary DRIPc-seq experiments identified mostly RNase H-resistant but exosome-sensitive RNAs that mapped to both DNA strands and resembled RNA:RNA hybrids (dsRNAs), suggesting that dsRNAs form widely in fission yeast. We confirmed in vitro that S9.6 can immuno-precipitate dsRNAs and provide evidence that dsRNAs can interfere with its binding to R-loops. dsRNA elimination by RNase III treatment prior to DRIPc-seq allowed the genome-wide and strand-specific identification of genuine R-loops that responded in vivo to RNase H levels and displayed classical features associated with R-loop formation. We also found that most transcripts whose levels were altered by in vivo manipulation of RNase H levels did not form detectable R-loops, suggesting that prolonged manipulation of R-loop levels could indirectly alter the transcriptome. We discuss the implications of our work in the design of experimental strategies to probe R-loop functions.",

In a recent article, Rosenberg et al. (Nat Neurosci, 19, 165-171, 2016) argue that whole-brain functional network strength is a broadly applicable neuromarker of sustained attention. They claim that this marker accurately predicts performance from task related as well as resting state activity. Here, we discuss the applicability and generalizability in the context of three methodological concerns: Simulations show that the statistical methods for the 1) initial validation analyses as well as 2) internal validation using leave-one-out cross validation, are biased towards significance; 3) simple and complex models are compared suboptimally. Overall, we find that the article of Rosenberg et al. provides sufficient proof that network strength is associated with attentional capacity that it is not possible to say to which extent, and for this reason we argue that it cannot be concluded that the network is a broadly applicable neuromarker.",

To do so, we first replicate the results of the recently proposed temporal interference (TI) stimulation (which was only tested in-vivo) in a computational model based on a Hodgkin-Huxley model for neurons and a model of current dispersion in the head. Using this computational model, we obtain a nontrivial extension of the 2-electrode-pair TI proposed originally to multielectrode TI (> 2 electrode pairs) that yields significantly higher spatial precision. To further improve precision, we develop STIMULUS techniques for generating spatial interference patterns in conjunction with temporal interference, and demonstrate strict and significant improvements over multielectrode TI. Finally, we utilize the adaptivity that is inherent in STIMULUS to create multisite neurostimulation patterns that can be dynamically steered over time.",

    "abstract": "The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.",

The presynaptic neural networks converging on these neurons and their role in tuning them remains poorly understood. We took advantage of well-known characteristics of one such neuron to investigate the properties of its presynaptic input network. We find a structure more complex than hitherto realized. In addition to dynamic lateral inhibition used to filter out background motion, presynaptic circuits include normalizing inhibition and short-range lateral excitatory interactions mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These interactions preferentially boost responses to coherently expanding visual stimuli generated by colliding objects, as opposed to spatially incoherent controls, helping implement object segmentation. Hence, in addition to active dendritic conductances within collision detecting neurons, multiple layers of both inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic connections are needed to finely tune neural circuits for collision detection.",

Earlier, using those mice, we discovered model mechanisms that enabled achieving quantitative validation targets while also providing plausible causal explanations for temporal characteristics of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. We isolated virtual hepatocytes, created a virtual culture, and then conducted dose-response experiments in both culture and mice. We expected the two dose-response curves to be displaced. We were surprised that they crossed because it evidenced that simulated acetaminophen metabolism and toxicity are different for virtual culture and mouse contexts even though individual hepatocyte mechanisms were unchanged. Crossing dose-response curves is a virtual example of an in vivo-to-in vitro disconnect. We use detailed results of experiments to explain the disconnect. Individual hepatocytes contribute differently to system level phenomena. In liver, hepatocytes are exposed to acetaminophen sequentially. Relative production of the reactive acetaminophen metabolite is largest (smallest) in pericentral (periportal) hepatocytes. Because that sequential exposure is absent in culture, hepatocytes from different lobular locations do not respond the same. A virtual Culture-to-Mouse translation can stand as a scientifically challengeable theory explaining an in vitro-in vivo disconnect. It provides a framework to develop more reliable interpretations of in vitro observations, which then may be used to improve extrapolations.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translational barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to provide plausible biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models - Callus Analogs - were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing a new way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80x80 {micro}m region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog - a theory - of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve [&ge;] 70% Similarity. We used an iterative protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73-90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2-4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83-94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a new medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTranslational barriers have limited the generation of mechanism-based explanations of fracture healing processes. Those barriers help explain why, to date, biological therapeutics have had only a minor impact on fracture management. New approaches are needed, and we present one that is intended to overcome those barriers incrementally. We created virtual Callus Analogs to simulate how the histologic appearance of a mouse fracture callus may transition from day-7 to day-10. Callus Analogs use software-based model mechanisms. Simulation experiments enable challenging and improving those model mechanisms. During execution, model mechanism operation provides a coarse-grain explanation (a theory) of a four-day portion of the healing process. Simulated day-10 callus histologic images achieved 73-94% similarity to a corresponding day-10 fracture callus image, thus demonstrating feasibility. Simulated healing provides a new perspective on the actual healing process and a new way of thinking about plausible fracture-healing processes. Our working hypothesis is that the approach can be extended to cover more of the healing process while making features of simulated and actual fracture healing increasingly analogous. The methods presented are intended to be extensible to other research areas that use histologic analysis to investigate and explain tissue level phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Protected areas are the primary management tool for conserving ecosystems, yet their intended outcomes may often be compromised by poaching. Consequently, many protected areas are ineffective  paper parks that contribute little towards conserving ecosystems. Poaching can be prevented through enforcement and engaging with community members so they support protected areas. It is not clear how much needs to be spent on enforcement and engagement to ensure they are frequent enough to be effective at conserving biodiversity. We develop models of enforcement against illegal fishing in marine protected areas. We apply the models to data on fishing rates and fish biomass from a marine protected area in Raja Ampat, Indonesia and explore how frequent enforcement patrols need to be to achieve targets for coral reef fish biomass. Achieving pristine levels of reef fish biomass required almost year-round enforcement of the protected area. Surveillance of the protected area may also be enhanced if local fishers who support the reserve report on poaching. The opportunity for local fishing boats to participate in surveillance was too small for it to have much benefit for total reef fish biomass, which increases slowly. However, specific functional groups of fish have much higher population growth rates and their biomass was predicted to increase markedly with community surveillance. We conclude that budgets for park management must balance the cost of conducting frequent patrols against supporting alternative activities, like education to build community support. Optimized budgets will be much more likely to achieve ecological targets for recovering fish biomasses and will contribute to fiscal sustainability of protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Bivariate morphological scaling relationships describe how the size of two traits co-varies among adults in a population. In as much as body shape is reflected by the relative size of various traits within the body, morphological scaling relationships capture how body shape varies with size, and therefore have been used widely as descriptors of morphological variation within and among species. Despite their extensive use, there is continuing discussion over which line-fitting method should be used to describe linear morphological scaling relationships. Here I argue that the  best line-fitting method is the one that most accurately captures the proximate developmental mechanisms that generate scaling relationships. Using mathematical modeling, I show that the  best line-fitting method depends on the pattern of variation among individuals in the developmental mechanisms that regulate trait size, and the morphological variation this pattern of developmental variation produces. For Drosophila traits, this pattern of variation indicates that major axis regression is the best line-fitting method. For morphological traits in other animals, however, other line-fitting methods may be more accurate. I provide a simple web-based application for researchers to explore how different line-fitting methods perform on their own morphological data.",

    "abstract": "Over half of the human genome is comprised of transposable elements (TE). TE have been implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Despite large-scale studies of the transcriptome in cancer, a comprehensive look at TE expression investigating its relationship to various mutations and its role in predicting prognosis has not been performed. We characterized TE expression in 178 adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients using transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified significant dysregulation of TE, with distinct patterns of TE expression correlated to specific mutations and distinct coding gene networks. TP53 mutated AML had a unique TE expression signature and was associated with significantly suppressed expression of TE and various classes of non-coding RNA. We identified 17 candidate prognostic TE transcripts that can classify AML subtypes as either high or low risk. These 17 TE were able to further sub-stratify low risk AML (based on mutational profile and coding gene expression) into favorable and unfavorable prognostic categories. The expression signature of the 17 TE was able to predict prognosis in an independent cohort of 284 pediatric AML patients, and was also able to predict time to relapse in an independent dataset of relapsed adult cases. This first comprehensive study of TE expression in AML demonstrates that TE expression can be used as a biomarker for predicting prognosis in AML and also provides novel insights into the biology of TP53 mutated AML. Studies characterizing its role in other cancers are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin domains play important roles in chromosome biology, organismal development and aging. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and metazoans, heterochromatin is marked by histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation. While factors required for heterochromatin have been identified, the dynamics of heterochromatin formation are poorly understood. Telomeres convert adjacent chromatin into heterochromatin. To form a new heterochromatic region in S. pombe, an inducible DNA double-strand break (DSB) was engineered next to 48 bp of telomere repeats in euchromatin, which caused formation of new telomere and gradual spreading of heterochromatin. However, spreading was highly dynamic even after the telomere had reached its stable length. The system also revealed the presence of repeats located at the boundaries of euchromatin and heterochromatin that are oriented to allow the efficient healing of a euchromatic DSB to cap the chromosome end with a new telomere. Telomere formation in S. pombe therefore reveals novel aspects of heterochromatin dynamics and the presence of failsafe mechanisms to repair subtelomeric breaks, with implications for similar processes in metazoan genomes.",
