    "abstract": "Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an important tool used by cell biologists to study the diffusion and binding kinetics of vesicles, proteins, and other molecules in the cytoplasm, nucleus or cell membrane. While many FRAP models have been developed over the past decades, the influence of the complex boundaries of three-dimensional cellular geometries on the recovery curves, in conjunction with ROI and optical effects (imaging, photobleaching, photoswitching, and scanning), has not been well studied. Here, we developed a three-dimensional computational model of the FRAP process that incorporates particle diffusion, cell boundary effects, and the optical properties of the scanning confocal microscope, and validated this model using the tip-growing cells of Physcomitrella patens. We then show how these cell boundary and optical effects confound the interpretation of FRAP recovery curves, including the number of dynamic states of a given fluorescent protein, in a wide range of cellular geometries-both in two and three dimensions-namely nuclei, filopodia, and lamellipodia of mammalian cells, and in cell types such as the budding yeast, S. pombe, and tip-growing plant cells. We explored the performance of existing analytical and algorithmic FRAP models in these various cellular geometries, and determined that the VCell VirtualFRAP tool provides the best accuracy to measure diffusion coefficients. Our computational model is not limited only to these cells types, but can easily be extended to other cellular geometries via the graphical Java-based application we also provide. This particle-based simulation-called the Digital Confocal Microscopy Suite, DCMS-can also perform fluorescence dynamics assays, such as Number and Brightness (N&B), Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS), and could help shape the way these techniques are interpreted.",

    "abstract": "If improvements are to be made in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, an increased understanding of disease in the lung is needed. Studies have shown that bacteria in a less metabolically active state, associated with the presence of lipid bodies, are less susceptible to antibiotics, and recent results have highlighted the disparity in concentration of different compounds into lesions. Treatment success therefore depends critically on the responses of the individual bacteria that constitute the infection.\\n\\nWe propose a hybrid, individual-based approach that analyses spatio-temporal dynamics at the cellular level, linking the behaviour of individual bacteria and host cells with the macroscopic behaviour of the microenvironment. The individual elements (bacteria, macrophages and T cells) are modelled using cellular automaton (CA) rules, and the evolution of oxygen, drugs and chemokine dynamics are incorporated in order to study the effects of the microenvironment in the pathological lesion. We allow bacteria to switch states depending on oxygen concentration, which affects how they respond to treatment. This is the first multiscale model of its type to consider both oxygen-driven phenotypic switching of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis and antibiotic treatment. Using this model, we investigate the role of bacterial cell state and of initial bacterial location on treatment outcome. We demonstrate that when bacteria are located further away from blood vessels, less favourable outcomes are more likely, i.e. longer time before infection is contained/cleared, treatment failure or later relapse. We also show that in cases where bacteria remain at the end of simulations, the organisms tend to be slower-growing and are often located within granulomas, surrounded by caseous material.",

    "abstract": "Spatially-explicit approaches are widely recommended for ecosystem management. The quality of the data, such as presence/absence or habitat maps, affects the management actions recommended, and is, therefore, key to management success. However, available data are often biased and incomplete. Previous studies have advanced ways to resolve data bias and missing data, but questions remain about how we design ecological surveys to develop a dataset through field surveys. Ecological surveys may have multiple spatial scales, including the spatial extent of the target ecosystem (observation window), the resolution for mapping individual distributions (mapping unit), and the survey area within each mapping unit (sampling unit). We developed an ecological survey method for mapping individual distributions by applying spatially-explicit stochastic models. We used spatial point processes to describe individual spatial placements using either random or clustering processes. We then designed ecological surveys with different spatial scales and individual detectability. We found that the choice of mapping unit affected the presence mapped fraction, and the fraction of the total individuals covered by the presence mapped patches. Tradeoffs were found between these quantities and the map resolution, associated with equivalent asymptotic behaviors for both metrics at sufficiently small and large mapping unit scales. Our approach enabled consideration of the effect of multiple spatial scales in surveys, and estimation of the survey outcomes such as the presence mapped fraction and the number of individuals situated in the presence detected units. The developed theory may facilitate management decision-making and inform the design of monitoring and data gathering.",

    "abstract": "Assessing diet variability is of main importance to better understand the biology of bats and design conservation strategies. Although the advent of metabarcoding has facilitated such analyses, this approach does not come without challenges. Biases may occur throughout the whole experiment, from fieldwork to biostatistics, resulting in the detection of false negatives, false positives or low taxonomic resolution. We detail a rigorous metabarcoding approach based on a short COI minibarcode and two-step PCR protocol enabling the  all at once taxonomic identification of bats and their arthropod preys for several hundreds of samples. Our study includes faecal pellets collected in France from 357 bats representing 16 species, as well as insect mock communities that mimic bat meals of known composition, negative and positive controls. All samples were analysed using three replicates. We compare the efficiency of DNA extraction methods and we evaluate the effectiveness of our protocol using identification success, taxonomic resolution, sensitivity, and amplification biases. Our parallel identification strategy of predators and preys reduces the risk of mis-assigning preys to wrong predators and decreases the number of molecular steps. Controls and replicates enable to filter the data and limit the risk of false positives, hence guaranteeing high confidence results for both prey occurrence and bat species identification. We validate 551 COI variants from arthropod including 18 orders, 117 family, 282 genus and 290 species. Our method therefore provides a rapid, resolutive and cost-effective screening tool for addressing evolutionary ecological issues or developing  chirosurveillance and conservation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Many cortical neurons combine the information ascending and descending the cortical hierarchy. In the classical view, this information is combined nonlinearly to give rise to a single firing rate output, which collapses all input streams into one. We propose that neurons can simultaneously represent multiple input streams by using a novel code that distinguishes single spikes and bursts at the level of a neural ensemble. Using computational simulations constrained by experimental data, we show that cortical neurons are well suited to generate such multiplexing. Interestingly, this neural code maximizes information for short and sparse bursts, a regime consistent with in vivo recordings. It also suggests specific connectivity patterns that allows to demultiplex this information. These connectivity patterns can be used by the nervous system to maintain optimal multiplexing. Contrary to firing rate coding, our findings indicate that a single neural ensemble can communicate multiple independent signals to different targets.",

Particularly, it remains unknown whether separate RSFC patterns temporally fluctuate in a random manner, or transit in specific orders. Here we investigated temporal transitions between characteristic RSFC patterns in awake rats and humans. We found that transitions between RSFC patterns were reproducible and significantly above chance, suggesting that RSFC pattern transitions were nonrandom. The organization of RSFC pattern transitions in rats was analyzed using graph theory. Pivotal RSFC patterns in transitions were identified including hippocampal, thalamic and striatal networks. This study has revealed nonrandom temporal relationship between characteristic RSFC patterns in both rats and humans. It offers new insights into understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous activity in the mammalian brain.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes exhibit widespread mono-allelic expression of autosomal genes. However, the mechanistic insight that allows specific expression of one allele remains enigmatic. Here, we present evidence that the linear and the three dimensional architectures of the genome ascribe the appropriate framework that guides the mono-allelic expression of genes. We show that: 1) mono-allelically expressed genes are assorted into genomic domains that are insulated from domains of bi-allelically expressed genes through CTCF mediated chromatin loops; 2) evolutionary and cell-type specific gain and loss of mono-allelic expression coincide respectively with the gain and loss of chromatin insulator sites; 3) dosage of mono- allelically expressed genes is more sensitive to loss of chromatin insulationn associated with CTCF depletion as compared to bi-allelically expressed genes; 4) distinct susceptibility of mono- and bi-allelically expressed genes to CTCF depletion can be attributed to distinct functional roles of CTCF around these genes. Altogether, our observations highlight a general topological framework for the mono-allelic expression of genes, wherein the alleles are insulated from the spatial interference of chromatin and transcriptional states from neighbouring bi-allelic domains via CTCF mediated chromatin loops. The study also suggests that the three-dimensional genome organization might have evolved under the constraint to mitigate the fluctuations in the dosage of mono-allelically expressed genes, which otherwise are dosage sensitive.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSWI/SNF is a large heterogenous multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complex. It consists of multiple sets of mutually exclusive components. Understanding how loss of one sibling of a mutually exclusive pair affects the occupancy and function of the remaining complex is needed to understand how mutations in a particular subunit might affect tumor formation. Recently, we showed that the members of the ARID family of SWI/SNF subunits (ARID1A, ARID1B, and ARID2) had complex transcriptional relationships including both antagonism and cooperativity. However, it remains unknown how loss of the catalytic subunit(s) affects the binding and genome-wide occupancy of the remainder complex and how changes in occupancy affect transcriptional output.\\n\\nResultsWe addressed this gap by depleting BRG1 and BRM, the two ATPase subunits in SWI/SNF, and characterizing the changes to chromatin occupancy of the remaining subunit and related this to transcription changes induced by loss of the ATPase subunits. We show that depletion of one subunit frequently leads to loss of the remaining subunit. This could cause either positive or negative changes in gene expression. At a subset of sites the sibling subunit is either retained or gained. Additionally, we show genome-wide that BRG1 and BRM have both cooperative and antagonistic interactions with respect to transcription. Importantly, at genes where BRG1 and BRM antagonise one another we observe a nearly complete rescue of gene expression changes in the combined BRG/BRM double knockdown.\\n\\nConclusionThis series of experiments demonstrate that mutually exclusive SWI/SNF complexes have heterogenous functional relationships and highlights the importance of considering the role of the remaining SWI/SNF complexes following loss or depletion of a single subunit.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal damage results in profound retrograde, but no anterograde amnesia in contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Although the content learned in the latter have been discussed, the compensating regions were seldom proposed and never empirically addressed. Here, we employed network analysis of pCREB expression quantified from brain slices of rats with dorsal hippocampal lesion (dHPC) after undergoing CFC session. Using inter-regional correlations of pCREB-positive nuclei between brain regions, we modelled functional networks using different thresholds. The dHPC network showed small-world topology, equivalent to SHAM (control) network. However, diverging hubs were identified in each network. In a direct comparison, hubs in both networks showed consistently higher centrality values compared to the other network. Further, the distribution of correlation coefficients was different between the groups, with most significantly stronger correlation coefficients belonging to the SHAM network. These results suggest that dHPC network engaged in CFC learning is partially different, and engage alternative hubs. We next tested if pre-training lesions of dHPC and one of the new dHPC network hubs (perirhinal, Per; or disgranular retrosplenial, RSC, cortices) would impair CFC. Only dHPC-RSC, but not dHPC-Per, impaired CFC. Interestingly, only RSC showed a consistently higher centrality in the dHPC network, suggesting that the increased centrality reflects an increased functional dependence on RSC. Our results provide evidence that, without hippocampus, the RSC, an anatomically central region in the medial temporal lobe memory system might support CFC learning and memory.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWhen determined cognitive performances are not affected by brain lesions of regions generally involved in that performance, the interpretation is that the remaining regions can compensate the damaged one. In contextual fear conditioning, a memory model largely used in laboratory rodents, hippocampal lesions produce amnesia for events occurred before, but not after the lesion, although the hippocampus is known to be important for new learning. Addressing compensation in animal models has always been challenging as it requires large-scale brain mapping. Here, we quantified 30 brain regions and used mathematical tools to model how a brain network can compensate hippocampal loss and learn contextual fear. We described that the damaged network preserved general interactivity characteristics, although different brain regions were identified as highly important for the network (e.g. highly connected). Further, we empirically validated our network model by performing double lesions of the hippocampus and the alternative hubs observed in the network models. We verified that double lesion of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex, one of the hubs, impaired contextual fear learning. We provide evidence that without hippocampus, the remaining network relies on alternative important regions from the memory system to coordinate contextual fear learning.",

In order to understand the cross-talk between plasma proteins and the brain, we knocked down circulating C1 inhibitor (C1INH) in wild-type (WT) mice using antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO) technique and examined the brain. C1INH is a plasma protein inhibitor of vascular inflammation induced by activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and the complement system. This knockdown induced the activation of the KKS but spared the activation of the classical complement system. Activation of the KKS induced an upregulation of the bradykinin pathway in the periphery and the brain, resulting in hypotension. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, plasma protein extravasations, activated glial cells and elevated levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and iNOS were detected in brains of C1INH ASO treated mice. Infiltrating innate immune cells were evident, entering the brain through the lateral ventricle walls and the neurovascular units. The mice showed normal motor functions, however, cognition was impaired. Altogether, our results highlight the important role of regulated plasma-C1INH as a gatekeeper of the neurovascular system.

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins facilitate chromatin-mediated gene repression through the modification of histone tails in a wide range of eukaryotes, including plants and animals. One of the PcG protein complexes, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), promotes repressive chromatin formation via tri-methylation of lysine-27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). The animal PRC2 is implicated in impacting subnuclear distribution of chromatin as its complex components and H3K27me3 are functionally connected with the nuclear lamina (NL) - a peripheral protein mesh that resides underneath the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and consists of lamins and lamina-associated proteins. In contrast to animals, NL in plants has an atypical structure and its association with PRC2-mediated gene repression is largely unknown. Here, we present a connection between lamin-like protein, CROWDED NUCLEI 1 (CRWN1), and a novel PRC2-associated component, PWWP INTERACTOR OF POLYCOMBS 1 (PWO1), in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that PWO1 and CRWN1 proteins associate physically with each other, act in the same pathway to maintain nuclear morphology and control expression of similar set of target genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that PWO1 proteins form speckle-like foci located partially at the subnuclear periphery in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. Ultimately, as CRWN1 and PWO1 are plant-specific, our results argue that plants developed an equivalent, rather than homologous, mechanism of linking PRC2-mediated chromatin repression and nuclear lamina.",

    "abstract": "The interstitial and perivascular spaces of the mammalian heart contain a highly interactive tissue community essential for cardiac homeostasis, repair and regeneration. Mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts) are one of the most abundant cell types, playing key roles as sentinels, tissue architects, paracrine signaling hubs and lineage precursors, and are linked to heart disease through their roles in inflammation and fibrosis. Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are secreted by several cell types involved in cardiac injury and repair, and are recognized mitogens for cardiac fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells. However, their roles are complex and investigations of their impact on heart repair have produced contrasting outcomes, leaving therapeutic potential uncertain. Here, we use new approaches and tools, including single cell RNA sequencing, to explore cardiac fibroblast heterogeneity and how PDGF receptor  (PDGFR) signaling impacts fibroblasts during heart repair. Short-term systemic delivery of PDGF-AB to mice from the time of myocardial infarction (MI) led to enhanced anatomical and functional recovery. Underpinning these benefits was a priming effect, in which PDGF-AB accelerated exit of fibroblasts from quiescence and induced a higher translational biosynthetic capacity in both fibroblasts and macrophages without triggering fibrosis. Our study highlights the significant biosynthetic heterogeneity and plasticity in cardiac fibroblast populations, and suggests a rationale for a novel therapeutic approach to cardiac injury involving controlled stimulation of fibroblast activation.",

Here, we have used existing transcriptome datasets to carry out a comprehensive screen for protein-coding genes preferentially expressed in progenitors of fetal human neocortex. In addition to the previously studied gene ARHGAP11B, we show that ten known and two newly identified human-specific genes exhibit such expression, however with distinct neural progenitor cell-type specificity compared to their ancestral paralogs. Furthermore, we identify 41 additional human genes with progenitor-enriched expression which have orthologs only in primates. Our study not only provides a resource of genes that are candidates to exert specific, and novel, roles in neocortical development, but also reveals that distinct mechanisms gave rise to these genes during primate, and notably human, evolution.",

This framework, however, relies on the assumption that pathogen populations are very large and that one can neglect the effects of demographic stochasticity. Here we expand the theory of life history evolution to account for the effects of finite population size on the evolution of pathogen virulence. We show that demographic stochasticity introduces additional evolutionary forces that can qualitatively affect the dynamics and the evolutionary outcome. We discuss the importance of the shape of pathogen fitness landscape and host heterogeneity on the balance between mutation, selection and genetic drift. In particular, we discuss scenarios where finite population size can dramatically affect classical predictions of deterministic models. This analysis reconciles Adaptive Dynamics with population genetics in finite populations and thus provides a new theoretical toolbox to study life-history evolution in realistic ecological scenarios.",

Specifically, higher motor centers and central pattern generators (CPGs) induce rhythmic leg movements that act in concert in the control of locomotion. Here we explored the relations between the subesophageal ganglion (SEG) and thoracic leg CPGs in the desert locust. Backfill staining revealed about 300 SEG descending interneurons (DINs) and some overlap with the arborization of DINs and leg motor neurons. In accordance, in in-vitro preparations, electrical stimulation applied to the SEG excited these neurons, and in some cases also induced CPGs activity. Additionally, we found that the SEG regulates the coupling pattern among the CPGs: when the CPGs were activated pharmacologically, inputs from the SEG were able to synchronize contralateral CPGs. This motor output was correlated to the firing of SEG descending and local interneurons. Altogether, these findings point to a role of the SEG in both activating leg CPGs and in coordinating their oscillations, and suggest parallels between the SEG and the brainstem of vertebrates.",

In plants, it is largely unclear how PcG proteins are recruited to their target genes.\\n\\nHere, we identified the PWWP-DOMAIN INTERACTOR OF POLYCOMBS1 (PWO1) protein which interacts with all three Arabidopsis PRC2 histone methyltransferases and is required for keeping full H3 occupancy at several Arabidopsis genes. PWO1 localizes and recruits CLF to nuclear speckles in tobacco nuclei, suggesting a role in spatial organization of PcG regulation. PWO1 belongs to a gene family with three members acting redundantly: pwo1 pwo2 pwo3 triple mutants are seedling lethal and show shoot and root meristem arrest, while pwo1 single mutants are early flowering. Interestingly, PWO1s PWWP domain confers binding to histones, which is reduced by a point mutation in a highly conserved residue of this domain and blocked by phosphorylation of H3S28. PWO1 carrying this mutation is not able to fully complement the pwo1 pwo2 pwo3 triple mutant, indicating the requirement of this domain for PWO1 in vivo activity. Thus, the PWO family may present a novel class of histone readers which are involved in recruiting PcG proteins to subnuclear domains and in promoting Arabidopsis development.",

Different disinfection methods are therefore employed in food processing industry; such as use of ultraviolet light or usage of surfaces with copper-containing alloys. However, all the disinfection methods currently in use have some shortcomings. Here we show that copper doped TiO2 nanotubes deposited on existing surfaces and illuminated with ceiling mounted fluorescent lights or additional low power light emitting diodes can be employed for an economical and permanent disinfection of surfaces.\\n\\nWe deposited the nanotubes on various surfaces: polyethylene terephatlate, polystyrene, and aluminum oxide, where they could withstand repeated washings with neutral, alkaline or acidic medium. Here we show that the polymer surfaces coated with the nanotubes and innoculated with 107 bacteria, illuminated with ceiling mounted fluorescent lights retard the growth of Listeria Innocua by up to 99% in seven hours of exposure to the fluorescent lights, compared to a control surface. The disinfection properties of the surfaces depend mainly on the temperature difference of the surface and the dew point, where for maximum effectiveness of the photocatalytic effect the difference should be at least 2.5 degrees celsius.\\n\\nUsage of one dimensional nanomaterials, such as TiO2 nanotubes, offers a promising low cost alternative to current disinfection methods, since illumination of surfaces with common fluorescent lights is sufficient to photo-excite the nanotubes, which sequentially produce microbicidal hydroxyl radicals. Future use of such surfaces with antibacterial nano-coating and resulting sterilizing effect holds promise for such materials to be used in different environments or in better control of critical control points in food production as well as an improved biosecurity during the food manufacturing process.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine for cancer involves identifying and targeting the somatic genome alterations (SGAs) that drive the development of an individual tumor. Much of current efforts at finding driver SGAs have involved identifying the genes that are mutated more frequently than expected among a collection of tumors. When these population-derived driver genes are altered (perhaps in particular ways) in a given tumor, they are posited as driver genes for that tumor. In this technical report, we introduce an alternative approach for identifying causative SGAs, also known as \\\"drivers\\\", by inferring causal relationships between SGAs and molecular phenotypes at the individual tumor level. Our tumor-specific causal inference (TCI) algorithm uses a Bayesian method to identify the SGAs in a given tumor that have a high probability of regulating transcriptomic changes observed in that specific tumor. Thus, the method is focused on identifying the tumor specific SGAs that are causing expression changes that are specific to the tumor. Those SGAs that have a high probability of regulating transcriptomic changes related to oncogenic processes are then designated to be the putative drivers of the tumor. In this paper, we describe in detail the TCI algorithm and its implementation.",

Regulatory T cells (Tregs), that prevent autoimmunity, require Interleukin-2 (IL-2) for maintenance of immunosuppressive functions and, alterations in the IL-2 pathway predispose to T1D. Using an adaptive trial design we aimed to determine the optimal regimen of aldesleukin (recombinant human IL-2) to physiologically enhance Tregs while limiting expansion of autoreactive Teffs.\\n\\nMethodsDILfrequency is a single-center, non-randomised, open-label, response-adaptive study of participants aged 18 to 70 years with T1D. The initial learning phase allocated 12 participants to six different predefined dose-frequency regimens.

However, many of these systems demonstrate low specificity or sensitivity, which limits their clinical utility. We evaluate the effects of a machine learning algodiagnostic (MLA) sepsis prediction and detection system using a before-and-after clinical study performed at Cabell Huntington Hospital (CHH) in Huntington, West Virginia. Prior to this study, CHH utilized the St. Johns Sepsis Agent (SJSA) as a rules-based sepsis detection system.\\n\\nMethodsThe Predictive algoRithm for EValuation and Intervention in SEpsis (PREVISE) study was carried out between July 1, 2017 and August 30, 2017. All patients over the age of 18 who were admitted to the emergency department or intensive care units at CHH were monitored during the study. We assessed pre-implementation baseline metrics during the month of July, 2017, when the SJSA was active. During implementation in the month of August, 2017, SJSA and the MLA concurrently monitored patients for sepsis risk. At the conclusion of the study period, the primary outcome of sepsis-related in-hospital mortality and secondary outcome of sepsis-related hospital length of stay were compared between the two groups.\\n\\nResultsSepsis-related in-hospital mortality decreased from 3.97% to 2.64%, a 33.5% relative decrease (P = 0.038), and sepsis-related length of stay decreased from 2.99 days in the pre-implementation phase to 2.48 days in the post-implementation phase, a 17.1% relative reduction (P < 0.001).\\n\\nConclusionReductions in patient mortality and length-of-stay were observed with use of a machine learning algorithm for early sepsis detection in the emergency department and intensive care units at Cabell Huntington Hospital, and may present a method for improving patient outcomes.\\n\\nTrial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03235193, retrospectively registered on July 27th 2017.",

    "abstract": "Observational epidemiological studies are prone to confounding, measurement error, and reverse causation, undermining their ability to generate reliable causal estimates of the effect of risk factors to inform cancer prevention and treatment strategies. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an analytical approach that uses genetic variants to proxy potentially modifiable exposures (e.g. environmental factors, biological traits, and druggable pathways) to permit robust causal inference of the effects of these exposures on diseases and their outcomes. MR has seen widespread adoption within population health research in cardio-metabolic disease, but also holds much promise for identifying possible interventions (e.g., dietary, behavioural, or pharmacological) for cancer prevention and treatment. However, some methodological and conceptual challenges in the implementation of MR are particularly pertinent when applying this method to cancer aetiology and prognosis, including reverse causation arising from disease latency and selection bias in studies of cancer progression. These issues must be carefully considered to ensure appropriate design, analysis, and interpretation of such studies.\\n\\nIn this review, we provide an overview of the key principles and assumptions of MR focusing on applications of this method to the study of cancer aetiology and prognosis. We summarize recent studies in the cancer literature that have adopted a MR framework to highlight strengths of this approach compared to conventional epidemiological studies. Lastly, limitations of MR and recent methodological developments to address them are discussed, along with the translational opportunities they present to inform public health and clinical interventions in cancer.",

Mean absolute errors between automatically-derived and self-reported sleep-onset and wake-up times were recorded in addition to kappa statistics for the minute-by-minute performance of each of the methods.\\n\\nResults46 participants provided 972 days of accelerometer recordings with corresponding self-reported sleep information. The three sleep-boundary detection methods resulted in mean absolute errors in sleep-onset and wake-up times per individual of 36 min, 34 min and 33 min and kappa statistics of 0.87, 0.89 and 0.89, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionOur methods provide a data-driven approach to detect sleep-onset and -end times without the need for self-reported sleep-boundary information. The methods are likely to be of particular use for large-scale studies where the collection of self-reported sleep diaries is impractical.\\n\\nSignificanceObjective measures of sleep are needed to reliably detect associations with health outcomes. This work lays the foundation for studies of objectively measured sleep duration and its health consequences in large studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae is an important and increasing cause of life-threatening disease in hospitalised neonates. Third generation cephalosporin resistance (3GC-R) is frequently a marker of multi-drug resistance, and can complicate management of infections. 3GC-R K. pneumoniae is hyper-endemic in many developing country settings, but its epidemiology is poorly understood and prospective studies of endemic transmission are lacking. We aimed to determine the transmission dynamics of 3GC-R K. pneumoniae in a newly opened neonatal unit (NU) in Cambodia.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a prospective longitudinal study between September and November 2013. Rectal swabs from 37 consented patients were collected upon NU admission and every three days thereafter. Morphologically different colonies from swabs growing cefpodoxime-resistant K. pneumoniae were selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS).\\n\\nResults32/37 (86%) patients screened positive for 3GC-R K. pneumoniae and 93 colonies from 119 swabs were sequenced. Isolates were resistant to a median of six (range 3-9) antimicrobials. WGS revealed high diversity; pairwise distances between isolates from the same patient were either 0-1 SNV or >1,000 SNVs; 19/32 colonized patients harboured K. pneumoniae colonies differing by >1000 SNVs. Diverse lineages accounted for 18 probable importations to the NU and nine probable transmission clusters involving 19/37 (51%) of screened patients. Median cluster size was 5 patients (range 3-9).\\n\\nConclusionsThe epidemiology of 3GC-R K. pneumoniae was characterised by multiple introductions and a dense network of cross-infection, with half of screened neonates part of a transmission cluster. Efforts to reduce the 3GC-R K. pneumoniae disease burden should consider targeting both processes.",

    "abstract": "Host shifts, where a pathogen invades and establishes in a new host species, are a major source of emerging infectious diseases. They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts, we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution, where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species, we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species, and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species, closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.",

Theory predicts that by increasing the number of coexisting beneficial alleles in a population beyond some point does not necessarily translates into an acceleration in the rate of evolution. This diminishing-returns effect of beneficial genetic variability in microbial asexual populations is known as clonal interference. Clonal interference has been shown to operate in experimental populations of animal RNA viruses replicating in cell cultures. Here we carried out experiments to test whether a similar diminishing-returns of population size on the rate of adaptation exists for a plant RNA virus infecting real multicellular hosts. We have performed evolution experiments with tobacco etch potyvirus in two hosts, the natural and a novel one, at different inoculation sizes and estimated the rates of evolution for two phenotypic fitness-related traits. Firstly, we found that evolution proceeds faster in the novel than in the original host. Secondly, we found the predicted diminishing-returns effect of inoculum size on the rate of evolution for one of the fitness traits, but not for the other, which suggests that selection operates differently on each trait.",

Previous genome sequencing of one individual of the common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus revealed an unusual, sharp rise in Ne during the last glacial, raising questions about the reliability, generality, underlying cause, and biological implication of this finding. Here we first verify this result by additional sampling of T. truncatus. We then sequence and analyze the genomes of its close relative, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin T. aduncus. The two species exhibit contrasting demographic changes in the last glacial, likely through actual changes in population size and/or alterations in the level of gene flow among populations.

We also present new evidence of large aggregations (n~30) in this species that possibly drive alternative mating strategies. Lastly, we provide footage of an opportunistic sneaky copulation in this species. We believe that alternative mating tactics may be more common in this genus than previously recorded (based on observations presented here and a search of the literature for similar life history, environmental and behavioural factors found in other species within the Sepia genus), and as much of their captive husbandry is well known, they could an ideal system for studying the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies.",

    "abstract": "Some of the fastest evolving regions of the human genome are conserved non-coding elements with many human-specific DNA substitutions. These Human Accelerated Regions (HARs) are enriched nearby regulatory genes, and several HARs function as developmental enhancers. To investigate if this evolutionary signature is unique to humans, we quantified evidence of accelerated substitutions in conserved genomic elements across multiple lineages and applied this approach simultaneously to the genomes of five apes: human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon. We find roughly similar numbers and genomic distributions of lineage-specific accelerated regions (linARs) in all five apes. In particular, apes share an enrichment of linARs in regulatory DNA nearby genes involved in development, especially transcription factors and other regulators. Many developmental loci harbor clusters of nonoverlapping linARs from multiple apes, suggesting that accelerated evolution in each species affected distinct regulatory elements that control a shared set of developmental pathways. Our statistical tests distinguish between GC-biased and unbiased accelerated substitution rates, allowing us to quantify the roles of different evolutionary forces in creating linARs. We find evidence of GC-biased gene conversion in each ape, but unbiased acceleration consistent with positive selection or loss of constraint is more common in all five lineages. It therefore appears that similar evolutionary processes created independent accelerated regions in the genomes of different apes, and that these lineage-specific changes to conserved non-coding sequences may have differentially altered expression of a core set of developmental genes across ape evolution.",

    "abstract": "Despite encompassing a relatively small geographical area, montane regions harbor disproportionately high levels of species diversity and endemism. Yet, relatively little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms ultimately leading to montane diversity. In this study, we use target capture of ultraconserved elements to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and diversification patterns of Melanophryniscus (Bufonidae) and Brachycephalus (Brachycephalidae), two frog genera that occur in sky islands of the southern Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Specifically, we test whether diversification of montane species in these genera can be explained by a single climatic shift leading to isolation in sky islands, followed by relative climatic stability that maintained populations in allopatry. In both genera, the topologies inferred using concatenation and coalescent-based methods were concordant and had strong nodal support, except for a few recent splits. These recent splits tended to be supported by more informative loci (those with higher average bootstrap support), suggesting that, while individual trees may be well resolved, the relationships they recover are being obscured by non-informative data. Divergence dating of a combined dataset using both genera is consistent with concordant timing of their diversification. These results support the scenario of diversification-by-isolation in sky islands, and suggest that allopatry due to climatic gradients in montane regions are an important mechanism for generating species diversity and endemism in these regions.",

We found evidence that this relationship is conserved by comparing predicted binding sites for Hunchback and Caudal across orthologous eve stripe 2 enhancers. These results alter the textbook view of eve stripe 2 regulation wherein Hb is depicted as a direct activator.

MreB uses local geometric cues of envelope curvature to avoid the cell poles and localize to specific regions of the cell body. However, it remains unclear whether MreBs curvature preference is regulated by additional factors, and which features of MreB are essential for specific aspects of rod shape growth, such as cylindrical uniformity. Here we show that in addition to its previously-described role in mediating MreB motion, RodZ also modulates MreB polymer number and curvature preference. MreB polymer number and curvature localization can be regulated independently. Quantitative 3D measurements and a series of mutant strains show that among various properties of MreB, polymer number, total length of MreB polymers, and MreB curvature preference are the key determinants of cylindrical uniformity, a measure of the variability in radius within a single cell. Changes in the values of these parameters are highly predictive of the resulting changes in cell shape (r2=0.93). Our data suggest a model for rod shape in which RodZ promotes the assembly of multiple long MreB polymers that ensure the growth of a uniform cylinder.",

Methods: This cohort study is the first to describe and quantitatively assess functional brain networks and their relation to later motor skills in neonates with a diverse range of perinatal brain injuries. Infants (n=65, included in final analyses: n=53) were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and were stratified based on their age at birth (premature vs. term), and on whether neuropathology was diagnosed from structural MRI. Functional brain networks and a measure of disruption to functional connectivity were obtained from 14 minutes of fcMRI acquired during natural sleep at term-equivalent age.\\n\\nResultsDisruption to connectivity of the somatomotor and frontoparietal executive networks predicted motor impairment at 4 and 8 months. This disruption in functional connectivity was not found to be driven by differences between clinical groups, or by any of the specific measures we captured to describe the clinical course.\\n\\nConclusionfcMRI was predictive over and above other clinical measures available at discharge from the NICU, including structural MRI. Motor learning was affected by disruption to somatomotor networks, but also frontoparietal executive networks, which supports the functional importance of these networks in early development.

Distinct anatomical and spectral channels may therefore play specialized roles in communication within hierarchical cortical networks; however, empirical evidence for this organization in humans is limited. We leverage high precision MEG to test this proposal, directly and non-invasively, in human participants during visually guided actions. Visual alpha activity mapped onto deep cortical laminae, whereas visual gamma activity predominantly arose from superficial laminae. This laminar-specificity was echoed in sensorimotor beta and gamma activity. Visual gamma activity scaled with task demands in a way compatible with feedforward signaling. For sensorimotor activity, we observed a more complex relationship with feedback and feedforward processes. Distinct frequency channels thus operate in a laminar-specific manner, but with dissociable functional roles across sensory and motor cortices.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we computationally generate hypotheses for dose-finding studies in the context of desynchronizing neuromodulation techniques. Abnormally strong neuronal synchronization is a hallmark of several brain disorders. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation is a spatio-temporally patterned stimulation technique that specifically aims at disrupting abnormal neuronal synchrony. In networks with spike-timing-dependent plasticity CR stimulation may ultimately cause an anti-kindling, i.e. an unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and neuronal synchrony. This long-lasting desynchronization was theoretically predicted and verified in several pre-clinical and clinical studies. We have shown that CR stimulation with rapidly varying sequences (RVS) robustly induces an anti-kindling at low intensities e.g. if the CR stimulation frequency (i.e. stimulus pattern repetition rate) is in the range of the frequency of the neuronal oscillation. In contrast, CR stimulation with slowly varying sequences (SVS) turned out to induce an anti-kindling more strongly, but less robustly with respect to variations of the CR stimulation frequency. Motivated by clinical constraints and inspired by the spacing principle of learning theory, in this computational study we propose a short-term dosage regimen that enables a robust anti-kindling effect of both RVS and SVS CR stimulation, also for those parameter values where RVS and SVS CR stimulation previously turned out to be ineffective. Intriguingly, for the vast majority of parameter values tested, spaced multishot CR stimulation with demand-controlled variation of stimulation frequency and intensity caused a robust and pronounced anti-kindling. In contrast, spaced CR stimulation with fixed stimulation parameters as well as singleshot CR stimulation of equal integral duration failed to improve the stimulation outcome. In the model network under consideration, our short-term dosage regimen enables to robustly induce long-term desynchronization at comparably short stimulation duration and low integral stimulation duration. Currently, clinical proof of concept is available for deep brain CR stimulation for Parkinsons therapy and acoustic CR stimulation for tinnitus therapy. Promising first in human data is available for vibrotactile CR stimulation for Parkinsons treatment. For the clinical development of these treatments it is mandatory to perform dose-finding studies to reveal optimal stimulation parameters and dosage regimens. Our findings can straightforwardly be tested in human dose-finding studies.",

    "abstract": "The transition from early adulthood to older is marked by pronounced functional and structural brain transformations that impact cognition and behaviour. Here, we use dynamic functional network connectivity method to examine resting state functional network changes over aging process. In general, the features of dynamic functional states are generally varying across ages, such as the frequency of expression and the amount of time spent in the certain state. Increasing age is associated with less variability of functional state across time at rest period. From age point of view, examining the age-related difference of topology index revealed 19-30 age range has the significant largest global efficiency, largest local efficiency of default-mode network (DMN), cognitive control network (CCN) and salience network (SN). As for functional states, one state displayed the whole positive connectivity, in the meantime, it has the largest global efficiency and local efficiency of three subnetworks. Besides, the frequency of another state was negatively correlated to the box block (The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale subset, which is thought to evaluate fine motor skills, processing speed, and visuospatial ability), while positively correlated with age, and the box block was inversely correlated to age. The results suggested that cognitive aging may be characterized by the dynamic functional network connectivity. Taken together, these findings suggested the importance of a dynamic approach to understanding cognitive aging in lifespan.",

    "abstract": "The most prevalent approach to activation localization in neuroimaging is to identify brain regions as contiguous supra-threshold clusters, check their significance using random field theory, and correct for the multiple clusters being tested. Besides recent criticism on the validity of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies \\\"there exists at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster\\\", and not that \\\"all the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response\\\". Inference on voxels within selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high, the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further \\\"drill down\\\" from the cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small, however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox, and its resolution using ARI. One of these datasets is large enough for us to split it and validate the ARI estimates. The conservatism of ARI inference permits circularity without losing error guarantees, while still returning informative estimates.",

    "abstract": "Frequency-related topological projections from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body (MGv) relay the tonotopic organization found in primary auditory cortex (A1). However, relaying circuits of the functional organization to higher-order, secondary auditory field (A2) have not been identified so far. Here, using tracing, we found that A2 receives dense topological projections from MGv in mice, and that tonotopy was established in A2 even when primary fields including A1 were removed. These indicate that thalamic inputs to A2 are sufficient for generating its tonotopy. Moreover, neuronal responses in the thalamocortical recipient layer of A2 showed wider bandwidth and greater heterogeneity of the best frequency distribution than those of A1, which was attributed to larger divergence of thalamocortical projections from MGv to A2 than those from MGv to A1. The current study identifies that the functional organization in the auditory cortex can be determined by the structure of thalamocortical input.\\n\\nSignificant StatementAlthough peripheral input patterns to the primary auditory cortex (A1) of the brain are well understood, how tonal information is relayed to higher-order regions such as the secondary auditory field (A2) remains unclear. This work revealed a new source of auditory information to A2; the tonal map in mouse A2 is primarily produced by orderly projections from the primary auditory thalamus. We also found that the complex behaviour and organization of neurons in A2 is generated by divergent projections from the primary thalamus that converge on neurons in A2. Our findings indicate that thalamocortical projections constitute a major factor that determines the regional properties and functional organization of mouse A2.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general-purpose powerful machine learning framework within which we can model various deterministic, non-deterministic and complex environments. We applied RL to the problem of tracking and improving human sustained attention during a simple sustained attention to response task (SART) in a proof of concept study with two subjects, using state-of-the-art deep neural network-based RL in the form of Deep Q Networks (DQNs). While others have used RL in EEG settings previously, none have applied it in a neurofeedback (NFB) setting, which seems a natural problem within Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to tackle using end-to-end RL in the form of DQNs, due to both the problems non-stationarity and the ability of RL to learn in a continuous setting. Furthermore, while many have explored phasic alerting previously, learning optimal alerting in a personalized way in real time is a less explored field, which we believe RL to be an most suitable solution for. First, we used empirically-derived simulated data of EEG and reaction times and subsequent parameter/algorithmic exploration within this simulated model to pick parameters for the DQN that are more likely to be optimal for the experimental setup and to explore the behavior of DQNs in this task setting. We then applied the method on two subjects and show that we get different but plausible results for both subjects, suggesting something about the behavior of DQNs in this setting. For this experimental part, we used parameters suggested to us by the simulation results. This RL-based behavioral- and neuro-feedback BCI method we have developed here is input feature agnostic and allows for complex continuous actions to be learned in other more complex closed-loop behavioral or neuro-feedback approaches.",

Here we engineer Escherichia coli with a light-activated transcriptional promoter to optically regulate adhesin gene expression. When illuminated with patterned blue light, long-term viable biofilms with spatial resolution down to 25m can be formed on a variety of substrates and inside enclosed culture chambers without the need for surface pretreatment. A biophysical model suggests the patterning mechanism involves stimulation of transiently surface-adsorbed cells, lending new evidence to a previously proposed role of adhesin expression during natural biofilm maturation. Overall, this tool - termed  Biofilm Lithography - has distinct advantages over existing cell-depositing and patterning methods and provides the ability to grow structured biofilms, with applications towards an improved understanding natural biofilm communities, as well as the engineering of living biomaterials and bottom-up approaches to microbial consortia design.",

    "abstract": "The paradox of high genetic variation observed in traits under stabilizing selection is a longstanding problem in evolutionary theory, as mutation rates are 10-100 times too low to explain observed levels of standing genetic variation under classic models of mutation-selection balance. Here, we use individual-based simulations to explore the effect of various types of environmental heterogeneity on the maintenance of genetic variation (VA) for a quantitative trait under stabilizing selection. We find that VA is maximized at intermediate migration rates in spatially heterogeneous environments, and that the observed patterns are robust to changes in population size. Spatial environmental heterogeneity increased variation by as much as 10-fold over mutation-selection-balance alone, whereas pure temporal environmental heterogeneity increased variance by only 45% at max. Our results show that some combinations of spatial heterogeneity and migration can maintain considerably more variation than mutation-selection balance, potentially reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical observations. However, given the narrow regions of parameter space required for this effect, this is unlikely to provide a general explanation for the maintenance of variation. Nonetheless, our results suggest that habitat fragmentation may affect the maintenance of VA and thereby reduce the adaptive capacity of populations.",

    "abstract": "While both genes and environment contribute to phenotype, deciphering environmental contributions to phenotype is a challenge. Furthermore, elucidating how different phenotypes may share similar environmental etiologies also is challenging. One way to identify environmental influences is through a discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin study design. Here, we assessed differential gene expression in MZ discordant twin pairs (affected vs. non-affected) for seven phenotypes, including chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, ulcerative colitis, major depressive disorder, intermittent allergic rhinitis, physical activity, and intelligence quotient, comparing the spectrum of genes differentially expressed across seven phenotypes individually. Second, we performed meta-analysis for each gene to identify commonalities and differences in gene expression signatures between the seven phenotypes. In our integrative analyses, we found that there may be a common gene expression signature (with small effect sizes) across the phenotypes; however, differences between phenotypes with respect to differentially expressed genes were more prominently featured. Therefore, defining common environmentally induced pathways in phenotypes remains elusive. We make our work accessible by providing a new database (DiscTwinExprDB: http://apps.chiragjpgroup.org/disctwinexprdb/) for investigators to study non-genotypic influence on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of our movements to changes in the environment is known to be supported by multiple learning processes which act in parallel. An implicit process recalibrates motor output to maintain alignment between intended and observed movement outcomes (\\\"implicit recalibration\\\"). In parallel, an explicit learning process drives more strategic adjustments of behavior, often by deliberately aiming movements away from an intended target (\\\"deliberate re-aiming\\\"). It has long been established that people form a memory for prior experience adapting to a perturbation through the fact that they become able to more rapidly adapt to familiar perturbations (a phenomenon known as \\\"savings\\\"). Repeated exposures to the same perturbation can further strengthen savings. It remains unclear, however, which underlying learning process is responsible for this practice-related improvement in savings. We measured the relative contributions of implicit recalibration and deliberate re-aiming to adaptation during multiple exposures to an alternating sequence of perturbations over two days. We found that the implicit recalibration followed an invariant learning curve despite prolonged practice, and thus exhibited no memory of prior experience. Instead, practice led to a qualitative change in re-aiming which, in addition to supporting savings, became able to be expressed rapidly and automatically. This qualitative change appeared to enable participants to form memories for two opposing perturbations, overcoming interference effects that typically prohibit savings when learning multiple, opposing perturbations. Our results are consistent with longstanding theories that frame skill learning as a transition from deliberate to automatic selection of actions.",
