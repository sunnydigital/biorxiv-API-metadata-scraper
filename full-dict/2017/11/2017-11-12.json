    "abstract": "Sexual isolation, a reproductive barrier, can prevent interbreeding between diverging populations or species. Sexual isolation can have a clear genetic basis; however, it may also result from learned mate preferences that form via sexual imprinting. Here, we demonstrate that two sympatric species of mice--the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and its sister species, the cotton mouse (P. gossypinus)--hybridize only rarely in the wild despite co-occurrence in the same habitat and lack of any measurable intrinsic postzygotic barriers in laboratory crosses. We present evidence that strong conspecific mating preferences in each species result in significant sexual isolation. We find that these preferences are learned in at least one species: P. gossypinus sexually imprints on its parents, but in P. leucopus, additional factors influence mating preferences. Our study demonstrates that sexual imprinting contributes to reproductive isolation that reduces hybridization between otherwise interfertile species, supporting the role for learning in mammalian speciation.",

    "abstract": "The innovation of iconic gestures is essential to establishing the symbolic vocabularies of signed languages, but might iconicity also play a role in the origin of various spoken words? Can people create novel vocalizations that are comprehensible to naive listeners without the use of prior conventions? To test this capacity, we launched a contest in which participants submitted a set of non-linguistic vocalizations for 30 meanings spanning actions, humans, animals, inanimate objects, properties, quantifiers and demonstratives. The winner - who received a monetary prize - was judged by the ability of naive listeners to successfully infer the meanings of the vocalizations. We report the results from the contest, along with a series of experiments and analyses designed to evaluate the vocalizations for: 1) their comprehensibility to naive listeners; 2) the degree to which they resembled their meanings, i.e., were iconic; 3) agreement between producers and listeners in what constitutes an iconic vocalization; and 4) whether iconicity helps naive listeners learn the vocalizations as category labels. The results show that contestants were able to create iconic vocalizations for a wide array of semantic domains, and that these vocalizations were largely comprehensible to naive listeners, as well as easier to learn as category labels. These findings provide a compelling demonstration of the extent to which iconic vocalizations can enable interlocutors to establish understanding through vocalizations in the absence of conventions. This suggests the possibility that, prior to the advent of full-blown spoken languages, people could have used iconic vocalizations to ground a spoken vocabulary with considerable semantic breadth.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100039). The efficiency of plant resistance to fungal pathogen populations is expected to decrease over time, due to its evolution with an increase in the frequency of virulent or highly aggressive strains. This dynamics may differ depending on the scale investigated (annual or pluriannual), particularly for annual crop pathogens with both sexual and asexual reproduction cycles. We assessed this time-scale effect, by comparing aggressiveness changes in a local Zymoseptoria tritici population over an eight-month cropping season and a six-year period of wheat monoculture. We collected two pairs of subpopulations to represent the annual and pluriannual scales: from leaf lesions at the beginning and end of a single annual epidemic, and from crop debris at the beginning and end of a six-year period. We assessed two aggressiveness traits - latent period and lesion size - on sympatric and allopatric host varieties. A trend toward decreased latent period concomitant with a significant loss of variability was established during the course of the annual epidemic, but not over the six-year period. Furthermore, a significant cultivar effect (sympatric vs. allopatric) on the average aggressiveness of the isolates revealed host adaptation, arguing that the observed patterns could result from selection. We thus provide an experimental body of evidence of an epidemiological trade-off between the intra- and inter-annual scales in the evolution of aggressiveness in a local plant pathogen population. More aggressive isolates were collected from upper leaves, on which disease severity is usually lower than on the lower part of the plants left in the field as crop debris after harvest. We suggest that these isolates play little role in sexual reproduction, due to an Allee effect (difficulty finding mates at low pathogen densities), particularly as the upper parts of the plant are removed from the field, explaining the lack of transmission of increases in aggressiveness between epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is an important driver of evolution. Variability in the intensity of recombination across chromosomes can affect sequence composition, nucleotide variation and rates of adaptation. In many organisms recombination events are concentrated within short segments termed recombination hotspots. The variation in recombination rate and positions of recombination hotspot can be studied using population genomics data and statistical methods. In this study, we conducted population genomics analyses to address the evolution of recombination in two closely related fungal plant pathogens: the prominent wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and a sister species infecting wild grasses Zymoseptoria ardabiliae. We specifically addressed whether recombination landscapes, including hotspot positions, are conserved in the two recently diverged species and if recombination contributes to rapid evolution of pathogenicity traits. We conducted a detailed simulation analysis to assess the performance of methods of recombination rate estimation based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium, in particular in the context of high nucleotide diversity. Our analyses reveal overall high recombination rates, a lack of suppressed recombination in centromeres and significantly lower recombination rates on chromosomes that are known to be accessory. The comparison of the recombination landscapes of the two species reveals a strong correlation of recombination rate at the megabase scale, but little correlation at smaller scales. The recombination landscapes in both pathogen species are dominated by frequent recombination hotspots across the genome including coding regions, suggesting a strong impact of recombination on gene evolution. A significant but small fraction of these hotspots co-localize between the two species, suggesting that hotspots dynamics contribute to the overall pattern of fast evolving recombination in these species.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) has revealed fundamental properties of neocortical processing at macroscopic scales. Since for each pixel VSDi signals report the average membrane potential over hundreds of neurons, it seems natural to use a mean-field formalism to model such signals. Here, we present a mean-field model of networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons, with conductance-based synaptic interactions. We study here a network of regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We use a Master Equation formalism, together with a semi-analytic approach to the transfer function of AdEx neurons to describe the average dynamics of the coupled populations. We compare the predictions of this mean-field model to simulated networks of RS-FS cells, first at the level of the spontaneous activity of the network, which is well predicted by the analytical description. Second, we investigate the response of the network to time-varying external input, and show that the mean-field model predicts the response time course of the population. Finally, to model VSDi signals, we consider a one-dimensional ring model made of interconnected RS-FS mean-field units. We found that this model can reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns seen in VSDi of awake monkey visual cortex as a response to local and transient visual stimuli. Conversely, we show that the model allows one to infer physiological parameters from the experimentally-recorded spatio-temporal patterns.",

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is one of the most common and lethal birth defects. Previous studies using exome sequencing support a significant contribution of coding de novo variants in complex CDH cases with additional anomalies and likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants in isolated CDH cases. To further investigate the genetic architecture of CDH, we performed exome or genome sequencing in 283 proband-parent trios. Combined with data from previous studies, we analyzed a total of 357 trios, including 148 complex and 209 isolated cases. Complex and isolated cases both have a significant burden of deleterious de novo coding variants (1.7~fold, p= 1.2x10-5 for complex, 1.5~fold, p= 9.0x10-5 for isolated). Strikingly, in isolated CDH, almost all of the burden is carried by female cases (2.1~fold, p=0.004 for likely gene disrupting and 1.8~fold, p= 0.0008 for damaging missense variants); whereas in complex CDH, the burden is similar in females and males. Additionally, de novo LGD variants in complex cases are mostly enriched in genes highly expressed in developing diaphragm, but distributed in genes with a broad range of expression levels in isolated cases. Finally, we identified a new candidate risk gene MYRF (4 de novo variants, p-value=2x10-10), a transcription factor intolerant of mutations. Patients with MYRF mutations have additional anomalies including congenital heart disease and genitourinary defects, likely representing a novel syndrome.",

Di-mensionality reduction methods reveal a striking simplicity underlying such multi-neuronal data: they can be reduced to a low-dimensional space, and the resulting neural trajectories in this space yield a remarkably insightful dynamical portrait of circuit computation. This simplicity raises profound and timely conceptual questions. What are its origins and its implications for the complexity of neural dynamics? How would the situation change if we recorded more neurons? When, if at all, can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from measuring an infinitesimal fraction of task relevant neurons?

    "abstract": "Insects use species-specific sex pheromone blends to attract members of the opposite sex which express the corresponding molecular receptors. Given this lock and key mechanism used for species identification and mate choice, it is currently not well understood how pheromone blends or receptor systems evolve. One possibility is that insects develop preferences for new sex pheromone blends via the process of learning, and that these learned preferences may be passed on to the next generation. We tested these hypotheses by exposing newly emerged Bicyclus anynana female butterflies to either wild type or to modified male sex pheromone blends. A few days later, we scored female mating outcome in a choice trial involving both male types. We also assessed the mating outcome of naive offspring of females that underwent distinct odor learning trials to test for a potential inheritance of learned odor preferences. Naive (parental) females mated preferentially with Wt-blend males, but females pre-exposed to new blends either shifted their preference to new-blend males, or mated equally with males of either blend type; the response depending on the new blend they were introduced to. Naive daughters of females who were exposed to new-blend males behaved similarly to their experienced mothers. We demonstrate that females are able to learn preferences for novel pheromone blends in response to a short social experience, and pass that learned preference down to the next generation. This suggests that learning can be a key factor in the evolution of sex pheromone blend recognition and in chemosensory speciation.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhile the diversity of sex pheromone communication systems across insects is well documented, the mechanisms that lead to such diversity are not well understood. Sex pheromones constitute a species-specific system of sexual communication that reinforces interspecific reproductive isolation. When odor blends evolve, the efficacy of male-female communication becomes compromised, unless preference for novel blends also evolves. We explore odor learning as a possible mechanism leading to changes in sex pheromone preferences. We show that preferences for new blends can develop following a short learning experience, and that these novel preferences can be transmitted to the next generation. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of sex pheromone blend preference learning impacting mate choice and being inherited in an insect.",

    "abstract": "Biological reactions in the cellular environment differ physicochemically from those performed in dilute buffer solutions due to, in part, slower diffusion of various components in the cellular milieu, increase in their chemical activities, and modulation of their binding affinities and conformational stabilities. In vivo transcription is therefore expected to be strongly influenced by the  crowdedness of the cell. Previous studies of transcription under macromolecular crowding conditions have focused mainly on multiple cycles of RNAP-Promoter associations, assuming that the association is the rate-determining step of the entire transcription process. However, recent reports demonstrated that late initiation and promoter escape could be the rate-determining steps for some promoter DNA sequences. The investigation of crowding effects on these steps under single-round conditions is therefore crucial for better understanding of transcription initiation in vivo. Here, we have implemented an in vitro transcription quenched-kinetics single-molecule assay to investigate the dependence of transcription reaction rates on the sizes and concentrations of crowders. Our results demonstrate an expected slowdown of transcription kinetics due to increased viscosity, and an unexpected enhancement in transcription kinetics by large crowding agents (at a given viscosity). More importantly, the enhancements dependence on crowder size significantly deviates from hard-sphere model (scaled-particle theory) predictions, commonly used for description of crowding effects. Our findings shed new light on how enzymatic reactions are affected by crowding conditions in the cellular milieu.",

    "abstract": "High throughput methods for profiling the transcriptomes of single cells have recently emerged as transformative approaches for large-scale population surveys of cellular diversity in heterogeneous primary tissues. Efficient generation of such an atlas will depend on sufficient sampling of the diverse cell types while remaining cost-effective to enable a comprehensive examination of organs, developmental stages, and individuals. To examine the relationship between cell number and transcriptional heterogeneity in the context of unbiased cell type classification, we explicitly explored the population structure of a publically available 1.3 million cell dataset from the E18.5 mouse brain. We propose a computational framework for inferring the saturation point of cluster discovery in a single cell mRNA-seq experiment, centered around cluster preservation in downsampled datasets. In addition, we introduce a \\\"complexity index\\\", which characterizes the heterogeneity of cells in a given dataset. Using Cajal-Retzius cells as an example of a limited complexity dataset, we explored whether biological distinctions relate to technical clustering. Surprisingly, we found that clustering distinctions carrying biologically interpretable meaning are achieved with far fewer cells (20,000). Together, these findings suggest that most of the biologically interpretable insights from the 1.3 million cells can be recapitulated by analyzing 50,000 randomly selected cells, indicating that instead of profiling few individuals at high \\\"cellular coverage\\\", the much anticipated cell atlasing studies may instead benefit from profiling more individuals, or many time points at lower cellular coverage.\\n\\nRecent efforts seek to create a comprehensive cell atlas of the human body1,2 Current technology, however, makes it precipitously expensive to perform analysis of every cell. Therefore, designing effective sampling strategies be critical to generate a working atlas in an efficient, cost-effective, and streamlined manner. The advent of single cell and single nucleus mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) in droplet format3,4 now enables large scale sampling of cells from any tissue, and a recently released publicly available dataset of 1.3 million single cells from the E18.5 mouse brain generated with the 10X Chromium5 provides an opportunity to explore the relationship between population structure and the number of sampled cells necessary to reveal the underlying diversity of cell types. Here, we present a framework for how researchers can evaluate whether a dataset has reached saturation, and we estimate how many cells would be required to generate an atlas of the sample analyzed here.

A prime example of such a question is enrichment of gene ontology (GO) classes in lists of genes. Our paper deals with two issues within this larger question. One is how to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR) within a set of apparently enriched ontologies, and the second how to set that FDR within the context of assessing significance for addressing biological questions, to answer these questions we compare a random resampling method with a commonly used method for assessing FDR, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. We further develop a heuristic method for evaluating Type II (false negative) errors to enable utilization of F-Measure binary classification theory for distinguishing \\\"significant\\\" from \\\"non-significant\\\" degrees of enrichment.\\n\\nResultsThe results show the preferability and feasibility of random resampling assessment of FDR over the analytical methods with which we compare it.

This genotypic to phenotypic mapping is executed by the machinery of gene regulation that turns genes on and off, which in microorganisms is essentially studied by changes in growth conditions and genetic modifications. Although many efforts have been made to systematize the annotation of experimental conditions in microbiology, the available annotation is not based on a consistent and controlled vocabulary for the unambiguous description of growth conditions, making difficult the identification of biologically meaningful comparisons of knowledge generated in different experiments or laboratories, a task urgently needed given the massive amounts of data generated by high throughput (HT) technologies.\\n\\nResultsWe curated terms related to experimental conditions that affect gene expression in E. coli K-12. Since this is the best studied microorganism, the collected terms are the seed for the first version of the Microbial Conditions Ontology (MCO), a controlled and structured vocabulary that can be expanded to annotate microbial conditions in general. Moreover, we developed an annotation framework using the MCO terms to describe experimental conditions, providing the foundation to identify regulatory networks that operate under a particular condition. MCO supports comparisons of HT-derived data from different repositories. In this sense, we started to map common RegulonDB terms and Colombos bacterial expression compendia terms to MCO.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationAs far as we know, MCO is the first ontology for growth conditions of any bacterial organism and it is available at http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/. Furthermore, we will disseminate MCO throughout the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry in order to set a standard for the annotation of gene expression data derived from conventional as well as HT experiments in E. coli and other microbial organisms. This will enable the comparison of data from diverse data sources.\\n\\nContactsgama@ccg.unam.mx, collado@ccg.unam.mx",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the cell origin of gastric cancer. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARD) is a druggable ligand-activated nuclear receptor that impacts protumorigenic cellular events. However, PPARDs role in tumorigenesis, especially gastric tumorigenesis, remains to be defined. We found that targeting PPARD overexpression in murine gastric progenitor cells (GPC), via a villin promoter, spontaneously induced gastric tumorigenesis that progressed to invasive adenocarcinoma. PPARD overexpression in GPC upregulated tumorigenic proinflammatory cytokine and CD44 expression, expanded GPC population in vivo, enhanced GPC self-renewal and proliferation in organoid cultures, and endowed these cells with tumorigenic properties. Our findings identify PPARD as a driver of gastric tumorigenesis via GPC transformation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate lineage reconstruction of mammalian pre-implantation development is essential for inferring the earliest cell fate decisions of mammalian development. Lineage tracing using global labeling techniques is complicated by increasing cell density and rapid embryo rotation, impeding automatic alignment and rendering accurate cell tracking of obtained four-dimensional imaging data sets highly challenging. Here, we exploit the advantageous properties of primed convertible fluorescent proteins (pr-pcFPs) to simultaneously visualize the global green and the photoconverted red population to minimize tracking uncertainties over prolonged time windows. Confined primed conversion of H2B-pr-mEosFP labeled nuclei combined with light-sheet imaging greatly facilitates segmentation, classification, and tracking of individual nuclei from the 4-cell stage up to the blastocyst. Using green and red labels as fiducial markers, we computationally correct for rotational and translational drift and accomplish high fidelity lineage tracing combined with a reduced data size - addressing majors concerns in the field of volumetric embryo imaging.",

    "abstract": "Early warning signals (EWS) are statistical indicators that a rapid regime shift may be forthcoming. Their development has given ecologists hope of predicting rapid regime shifts before they occur. Accurate predictions, however, rely on the signals being appropriate to the system in question. Most of the EWS commonly applied in ecology have been studied in the context of one specific type of regime shift (the type brought on by a saddle-node bifurcation, at which one stable equilibrium point collides with an unstable equilibrium and disappears) under one particular perturbation scheme (temporally uncorrelated noise that perturbs the net population growth rate in a density independent way). Whether and when these EWS can be applied to other ecological situations remains relatively unknown, and certainly underappreciated. We study a range of models with different types of dynamical transitions (including rapid regime shifts) and several perturbation schemes (density-dependent uncorrelated or temporally-correlated noise) and test the ability of EWS to warn of an approaching transition. We also test the sensitivity of our results to the amount of available pre-transition data and various decisions that must be made in the analysis (i.e. the rolling window size and smoothing bandwidth used to compute the EWS). We find that EWS generally work well to signal an impending saddle-node bifurcation, regardless of the autocorrelation or intensity of the noise. However, EWS do not reliably appear as expected for other types of transition. EWS were often very sensitive to the length of the pre-transition time series analyzed, and usually less sensitive to other decisions. We conclude that the EWS perform well for saddle-node bifurcation in a range of noise environments, but different methods should be used to predict other types of regime shifts. As a consequence, knowledge of the mechanism behind a possible regime shift is needed before EWS can be used to predict it.",

We performed a genome-wide analysis of the compositional reshaping of cellular transporters (the transportome) across the kingdoms of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. We show that the transportomes of eukaryotes evolved strongly towards a higher energetic efficiency, as ATP-dependent transporters diminished and secondary transporters and ion channels proliferated. This change has likely been important in the development of tissues performing energetically costly cellular functions. The transportome analysis also indicated seven bacterial species, including Neorickettsia risticii and Neorickettsia sennetsu, as likely origins of the mitochondrion in eukaryotes, due to the restricted presence therein of clear homologues of modern mitochondrial solute carriers.",

    "abstract": "To understand how complex genetic networks perform and regulate diverse cellular processes, the function of each individual component must be defined. Comprehensive phenotypic studies of mutant alleles have been successful in model organisms in determining what processes depend on the normal function of a gene. These results are often ported to newly sequenced genomes by using sequence homology. However, sequence similarity does not always mean identical function or phenotype, suggesting that new methods are required to functionally annotate newly sequenced species. We have implemented comparative analysis by high-throughput experimental testing of gene dispensability in Saccharomyces uvarum, a sister species of S. cerevisiae. We created haploid and heterozygous diploid Tn7 insertional mutagenesis libraries in S. uvarum to identify species dependent essential genes, with the goal of detecting genes with divergent functions and/or different genetic interactions. Comprehensive gene dispensability comparisons with S. cerevisiae predicted diverged dispensability at 12% of conserved orthologs, and validation experiments confirmed 22 differentially essential genes. Surprisingly, despite their differences in essentiality, these genes were capable of cross-species complementation, demonstrating that trans-acting factors that are background-dependent contribute to differential gene essentiality. This study demonstrates that direct experimental testing of gene disruption phenotypes across species can inform comparative genomic analyses and improve gene annotation. Our method can be widely applied in microorganisms to further our understanding of genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Short time-scale observations are valuable for understanding microbial ecological processes. We assessed dynamics in relative abundance and potential activities by sequencing the small sub-unit ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA gene) and rRNA molecules (rRNA) of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota once to twice-daily between March 2014 and May 2014 from the surface ocean off Catalina Island, California. Typically Ostreococcus, Braarudosphaera, Teleaulax, and Synechococcus dominated phytoplankton sequences (including chloroplasts) while SAR11, Sulfitobacter, and Fluviicola dominated non-phytoplankton Bacteria and Archaea. We observed short-lived increases of diatoms, mostly Pseudo-nitzschia and Chaetoceros, with quickly responding Bacteria and Archaea including Flavobacteriaceae (Polaribacter & Formosa), Roseovarius, and Euryarchaeota (MGII), notably the exact amplicon sequence variants we observed responding similarly to another diatom bloom nearby, three years prior. We observed correlations representing known interactions among abundant phytoplankton rRNA sequences, demonstrating the biogeochemical and ecological relevance of such interactions: 1) The kleptochloroplastidic ciliate Mesodinium 18S rRNA gene sequences and a single Teleaulax taxon (via 16S rRNA gene sequences) were correlated (Spearman r =0.83) yet uncorrelated to a Teleaulax 18S rRNA gene OTU, or any other taxon (consistent with a kleptochloroplastidic or karyoklepty relationship) and 2) the photosynthetic prymnesiophyte Braarudosphaera bigelowii and two strains of diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A were correlated and each taxon was also correlated to other taxa, including B. bigelowii to a verrucomicrobium and a dictyochophyte phytoplankter (all r > 0.8). We also report strong correlations (r > 0.7) between various ciliates, bacteria, and phytoplankton, suggesting interactions via currently unknown mechanisms. These data reiterate the utility of high-frequency time-series to show rapid microbial reactions to stimuli, and provide new information about in-situ dynamics of previously recognized and hypothesized interactions.",

Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the small GTPase Rhoa in adult microglia is sufficient to trigger spontaneous microglia activation producing a neurological phenotype (including synapse and neuron loss, impairment of LTP, formation of {beta}-amyloid plaques and memory deficits). Mechanistically, loss of Rhoa in microglia triggers Src activation and Src-mediated Tnf production, leading to excitotoxic glutamate secretion. Inhibiting Src in microglia Rhoa-deficient mice attenuates microglia dysregulation and the ensuing neurological phenotype. We also found that the Rhoa/Src signaling pathway was disrupted in microglia of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimers disease and that low doses of A{beta} oligomers triggered microglia neurotoxic polarization through the disruption of Rhoa-to-Src signaling. Overall, our results indicate that disturbing RhoGTPase signaling in microglia can directly cause neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have shown that pleiotropy is a common phenomenon that can potentially be exploited for enhanced detection of susceptibility loci. We propose heritability informed power optimization (HIPO) for conducting powerful pleiotropic analysis using summary-level association statistics. We find optimal linear combinations of association coefficients across traits that are expected to maximize non-centrality parameter for the underlying test statistics, taking into account estimates of heritability, sample size variations and overlaps across the traits. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has correct type I error, robust to population stratification and leads to desired genome-wide enrichment of association signals. Application of the proposed method to publicly available data for three groups of genetically related traits, lipids (N=188,577), psychiatric diseases (Ncase=33,332, Ncontrol=27,888) and social science traits (N ranging between 161,460 to 298,420 across individual traits) increased the number of genome-wide significant loci by 12%, 200% and 50%, respectively, compared to those found by analysis of individual traits. Evidence of replication is present for many of these loci in subsequent larger studies for individual traits. HIPO can potentially be extended to high-dimensional phenotypes as a way of dimension reduction to maximize power for subsequent genetic association testing.",
