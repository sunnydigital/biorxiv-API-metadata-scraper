    "abstract": "Empathy is the ability to recognize and respond to the emotional states of other individuals. It is an important psychological process that facilitates navigating social interactions and maintaining relationships, which are important for wellbeing. Several psychological studies have identified difficulties in both self-report and performance-based measures of empathy in a range of psychiatric conditions. To date, no study has systematically investigated the genetic architecture of empathy using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report the results of the largest GWAS of empathy to date using a well-validated self-report measure of empathy, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), in 46,861 research participants from 23andMe, Inc. We identify 11 suggestive loci (P < 1x10-6), though none were significant at P < 2.5x10-8 after correcting for multiple testing. The most significant SNP was identified in the non-stratified analysis (rs4882760; P = 4.29x10-8), and is an intronic SNP in TMEM132C. The EQ had a modest but significant narrow-sense heritability (0.11{+/-}0.014; P = 1.7x10-14). As predicted, based on earlier work, we confirmed a significant female-advantage on the EQ (P < 2x10-16 Cohens d = 0.65). We identified similar SNP heritability and high genetic correlation between the sexes. Also, as predicted, we identified a significant negative genetic correlation between autism and the EQ (rg = -0.27{+/-}0.07, P = 1.63x10-4). We also identified a significant positive genetic correlation between the EQ and risk for schizophrenia (rg = 0.19{+/-}0.04; P= 1.36x10-5), risk for anorexia nervosa (rg = 0.32{+/-}0.09; P = 6x10-4), and extraversion (rg = 0.45{+/-}0.08; 5.7x10-8). This is the first GWAS of self-reported empathy. The results suggest that the genetic variations associated with empathy also play a role in psychiatric conditions and psychological traits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with brain lesions provide a unique opportunity to understand the functioning of the human mind. However, even when focal, brain lesions have local and remote effects that impact functionally and structurally connected circuits. Similarly, function emerges from the interaction between brain areas rather than their sole activity. For instance, category fluency requires the association between executive, semantic and language production functions.\\n\\nFindingsHere we provide, for the first time, a set of complementary solutions to measure the impact of a given lesion upon the neuronal circuits. Our methods, which were applied to 37 patients with a focal frontal brain lesion, revealed a large set of directly and indirectly disconnected brain regions that had significantly impacted category fluency performance. The directly disconnected regions corresponded to areas that are classically considered as functionally engaged in verbal fluency and categorization tasks. These regions were also organized into larger directly and indirectly disconnected functional networks, including the left ventral fronto-parietal network, whose cortical thickness correlated with performance on category fluency.\\n\\nConclusionsThe combination of structural and functional connectivity together with cortical thickness estimates reveals the remote effects of brain lesions, provide for the identification of the affected networks and strengthen our understanding of their relationship with cognitive and behavioural measures. The methods presented are available and freely accessible in the BCBtoolkit as supplementary software (http://toolkit.bcblab.com).",

    "abstract": "Model-averaged partial regression coefficients have been criticized for averaging over a set of models with coefficients that have different meanings from model to model. This criticism arises because statisticians since Fisher believe that the meaning of a coefficient in a regression model arises from probabilistic conditioning (P (Y |X)) and that coefficients are mere descriptors of conditional association (or \\\"differences in conditional means\\\"). Because this association parameter is conditional on a specific set of covariates, the parameter for a predictor varies from model to model. The coefficients in many applied regression models, however, take their meaning from causal conditioning (P (Y |do(X))) and these coefficients estimate causal effect parameters (or simply, causal effects or Average Treatment Effects). Causal effect parameters are also differences in conditional expectations, but the event conditioned on is not the set of covariates in a regression model but a hypothetical intervention. Because an effect parameter for a predictor takes its meaning from causal and not probabilistic conditioning, it is the same from model to model, and an averaged coefficient has a straightforward interpretation as an estimate of a causal effect. But, because the effect parameter is the same from model to model, the estimates of the parameter will generally be biased. By contrast, with probabilistic conditioning, the coefficients are consistent estimates of their parameter in every model. Confounding and omitted variable bias, which are central to explanatory modeling, are meaningless in regression modeling as mere description.",

    "abstract": "Ecologists are increasingly involved in the pandemic prediction process. In the course of the Zika outbreak in the Americas, several ecological models were developed to forecast the potential global distribution of the disease. Conflicting results produced by alternative methods are unresolved, hindering the development of appropriate public health forecasts. We compare ecological niche models and experimentally-driven mechanistic forecasts for Zika transmission in the continental United States, a region of high model conflict. We use generic and uninformed stochastic county-level simulations to demonstrate the downstream epidemiological consequences of conflict among ecological models, and show how assumptions and parameterization in the ecological and epidemiological models propagate uncertainty and produce downstream model conflict. We conclude by proposing a basic consensus method that could resolve conflicting models of potential outbreak geography and seasonality. Our results illustrate the unacceptable and often undocumented margin of uncertainty that could emerge from using any one of these predictions without reservation or qualification. In the short term, ecologists face the task of developing better post hoc consensus that accurately forecasts spatial patterns of Zika virus outbreaks. Ultimately, methods are needed that bridge the gap between ecological and epidemiological approaches to predicting transmission and realistically capture both outbreak size and geography.",

    "abstract": "Developmental constraints on genome evolution have been suggested to follow either an early conservation model or an \\\"hourglass\\\" model. Both models agree that late development strongly diverges between species, but debate on which developmental period is the most conserved. Here, based on a modified \\\"Transcriptome Age Index\\\" approach, i.e. weighting trait measures by expression level, we analyzed the constraints acting on three evolutionary traits of protein coding genes (strength of purifying selection on protein sequences, phyletic age, and duplicability) in four species: nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, fly Drosophila melanogaster, zebrafish Danio rerio, and mouse Mus musculus. In general, we found that both models can be supported by different genomic properties. Sequence evolution follows an hourglass model, but the evolution of phyletic age and of duplicability follow an early conservation model. Further analyses indicate that stronger purifying selection on sequences in the middle development are driven by temporal pleiotropy of these genes. In addition, we report evidence that expression in late development is enriched with retrogenes, which usually lack efficient regulatory elements. This implies that expression in late development could facilitate transcription of new genes, and provide opportunities for acquisition of function. Finally, in C. elegans, we suggest that dosage imbalance could be one of the main factors that cause depleted expression of high duplicability genes in early development.",

With age, however, they produce a myeloid-biased output that may lead to poor immune responses to infectious challenge and the development of myeloid leukemias. Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is much more common amongst aged LT-HSCs and is uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict several transcription factors to regulate differentially expressed genes between mLT-HSCs and other LT-HSC subsets. Among these, we show that Klf5, Ikzf1 and Stat3 play important roles in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias.

    "abstract": "Inference from fMRI data faces the challenge that the hemodynamic system, that relates the underlying neural activity to the observed BOLD fMRI signal, is not known. We propose a new Bayesian model for task fMRI data with the following features: (i) joint estimation of brain activity and the underlying hemodynamics, (ii) the hemodynamics is modeled nonparametrically with a Gaussian process (GP) prior guided by physiological information and (iii) the predicted BOLD is not necessarily generated by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We place a GP prior directly on the predicted BOLD time series, rather than on the hemodynamic response function as in previous literature. This allows us to incorporate physiological information via the GP prior mean in a flexible way. The prior mean function may be generated from a standard LTI system, based on a canonical hemodynamic response function, or a more elaborate physiological model such as the Balloon model. This gives us the nonparametric flexibility of the GP, but allows the posterior to fall back on the physiologically based prior when the data are weak. Results on simulated data show that even with an erroneous prior for the GP, the proposed model is still able to discriminate between active and non-active voxels in a satisfactory way. The proposed model is also applied to real fMRI data, where our Gaussian process model in several cases finds brain activity where previously proposed LTI models, parametric and nonparametric, does not.",

In this paper, we explore the effects of partial selfing on the equilibrium genetic variance Vg, mutation load L and inbreeding depression{delta} under stabilizing selection acting on a arbitrary number n of quantitative traits coded by biallelic loci with additive effects. Overall, our model predicts a decrease in the equilibrium genetic variance with increasing selfing rates; however, the relationship between self-fertilization and the variables of interest depends on the strength of associations between loci, and three different regimes are observed. When the U/n ratio is low (where U is the total haploid mutation rate on selected traits) and effective recombination rates are sufficiently high, genetic associations between loci are negligible and the genetic variance, mutation load and inbreeding depression are well predicted by approximations based on single-locus models. For higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, moderate genetic associations generated by epistasis tend to increase Vg, L and{delta} , this regime being well predicted by approximations including the effects of pairwise associations between loci. For yet higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, a different regime is reached under which the maintenance of coadapted gene complexes reduces Vg, L and{delta} . Simulations indicate that the values of Vg, L and{delta} are little affected by assumptions regarding the number of possible alleles per locus.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of DNA is increasingly understood to play a decisive role in gene regulation and other vital cellular processes, which has triggered an explosive growth of research on the spatial architecture of the genome. Many studies focus on the role of various DNA-packaging proteins, crowding, and confinement in organizing chromatin, but structural information might also be directly encoded in bare DNA itself. Here, we use a fluorescence-based single-molecule technique to visualize plectonemes, the extended intertwined DNA loops that form upon twisting DNA. Remarkably, we find that the underlying DNA sequence directly encodes the structure of supercoiled DNA by pinning plectonemes at specific positions. We explore a variety of DNA sequences to determine what features influence pinning, and we develop a physical model that predicts the level of plectoneme pinning in excellent agreement with the data. The intrinsic curvature measured over a range of ~70 base pairs is found to be the key property governing the supercoiled structure of DNA. Our model predicts that plectonemes are likely to localize directly upstream of prokaryotic transcription start sites, and this prediction is experimentally verified in vitro. Our results reveal a hidden code in DNA that helps to spatially organize the genome.",

Transcriptionally silent heterochromatin is found at subtelomeric regions, leading to the telomeric position effect (TPE) in yeast, fly and man. Heterochromatin generally initiates and spreads from defined loci, and diverse mechanisms prevent the ectopic spread of heterochromatin into euchromatin. Here, we overexpressed the silencing factor Sir3 at various levels in yeast, and found that Sir3 spreading into Extended Silent Domains (ESD) eventually reached saturation at subtelomeres. We observed that Sir3 spreading into ESDs covered zone associated with specific histone marks in wild-type cells and stopped at zones of histone mark transitions including H3K79 tri-methylation levels. The conserved enzyme Dot1 deposits H3K79 methylation, and we found that it is essential for viability upon overexpression of Sir3, but not of a spreading-defective mutant Sir3A2Q. These data suggest that H3K79 methylation actively blocks Sir3 spreading. Lastly, our meta-analysis uncovers previously uncharacterized discrete subtelomeric domains associated with specific chromatin features offering a new viewpoint on how to separate subtelomeres from the core chromosome.",

    "abstract": "The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with marked alterations in circulating immune cell populations, but no studies have characterized alterations in these cell types across the full spectrum of lung function impairment in current and former smokers. In 6,299 subjects from the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, we related Coulter blood counts and proportions to cross-sectional FEV1 adjusting for current smoking status. We also related cell count measures to three-year change in FEV1 in ECLIPSE subjects. In a subset of subjects with blood gene expression data, we used cell type deconvolution methods to infer the proportions of immune cell subpopulations, and we related these to COPD clinical status. We observed that FEV1 levels are positively correlated with lymphocytes and negatively correlated with myeloid populations such as neutrophils and monocytes. In multivariate models, absolute cell counts and proportions were associated with cross-sectional FEV1, and lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophil counts were predictive of three-year change in lung function. Using cell type deconvolution to study immune cell subpopulations, we observed that subjects with COPD had a lower proportion of CD4+ resting memory cells and naive B cells compared to non-COPD smokers. Alterations in circulating immune cells in COPD support a mixed pattern of lymphocyte suppression and an enhanced myeloid cell immune response. Cell counts and proportions contribute independent information to models predicting lung function suggesting a critical role for immune response in long-term COPD outcomes. Cell type deconvolution is a promising method for immunophenotyping in large cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Large exome-sequencing datasets offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand the genetic architecture of rare diseases, informing clinical genetics counseling and optimal study designs for disease gene identification. We analyzed 7,448 exome-sequenced families from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study, and, for the first time, estimated the causal contribution of recessive coding variation exome-wide. We found that the proportion of cases attributable to recessive coding variants is surprisingly low in patients of European ancestry, at only 3.6%, versus 50% of cases explained by de novo coding mutations. Surprisingly, we found that, even in European probands with affected siblings, recessive coding variants are only likely to explain ~12% of cases. In contrast, they account for 31% of probands with Pakistani ancestry due to elevated autozygosity. We tested every gene for an excess of damaging homozygous or compound heterozygous genotypes and found three genes that passed stringent Bonferroni correction: EIF3F, KDM5B, and THOC6. EIF3F is a novel disease gene, and KDM5B has previously been reported as a dominant disease gene. KDM5B appears to follow a complex mode of inheritance, in which heterozygous loss-of-function variants (LoFs) show incomplete penetrance and biallelic LoFs are fully penetrant. Our results suggest that a large proportion of undiagnosed developmental disorders remain to be explained by other factors, such as noncoding variants and polygenic risk.",

R. irregularis has only ten or eleven copies of complete 45S rDNAs, whereas the general eukaryotic genome has tens to thousands of rDNA copies. R. irregularis rDNAs are highly heterogeneous and lack a tandem repeat structure. These findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that rDNA heterogeneity depends on the lack of tandem repeat structures. RNA-Seq analysis confirmed that all rDNA variants are actively transcribed. Observed rDNA/rRNA polymorphisms may modulate translation by using different ribosomes depending on biotic and abiotic interactions. The non-tandem repeat structure and intragenomic heterogeneity of AMF rDNA/rRNA may facilitate adaptation to a various environmental condition including the broad host range.",

    "abstract": "The multilingual brain must implement mechanisms that serve to select the appropriate language as a function of the communicative environment. Engaging these mechanisms on a regular basis appears to have consequences for brain structure and function. Studies have implicated the caudate nuclei as important nodes in polyglot language control processes, and have also shown structural differences in the caudate nuclei in bilingual compared to monolingual populations. However, the majority of published work has focused on the categorical differences between monolingual and bilingual individuals, and little is known about whether these findings extend to multilingual individuals, who have even greater language control demands. In the present paper, we present an analysis of the volume and morphology of the caudate nuclei in 75 multilingual individuals who speak three or more languages. Volumetric analyses revealed a significant relationship between multilingual experience and right caudate volume, as well as a marginally-significant relationship with left caudate volume. Vertexwise analyses revealed a significant enlargement of dorsal and anterior portions of the left caudate nucleus having connectivity to executive brain regions, as a function of multilingual expertise. These results suggest that multilingual expertise might exercise a continuous impact on the brain, and that as additional languages beyond a second are acquired, the additional demands for control result in modifications to brain structures associated with language management processes.",

We tested the hypothesis that the altered behavior of hosts due to parasitic manipulation is also subject to selection imposed by changes in environmental conditions over time. Our model system is ants manipulated by parasitic fungi to bite onto vegetation. We analyzed the correlation between forest type (tropical vs. temperate) and biting substrate (leaf vs. twigs), the time required for the fungi to reach reproductive maturity, and the phylogenetic relationship among specimens from tropical and temperate forests in different parts of the globe. We show that the fungal development in temperate forest is longer than the period of time leaves are present and the ants are manipulated to bite twigs. When biting twigs, 90% of the we examined dead ants had their legs wrapped around twigs, which appears to provide better attachment to the plant. Ancestral state character reconstruction suggests that the leaf biting is the ancestral trait and that twig biting is a convergent trait in temperate regions of the globe. These three lines of evidence suggest that changes in environmental conditions have shaped the manipulative behavior of the host by its parasite.",

    "abstract": "We show that nucleosomes can efficiently control the relative search times spent by transcription factors (TFs) on one- (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) diffusion routes towards locating their cognate sites on DNA. Our theoretical results suggest that the roadblock effects of nucleosomes are dependent on the relative position on DNA with respect to TFs and their cognate sites. Especially, nucleosomes exert maximum amount of hindrance to the 1D diffusion dynamics of TFs when they are positioned in between TFs and their cognate sites. The effective 1D diffusion coefficient ({chi}TF) associated with the dynamics of TFs in the presence of nucleosome decreases with the free energy barrier ({micro}) associated the sliding dynamics of nucleosomes as [Formula]. Subsequently the mean first passage time ({eta}L) that is required by TFs to scan L number of binding sites on DNA via 1D diffusion increases with  as [Formula]. When TFs move close to nucleosomes then they exhibit a typical sub-diffusive dynamics. Nucleosomes can enhance the search dynamics of TFs when TFs present in between nucleosomes and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). The level of enhancement effects of nucleosomes seems to be much lesser than the level of retardation effects when nucleosomes present in between TFs and their cognate sites. These results suggest that nucleosome depleted regions around the cognate sites of TFs is mandatory for an efficient site-specific interactions of TFs with DNA. Remarkably the genome wide positioning pattern of TFs shows maximum at their specific binding sites and the positioning pattern of nucleosome shows minimum at the specific binding sites of TFs under in vivo conditions. This seems to be a consequence of increasing level of breathing dynamics of nucleosome cores and decreasing levels of fluctuations in the DNA binding domains of TFs as they move across TFBS. Since the extent of breathing dynamics of nucleosomes and fluctuations in the DBDs of TFs are directly linked with their respective 1D diffusion coefficients, the dynamics of TFs becomes slow as they approach their cognate sites so that TFs form tight site-specific complex. Whereas the dynamics of nucleosomes becomes rapid so that they pass through the cognate sites of TFs. Several in vivo datasets on genome wide positioning pattern of nucleosomes as well as TFs seem to agree well with our arguments. We further show that the condensed conformational state of DNA can significantly decrease the retarding effects of nucleosome roadblocks. The retarding effects of nucleosomes on the 1D diffusion dynamics of TFs can be nullified when the degree of condensation of the genomic DNA is such that it can permit a jump size associated with the dynamics of TFs beyond k > 150 bps.",

To our knowledge this is the first study documenting such a comprehensive diversity of multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli in wastewater. The genomic diversity of the isolates was unexpectedly high and contained a high number of resistance and virulence genes. To illustrate the genomic diversity of the isolates we calculated the pan genome of the wastewater Escherichia coli and found it to contain over sixteen thousand genes. To analyse this diverse dataset, we devised a computational approach correlating genotypic variation and resistance phenotype, this way we were able to identify not only known, but also candidate resistance genes. Finally, we could verify that the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant will contain multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli belonging to clinically important clonal groups.",

Body size is a key trait central to many life history traits and behaviours. While behaviours are typically assumed to be highly plastic, size correlations may impose constraints on their adaptive value when size itself is subject to environmental changes.\\nC_LIO_LIUrbanization is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear.\\nC_LIO_LIUsing web-building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size, and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we disentangle direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity at two spatial scales.\\nC_LIO_LISpiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes. Spiders thus altered different components of their web-building behaviours independently in response to urbanization: mesh width and web surface decreased independently with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. These responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that responses in typically size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximisation in novel environments. The spatial scale of the behavioural responses to urbanization suggest contributions of both genetic adaptation and plasticity. Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, Araneus diadematus abundances were remarkably similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Effective use of semantic knowledge requires a set of conceptual representations and control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of this knowledge are retrieved and selected. It is well-established that levels of semantic knowledge increase across the lifespan. However, the effects of ageing on semantic control processes have not been assessed. I addressed this issue by comparing the performance profiles of young and older people on a verbal comprehension test. Two sets of variables were used to predict accuracy and RT in each group: (a) the psycholinguistic properties of words probed in each trial, (b) the performance on each trial by two groups of semantically-impaired neuropsychological patients. Young people demonstrated poor performance for low frequency and abstract words, suggesting that they had difficulty processing words with intrinsically weak semantic representations. Indeed, performance in this group was strongly predicted by the performance of patients with semantic dementia, who suffer from degradation of semantic knowledge. In contrast, older adults performed poorly on trials where the target semantic relationship was weak and distractor relationships strong - conditions which require high levels of controlled processing. Their performance was not predicted by the performance of semantic dementia patients, but was predicted by the performance of patients with semantic control deficits. These findings indicate that the effects of ageing on semantic cognition are more complex than has previously been assumed. While older people have larger stores of knowledge than young people, they appear to be less skilled at exercising control over the activation of this knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Cellular development has traditionally been described as a series of transitions between discrete cell states, such as the sequence of double negative, double positive and single positive stages in T-cell development. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of development, in which cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories. A cells state along such a trajectory can be captured with pseudotemporal ordering, which however is not able to predict development of the system in real time. We present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that integrates time-series and genetic knock-out information with such transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze the real-time evolution of the system. Pseudodynamics models the distribution of a cell population across a continuous cell state coordinate over time based on a stochastic differential equation along developmental trajectories and random switching between trajectories in branching regions. To illustrate feasibility, we use pseudodynamics to estimate cell-state-dependent growth and differentiation of thymic T-cell development. The model approximates a developmental potential function (Waddingtons landscape) and suggests that thymic T-cell development is biphasic and not strictly deterministic before beta-selection. Pseudodynamics generalizes classical discrete population models to continuous states and thus opens possibilities such as probabilistic model selection to single cell genomics.",

Yet, our knowledge about their biology is for the most part limited to the minority that has been successfully cultured. Molecular techniques now allow for obtaining genome sequences of uncultivated prokaryotic taxa, facilitating in-depth analyses that may ultimately improve our understanding of these key organisms.\\n\\nResultsWe compared results from two culture-independent strategies for recovering bacterial genomes: single-amplified genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes. Single-amplified genomes were obtained from samples collected at an offshore station in the Baltic Sea Proper and compared to previously obtained metagenome-assembled genomes from a time series at the same station. Among 16 single-amplified genomes analyzed, seven were found to match metagenome-assembled genomes, affiliated with a diverse set of taxa. Notably, genome pairs between the two approaches were nearly identical (>98.7% identity) across overlapping regions (30-80% of each genome). Within matching pairs, the single-amplified genomes were consistently smaller and less complete, whereas the genetic functional profiles were maintained. For the metagenome-assembled genomes, only on average 3.6% of the bases were estimated to be missing from the genomes due to wrongly binned contigs; the metagenome assembly was found to cause incompleteness to a higher degree than the binning procedure.\\n\\nConclusionsThe strong agreement between the single-amplified and metagenome-assembled genomes emphasizes that both methods generate accurate genome information from uncultivated bacteria.

With statistical validations from phenotype-genotype associations and interactome networks, we demonstrate that NCD improves disease specificity owing to its overlapping categories and polyhierarchical structure.

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome annotation is of key importance in many research questions. The identification of protein-coding genes is often based on transcriptome sequencing data, ab-initio or homology-based prediction. Recently, it was demonstrated that intron position conservation improves homology-based gene prediction, and that experimental data improves ab-initio gene prediction.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present an extension of the gene prediction tool GeMoMa that utilizes amino acid sequence conservation, intron position conservation and optionally RNA-seq data for homology-based gene prediction. We show on published benchmark data for plants, animals and fungi that GeMoMa performs better than the gene prediction programs BRAKER1, MAKER2, and CodingQuarry, and purely RNA-seq-based pipelines for transcript identification. In addition, we demonstrate that using multiple reference organisms may help to further improve the performance of GeMoMa. Finally, we apply GeMoMa to four nematode species and to the recently published barley reference genome indicating that current annotations of protein-coding genes may be refined using GeMoMa predictions.\\n\\nAvailabilityGeMoMa has been published under GNU GPL3 and is freely available at http://www.jstacs.de/index.php/GeMoMa.\\n\\nContactjens.keilwagen@julius-kuehn.de",

    "abstract": "Scratch assays are routinely used to study the collective spreading of cell populations. In general, the rate at which a population of cells spreads is driven by the combined effects of cell migration and proliferation. To examine the effects of cell migration separately from the effects of cell proliferation, scratch assays are often performed after treating the cells with a drug that inhibits proliferation. Mitomycin-C is a drug that is commonly used to suppress cell proliferation in this context. However, in addition to suppressing cell proliferation, Mitomycin-C also causes cells to change size during the experiment, as each cell in the population approximately doubles in size as a result of treatment. Therefore, to describe a scratch assay that incorporates the effects of cell-to-cell crowding, cell-to-cell adhesion, and dynamic changes in cell size, we present a new stochastic model that incorporates these mechanisms. Our agent-based stochastic model takes the form of a system of Langevin equations that is the system of stochastic differential equations governing the evolution of the population of agents. We incorporate a time-dependent interaction force that is used to mimic the dynamic increase in size of the agents. To provide a mathematical description of the average behaviour of the stochastic model we present continuum limit descriptions using both a standard mean-field approximation, and a more sophisticated moment dynamics approximation that accounts for the density of agents and density of pairs of agents in the stochastic model. Comparing the accuracy of the two continuum descriptions for a typical scratch assay geometry shows that the incorporation of agent growth in the system is associated with a decrease in accuracy of the standard mean-field description. In contrast, the moment dynamics description provides a more accurate prediction of the evolution of the scratch assay when the increase in size of individual agents is included in the model.",

    "abstract": "Convergent phenotypic evolution is often caused by recurrent changes at particular nodes in the underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The genes at such evolutionary  hotspots are thought to maximally affect the phenotype with minimal pleiotropic consequences. This has led to the suggestion that if a GRN is understood in sufficient detail, the path of evolution may be predictable. The repeated evolutionary loss of larval trichomes among Drosophila species is caused by the loss of shavenbaby (svb) expression. svb is also required for development of leg trichomes, but the evolutionary gain of trichomes in the  naked valley on T2 femurs in Drosophila melanogaster is caused by the loss of microRNA-92a (miR-92a) expression rather than changes in svb. We compared the expression and function of components between the larval and leg trichome GRNs to investigate why the genetic basis of trichome pattern evolution differs in these developmental contexts. We found key differences between the two networks in both the genes employed, and in the regulation and function of common genes. These differences in the GRNs reveal why mutations in svb are unlikely to contribute to leg trichome evolution and how instead miR-92a represents the key evolutionary switch in this context. Our work shows that variability in GRNs across different developmental contexts, as well as whether a morphological feature is lost versus gained, influence the nodes at which a GRN evolves to cause morphological change. Therefore, our findings have important implications for understanding the pathways and predictability of evolution.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA major goal of biology is to identify the genetic cause of organismal diversity. Convergent evolution of traits is often caused by changes in the same genes - evolutionary  hotspots. shavenbaby is a  hotspot for larval trichome loss in Drosophila, however microRNA-92a underlies the gain of leg trichomes. To understand this difference in the genetics of phenotypic evolution, we compared the expression and function of genes in the underlying regulatory networks. We found that the pathway of evolution is influenced by differences in gene regulatory network architecture in different developmental contexts, as well as by whether a trait is lost or gained. Therefore, hotspots in one context may not readily evolve in a different context. This has important implications for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic change and the predictability of evolution.",

    "abstract": "The RNA world hypothesis relies on the ability of ribonucleic acids to spontaneously acquire complex structures capable of supporting essential biological functions. Multiple sophisticated evolutionary models have been proposed for their emergence, but they often assume specific conditions. In this work we explore a simple and parsimonious scenario describing the emergence of complex molecular structures at the early stages of life. We show that at specific GC-content regimes, an undirected replication model is sufficient to explain the apparition of multi-branched RNA secondary structures - a structural signature of many essential ribozymes. We ran a large scale computational study to map energetically stable structures on complete mutational networks of 50-nucleotide-long RNA sequences. Our results reveal that the sequence landscape with stable structures is enriched with multi-branched structures at a length scale coinciding with the appearance of complex structures in RNA databases. A random replication mechanism preserving a 50% GC-content may suffice to explain a natural enrichment of stable complex structures in populations of functional RNAs. By contrast, an evolutionary mechanism eliciting the most stable folds at each generation appears to help reaching multi-branched structures at highest GC content.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe advancement in automated image based microscopy platforms coupled with high throughput liquid workflows has facilitated the design of large scale screens utilizing multicellular model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic interactions, therapeutic drugs or disease modifiers. However, the analysis of essential genes has lagged behind because lethal or sterile mutations pose a bottleneck for high throughput approaches.\\n\\nResultsIn C. elegans, non-conditional lethal mutations can be maintained in heterozygosis using chromosome balancers, commonly labelled with GFP in the pharynx. Moreover gene-expression is typically monitored by the use of fluorescent reporters marked with the same fluorophore. Therefore, the separation of the different populations of animals at early larval stages represents a challenge. Here, we develop a sorting strategy capable of selecting homozygous mutants carrying a GFP stress reporter from GFP-balanced animals at early larval stages. Because sorting is not completely error-free, we develop an automated high-throughput image-analysis protocol that identifies and discards animals carrying the chromosome balancer. We demonstrate the experimental usefulness of combining sorting of homozygous lethal mutants and automated image-analysis in a functional genomic RNAi screen for genes that genetically interact with mitochondrial prohibitin (PHB). Lack of PHB results in embryonic lethality, while, homozygous PHB deletion mutants develop into sterile adults due to maternal contribution and strongly induce the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). In a chromosome-wide RNAi screen for C. elegans genes having human orthologues, we uncover both, known and new PHB genetic interactors affecting the UPRmt and growth.\\n\\nConclusionsA systematic way to analyse genetic interactions of essential genes in multicellular organisms is lacking. The method presented here allows the study of balanced lethal mutations in a high-throughput manner and can be easily adapted depending on the users requirements. Therefore, it will serve as a useful resource for the C. elegans community for probing new biological aspects of essential nematode genes as well as the generation of more comprehensive genetic networks.",

    "abstract": "Social challenges like territorial intrusions evoke behavioral responses in widely diverging species. Recent work has revealed that evolutionary \\\"toolkits\\\" - genes and modules with lineage-specific variations but deep conservation of function - participate in the behavioral response to social challenge. Here, we develop a multi-species computational-experimental approach to characterize such a toolkit at a systems level. Brain transcriptomic responses to social challenge was probed via RNA-seq profiling in three diverged species - honey bees, mice, and three-spined stickleback fish - following a common methodology, allowing fair comparisons across species. Data were collected from multiple brain regions and multiple time points after social challenge exposure, achieving anatomical and temporal resolution substantially greater than previous work. We developed statistically rigorous analyses equipped to find homologous functional groups among these species at the levels of individual genes, functional and coexpressed gene modules, and transcription factor sub-networks. We identified six orthogroups involved in response to social challenge, including groups represented by mouse genes Npas4 and Nr4a1, as well as common modulation of systems such as transcriptional regulators, ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors, and synaptic proteins. We also identified conserved coexpression modules enriched for mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism and heat shock that constitute the shared neurogenomic response. Our analysis suggests a toolkit wherein nuclear receptors, interacting with chaperones, induce transcriptional changes in mitochondrial activity, neural cytoarchitecture, and synaptic transmission after social challenge. It reveals systems-level mechanisms that have been repeatedly co-opted during evolution of analogous behaviors, thus advancing the genetic toolkit concept beyond individual genes.",

Understanding errors in these assemblies is important for optimising future sequencing and assembly approaches and for comparative genomics.\\n\\nResultsHere we use a Fosill 38 Kb jumping library to assess medium and longer range order of different publicly available wheat genome assemblies. Modifications to the Fosill protocol generated longer Illumina sequences and enabled comprehensive genome coverage. Analyses of two independent BAC based chromosome-scale assemblies, two independent Illumina whole genome shotgun assemblies, and a hybrid long read (PacBio) and short read (Illumina) assembly were carried out. We revealed a variety of discrepancies using Fosill mate-pair mapping and validated several of each class. In addition, Fosill mate-pairs were used to scaffold a whole genome Illumina assembly, leading to a three-fold increase in N50 values.\\n\\nConclusionsOur analyses, using an independent means to validate different wheat genome assemblies, show that whole genome shotgun assemblies are significantly more accurate by all measures compared to BAC-based chromosome scale assemblies. Although current whole genome assemblies are reasonably accurate and useful, additional steps will be needed for the rapid, cost effective and complete sequencing and assembly of wheat genomes.",

    "abstract": "In the small intestine, a cellular niche of diverse accessory cell types supports the rapid generation of mature epithelial cell types through self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs). However, not much is known about interactions between immune cells and ISCs, and it is unclear if and how immune cell dynamics affect eventual ISC fate or the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to identify new mechanisms for ISC-immune cell interactions. Surprisingly, MHC class II (MHCII) is enriched in two distinct subsets of Lgr5+ crypt base columnar ISCs, which are also distinguished by higher proliferation rates. Using co-culture of T cells with intestinal organoids, cytokine stimulations, and in vivo mouse models, we confirm that CD4+ T helper (Th) cells communicate with ISCs and affect their differentiation, in a manner specific to the Th subtypes and their signature cytokines and dependent on MHCII expression by ISCs. Specific inducible knockout of MHCII in intestinal epithelial cells in mice in vivo results in expansion of the ISC pool. Mice lacking T cells have expanded ISC pools, whereas specific depletion of Treg cells in vivo results in substantial reduction of ISC numbers. Our findings show that interactions between Th cells and ISCs mediated via MHCII expressed in intestinal epithelial stem cells help orchestrate tissue-wide responses to external signals.",

    "abstract": "Tissue barrier dysfunction is a poorly defined feature hypothesized to drive chronic human inflammatory disease1,2. The epithelium of the upper respiratory tract represents one such barrier, responsible for separating inhaled agents, such as pathogens and allergens, from the underlying submucosa. Specialized epithelial subsets--including secretory, glandular, and ciliated cells--differentiate from basal progenitors to collectively realize this role3-5. Allergic inflammation in the upper airway barrier can develop from persistent activation of Type 2 immunity (T2I), resulting in the disease spectrum known as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), ranging from rhinitis to severe nasal polyps6-8. Whether recently identified epithelial progenitor subsets, and their differentiation trajectory, contribute to the clinical presentation and barrier dysfunction in T2I-mediated disease in humans remains unexplored3,9,10. Profiling twelve primary human samples spanning the range of clinical severity with the Seq-Well platform11 for massively-parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we report the first single-cell transcriptomes for human respiratory epithelial cell subsets, immune cells, and parenchymal cells (18,036 total cells) from a T2I inflammatory disease, and map key mediators. We find striking differences between non-polyp and polyp tissues within the epithelial compartments of human T2I cellular ecosystems. More specifically, across 10,383 epithelial cells, we identify a global reduction in epithelial diversity in polyps characterized by basal cell hyperplasia, a concomitant decrease in glandular and ciliated cells, and phenotypic shifts in secretory cell function. We validate these findings through flow cytometry, histology, and bulk tissue RNA-seq of an independent cohort. Furthermore, we detect an aberrant basal progenitor differentiation trajectory in polyps, and uncover cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may lock polyp basal cells into an uncommitted state. Overall, our data define severe T2I barrier dysfunction as a reduction in epithelial diversity, characterized by profound functional shifts stemming from basal cell defects, and nominate a cellular mechanism for the persistence and chronicity of severe human respiratory disease.",

    "abstract": "T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies present a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy and numerous bispecific formats have been developed for retargeting cytolytic T cells toward tumor cells. To explore the therapeutic utility of T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1, which is expressed by tumor cells of various hematologic and solid malignancies, we used a bispecific ROR1 x CD3 scFv-Fc format based on a heterodimeric and aglycosylated Fc domain designed for extended circulatory half-life and diminished systemic T-cell activation. A diverse panel of ROR1-targeting scFv derived from immune and naive rabbit antibody repertoires was compared in this bispecific format for target-dependent T-cell recruitment and activation. A ROR1-targeting scFv with a membrane-proximal epitope, R11, revealed potent and selective antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo and emerged as a prime candidate for further preclinical and clinical studies. To elucidate the precise location and engagement of this membrane-proximal epitope, which is conserved between human and mouse ROR1, the three-dimensional structure of scFv R11 in complex with the kringle domain of ROR1 was determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.6-[A] resolution.",

We identified loss-of-function mutations in the open reading frame C11ORF70 in PCD individuals from five distinct families. Transmission electron microscopy analyses and high resolution immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrate that loss-of-function mutations in C11ORF70 cause immotility of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella, respectively, due to loss of axonemal outer (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs), indicating that C11ORF70 is involved in cytoplasmic assembly of dynein arms. Expression analyses of C11ORF70 showed that C11ORF70 is expressed in ciliated respiratory cells and that the expression of C11ORF70 is upregulated during ciliogenesis, similar to other previously described cytoplasmic dynein arm assembly factors. Furthermore, C11ORF70 shows an interaction with cytoplasmic ODA/IDA assembly factor DNAAF2, supporting our hypothesis that C11ORF70 is a novel preassembly factor involved in the pathogenesis of PCD. The identification of a novel genetic defect that causes PCD and male infertility is of great clinical importance as well as for genetic counselling.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeCognitive deficits including impaired working memory are a hallmark feature of schizophrenia. Changes in prefrontal cortex function modulated by dopamine D1 receptors, play a potentially important role in the pathology underlying such deficits. However, pharmacological interventions that selectively engage the D1 receptor are severely restricted for research in humans. The present study is a proof-of-principle for enhancing cognitive performance and associated brain activation via indirect D1 stimulation. Here, we combine the non-selective dopamine agonist L-dopa with the D2-antagonist haloperidol, theoretically producing increased stimulation at the D1 receptor.\\n\\nExperimental ApproachFourteen healthy volunteers received placebo or combined carbidopa (125 mg, 100mg L-dopa) plus haloperidol (2 mg) orally on two separate occasions according to a within-subjects cross-over design. Drug-induced differences in brain activity were assessed during an N-back working memory task in a 3T magnetic resonance imaging environment.\\n\\nKey ResultsDrug treatment was associated with a reduction in activity in a large number of brain areas, most prominently occipital/temporal brain areas during 2-back performance, which may be due to the effects of haloperidol specifically. Drug treatment was also associated with greater functional connectivity within parts of the salience network during all N-back trials.\\n\\nConclusion and ImplicationsThis preliminary study provides initial evidence for combined L-dopa/haloperidol modulation in cognition-related brain areas and networks, which is relevant for the treatment of cognitive impairments in mental illness.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations in gonadal hormones over the course of the menstrual cycle are known to cause functional brain changes and are thought to modulate changes in the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition. Animal research has shown this occurs primarily via the major metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, and its action as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Our study used EEG to record gamma oscillations induced in the visual cortex using stationary and moving gratings. Recordings took place during twenty females' mid-luteal phase when progesterone and oestradiol are highest, and early follicular phase when progesterone and oestradiol are lowest. Significantly higher (~5 Hz) gamma frequency was recorded during the luteal compared to the follicular phase for both stimuli types. Using dynamic causal modelling these changes were linked to stronger self-inhibition of superficial pyramidal cells in the luteal compared to the follicular phase. In addition the connection from inhibitory interneurons to deep pyramidal cells was found to be stronger in the follicular compared to the luteal phase. These findings show that complex functional changes in synaptic microcircuitry occur across the menstrual cycle and that menstrual cycle phase should be taken into consideration when including female participants in research into gamma-band oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Inter-areal functional connectivity (FC), neuronal synchronization in particular, is thought to constitute a key systems-level mechanism for coordination of neuronal processing and communication between brain regions. Evidence to support this hypothesis has been gained largely using invasive electrophysiological approaches. In humans, neuronal activity can be non-invasively recorded only with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), which have been used to assess FC networks with high temporal resolution and whole-scalp coverage. However, even in source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data, signal mixing, or \\\"source leakage\\\", is a significant confounder for FC analyses and network localization.\\n\\nSignal mixing leads to two distinct kinds of false-positive observations: artificial interactions (AI) caused directly by mixing and spurious interactions (SI) arising indirectly from the spread of signals from true interacting sources to nearby false loci. To date, several interaction metrics have been developed to solve the AI problem, but the SI problem has remained largely intractable in MEG/EEG all-to-all source connectivity studies. Here, we advance a novel approach for correcting SIs in FC analyses using source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data.\\n\\nOur approach is to bundle observed FC connections into hyperedges by their adjacency in signal mixing. Using realistic simulations, we show here that bundling yields hyperedges with good separability of true positives and little loss in the true positive rate. Hyperedge bundling thus significantly decreases graph noise by minimizing the false-positive to true-positive ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of edge bundling in the visualization of large-scale cortical networks with real MEG data. We propose that hypergraphs yielded by bundling represent well the set of true cortical interactions that are detectable and dissociable in MEG/EEG connectivity analysis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIA true interaction often is \\\"ghosted\\\" into a multitude of spurious edges (SI)\\nC_LIO_LIEffective in controlling and illustrating SI\\nC_LIO_LIHyperedges have much improved TPR and graph quality\\nC_LIO_LIAdvantages in visualizing connectivity\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recently, approaches that estimate species divergence times using fossil taxa and models of morphological evolution have exploded in popularity. These methods incorporate diverse biological and geological information to inform posterior reconstructions, and have been applied to several high-profile clades to positive effect. However, there are important examples where morphological data are misleading, resulting in unrealistic age estimates. While several studies have demonstrated that these approaches can be robust and internally consistent, the causes and limitations of these patterns remain unclear. In this study, we dissect signal in Bayesian dating analyses of three mammalian clades. For two of the three examples, we find that morphological characters provide little information regarding divergence times as compared to geological range information, with posterior estimates largely recapitulating those recovered under the prior. However, in the cetacean dataset, we find that morphological data do appreciably inform posterior divergence time estimates. We supplement these empirical analyses with a set of simulations designed to explore the efficiency and limitations of binary and 3-state character data in reconstructing node ages. Our results demonstrate areas of both strength and weakness for morphological clock analyses, and help to outline conditions under which they perform best and, conversely, when they should be eschewed in favour of purely geological approaches.",

These adhesins are O-glycosylated by several cytosolic glycosyltransferases and require three accessory Sec proteins (Asp1-3) for export, but how the adhesins are processed for secretion is not well defined. Here, we show that O-glycosylation of S. gordonii adhesin GspB occurs in a sequential manner by three enzymes (GtfA/B, Nss, Gly) that attach N-acetylglucosamine and glucose to Ser/Thr residues. The modified substrate is subsequently transferred from the last glycosyltransferase to the Asp1/2/3 complex. Crystal structures show that both Asp1 and Asp3 are related to carbohydrate binding proteins. Asp1 also has an affinity for phospholipids, which is attenuated by Asp2. These results suggest a mechanism for the modification of adhesin in the cytosol and its subsequent targeting to the export machinery.",

To address this need to integrate more complex biomaterials design with high-throughput screening approaches, we present several methods to fabricate synthetic biomaterials in 96-well plates and demonstrate that they can be adapted to semi-automated liquid handling robotics. These platforms include 1) glass bottom plates with covalently attached ECM proteins, and 2) hydrogels with tunable stiffness and protein composition with either cells seeded on the surface, or 3) laden within the three-dimensional hydrogel matrix. This study includes proof-of-concept results demonstrating control over breast cancer cell line phenotypes via these ECM cues in a semi-automated fashion.

We show that the RDP naive Bayesian classifier can assign the same number of queries 19 times faster than the popular BLAST top hit method and reduce the false positive rate by two-thirds. As reference databases become more representative of current species diversity, confidence in taxonomic assignments should continue to improve.

    "abstract": "Many tools have been developed to visualize phylogenetic trees, which is a traditional technique for evolutionary tree analysis. However, due to the unique characteristics of antibody lineage trees, the phylogenetic method cannot adequately construct proper tree structures for antibody lineages, and many other tools have been developed to address this problem. However, there still lacks of an adequate tool to visualize the resulted antibody lineage structures that are more complicated than phylogenetic trees. In addition, high-throughput sequencing-based antibody repertoire profiling enables the counting of the number of transcripts associated with individual antibody sequences, thus more dimensions need to be encoded in the tree structure visualization. Further, users may wish to manually adjust the tree structure for a special context. When doing so, they may wish to maintain some biological constraints that are applicable in antibody lineage tree structure, such as isotype switching constraints or different sampling constraints. Here, we report an interactive visualization tool (COLT-Viz) designed to display the number of RNA copies, number of somatic hypermutations, and sample collection time associated with each antibody sequence as well as the distance to neighboring sequences for each antibody sequence in the lineage. COLT-Viz also allows users to interactively visualize and edit antibody lineage structures while giving users the option to automatically check biological constraints on the edited structures to ensure accuracy. COLT-Viz takes JSON text format as input files and can easily be used to visualize networks with or without the biological constraints. We believe the amount of information that can be displayed for complex antibody lineages, the interactive interface, and the option of checking for biological constraints make COLT-Viz a versatile tool for antibody lineage tree visualization that will guide further biological discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Syntaxins are a family of membrane-anchored SNARE proteins that are essential components required for membrane fusion in all eukaryotic intracellular membrane trafficking pathways. Syntaxins contain an N-terminal regulatory domain, termed the Habc domain, that is not highly conserved at the primary sequence level but folds into a three-helix bundle that is structurally conserved among family members. The syntaxin Habc domain has previously been found to be structurally very similar to the GAT domain present in GGA family members and related proteins that are otherwise completely unrelated to syntaxins. Because the GAT domain has been found to be a ubiquitin binding domain we hypothesized that the Habc domain of syntaxins may also bind to ubiquitin. Here, we report that the Habc domain of syntaxin 3 (Stx3) indeed binds to monomeric ubiquitin with low affinity. This domain binds efficiently to K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains within a narrow range of chain lengths but not to K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. Other syntaxin family members also bind to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains but with different chain length specificities. Molecular modeling suggests that residues of the GGA3-GAT domain known to be important for ionic and hydrophobic interactions with ubiquitin have equivalent, conserved residues within the Habc domain of Stx3. We conclude that the syntaxin Habc domain and the GAT domain are both structurally and functionally related, and likely share a common ancestry despite sequence divergence. Binding of K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains to the Habc domain may regulate the function of syntaxins in membrane fusion or may suggest additional functions of this protein family.",

    "abstract": "Recent declines in global biodiversity emphasize that understanding the factors that determine extinction risk should be a priority for ecologists and conservation biologists. A key question is whether extinctions are nonrandom and selective, in which case knowledge of selectivity may help predict and prevent future extinction. We suggest, however, that a premature focus on the identification of selective, trait-based determinants of extinctions risk is problematic if the potential importance of stochastic extinction processes are not first considered. Within this context we aimed to determine the roles that stochastic extinction and species abundance play in extinction risk by applying a rarefaction-based null model approach to analyzing biodiversity declines and extinctions in an experimental system. We focused on aquatic macroinvertebrate declines and extinction caused by predation by fish (Lepomis cyanellus) in semi-natural freshwater mesocosms. We found that null-predicted local extirpations based on the random loss of individuals were a significant predictor of observed local extirpations, and that the majority of observed extinctions were consistent with stochastic mechanisms of extinction, as predicted by a rarefaction model. We were able to identify a number of selective extinctions that were not predicted by the rarefaction model, and while these were relatively rare, they contributed to greater-than-expected loss of diversity at both local (mesocosm) and regional (whole experiment) spatial scales. Our results confirm that species abundance and occupancy are among the most important factors in identifying extinction risk in response to a disturbance. Moreover, owing to our use of a stochastic null model, we also conclude that measures of abundance are important indicators of extinction probability because they are operated on by the random loss of individuals, suggesting that stochastic extinction is an important process in this system and in biodiversity loss in general.",

Of particular importance is the interplay between reproduction and the dynamics of starvation and recovery. To elucidate this interplay, we introduce a nutritional state-structured model that incorporates two classes of consumer: nutritionally replete, reproducing consumers, and undernourished, non-reproducing consumers. We obtain strong constraints on starvation and recovery rates by deriving allometric scaling relationships and find that population dynamics are typically driven to a steady state. Moreover, these rates fall within a  refuge in parameter space, where the probability of population extinction is minimized. We also show that our model provides a natural framework to predict maximum mammalian body size by determining the relative stability of an otherwise homogeneous population to a competing population with altered percent body fat. This framework provides a principled mechanism for a selective driver of Copes rule.",

While Mendelian diseases are predominantly caused by rare alleles, their cumulative contribution to complex phenotypes remains largely unknown. We develop and rigorously validate an approach to jointly estimate the contribution of all alleles, including singletons, to phenotypic variation. We apply our approach to transcriptional regulation, an intermediate between genetic variation and complex disease. Using whole genome DNA and lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data from 360 European individuals, we conservatively estimate that singletons contribute ~25% of cis-heritability across genes (dwarfing the contributions of other frequencies). Strikingly, the majority (~76%) of singleton heritability derives from ultra-rare variants absent from thousands of additional samples. We develop a novel inference procedure to demonstrate that our results are consistent with rampant purifying selection shaping the regulatory architecture of most human genes.",

In socially monogamous birds, old males are most likely to sire extra-pair offspring. The male manipulation and female choice hypotheses predict that age-specific male mating behaviour could explain this old-over-young male advantage. These hypotheses have been difficult to test because copulations and the individuals involved are hard to observe. Here, we studied the mating behaviour and pairing contexts of captive house sparrows, Passer domesticus. Our set-up mimicked the complex social environment experienced by wild house sparrows. We found that middle-aged males, that would be considered old in natural populations, gained most extra-pair paternity. However, both female solicitation behaviour and subsequent extra-pair matings were unrelated to male age. Further, copulations were more likely when solicited by females than those initiated by males (i.e. unsolicited copulations), and unsolicited within-pair copulations were more common than unsolicited extrapair copulations. To conclude, our results did not support either hypotheses regarding age-specific male mating behaviour. Instead, female choice, independent of male age, governed copulation success, especially in an extra-pair context and post-copulatory mechanisms might determine why older males sire more extra-pair offspring.",

To overcome these limitations, we develop Causal Multivariate Mediation within Extended Linkage disequilibrium (CaMMEL), a novel Bayesian inference framework to jointly model multiple mediated and unmediated effects relying only on summary statistics. We show in simulation that CaMMEL accurately distinguishes between mediating and pleiotropic genes unlike existing methods. We applied CaMMEL to Alzheimers disease (AD) and found 206 causal genes in sub-threshold loci (p < 10-4).

    "abstract": "The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway is a cellular quality control and post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanism and is essential for viability in most multicellular organisms. A complex of proteins has been identified to be required for NMD function to occur, however the individual contribution of each of these factors to the NMD process is not well understood. Central to the NMD process are two proteins Upf1 (SMG-2) and Upf2 (SMG-3), which are found in all eukaryotes and are absolutely required for NMD in all organisms in which it has been examined. The other known NMD factors, Smg1, Smg5, Smg6, and Smg7 are more variable in their presence in different orders of organisms, and are thought to have a more regulatory role. Here we present the first genetic analysis of the NMD factor Smg5 in Drosophila. Surprisingly, we find that unlike the other analyzed Smg genes in this organism, Smg5 is essential for NMD activity. We found this is due at least in part to a role for Smg5 in the activity of two separable NMD-target decay mechanisms: endonucleolytic cleavage and 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic decay. Redundancy between these degradation pathways explains why some Drosophila NMD genes are not required for all NMD-pathway activity. We also found that while the NMD component Smg1 has only a minimal role in Drosophila NMD during normal conditions, it becomes essential when NMD activity is compromised by partial loss of Smg5 function. Our findings suggest that not all NMD complex components are required for NMD function at all times, but instead are utilized in a context dependent manner in vivo.",

However, there is currently no model that can quantitatively predict the neoantigenic effect of any given somatic mutation. Here, we examined signatures of immune selection pressure on the distribution of somatic mutations. We quantified the extent to which somatic mutations are significantly depleted in peptides that are predicted to be displayed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins. We characterized the dependence of this depletion on expression level. We then examined whether immune selection pressure on somatic mutations changes depending on whether the patient had either one or two MHC-encoding alleles that can display the peptide. Our results indicate that MHC-encoding alleles are, in general, incompletely dominant, i.e., that having two copies of the display-enabling allele is more effective in displaying that peptide than having just one copy. More generally, a quantitative understanding of counter-selection of identifiable subclasses of neoantigenic somatic variation could guide immunotherapy or aid in developing personalized cancer vaccines.",

Advances in sequencing technology enable the IonTorrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) to cover the full-length of IG mRNA transcripts. Nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) are the dominant errors of the PGM sequencing platform and can critically influence IG repertoire assessments. Here, we present a PGM-tailored IG repertoire sequencing approach combining error correction through unique molecular identifier (UID) barcoding and indel detection through ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT), the most commonly used sequence alignment database for IG sequences. Using artificially falsified sequences for benchmarking, we found that IMGT efficiently detects 98% of the introduced indels through gene-segment frameshifts. Undetected indels are either located at the ends of the sequences or produce masked frameshifts with an insertion and deletion in close proximity. IMGTs indel correction algorithm resolves up to 87% of the tested insertions, but no deletions. The complementary determining regions 3 (CDR3s) are returned 100% correct for up to 3 insertions or 3 deletions through conservative culling. We further show, that our PGM-tailored unique molecular identifiers results in highly accurate HTS datasets if combined with the presented data processing. In this regard, considering sequences with at least two copies from datasets with UID families of minimum 3 reads result in correct sequences with over 99% confidence.

    "abstract": "It is important to accurately regulate the expression of genes involved in development and environmental response. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, meiotic genes are tightly repressed during vegetative growth. Despite being embedded in heterochromatin these genes are transcribed and believed to be repressed primarily at the level of RNA. However, the mechanism of facultative heterochromatin formation and the interplay with transcription regulation is not understood. We show genome-wide that HDAC-dependent histone deacetylation is a major determinant in transcriptional silencing of facultative heterochromatin domains. Indeed, mutation of class I/II HDACs leads to increased transcription of meiotic genes and accumulation of their mRNAs. Mechanistic dissection of the pho1 gene where, in response to phosphate, transient facultative heterochromatin is established by overlapping lncRNA transcription shows that the Clr3 HDAC contributes to silencing independently of SHREC, but in an lncRNA-dependent manner. We propose that HDACs promote facultative heterochromatin by establishing alternative transcriptional silencing.",

Whereas the laminar arrangements of AAC dendrites reflect differential recruitment by input streams, the laminar distribution and local geometry of AAC axons enable differential innervation of PyN ensembles. Therefore, interneuron types likely consist of fine-grained subtypes with distinct input-output connectivity patterns.",

It supports three classes of differential equations commonly used in computational neuroscience: Ordinary Differential Equations, Delay Differential Equations and Stochastic Differential Equations. The design of the graphical interface fosters intuitive exploration of the dynamics, yet there is no barrier to scripting large-scale simulations and parameter explorations. System variables and parameters may range in size from simple scalars to large vectors or matrices. The toolbox is intended for dynamical models in computational neuroscience but it can be applied to continuous dynamical systems from any domain.",

    "abstract": "A major problem in psychology and physiology experiments is drowsiness: around a third of participants show decreased wakefulness despite being instructed to stay alert. In some non-visual experiments participants keep their eyes closed throughout the task, thus promoting the occurrence of such periods of varying alertness. These wakefulness changes contribute to systematic noise in data and measures of interest. To account for this omnipresent problem in data acquisition we defined criteria and code to allow researchers to detect and control for varying alertness in electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. We first revise a visual-scoring method developed for detection and characterization of the sleep-onset process, and adapt the same for detection of alertness levels. Furthermore, we show the major issues preventing the practical use of this method, and overcome these issues by developing an automated method based on frequency and sleep graphoelements, which is capable of detecting micro variations in alertness. The validity of the automated method was verified by training and testing the algorithm using a dataset where participants are known to fall asleep. In addition, we tested generalizability by independent validation on another dataset. The methods developed constitute a unique tool to assess micro variations in levels of alertness and control trial-by-trial retrospectively or prospectively in every experiment performed with EEG in cognitive neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Plant and fungal specimens in herbaria are becoming primary resources for investigating how plant phenology and geographic distributions shift with climate change, greatly expanding inferences across spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic dimensions. However, these specimens contain a wealth of additional data--including nutrients, defensive compounds, herbivore damage, disease lesions, and signatures of physiological processes--that capture ecological and evolutionary responses to the Anthropocene but which are less frequently utilized. Here, we outline the diversity of herbarium data, global change topics to which they have been applied, and new hypotheses they could inform. We find that herbarium data have been used extensively to study impacts of climate change and invasive species, but that such data are less commonly used to address other drivers of biodiversity loss, including habitat conversion, pollution, and overexploitation. In addition, we note that fungal specimens are under-explored relative to vascular plants. To facilitate broader application of plant and fungal specimens in global change research, we outline the limitations of these data and modern sampling and statistical tools that may be applied to surmount challenges they present. Using a case study of insect herbivory, we illustrate how novel herbarium data may be employed to test hypotheses for which few data exist, despite potentially large biases. With the goal of positioning herbaria as hubs for global change research, we suggest future research directions and curation priorities.",

    "abstract": "Hox gene transcription factors are important regulators of positional identity along the anterior-posterior axis in bilaterian animals. Cnidarians (e.g. sea anemones, corals and hydroids) are the sister group to the Bilateria and possess genes related to both anterior and central/posterior class Hox genes. In the absence of a conserved set of Hox genes among other early branching animal clades, cnidarians provide the best opportunity to learn about the emergence of this gene family. We report a previously unrecognized domain of Hox expression in the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, beginning at early blastula stages. Functional perturbation reveals that two Hox genes not only regulate their respective expression domains, but interact with one another to pattern the entire oral-aboral axis mediated by Wnt signaling. This suggests an ancient link between Hox/Wnt patterning of the oral-aboral axis and suggest that these domains are likely established during blastula formation in anthozoan cnidarians.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, lysosomes are distributed in the cytoplasm as individual membrane-bound compartments to degrade macromolecules and to control cellular metabolism. A fundamental yet unanswered question is whether and, if so, how individual lysosomes are spatially organized so that their functions can be coordinated and integrated to meet changing needs of cells. To address this question, we analyze their collective behavior in cultured cells using spatial statistical techniques. We find that in single cells, lysosomes maintain nonrandom, stable, yet distinct spatial distributions, which are mediated by the coordinated effects of the cytoskeleton and lysosomal biogenesis on different lysosomal subpopulations. Furthermore, we find that throughout the intracellular space, lysosomes form dynamic clusters that substantially increase their interactions with endosomes. Together, our findings reveal the spatial organization of lysosomes at the whole-cell scale and provide new insights into how organelle interactions are mediated and regulated over the entire intracellular space.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LILysosomes maintain stable yet distinct spatial distributions in single cells\\nC_LIO_LIThe cytoskeleton and lysosomal biogenesis mediate stable lysosomal distributions\\nC_LIO_LILysosomes form dynamic clusters that promote their interactions with endosomes\\nC_LIO_LITwo subpopulations of lysosomes jointly mediate formation of lysosomal clusters\\nC_LI\\n\\neTOC BlurbLysosomes are spatially organized at the whole-cell scale and form dynamic clusters that promote their interactions with endosomes.",
