    "abstract": "The use of the journal impact factor (JIF) as a measure for the quality of individual manuscripts and the merits of scientists has faced significant criticism in recent years. We add to the current criticism in arguing that such an application of the JIF in policy and decision making in academia is based on false beliefs and unwarranted inferences. To approach the problem, we use principles of deductive and inductive reasoning to illustrate the fallacies that are inherent to using journal based metrics for evaluating the work of scientists. In doing so, we elaborate that if we judge scientific quality based on the JIF or other journal based metrics we are either guided by invalid or weak arguments or in fact consider our uncertainty about the quality of the work and not the quality itself.",

    "abstract": "The detection of ancient gene flow between human populations is an important issue in population genetics. A common tool for detecting ancient admixture events is the D-statistic. The D-statistic is based on the hypothesis of a genetic relationship that involves four populations, whose correctness is assessed by evaluating specific coincidences of alleles between the groups.\\n\\nWhen working with high throughput sequencing data calling genotypes accurately is not always possible, therefore the D-statistic currently samples a single base from the reads of one individual per population. This implies ignoring much of the information in the data, an issue especially striking in the case of ancient genomes.\\n\\nWe provide a significant improvement to overcome the problems of the D-statistic by considering all reads from multiple individuals in each population. We also apply type-specific error correction to combat the problems of sequencing errors and show a way to correct for introgression from an external population that is not part of the supposed genetic relationship, and how this leads to an estimate of the admixture rate.\\n\\nWe prove that the D-statistic is approximated by a standard normal. Furthermore we show that our method outperforms the traditional D-statistic in detecting admixtures. The power gain is most pronounced for low/medium sequencing depth (1-10X) and performances are as good as with perfectly called genotypes at a sequencing depth of 2X. We show the reliability of error correction on scenarios with simulated errors and ancient data, and correct for introgression in known scenarios to estimate the admixture rates.",

    "abstract": "The detection and transmission of the temporal quality of intracellular and extracellular signals is an essential cellular mechanism. It remains largely unexplored how cells interpret the duration information of a stimulus. In this paper, through an integrated quantitative and computational approach we demonstrate that crosstalk among multiple TGF-{beta} activated pathways forms a relay from SMAD to GLI1 that initializes and maintains SNAILl expression, respectively. This transaction is smoothed and accelerated by another temporal switch from elevated cytosolic GSK3 enzymatic activity to reduced nuclear GSK3 enzymatic activity. The intertwined network places SNAIL1 as a key integrator of information from TGF-{beta} signaling subsequently distributed through upstream divergent pathways; essentially cells generate a transient or sustained expression of SNAIL1 depending on TGF-{beta} duration. Other signaling pathways may use similar network structure to encode duration information.",

    "abstract": "Trans-translation is a ribosome rescue system that is ubiquitous in bacteria. Small molecules defining a new family of oxadiazole compounds that inhibit trans-translation have been found to have broad-spectrum antibiotic activity. We sought to determine the activity of KKL-35, a potent member of the oxadiazole family, against the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila and other related species that can also cause Legionnaires disease (LD). Consistent with the essential nature of trans-translation in L. pneumophila, KKL-35 inhibits growth of all tested strains at sub-micromolar concentrations. KKL-35 is also active against other LD-causing Legionella species. KKL-35 remains equally active against L. pneumophila mutants that have evolved resistance to macrolides. KKL-35 inhibits multiplication of L. pneumophila in human macrophages at several stages of infection. No resistant mutants could be obtained, even during extended and chronic exposure. Surprisingly, KKL-35 is not synergistic with other ribosome-targeting antibiotics and does not induce the filamentation phenotype observed in cells defective for trans-translation. Importantly, KKL-35 remains active against L. pneumophila mutants expressing an alternate ribosome-rescue system and lacking tmRNA, the essential component of trans-translation. These results indicate that the antibiotic activity of KKL-35 is not related to the specific inhibition of trans-translation and its mode of action remains to be identified. In conclusion, KKL-35 is an effective antibacterial agent against the intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila and with no detectable resistance. However, further studies are needed to better understand its mechanism of action and to assess further the potential of oxadiazoles in treatment.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated rhythmic movements are ubiquitous in animal behavior. In many organisms, chains of neural oscillators underlie the generation of these rhythms. In C. elegans, locomotor wave generation has been poorly understood; in particular, it is unclear where in the circuit rhythms are generated, and whether there exists more than one such generator. We used optogenetic and ablation experiments to probe the nature of rhythm generation in the locomotor circuit. We found that multiple sections of forward locomotor circuitry are capable of independently generating rhythms. By perturbing different components of the motor circuit, we localize the source of secondary rhythms to cholinergic motor neurons in the midbody. Using rhythmic optogenetic perturbation we demonstrate bidirectional entrainment of oscillations between different body regions. These results show that, as in many other vertebrates and invertebrates, the C. elegans motor circuit contains multiple oscillators that coordinate activity to generate behavior.",

    "abstract": "Cells that proliferate within a confined environment build up mechanical compressive stress. For example, mechanical pressure emerges in the naturally space-limited tumor environment. However, little is known about how cells sense and respond to mechanical compression. We developed microfluidic bioreactors to enable the investigation of the effects of compressive stress on the growth of the genetically tractable model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used this system to determine that compressive stress is partly partly sensed through a module consisting of the mucin Msb2, and the cell wall protein Sho1, which act together as a sensor module in one of the two major osmosensing pathways in budding yeast. This signal is transmitted via the MAPKKK kinase Ste11. Thus, we term this mechanosensitive pathway the SMuSh pathway, for Ste11 through Mucin / Sho1 pathway. The SMuSh pathway delays cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and improves cell survival in response to growth-induced pressure. We also found that the Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway contributes to the response to mechanical compressive stress. These latter results are confirmed in complimentary experiments in the accompanying manuscript from Mishra et al. When both the SMuSh and the CWI pathways are deleted, cells fail to adapt to compressive stress and all cells lyse at relatively low pressure when grown in confinement. Thus, we define a network that is essential for cell survival during growth under pressure. We term this new mechanosensory system the SCWISh (Survival through the CWI and SMuSh) network.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGrowth in confined environments leads to the build up of compressive mechanical stresses, which are relevant to diverse fields, from cancer to microbiology. In contrast to tensile stress, little is known about the molecular integration of compressive stresses. In this study, we elucidate the SMuSh pathway, which, together with the Cell Wall Integrity pathway, is essential for viability of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae when growing under mechanical pressure. Pressure-sensing requires the transmembrane mucin, Msb2, which is linked to the actin cortex. Our result raises the intriguing question of whether mucins, widely conserved in eukaryotes and frequently misregulated in cancers, might sense compressive stresses in other organisms, including humans.",

    "abstract": "Delineating species and epidemic lineages in fungal plant pathogens is critical to our understanding of disease emergence and the structure of fungal biodiversity, and also informs international regulatory decisions. Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) is a multi-host pathogen that infects multiple grasses and cereals, is responsible for the most damaging rice disease (rice blast), and of growing concern due to the recent introduction of wheat blast to Bangladesh from South America. However, the genetic structure and evolutionary history of M. oryzae, including the possible existence of cryptic phylogenetic species, remain poorly defined. Here, we use whole-genome sequence information for 76 M. oryzae isolates sampled from 12 grass and cereal genera to infer the population structure of M. oryzae, and to reassess the species status of wheat-infecting populations of the fungus. Species recognition based on genealogical concordance, using published data or extracting previously-used loci from genome assemblies, failed to confirm a prior assignment of wheat blast isolates to a new species (Pyricularia graminis tritici). Inference of population subdivisions revealed multiple divergent lineages within M. oryzae, each preferentially associated with one host genus, suggesting incipient speciation following host shift or host range expansion. Analyses of gene flow, taking into account the possibility of incomplete lineage sorting, revealed that genetic exchanges have contributed to the makeup of multiple lineages within M. oryzae. These findings provide greater understanding of the eco-evolutionary factors that underlie the diversification of M. oryzae and highlight the practicality of genomic data for epidemiological surveillance in this important multi-host pathogen.\\n\\nImportanceInfection of novel hosts is a major route for disease emergence by pathogenic micro-organisms. Understanding the evolutionary history of multi-host pathogens is therefore important to better predict the likely spread and emergence of new diseases. Magnaporthe oryzae is a multi-host fungus that causes serious cereal diseases, including the devastating rice blast disease, and wheat blast, a cause of growing concern due to its recent spread from South America to Asia. Using whole genome analysis of 76 fungal strains from different hosts, we have documented the divergence of M. oryzae into numerous lineages, each infecting a limited number of host species. Our analyses provide evidence that inter-lineage gene flow has contributed to the genetic makeup of multiple M. oryzae lineages within the same species. Plant health surveillance is therefore warranted to safeguard against disease emergence in regions where multiple lineages of the fungus are in contact with one another.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating how wildlife conservation laws are implemented is critical for safeguarding biodiversity. Two agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service (FWS and NMFS; Services collectively), are responsible for implementing the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), which requires federal protection for threatened and endangered species. FWS and NMFS comparable role for terrestrial and marine taxa, respectively, provides the opportunity to examine how implementation of the same law varies between agencies. We analyzed how the Services implement a core component of the ESA, section 7 consultations, by objectively assessing the contents of >120 consultations on sea turtle species against the requirements in the Services consultation handbook, supplemented with in-person observations from Service biologists. Our results showed that NMFS consultations were 1.40 times as likely to have higher completeness scores than FWS consultations given the standard in the handbook. Consultations tiered from an FWS programmatic consultation inherited higher quality scores of generally more thorough programmatic consultations, indicating that programmatic consultations could increase the quality of consultations while improving efficiency. Both agencies commonly neglected to account for the effects of previous consultations and the potential for compounded effects on species. From these results, we recommend actions that can improve quality of consultation, including the use of a single database to track and integrate previously authorized harm in new analyses and the careful but more widespread use of programmatic consultations. Our study reveals several critical shortfalls in the current process of conducting ESA section 7 consultations that the Services could address to better safeguard North Americas most imperiled species.",

Here we reveal the system underlying radial size maintenance of the murine epididymal tubule by combining quantitative imaging, mathematical modeling, and mechanical perturbations. We found that an oriented cell intercalation making the tubule radial size smaller counteracts a cell tension reduction due to neighbor cell division along the tubule circumferential axis. Moreover, we demonstrated that the tubule cells enhance actomyosin constriction driving the cell intercalation in response to mechanical forces anisotropically applied on the cells. Our results suggest that epididymal tubule cells have endogenous systems for responding as active cell movement to mechanical forces exclusively along the circumferential axis, and the anisotropic cellular mechanoresponse spontaneously controls the tubule radial size.",

    "abstract": "Effective cancer treatment is crucially dependent on the identification of the biological processes that drive a tumor. However, multiple processes may be active simultaneously in a tumor. Clustering is inherently unsuitable to this task as it assigns a tumor to a single cluster. In addition, the wide availability of multiple data types per tumor provides the opportunity to profile the processes driving a tumor more comprehensively.\\n\\nHere we introduce Functional Sparse-Factor Analysis (funcSFA) to address these challenges. FuncSFA integrates multiple data types to define a lower dimensional space capturing the relevant variation. A tailor-made module associates biological processes with these factors. FuncSFA is inspired by iCluster, which we improve in several key aspects. First, we increase the convergence efficiency significantly, allowing the analysis of multiple molecular datasets that have not been pre-matched to contain only concordant features. Second, FuncSFA does not assign tumors to discrete clusters, but identifies the dominant driver processes active in each tumor. This is achieved by a regression of the factors on the RNA expression data followed by a functional enrichment analysis and manual curation step.\\n\\nWe apply FuncSFA to the TCGA breast and lung datasets. We identify EMT and Immune processes common to both cancer types. In the breast cancer dataset we recover the known intrinsic subtypes and identify additional processes. These include immune infiltration and EMT, and processes driven by copy number gains on the 8q chromosome arm. In lung cancer we recover the major types (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and processes active in both of these types. These include EMT, two immune processes, and the activity of the NFE2L2 transcription factor.\\n\\nIn summary, FuncSFA is a robust method to perform discovery of key driver processes in a collection of tumors through unsupervised integration of multiple molecular data types and functional annotation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn order to select effective cancer treatment, we need to determine which biological processes are active in a tumor. To this end, tumors have been quantified by high dimensional molecular measurements such as RNA sequencing and DNA copy number profiling. In order to support decision making, these measurements need to be condensed into interpretable summaries. Such summaries can be made interpretable by connecting them to biological processes.\\n\\nBiological process activity is continuous and multiple biological processes are taking place in a single tumor. Therefore, the biological processes associated with a tumor are misrepresented by clustering, which tries to put every tumor in a single cluster. In the method introduced in this paper (funcSFA), molecular measurements are summarized into a small number factors. A factor is a continuous value per tumor that aims to represent the activity of a biological process.\\n\\nWhen applied to breast and lung cancer, funcSFA identifies factors covering well known biology of these tumor types. FuncSFA also finds novel factors covering biology whose importance is not yet widely recognized in these tumor types. Some of the factors suggest treatment opportunities that can be further investigated in cell lines and mice.",

    "abstract": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a therapy for epilepsy and depression. However, its efficacy varies and its mechanism remains unclear. Prior studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activations with VNS in human brains, but have reported inconsistent findings. The source of inconsistency is likely attributable to the complex temporal characteristics of VNS-evoked fMRI responses that cannot be fully explained by simplified response models in the conventional model-based analysis for activation mapping. To address this issue, we acquired 7-Tesla blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI data from anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats receiving electrical stimulation at the left cervical vagus nerve. Using spatially independent component analysis, we identified 20 functional brain networks and detected the network-wise activations with VNS in a data-driven manner. Our results showed that VNS activated 15 out of 20 brain networks, and the activated regions covered >76% of the brain volume. The time course of the evoked response was complex and distinct across regions and networks. In addition, VNS altered the strengths and patterns of correlations among brain networks relative to those in the resting state. The most notable changes in network-network interactions were related to the limbic system. Together, such profound and widespread effects of VNS may underlie its unique potential for a wide range of therapeutics to relieve central or peripheral conditions.",

    "abstract": "Neurophysiological recordings are dominated by arhythmical activity whose spectra can be characterised by power-law functions, and on this basis are often referred to as reflecting scale-free brain dynamics (1/f {beta}). Relatively little is known regarding the neural generators and temporal dynamics of this arhythmical behaviour compared to rhythmical behaviour. Here we used Irregularly Resampled AutoSpectral Analysis (IRASA) to quantify {beta}, in both the high (5-100 Hz, {beta}hf) and low frequency bands (0.1-2.5 Hz, {beta}lf in EEG/MEG/ECoG recordings and to separate arhythmical from oscillatory modes of activity, such as, alpha rhythms. In MEG/EEG/ECoG data, we demonstrate that oscillatory alpha power dynamically correlates over time with {beta}hf and similarly, participants with higher rhythmical alpha power have higher {beta}hf). In a series of MEG investigations using the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine, the glutamatergic AMPA receptor antagonist perampanel, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine and the mixed partial serotonergic agonist LSD we reveal systematic effects of excitation-inhibition balance on both {beta}hf and {beta}lf. Additionally, strong modulations of {beta}hf are seen in monkey ECoG data during general anaesthesia using propofol and ketamine. Surrogate data analysis demonstrates that arhythmical activity is generated by both linear and non-linear schemes, with non-linear effects emerging at critical boundaries. We develop and test a unifying model which can explain, the 1/f nature of electrophysiological spectra, their dynamic interaction with oscillatory rhythms as well as the sensitivity of 1/f activity to excitation-inhibition balance by considering electrophysiological spectra as being generated by a collection of stochastically perturbed damped oscillators having a distribution of relaxation rates.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYIonizing radiation stimulates nuclear accumulation of Abl tyrosine kinase that is required for directly irradiated cells to produce microRNA-34c-containing extracellular vesicles, which transfer the microRNA into non-irradiated cells to induce reactive oxygen species and bystander DNA damage.\\n\\nABSTRACTIonizing radiation (IR) activates an array of DNA damage response (DDR) that includes the induction of bystander effects (BE) in cells not targeted by radiation. How DDR pathways in irradiated cells stimulate BE in non-targeted cells is mostly unknown. We show here that extracellular vesicles from irradiated cells (EV-IR) induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage when internalized by un-irradiated cells. We found that EV-IR from Abl-NLS-mutated cells could not induce ROS or DNA damage, and restoration of nuclear Abl rescued those defects. Expanding a previous finding that Abl stimulates miR-34c expression, we show here that nuclear Abl also drives the vesicular secretion of miR-34c. Ectopic miR-34c expression, without irradiation, generated EV-miR-34c capable of inducing ROS and DNA damage. Furthermore, EV-IR from miR34-knockout cells could not induce ROS and raised {gamma}H2AX to lesser extent than EV-IR from miR34-wild type cells. These results establish a novel role for the Abl-miR-34c DDR pathway in stimulating radiation-induced bystander effects.",

    "abstract": "In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for thousands of phenotypes in large biobanks, most binary traits have substantially fewer cases than controls. Both of the widely used approaches, linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic mixed model, perform poorly - producing large type I error rates - in the analysis of phenotypes with unbalanced case-control ratios. Here we propose a scalable and accurate generalized mixed model association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the distribution of score test statistics. This method, SAIGE, provides accurate p-values even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced. It utilizes state-of-art optimization strategies to reduce computational time and memory cost of generalized mixed model. The computation cost linearly depends on sample size, and hence can be applicable to GWAS for thousands of phenotypes by large biobanks. Through the analysis of UK Biobank data of 408,961 white British European-ancestry samples for >1400 binary phenotypes, we show that SAIGE can efficiently analyze large sample data, controlling for unbalanced case-control ratios and sample relatedness.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a rapid, cost-effective, non-invasive biodiversity monitoring tool which utilises DNA left behind in the environment by organisms for species detection. The method is used as a species specific survey tool for rare or invasive species across a broad range of ecosystems. Recently, eDNA and  metabarcoding have been combined to describe whole communities rather than focusing on single target species. However, whether metabarcoding is as sensitive as targeted approaches for rare species detection remains to be evaluated. The great crested newt Triturus cristatus is a flagship pond species of international conservation concern and the first UK species to be routinely monitored using eDNA. We evaluate whether eDNA metabarcoding has comparable sensitivity to targeted real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cristatus detection. Extracted eDNA samples (N = 532) were screened for T. cristatus by qPCR and analysed for all vertebrate species using High-Throughput Sequencing technology. With qPCR and a detection threshold of 1/12 positive qPCR replicates, newts were detected in 50% of ponds. Detection decreased to 32% when the threshold was increased to 4/12 positive qPCR replicates. With metabarcoding, newts were detected in 34% of ponds without a detection threshold, and in 28% of ponds when a threshold (0.028%) was applied. Therefore, qPCR provided greater detection than metabarcoding but metabarcoding detection with no threshold was equivalent to qPCR with a stringent detection threshold. The proportion of T. cristatus sequences in each sample was positively associated with the number of positive qPCR replicates (qPCR score) suggesting eDNA metabarcoding may be indicative of eDNA concentration. eDNA metabarcoding holds enormous potential for holistic biodiversity assessment and routine freshwater monitoring. We advocate this community approach to freshwater monitoring to guide management and conservation, whereby entire communities can be initially surveyed to best inform use of funding and time for species-specific surveys.",

Multiple sophisticated evolutionary models have been proposed for their emergence, but they often assume specific conditions. In this work we explore a simple and parsimonious scenario describing the emergence of complex molecular structures at the early stages of life. We show that at specific GC-content regimes, an undirected replication model is sufficient to explain the apparition of multi-branched RNA secondary structures - a structural signature of many essential ribozymes. We ran a large scale computational study to map energetically stable structures on complete mutational networks of 50-nucleotide-long RNA sequences. Our results reveal that the sequence landscape with stable structures is enriched with multi-branched structures at a length scale coinciding with the appearance of complex structures in RNA databases. A random replication mechanism preserving a 50% GC-content may suffice to explain a natural enrichment of stable complex structures in populations of functional RNAs. By contrast, an evolutionary mechanism eliciting the most stable folds at each generation appears to help reaching multi-branched structures at highest GC content.",

BURRITO simultaneously visualizes the taxonomic and functional compositions of multiple samples and dynamically highlights relationships between taxa and functions to capture the underlying structure of these data. Users can browse for taxa and functions of interest and interactively explore the share of each function attributed to each taxon across samples. BURRITO supports multiple input formats for taxonomic and metagenomic data, allows adjustment of data granularity, and can export generated visualizations as static publication-ready formatted figures. In this paper, we describe the functionality of BURRITO, and provide illustrative examples of its utility for visualizing various trends in the relationship between the composition of taxa and functions in complex microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Metaproteomics can greatly assist established high-throughput sequencing methodologies to provide systems biological insights into the alterations of microbial protein functionalities correlated with disease-associated dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. Here, we utilized the well-characterized murine T cell transfer model of colitis to find specific changes within the intestinal luminal proteome associated with inflammation. MS proteomic analysis of colonic samples permitted the identification of {bsim}10,000-12,000 unique peptides that corresponded to 5,610 protein clusters identified across three groups, including the colitic Rag1-/- T cell recipients, isogenic Rag1-/- controls, and wild-type mice. We demonstrate that the colitic mice exhibited a significant increase in Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and show that such alterations in the microbial communities contributed to the enrichment of specific proteins with transcription and translation gene ontology terms. In combination with 16S sequencing, our metaproteomics-based microbiome studies provide a foundation for assessing alterations in intestinal luminal protein functionalities in a robust and well-characterized mouse model of colitis, and set the stage for future studies to further explore the functional mechanisms of altered protein functionalities associated with dysbiosis and inflammation.\\n\\nStatement of significance of the studyThe commensal gut microbiota is essential to maintaining health and has a primary role in digestion/metabolism, homeostasis, and protection from pathogenic bacteria. High-throughput sequencing has established Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria as the four major bacterial phyla that comprise the ecological makeup of the intestinal microbiota. However, the tremendous inter-/intra-variability in microbial composition across individuals, as well as along the length of the intestinal tract has made it difficult to definitively ascertain specific bacterial species associated with health or as drivers of disease states, including inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, we expanded upon the current metaproteomics techniques and use the robust and highly reproducible murine T cell transfer model of colitis as well as a comprehensive database of mouse, human, plant, and all microbial genomes sequenced to date to elucidate alterations in both host and gut microbial proteins associated with intestinal inflammation. Our results show that host genetics, gut microbiota, and inflammation have tremendous influences on the intestinal luminal proteomic landscape.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have probed the role of the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm (8 - 12 Hz) in human visual perception through attempts to drive its neural generators. To that end, paradigms have used high-intensity strictly-periodic visual stimulation that created strong predictions about future stimulus occurrences and repeatedly demonstrated perceptual consequences in line with an entrainment of parieto-occipital alpha. Our study, in turn, examined the case of alpha entrainment by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation within theta-(4 - 7 Hz), alpha-(8 - 13 Hz) and beta (14 - 20 Hz) frequency bands, i.e. a class of stimuli that resemble the temporal characteristics of naturally occurring visual input more closely. We have previously reported substantial neural phase-locking in EEG recording during all three stimulation conditions. Here, we studied to what extent this phase-locking reflected an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the same dataset. Specifically, we tested whether quasi-periodic visual stimulation affected several properties of parieto-occipital alpha generators. Speaking against an entrainment of intrinsic alpha rhythms by non-predictive low-intensity quasi-periodic visual stimulation, we found none of these properties to show differences between stimulation frequency bands. In particular, alpha band generators did not show increased sensitivity to alpha band stimulation and Bayesian inference corroborated evidence against an influence of stimulation frequency. Our results set boundary conditions for when and how to expect effects of entrainment of alpha generators and suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha rhythm may be more inert to external influences than previously thought.",

One of the main goals in microbiome analysis is the identification of microbial species that are differentially abundant among groups of samples, or whose abundance is associated with a variable of interest. Most available methods for microbiome abundance testing perform univariate tests for each microbial species or taxa separately, ignoring the compositional nature of microbiome data.\\n\\nWe propose an alternative approach for microbiome abundance testing that consists on the identification of two groups of taxa whose relative abundance, or balance, is associated with the response variable of interest. This approach is appealing, since it has direct translation to the biological concept of ecological balance between species in an ecosystem. In this work, we present selbal, a greedy stepwise algorithm for balance selection. We illustrate the algorithm with 16s abundance data from an HIV-microbiome study and a Crohn-microbiome study.\\n\\nImportanceA more meaningful approach for microbiome abundance testing is presented. Instead of testing each taxon separately we propose to explore abundance balances among groups of taxa. This approach acknowledges the compositional nature of microbiome data.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how drugs are delivered to diseased tissue, and their subsequent spatial and temporal distribution, is a key factor in the development of effective, targeted therapies. However, the interaction between the pathophysiology of diseased tissue and individual therapeutic agents can be complex, and can vary significantly between individuals. In cancer, suboptimal dosing resulting from poor delivery can cause reduced treatment efficacy, upregulation of resistance mechanisms and can even stimulate growth. Preclinical tools to better understand drug delivery are therefore urgently required, which incorporate the inherent variability and heterogeneity of human disease. To meet this need, we have combined multiscale mathematical modelling, high-resolution optical imaging of intact, optically-cleared tumour tissue from animal models, and in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our framework, named REANIMATE (REAlistic Numerical Image-based Modelling of biologicAl Tissue substratEs) allows large tissue samples to be investigated as if it were a living sample, in detailed, highly controlled, computational experiments. Specifically, we show that REANIMATE can be used to predict the heterogeneous delivery of specific therapeutic agents, in disparate two murine xenograft models of human colorectal carcinoma. Given the wide adoption of optical clearing equipment in biomedical research laboratories, REANIMATE enables a new paradigm in cancer drug development, which could also be applied to other disease areas.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is an essential cellular function in all eukaryotes that is driven by a self-assembled macromolecular machine of over 50 different proteins in tens to hundreds of copies. How these proteins are organized to produce endocytic vesicles with high precision and efficiency is not understood. Here, we developed high-throughput superresolution microscopy to reconstruct the nanoscale structural organization of 23 endocytic proteins from over 100,000 endocytic sites in yeast. We found that proteins assemble by radially-ordered recruitment according to function. WASP family proteins form a circular nano-scale template on the membrane to spatially control actin nucleation during vesicle formation. Mathematical modeling of actin polymerization showed that this WASP nano-template creates sufficient force for membrane invagination and substantially increases the efficiency of endocytosis. Such nanoscale pre-patterning of actin nucleation may represent a general design principle for directional force generation in membrane remodeling processes such as during cell migration and division.",

Although individual common polymorphisms have modest predictive capacity, their cumulative impact can be aggregated into a polygenic score.

However, in the present study, we show that in canonical or accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the peptide terminus in some immunodominant peptide-MHCI (pMHCI) complexes can detach from their binding pockets and stretch outside the MHC cleft. These pMHCI complexes include the complex of the H-2Kb and the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) gp33 peptide, and the complex of the HLA-A*0201 and the influenza A virus M1 peptide. The detached peptide terminus becomes the most prominent spot at the pMHC interface, and so can serves as a novel TCR recognition target. Thus, peptide terminus detaching may be a novel mechanism for MHC antigen presentation.",

The viral nucleoprotein (NP) of influenza A virus has been suggested to be a target of MxA. However, the molecular details of the interactions between NP and MxA remain unknown. In the present study, loop L4 of MxA, which was shown to target viral component and is missing in the crystal structure of MxA was modeled on a dimer of the MxA. The dimer was then docked onto NP. The resulting NP-MxA dimer complex is in agreement with previous studies, as the interface contains many residues that were previously identified to be associated with MxA resistance. And the model was the used to construct NP-MxA ring. We also constructed a structural model of the complex of influenza virus NP and polymerase, and the NP residues that interact with MxA in the NP-MxA model partly overlap with those in the NP-polymerase model, so MxA may competitively inhibit the binding of NP and the polymerase and disrupt the assembly of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. These results of this work represent a putative molecular mechanisms for MxA antiviral activity.",

Here, we show the cortical distribution of this abnormal dynamics of adaptation using fast acquisition fMRI. We find that dyslexics faster decay of adaptation is widespread, though the most significant effects are found in the left superior temporal lobe, including the auditory cortex. This broad distribution suggests that dyslexics faster decay of implicit memory is a general characteristic of their cortical dynamics, which also encompasses the sensory cortices.",

    "abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a psychedelic drug with predominantly agonist activity at various serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors. Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, the specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study during which 24 healthy participants received either i) placebo+placebo, ii) placebo+LSD (100 g po), or iii) ketanserin - a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. Here we focus on resting-state fMRI, a measure of spontaneous neural fluctuations that can map functional brain connectivity. We collected resting-state data 75 and 300 minutes after LSD/placebo administration. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a fully data-driven global brain connectivity (GBC) method to comprehensively map LSD neuropharmacological effects. LSD administration caused widespread GBC alterations that followed a specific topography: LSD reduced connectivity in associative areas, but concurrently increased connectivity across sensory and somatomotor areas. The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. We show that whole-brain data-driven spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT2A receptor cortical gene expression in humans, which along with ketanserin effects, strongly implicates the 5-HT2A receptor in LSDs neuropharmacology. Critically, the LSD-induced subjective effects were associated with somatomotor networks GBC changes. These data-driven neuropharmacological results pinpoint the critical role of 5-HT2A in LSDs mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics",

    "abstract": "The extent to which visual inference is shaped by attentional goals is unclear. Voluntary attention may simply modulate the priority with which information is accessed by higher cognitive functions involved in perceptual decision making. Alternatively, voluntary attention may influence fundamental visual processes, such as those involved in segmenting an incoming retinal signal into a structured scene of coherent objects, thereby determining perceptual organisation. Here we tested whether the segmentation and integration of visual form can be determined by an observers goals by exploiting a novel variant of the classical Kanizsa figure. We generated predictions about the influence of attention with a machine classifier, and tested these predictions with a psychophysical response classification technique. Despite seeing the same image on each trial, observers perception of illusory spatial structure depended on their attentional goals. These attention-contingent illusory contours directly conflicted with equally plausible visual form implied by the geometry of the stimulus, revealing that attentional selection can determine the perceived layout of a fragmented scene. Attentional goals, therefore, not only select pre-computed features or regions of space for prioritised processing, but, under certain conditions, also greatly influence perceptual organisation and thus visual appearance.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe extent to which higher cognitive functions can influence perceptual organisation is debated. The role of voluntary spatial attention, the ability to focus on only some parts of a scene, has been particularly controversial among neuroscientists and psychologists who aim to uncover the basic neural computations involved in grouping image features into coherent objects. To address this issue, we repeatedly presented the same novel ambiguous image to observers and changed their attentional goals by having them make fine spatial judgements about only some elements of the image. We found that observers attentional goals determine the perceived organisation of multiple illusory shapes. We thus reveal that voluntary spatial attention can control the fundamental processes that determine perceptual organisation.",

    "abstract": "Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history.\n\nProton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that todays NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.",

The results indicated that concentration 3M NaCl is the optimal concentration of salt, since in this concentration, the highest enhancement in fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll and carotenoids, soluble sugar, glycerol, protein and starch content was observed in comparison with other concentrations. The amount of these metabolites declined in the concentrations under the optimum salinity. The least and highest amounts of MDA were observed at 1 and 4 M NaCl respectively. Polyploidy in optimum concentration of salt, caused further increment of the above growth parameters. In this relation, in most cases, treatment of 0.1% was more effective. The beneficial effects of polyploidy in non-optimal conditions were also found in some parameters such as biomass, chlorophyll, carotenoids, proteins and starch. The activity of antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD and POD were maximum in 4 M NaCl. Polyploidy affected activity of these antioxidant enzymes in some concentrations of salt. Overall, our results suggest that the microalgae have significantly different responses to salt stress based on ploidy level of the algae.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

We identified that increased non-muscle myosin II activation and cellular contraction inhibited Wnt target gene transcription in developing Drosophila. Genetic interactions studies identified this effect was due to myosin-induced accumulation of cortical F-actin resulting in clustering and accumulation of E-cadherin to the adherens junctions. E-cadherin titrates any available {beta}-catenin, the Wnt pathway transcriptional co-activator, to the adherens junctions in order to maintain cell-cell adhesion under contraction. We show that decreased levels of cytoplasmic {beta}-catenin result in insufficient nuclear translocation for full Wnt target gene transcription. Our work elucidates a mechanism in which the dynamic activation of actomyosin contractility refines patterning of Wnt transcription during development and maintenance of epithelial tissue in organisms.",

Here, we have developed a quantitative high-resolution microscopy assay in living yeast cells to visualize and quantify chromatin dynamics using the GAL7-10-1 locus as a model system. Upon transcriptional activation of these three clustered genes, we detect an increase of the mean distance across this locus by >100 nm. This decompaction is linked to active transcription but is not sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A or to deletion of the histone acetyl transferase Gcn5. By contrast, the deletion of SNF2 (encoding the ATPase of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) or the deactivation of the histone chaperone complex FACT lead to a strongly reduced decompaction without significant effects on transcriptional induction. Our findings are consistent with nucleosome remodeling and eviction activities being major contributors to chromatin reorganization during transcription but also suggest that transcription can occur in the absence of detectable decompaction.",

While various adaptation mechanisms for regulating gene expression have been revealed for transcription and translation, the role of splicing and how it evolves to optimize gene-expression patterns has not been thoroughly investigated. To tackle this question, we employed a lab-evolution experimental approach that challenged yeast cells to increase expression levels of a gene that carries an inefficiently-spliced intron. We followed the evolution of multiple lines and found independent routes by which cells adapted. Surprisingly, we did not observe an intron loss event, a mechanism believed to be common in intron evolution. Instead, we identified mutations in cis that improved the introns splicing efficiency and increased the overall expression level of the entire gene. One of these cis-acting mutations occurred in an adjacent exon and hampered the functionality of the gene that was not under selection - demonstrating that adaptation of splicing efficiency may sometimes come at the expense of protein activity. Additionally, we observed adaptations in trans, which increased the cellular availability of the splicing machinery. These adaptations were achieved either by elevated expression levels of the splicing apparatus or, unexpectedly, by reduced expression levels of other intron-containing genes that are the natural consumers of this process. Ultimately, our work reveals novel molecular means by which the splicing machinery is changed by natural selection to optimize gene-expression patterns of cells.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic information can be inherited for multiple generations (termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance or TEI) 1,2. Non-coding RNAs have emerged as important mediators of TEI, although the mechanism(s) by which non-coding RNAs mediate TEI remains poorly understood. dsRNA-mediated gene silencing (RNAi) in C. elegans is a robust example of RNA-directed TEI3-5. To further our understanding of RNA-directed TEI, we conducted a genetic screen in C. elegans to identify genes required for RNAi inheritance. Our screen identified the conserved RNA helicase/Zn finger protein ZNFX-1 and the Argonaute protein WAGO-4. We find that WAGO-4 and ZNFX-1 act cooperatively in inheriting generations to maintain small interfering (si)RNA expression over generational time. ZNFX-1/ WAGO-4 localize to a liquid droplet organelle termed the P granule in early germline blastomeres. Later in development, ZNFX-1/WAGO-4 appear to separate from P granules to form independent foci that are adjacent to, yet remain distinct, from P granules. ZNFX-1/WAGO-4 labeled foci exhibit properties reminiscent of liquid droplets and we name these foci Z granules. In the adult germline, Z granules assemble into ordered tri-droplet assemblages with P granules and another germline droplet-like foci termed the Mutator foci. This work identifies a conserved RNA-binding protein that drives RNA-directed TEI in C. elegans, defines a new germline foci that we term the Z granule, demonstrates that liquid droplet formation is under developmental control, and shows that liquid droplets can assemble into spatially ordered multi-droplet structures. We speculate that temporal and spatial ordering of liquid droplets helps cells organize and coordinate the complex RNA processing pathways underlying gene regulatory systems, such as RNA-directed TEI.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs are a puzzling class of RNAs with covalently closed loop structure, lacking 5 and 3 ends. Present in all cells, no unifying theme has emerged regarding their function. Here, we use transcriptional data obtained by biotagging in zebrafish to uncover a high-resolution cohort of embryonic circRNAs expressed in nuclear and polysomal subcellular compartments in three developmental cell types. The ample presence of embryonic circRNAs on polysomes contradicts previous reports suggesting predominant nuclear localisation. We uncover a novel class of circRNAs, significantly enriched at tandem duplicated genes. Using newly-developed NGS-based approach, we simultaneously resolve the full sequence of putative \\\"tandem-circRNAs\\\" and their underlying mRNAs. These form by long-range cis-splicing events often between distant tandem duplicated genes, resulting in chimaeric mRNA transcripts and circRNAs containing their supernumerary excised exons, integrated from multiple tandem loci. Taken together, our results suggest that circularisation events rather than circRNAs themselves are functionally important.",

    "abstract": "Extraction of particles from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micrographs is a crucial step in processing single-particle datasets. Although algorithms have been developed for automatic particle picking, these algorithms generally rely on two-dimensional templates for particle identification, which may exhibit biases that can propagate artifacts through the reconstruction pipeline. Manual picking is viewed as a gold-standard solution for particle selection, but it is too time-consuming to perform on data sets of thousands of images. In recent years, crowdsourcing has proven effective at leveraging the open web to manually curate datasets. In particular, citizen science projects such as Galaxy Zoo have shown the power of appealing to users' scientific interests to process enormous amounts of data. To this end, we explored the possible applications of crowdsourcing in cryo-EM particle picking, presenting a variety of novel experiments including the production of a fully annotated particle set from untrained citizen scientists. We show the possibilities and limitations of crowdsourcing particle selection tasks, and explore further options for crowdsourcing cryo-EM data processing.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important energy metabolic organ that is closely related to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Aging is one of the most important determinants of BAT activity. In this study, we used 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging to assess the aging of the BAT in LmnaG609G/G609G mice. To evaluate the BAT activity, LmnaG609G/G609G and wild-type (WT) mice were injected with 18F-FDG, and PET/CT imaging was performed. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVMax) of the BAT was measured and the target/nontarget (T/NT) values of BAT were calculated. The transcription and the protein expression levels of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), beta3-adrenergic receptor ({beta}3-AR), and the PRdomain-containing16 (PRDM16), were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting or immunohistochemical analysis. Apoptosis and cell senescence of the BAT, in WT and LmnaG609G/G609G mice, was detected by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and by CDKN2A/p16INK4a immunohistochemical staining, respectively. At 14 weeks of age, the BAT SUVMax and the expression levels of UCP1, {beta}3-AR and PRDM16 in LmnaG609G/G609G mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice. At the same time, the number of p16INK4a and TUNEL positively stained cells (%) increased in LmnaG609G/G609G mice. LmnaG609G/G609G mice are an ideal model for studying BAT aging. The aging characteristics and the aging mechanism of BAT in LmnaG609G/G609G mice can mimic normal BAT aging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSkeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are quiescent in adult mice and can undergo multiple rounds of proliferation and self-renewal following muscle injury. Several labs have profiled transcripts of myogenic cells during developmental and adult myogenesis with the aim of identifying quiescent markers. Here, we focused on the quiescent cell state and generated new transcriptome profiles that include subfractionations of adult MuSC populations, and an artificially induced prenatal quiescent state, to identify core signatures for quiescent and proliferating MuSCs.\\n\\nMethodsComparison of available data offered challenges related to the inherent diversity of datasets and biological conditions. We developed a standardized workflow to homogenize the normalization, filtering, quality control steps for the analysis of gene expression profiles allowing the identification up- and down-regulated genes and the subsequent gene set enrichment analysis. To share the analytical pipeline of this work, we developed Sherpa, an interactive Shiny server that allows multiscale comparisons for extraction of desired gene sets from the analysed datasets. This tool is adaptable to cell populations in other contexts and tissues.\\n\\nResultsA multiscale analysis comprising eight datasets of quiescent MuSCs had 207 and 542 genes commonly up- and down-regulated, respectively. Shared up-regulated gene sets include an over-representation of the TNFa pathway via NFKb signaling, Il6-Jak-Stat3 signaling, and the apical surface processes, while shared down-regulated gene sets exhibited an over-representation of Myc and E2F targets, and genes associated to the G2M checkpoint and oxidative phosphorylation. However, virtually all datasets contained genes that are associated with activation or cell cycle entry, such as the immediate early stress response genes Fos and Jun. Empirical examination of fixed and isolated MuSCs showed that these and other genes were absent in vivo, but activated during procedural isolation of cells.\\n\\nConclusionsThrough the systematic comparison and individual analysis of diverse transcriptomic profiles, we identified genes that were consistently differentially expressed among the different datasets and common underlying biological processes key to the quiescent cell state. Our findings provide impetus to define and distinguish transcripts associated with true in vivo quiescence from those that are first responding genes due to disruption of the stem cell niche.",

    "abstract": "Impaired interactions between Calcineurin (Cn) and (Cu/Zn) superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are suspected to be responsible for the formation of hyperphosphorylated protein aggregation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Serine (Ser)-enriched TDP-43 protein aggregation appears in the spinal cord of ALS animal models, and may be linked to the reduced phosphatase activity of Cn. The mutant overexpressed SOD1G93A protein does not properly bind zinc (Zn) in animal models; hence, mutant SOD1G93A - Cn interaction weakens. Consequently, unstable Cn fails to dephosphorylate TDP-43 that yields hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 aggregates. Our previous studies had suggested that Cn and SOD1 interaction was necessary to keep Cn enzyme functional. We have observed low Cn level, increased Zn concentrations, and increased TDP-43 protein levels in cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions of the spinal cord tissue homogenates. This study further supports our previous published work indicating that Cn stability depends on functional Cn-SOD1 interaction because Zn metal is crucial for maintaining the Cn stability. Less active Cn did not efficiently dephosphorylate TDP-43; hence TDP-43 aggregations appeared in the spinal cord tissue.",

    "abstract": "Natural products and their analogues are often challenging to synthesise due to their complex scaffolds and embedded functional groups. Solely relying on engineering the biosynthesis of natural products may lead to limited compound diversity. Integrating synthetic biology with synthetic chemistry allows rapid access to much more diverse portfolios of xenobiotic compounds which may accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics. As a proof-of-concept, by supplementing an Escherichia coli strain expressing the violacein biosynthesis pathway with 5-bromo-tryptophan in vitro or tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH in vivo, 6 halogenated analogues of violacein or deoxyviolacein were generated, demonstrating promiscuity of the violacein biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, 20 new derivatives were generated from 5-brominated violacein analogues via Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction directly using the crude extract without prior purification. Herein, we demonstrate a flexible and rapid approach to access diverse chemical space that can be applied to a wide range of natural product scaffolds.",
