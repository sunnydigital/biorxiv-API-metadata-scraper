    "abstract": "The elemental content of a soybean seed is a determined by both genetic and environmental factors and is an important component of its nutritional value. The elemental content is chemically stable, making the samples stored in germplasm repositories an intriguing source of experimental material. To test the efficacy of using samples from germplasm banks for gene discovery, we analyzed the elemental profile of seeds from 1653 lines in the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection. We observed large differences in the elemental profiles based on where the lines were grown, which lead us to break up the genetic analysis into multiple small experiments. Despite these challenges, we were able to identify candidate SNPs controlling elemental accumulation as well as lines with extreme elemental accumulation phenotypes. Our results suggest that elemental analysis of germplasm samples can identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium to genes, which can be leveraged to assist in crop improvement efforts.",

    "abstract": "After a series of reports uncovered various methodological problems with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research, considerable attention has been given to principles and practices to improve reproducibility of neuroimaging findings, including promotion of openness, transparency, and data sharing. However, much less attention has been given to use of open access neuroimaging datasets to conduct replication studies. A major barrier to reproducing neuroimaging studies is their high cost, in money and labor, and utilizing such datasets is an obvious solution for breaking down this barrier. The Human Connectome Project (HCP) is an open access dataset consisting of extensive behavioral and neuroimaging data from over 1,100 individuals and there are numerous ongoing HCP-harmonized studies of lifespan and disease that will ultimately release data through HCP infrastructure. To bring attention to the HCP and related projects as an important resource for conducting replication studies, I used the HCP to conduct a replication of a highly cited neuroimaging study that showed correspondence between resting state and task brain networks.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100042).\\n\\nReconstructing ancestral characters on a phylogeny is an arduous task because the observed states at the tips of the tree correspond to a single realization of the underlying evolutionary process. Recently, it was proposed that ancestral traits can be indirectly estimated with the help of molecular data, based on the fact that life history traits influence substitution rates. Here we challenge these new approaches in the Cetartiodactyla, a clade of large mammals which, according to paleontology, derive from small ancestors. Analysing transcriptome data in 41 species, of which 22 were newly sequenced, we provide a dated phylogeny of the Cetartiodactyla and report a significant effect of body mass on the overall substitution rate, the synonymous vs. non-synonymous substitution rate and the dynamics of GC-content. Our molecular comparative analysis points toward relatively small Cetartiodactyla ancestors, in agreement with the fossil record, even though our data set almost exclusively consists of large species. This analysis demonstrates the potential of phylogenomic methods for ancestral trait reconstruction and gives credit to recent suggestions that the ancestor to placental mammals was a relatively large and long-lived animal.",

However, no study of successfully applied genome editing has been reported in a dinoflagellate despite the first genetic transformation of Symbiodinium being published about 20 years ago.

Plasmid vectors designed for nuclear transformation containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene under the control of the CaMV p35S promoter as well as several putative endogenous promoters were used to test a variety of transformation techniques including biolistics, electroporation and silicon carbide whiskers. Chloroplast-targeted transformation were attempted using an engineered Symbiodinium chloroplast minicircle encoding a modified PsbA protein that confers atrazine resistance. We report that we have been unable to confer chloramphenicol or atrazine resistance to Symbiodinium microadriaticum strain CCMP2467.",

While the generation of spatially resolved transcriptome maps is increasingly feasible, computational methods for analysing the resulting data are not established. Existing analysis strategies either ignore the spatial component of gene expression variation, or require discretization of the cells into coarse grained groups.\\n\\nTo address this, we have developed SpatialDE, a computational framework for identifying and characterizing spatially variable genes. Our method generalizes variable gene selection, as used in population-and single-cell studies, to spatial expression profiles. To illustrate the broad utility of our approach, we apply SpatialDE to spatial transcriptomics data, and to data from single cell methods based on multiplexed in situ hybridisation (SeqFISH and MERFISH). SpatialDE enables the statistically robust identification of spatially variable genes, thereby identifying genes with known disease implications, several of which are missed by conventional variable gene selection. Additionally, to enable gene-expressed based histology, SpatialDE implements a spatial gene clustering model which we call \\\"automatic expression histology,\\\" allowing to classify genes into groups with distinct spatial patterns.",

    "abstract": "An open question in human evolution is the importance of polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method - which we call PolyGraph - has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been influenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.",

    "abstract": "Decoding sensory stimuli from neural signals can be used to reveal how we sense our physical environment, and is valuable for the design of brain-machine interfaces. However, existing linear techniques for neural decoding may not fully reveal or exploit the fidelity of the neural signal. Here we develop a new approximate Bayesian method for decoding natural images from the spiking activity of populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We sidestep known computational challenges with Bayesian inference by exploiting artificial neural networks developed for computer vision, enabling fast nonlinear decoding that incorporates natural scene statistics implicitly. We use a decoder architecture that first linearly reconstructs an image from RGC spikes, then applies a convolutional autoencoder to enhance the image. The resulting decoder, trained on natural images and simulated neural responses, significantly outperforms linear decoding, as well as simple point-wise nonlinear decoding. These results provide a tool for the assessment and optimization of retinal prosthesis technologies, and reveal that the retina may provide a more accurate representation of the visual scene than previously appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans, a dental caries causing odontopathogen, produces X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase (Sm-XPDAP, encoded by pepX), a serine protease known to have a nutritional role. Considering the potential of proteases as therapeutic targets in pathogens, this study was primarily aimed at investigating the role of Sm-XPDAP in contributing to virulence-related traits. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP IV), an XPDAP analogous enzyme found in mammalian tissues, is a well known therapeutic target in Type II diabetes. Based on the hypothesis that gliptins, commonly used as anti-human-DPP IV drugs, may affect bacterial growth upon inhibition of Sm-XPDAP, we have determined their ex vivo antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity towards S. mutans. All three DPP IV drugs tested reduced biofilm formation as determined by crystal violet staining. To link the observed biofilm inhibition to the human-DPP IV analogue present in S. mutans UA159, a pepX isogenic mutant was generated. In addition to reduced biofilm formation, CLSM studies of the biofilm formed by the pepX isogenic mutant showed these were comparable to those formed in the presence of saxagliptin, suggesting a probable role of this enzyme in biofilm formation by S. mutans UA159. The effects of both pepX deletion and DPP IV drugs on the proteome were studied using LC-MS/MS. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Sm-XPDAP as a novel anti-biofilm target and suggests a template molecule to synthesize lead compounds effective against this enzyme.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHaplotype assembly is the process of assigning the different alleles of the variants covered by mapped sequencing reads to the two haplotypes of the genome of a human individual. Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages.\\n\\nResultsHere, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.\\n\\nAvailabilityHapCHAT is available at http://hapchat.algolab.eu under the GPL license.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide, with up to two-thirds of individuals experiencing long-term disabilities. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have shown promise in identifying robust biomarkers (e.g., measures of brain structure) of long-term stroke recovery following rehabilitation. However, analyzing large rehabilitation-related datasets is problematic due to barriers in accurate stroke lesion segmentation. Manually-traced lesions are currently the gold standard for lesion segmentation on T1-weighted MRIs, but are labor intensive and require anatomical expertise. While algorithms have been developed to automate this process, the results often lack accuracy. Newer algorithms that employ machine-learning techniques are promising, yet these require large training datasets to optimize performance. Here we present ATLAS (Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke), an open-source dataset of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented lesions and metadata. This large, diverse dataset can be used to train and test lesion segmentation algorithms and provides a standardized dataset for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods. We hope ATLAS release 1.1 will be a useful resource to assess and improve the accuracy of current lesion segmentation methods.",

    "abstract": "Countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties. Only a few studies have explored how such variations influence how humans navigate or reason about space [1-7]. We predicted that these variations impact human cognition, resulting in an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people, sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-centre clinical trials using cognitive testing.",

    "abstract": "Parasite egress from infected erythrocytes and invasion of new erythrocytes are essential for the exponential asexual replication of the malaria parasite, and both processes are regulated and mediated by proteases. The putative cysteine protease dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3) was previously suggested to be essential for parasite egress, but little is known about its biological function. Here, we demonstrate that DPAP3 has proteolytic activity, but contrary to previously studied DPAPs, removal of its prodomain is not required for activation. Interestingly, P. falciparum DPAP3 localizes to merozoite apical organelles from which it is secreted immediately before egress. Using a conditional knock out approach coupled to complementation studies with wild type or mutant DPAP3, we show that DPAP3 activity is critical for efficient RBC invasion and overall parasite replication, and demonstrate that it does not play a role in parasite egress. Overall, this study establishes DPAP3 as a key regulator of erythrocyte invasion.",

The p-value estimator conventionally used in existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) regressions assumes a normally-distributed dependent variable, or relies on a central limit theorem based approximation. The central limit theorem approximation is unreliable for GWAS regression p-values, and measured phenotypes often have markedly non-normal distributions. A normal mixture distribution better fits observed phenotypic variables, and we provide exact small-sample p-values for univariate GWAS regressions under this flexible distributional assumption.

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of proteomes across multiple time points, organelles, and perturbations is essential for understanding both fundamental biology and disease states. The development of isobaric tags (e.g. TMT) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of peptide abundances across several different conditions. These multiplexed approaches are promising in principle because of advantages in throughput and measurement quality. However, in practice existing multiplexing approaches suffer from key limitations. In its simple implementation (TMT-MS2), measurements are distorted by chemical noise leading to poor measurement accuracy. The current state-of- the-art (TMT-MS3) addresses this, but requires specialized quadrupole-iontrap-Orbitrap instrumentation. The complement reporter ion approach (TMTc) produces high accuracy measurements and is compatible with many more instruments, like quadrupole-Orbitraps. However, the required deconvolution of the TMTc cluster leads to poor measurement precision. Here, we introduce TMTc+, which adds the modeling of the MS2- isolation step into the deconvolution algorithm. The resulting measurements are comparable in precision to TMT-MS3/MS2. The improved duty cycle, and lower filtering requirements make TMTc+ more sensitive than TMT-MS3 and comparable with TMT-MS2. At the same time, unlike TMT-MS2, TMTc+ is exquisitely able to distinguish signal from chemical noise even outperforming TMT-MS3. Lastly, we compare TMTc+ to quantitative label-free proteomics of total HeLa lysate and find that TMTc+ quantifies 7.8k versus 3.9k proteins in a 5-plex sample. At the same time the median coefficient of variation improves from 13% to 4%. Thus, TMTc+ advances quantitative proteomics by enabling accurate, sensitive, and precise multiplexed experiments on more commonly used instruments.",

    "abstract": "Background- Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a colossal threat to global health and incurs high economic costs to society. Economic evaluations of antimicrobials and interventions such as diagnostics and vaccines that affect their consumption rarely include the costs of AMR, resulting in sub-optimal policy recommendations. We estimate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed, stratified by drug class and national income level.\\n\\nMethods- The model is comprised of three components: correlation coefficients between human antibiotic consumption and subsequent resistance; the economic costs of AMR for five key pathogens; and consumption data for antibiotic classes driving resistance in these organisms. These were used to calculate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed for different drug classes, using data from Thailand and the United States (US) to represent low/middle and high-income countries.\\n\\nResults- The correlation coefficients between consumption of antibiotics that drive resistance in S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. baumanii, and P. aeruginosa and resistance rates were 0.37, 0.27, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.52, respectively. The total economic cost of AMR due to resistance in these five pathogens was $0.5 billion and $2.8 billion in Thailand and the US, respectively. The cost of AMR associated with the consumption of one standard unit (SU) of antibiotics ranged from $0.1 for macrolides to $0.7 for quinolones, cephalosporins and broad-spectrum penicillins in the Thai context. In the US context, the cost of AMR per SU of antibiotic consumed ranged from $0.1 for carbapenems to $0.6 for quinolones, cephalosporins and broad spectrum penicillins.\\n\\nConclusion- The economic costs of AMR per antibiotic consumed were considerable, often exceeding their purchase cost. Differences between Thailand and the US were apparent, corresponding with variation in the overall burden of AMR and relative prevalence of different pathogens. Notwithstanding their limitations, use of these estimates in economic evaluations can make better-informed policy recommendations regarding interventions that affect antimicrobial consumption and those aimed specifically at reducing the burden of AMR.",

    "abstract": "Feathers are one of the defining characteristics of birds and serve a critical role in thermal insulation and physical protection against the environment. Feather structure is known to vary among individuals, and it has been suggested that populations exposed to different environmental conditions may exhibit different patterns in feather structure. We examined both down and contour feathers from two populations of male Torrent Ducks (Merganetta armata) from Lima, Peru, including one high-altitude population from the Chancay-Huaral River at approximately 3500 meters (m) elevation and one low-altitude population from the Chillon River at approximately 1500 m. Down feather structure differed significantly between the two populations. Ducks from the high-altitude population had longer, denser down compared with low-altitude individuals. Contour feather structure varied greatly among individuals but showed no significant difference between populations. These results suggest that the innermost, insulative layer of plumage (the down), may have developed in response to lower ambient temperatures at high elevations. The lack of observable differences in the contour feathers may be due to the general constraints of the waterproofing capability of this outer plumage layer.\\n\\nResumenEl plumaje es una caracteristica que define a las aves y cumple roles criticos en el aislamiento termico y proteccion fisica del ambiente. Se sabe que la estructura de las plumas varia ente individuos, y se ha sugerido que poblaciones expuestas a diferentes condiciones ambientales pueden exhibir diferentes patrones en la estructura de las plumas. En este estudio se examinaron tanto el plumon como las plumas de contorno de machos adultos del Pato de los Torrentes (Merganetta armata) de dos poblaciones, una en el rio Chancay-Huaral a 3,500 msnm y otra en el rio Chillon a 1,500 msnm, ubicadas en Lima, Peru. La estructura de los plumones difiere significativamente entre las dos poblaciones. Los patos de la poblacion a grandes elevaciones tienen plumones largos, y densos comparados con los individuos de las partes bajas. La estructura de las plumas de contorno varia ampliamente entre individuos pero no muestra diferencias significativas entre poblaciones. Estos resultados sugieren que las diferencias entre las capas interiores de aislamiento del plumaje (plumon), haberse desarrollado como respuesta en ambientes de bajas temperaturas a grandes elevaciones. En cambio la falta de detectables diferencias en las plumas de contorno puede ser debido a la constante seleccion en la capacidad impermeable de la capa de plumas exteriores.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of hospitalization for children under two years of age. RSV vaccines are currently unavailable, and children suffering from multiple reinfections by the same viral strain, fail to develop protective memory responses. Follicular helper T (TFH) cells specialize in providing B cell help to antibody production and affinity maturation, mainly via IL-21 secretion. Although RSV-specific antibodies can be detected upon infection, how they are generated and their relevance against disease protection has not been fully examined. Here, we observed that RSV expands a functionally impaired murine TFH cell population in vitro and vivo, with downregulated IL-21R expression and IL-21 production. IL-21 treatment of RSV-infected mice, however, increased TFH cells frequency, enhanced the germinal center reaction and improved protective humoral immune responses by increasing viral protein F specific antibody avidity and neutralization capacity. In vivo, it protected from RSV infection, decreasing lung inflammation. Passive immunization with purified IgG from IL-21 treated RSV-infected mice protected against RSV infection. Both viable and UV-inactivated RSV induced PD-L1 expression on B cells and DCs, however, only in DCs a direct effect of RSV was detected. Blocking PD-L1 during infection recovered IL-21R expression in TFH and B cells and increased secretion of IL-21 by TFH cells in a DC-dependent manner. Our results unveil a novel pathway by which RSV affects TFH cells activity, reducing levels of IL-21 and its receptor, by increasing PD-L1 expression on APCs. These results highlight the PD-L1/IL-21 axis importance for the generation of protective responses to RSV infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=176 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/203133_figGA1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (36K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172470eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@197017eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e31ae3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa4c4f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTRSV infection impairing IL-21 secretion by TFH cells via PD-L1induction in dendritic cells and B cells.

    "abstract": "For many animals, affiliative relationships such as pair bonds form the foundation of society, and are highly adaptive. Animal systems amenable for comparatively studying pair bonding are important for identifying underlying biological mechanisms, but mostly exist in mammals. Better establishing fish systems will enable comparison of pair bonding mechanisms across taxonomically distant lineages that may reveal general underlying principles. We examined the utility of wild butterflyfishes (f: Chaetodontidae; g: Chaetodon) for comparatively studying pair bonding. Stochastic character mapping inferred that within the family, pairing is ancestral, with at least seven independent transitions to group formation and seven transition to solitary behavior from the late Miocene to recent. In six sympatric and wide-spread species representing a clade with one ancestrally reconstructed transition from paired to solitary grouping, we then verified social systems at Lizard Island, Australia. In situ observations confirmed that Chaetodon baronessa, C. lunulatus, and C. vagabundus are predominantly pair bonding, whereas C. rainfordi, C. plebeius, and C. trifascialis are predominantly solitary. Even in the predominantly pair bonding species, C. lunulatus, a proportion of adults (15 %) are solitary. Importantly, inter- and intra-specific differences in social systems do not co-vary with other previously established attributes (geographic occurrence, parental care, diet, or territoriality). Hence, the proposed butterflyfish populations are promising for comparative analyses of pair bonding and its mechanistic underpinnings. Avenues for further developing the system are proposed, including determining whether the utility of these species applies across their geographic disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Bioplastics are an attractive alternative to petroleum-derived plastics because of the harmful environmental effects of conventional plastics and the impending fossil fuel crisis. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a well-known bioplastic that is produced by several microbes using organic carbon sources. Autotrophic (using carbon dioxide or CO2) PHB production is reported for only a few organisms. Sustainable PHB bioproduction using other autotrophic microbes needs to be explored. Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile purple non-sulfur bacterium (PNSB) is known to produce PHBs under photoheterotrophic conditions. Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain TIE-1 demonstrates extended metabolic versatility by using electron sources such as ferrous iron and poised electrodes for photoautotrophy. Here we report the ability of TIE-1 to produce PHB under photoferroautotrophic (light - energy source, ferrous iron - electron source and CO2 - carbon source) and photoelectroautotrophic (light - energy source, poised electrodes - electron source and CO2 - carbon source) growth conditions. PHB accumulation was observed both under nitrogen (N2) fixing and non-N2 fixing conditions. For comparison, we determined PHB production under chemoheterotrophic, photoheterotrophic and photoautotrophic conditions using hydrogen as the electron donor. Photoferroautotrophic and photoelectroautotrophic PHB production was on par with that observed from organic carbon substrates such as butyrate. PHB production increased during N2 fixation under photoheterotrophic conditions but not during photoautotrophic growth. Electron microscopy confirmed that TIE-1 cells accumulate PHBs internally under the conditions that showed highest production. However, gene expression analysis suggests that PHB cycle genes are not differentially regulated despite observable changes in biopolymer production.",

The stele-derived signaling peptide CIF2 stabilizes SHORTROOT-induced reprogramming. The outcome is a partially impermeable barrier deposited in the sub-epidermal cell layer that has a transcriptional signature similar to endodermis. The trans-differentiation mechanism depends on the expression of genes downstream in the gene regulatory network but is independent of SHORTROOT movement.

Massive, genome-wide transcriptomic rewiring in response to genomic merger and doubling has been demonstrated in many allopolyploid systems, encompassing a diversity of phenomena, including homoeolog expression bias, genome dominance, expression-level dominance, and revamping of co-expression networks. Here we present an analytical framework to reconcile these patterns of regulatory novelty as governed by distinct sets of intra- and inter-subgenome cis-trans relationships. This approach is a novel extension of classic allele-specific expression analysis to incorporate and distinguish the separate effects of parental regulatory interactions as well as further complications at the allopolyploid level. We demonstrated that the cis-trans framework devised not only offers new perspective on disentangling genetic from epigenetic and higher-order effects that impact gene expression, but also provides the conceptual basis and tools to unify recently presented models for both genome-wide expression dominance and biased fractionation in allopolyploids.",

Several models have been proposed to explain how parents should respond to changes in each others parental care to maximize their own fitness, predicting no change, partial compensation, or matching effort as a response. Here, we present an experiment in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in which we increased the parental care of females by presenting them, but not their mates, with additional nestling begging calls using automated playbacks. We performed this experiment in two populations differing in future breeding opportunities and thus the intensity of conflict over current parental care. We found that in response to a temporary increase in female parental effort, males in the northern population with lower sexual conflict matched the increased effort, whereas males in the southern population did not. We also found that increases in parental care during playbacks were driven by the females (i.e., females initiated the increased effort and their mates followed them) in the northern population but not the southern population. These results support the idea that with incomplete information about the brood value and need, cues or signals from the partner might become important in coordinating parental care.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Identification of differentially expressed genes in AD would help to find biomarker and therapeutic target. Here, we carried out an analysis to identify the age-independent and AD-specific genes. We found that genes MET, WIF1 and NPTX2 are down regulated in AD. WIF1 and MET are in signaling of WNT and MET, regulating the activity of GSK3{beta}, thus in AD. Importantly, we found gene GMPR shows a gradual increase in AD progress. A logistic model based on GMPR exhibits a good capacity in classifying AD cases. GMPRs product GMPR1 links with AMPK and adenosine receptor pathways, thus associating phosphorylation of Tau in AD. This allows GMPR1 to be a therapeutic target. Therefore, we screened five possible inhibitors to GMPR1 by docking GMPR1 with 1174 approved drugs. Among them, lumacaftor is ideal due to its high affinity and light molecular weight. We then tested the effect of lumacaftor on AD model mice. After twenty days of oral administration, {beta}-Amyloid accumulation is slowed down and phosphorylation of Tau is almost eliminated in the treated mice, showing a satisfying effect. In conclusion, the elevated expression level of GMPR tightly associates with AD progress and leads to AD phenotype probably through AMPK and adenosine receptor pathways; and one of therapeutic strategies is to inhibit GMPRs product with lumacaftor.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe found the elevated expression level of GMPR tightly associates with AD progress and leads to AD phenotype probably through AMPK and adenosine receptor pathways; and the therapeutic strategy targeting GMPR1 with lumacaftor shows a satisfying result.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChallenges in developing a good de novo transcriptome assembler include how to deal with read errors and sequence repeats. Almost all de novo assemblers utilize de Bruijn graph, which has a complexity linearly growing with data size while suffers from errors and repeat. Although one can correct errors by inspecting topological structure of the graph, it is an uneasy task when there are too many branches. There are two research directions: improving either graph reliability or path search precision. We focused on improving the reliability.\\n\\nResultsWe present TraRECo, a greedy approach to de novo assembly employing error-aware graph construction. The idea is similar to overlap-layout-consensus approach used for genome assembly, but is different in that consensus is made through the entire graph construction step. Basically, we built contigs by direct read alignment within a distance margin and performed junction search to construct splicing graphs. While doing so, however, a contig of length l was represented by 4x1 matrix (called consensus matrix), of which each element was the base count of aligned reads so far. A representative sequence is obtained, by taking majority in each column of the consensus matrix, to be used for further read alignment. Once splicing graphs were obtained, we used IsoLasso to find paths with noticeable read depth. The experiments using real and simulated reads showed that the method provides considerable improvements in sensitivity and reasonably better performances when comparing both sensitivity and precision. This could be achieved by making more erroneous reads to be participated in graph construction, which, in turn, improved the depth information quality used for the subsequent path search step. The results for simulated reads showed also challenges are still remaining since non-negligible percentage of transcripts with high abundance were not recovered by the assemblers we considered.\\n\\nConclusionde novo assembly is mainly to explore not-yet-discovered isoforms and must be able to represent as much reads as possible in an efficient way. In this sense, TraRECo provides us a potential alternative to improve graph reliability, even though the computational burden can be much higher than single k-mer de Bruijn graph approach.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWhole-genome alignment and pan-genome analysis are useful tools in understanding the similarities and differences of many genomes in an evolutionary context. Here we introduce the concept of pan-synteny graphs, an analysis method that combines elements of both to represent conservation and change of multiple prokaryotic genomes at an architectural level. Pan-synteny graphs represent a reference free approach for the comparison of many genomes and allows for the identification of synteny, insertion, deletion, replacement, inversion, recombination, missed assembly joins, evolutionary hotspots, and reference based scaffolding.\\n\\nResultsWe present an algorithm for creating whole genome multiple sequence comparisons and a model for representing the similarities and differences among sequences as a graph of syntenic gene families. As part of the pan-synteny graph creation, we first create a de Bruijn graph. Instead of the alphabet of nucleotides commonly used in genome assembly, we use an alphabet of gene families. This de Bruijn graph is then processed to create the pan-synteny graph. Our approach is novel in that it explicitly controls how regions from the same sequence and genome are aligned and generates a graph in which all sequences are fully represented as paths. This method harnesses previous computation involved in protein family calculation to speed up the creation of whole genome alignment for many genomes. We provide the software suite Panaconda, for the calculation of pan-synteny graphs given annotation input, and an implementation of methods for their layout and visualization.\\n\\nAvailabilityPanaconda is available at https://github.com/aswarren/pangenome_graphs and datasets used in examples are available at https://github.com/aswarren/pangenome_examples\\n\\nContactAndrew Warren anwarren@vt.edu",

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing technology has facilitated the discovery of a large number of somatic mutations in enhancers (SMEs), whereas the utility of SMEs in tumorigenesis has not been fully explored. Here we present Ennet, a method to comprehensively investigate SMEs enriched networks (SME-networks) in cancer by integrating SMEs, enhancer-gene interactions and gene-gene interactions. Using Ennet, we performed a pan-cancer analysis in 2004 samples from 8 cancer types and found many well-known cancer drivers were involved in the SME-networks, including ESR1, SMAD3, MYC, EGFR, BCL2 and PAX5. Meanwhile, Ennet also identified many new networks with less characterization but have potentially important roles in cancer, including a large SME-network in medulloblastoma (MB), which contains genes enriched in the glutamate receptor and neural development pathways. Interestingly, SME-networks are specific across cancer types, and the vast majority of the genes identified by Ennet have few mutations in gene bodies. Collectively, our work suggests that using enhancer-only somatic mutations can be an effective way to discover potential cancer-driving networks. Ennet provides a new perspective to explore new mechanisms for tumor progression from SMEs.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) are uncommon cancers arising from pancreatic islet cells. Analysis of gene mutation, copy number and RNA expression of 57 sporadic pNETs showed that pNET genomes are dominated by aneuploidy. Remarkably, ~25% of pNETs had genomes characterized by recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LoH) of the same 10 chromosomes, accompanied by bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation, and these cases had generally poor clinical outcome. Another ~25% of all pNETs had chromosome 11 LoH and bi-allelic MEN1 inactivation, lacking the recurrent LoH pattern - these had universally good clinical outcome. Some level of aneuploidy was common, and overall ~80% of pNETs had LoH of [&ge;]1 chromosome. This aneuploidy led to changes in RNA expression at the level of whole chromosomes and allowed pathogenic germline variants (e.g. ATM) to be expressed unopposed, inactivating downstream tumor suppressor pathways. Some pNETs appear to utilize VHL gene methylation or mutation to activate pseudo-hypoxia. Contrary to expectation neither tumor morphology within well-differentiated pNETs nor single gene mutation had significant associations with clinical outcome, nor did expression of RNAs reflecting the activity of immune, differentiation, proliferative or tumor suppressor pathways. MEN1 was the only statistically significant recurrently mutated driver gene in pNETs. Only one pNET had clearly oncogenic and actionable SNVs (in PTEN and FLCN) confirmed by corroborating RNA expression changes. The two distinct patterns of aneuploidy described here, associated with markedly poor and good clinical outcome respectively, define a novel oncogenic mechanism and the first route to genomic precision oncology for this tumor type.",

Injected cells exhibited disease-specific patterns of intravascular distribution with leukemic cells moving faster than breast cancer cells. While breast cancer cells predominantly adhered to nearby regions, about 30% invaded the avascularized tissue, reminiscent of their metastatic phenotype. Survival of the injected tumor cells was partly inhibited by the cellular innate immune system of the recipient embryos and leukemic cell dissemination was effectively inhibited by pharmacological ROCK1 blockade. These observations, and the ability to image several embryos simultaneously, support the use of eZXM and SPIM imaging as a functional screening platform to identify compounds that restricts cancer cell spread and invasion.",

Here, we identify a new modification at the CTD, the deimination of arginine and its conversion to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), an enzyme that has been associated with several diseases including cancer. We show that among PADI family members, only PADI2 citrullinates R1810 (Cit1810) at repeat 31 of the CTD. Depletion of PADI2 or loss of R1810 result in accumulation of RNAP2 at transcription start sites, reduced gene expression and inhibition of cell proliferation. Cit1810 is needed for interaction with the P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) kinase complex and for its recruitment to chromatin. In this way, CTD-Cit1810 favors RNAP2 pause release and efficient transcription in breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "The cellular and molecular basis of stromal cell recruitment, activation and crosstalk in carcinomas is poorly understood, limiting the development of targeted anti-stromal therapies. In mouse models of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), Hh ligand produced by neoplastic cells reprogrammed cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) gene expression, driving tumor growth and metastasis. Hh-activated CAFs upregulated expression of FGF5 and production of fibrillar collagen, leading to FGFR and FAK activation in adjacent neoplastic cells, which then acquired a stem-like, drug-resistant phenotype. Treatment with smoothened inhibitors (SMOi) reversed these phenotypes. Stromal treatment of TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with SMOi downregulated the expression of cancer stem cell markers and sensitized tumors to docetaxel, leading to markedly improved survival and reduced metastatic burden. In the phase I clinical trial EDALINE, 3 of 12 patients with metastatic TNBC derived clinical benefit from combination therapy with the SMOi Sonidegib and docetaxel chemotherapy, with one patient experiencing a complete response. Markers of pathway activity correlated with response. These studies identify Hh signaling to CAFs as a novel mediator of cancer stem cell plasticity and an exciting new therapeutic target in TNBC.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCECompared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBCs are associated with significantly worse patient outcomes. Standard of care systemic treatment for patients with non-BRCA1/2 positive TNBC is cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, the failure of 70% of treated TNBCs to attain complete pathological response reflects the relative chemoresistance of these tumors. New therapeutic strategies are needed to improve patient survival and quality of life. Here, we provide new insights into the dynamic interactions between heterotypic cells within a tumor. Specifically, we establish the mechanisms by which CAFs define cancer cell phenotype and demonstrate that the bidirectional CAF-cancer cell crosstalk can be successfully targeted in mice and humans using anti-stromal therapy.",

    "abstract": "Secretion of adhesive glycoproteins to the lumen of Drosophila larval salivary glands is carried out by contraction of an actomyosin network that is assembled around large secretory vesicles, following their fusion to the apical membranes. We have identified a cycle of actin coat nucleation and disassembly that is independent of myosin. Recruitment of active Rho1 to the fused vesicle triggers activation of the formin Diaphanous and nucleation of linear actin. This, in turn, leads to actin-dependent localization of a RhoGAP protein that locally shuts off Rho1, promoting disassembly of the actin coat. Recruitment of the branched actin nucleation machinery is also required for effective Rho1 inactivation. Interestingly, different blocks to actin coat disassembly arrested vesicle contraction, indicating that actin turnover is an integral part of the actomyosin contraction cycle. The capacity of F-actin to trigger a negative feedback on its own production may be utilized in a variety of scenarios, to coordinate a succession of morphogenetic events or maintain homeostasis.\\n\\nSummaryThis work identified a cycle of actin assembly and disassembly in large secretory vesicles of Drosophila salivary glands. Actin disassembly is triggered by actin-dependent recruitment of a RhoGAP protein, and is essential for the contractility of the vesicle leading to content release to the lumen.",

The events that mediate the installation of CENP-A in place of H3 remain poorly characterized. H2A.Z is linked to transcriptional competence and associates with mammalian centromeres. We find that H2A.ZPht1 and the Swr1 complex are enriched in fission yeast CENP-ACnp1 chromatin. Our analysis shows that Swr1, Msc1 and H2A.ZPht1 are required to maintain CENP-ACnp1 chromatin integrity. Cell cycle analyses demonstrate that H2A.ZPht1 is deposited in S phase, coincident with the deposition of placeholder H3, and prior to CENP-ACnp1 replenishment in G2. Establishment assays reveal that H2A.ZPht1 and Swr1 are required for de novo assembly of CENP-ACnp1 onto naive centromere DNA. We propose that features akin to promoters within centromere DNA program the incorporation of H2A.ZPht1 via Swr1, and mediate the replacement of resident H3 nucleosomes with CENP-A nucleosomes thereby defining centromeres.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of protein homeostasis (\\\"proteostasis\\\") is necessary for maintaining healthy cells. Disturbances in proteostasis lead to aggregates, cellular stress and can result in toxicity. There is thus great interest in when and where proteins are degraded in cells. Neurons are very large as well as very long-lived, creating unusually high needs for effective regulation of protein turnover in time and space. We previously discovered that the dendritic membrane proteins Nsg1 and Nsg2 are short-lived with half-lives of less than two hours. Their short half-lives enabled us to ask whether these proteins are degraded by local degradative pathways in dendrites. We discovered a striking spatial gradient of late endosomes/lysosomes in dendrites, with late endosomes (Rab7-positive/LAMP1-negative/cathepsinB-negative) found in distal portion of dendrites, and degradative lysosomes (LAMP1-positive/cathepsinB-positive) being overwhelmingly found in the soma and in the proximal portion of dendrites. Surprisingly, the majority of dendritic Rab7-positive late endosomes do not contain LAMP1, unlike Rab7-positive late endosomes in fibroblasts. Secondly, Rab7 activity is required to mobilize these distal pre-degradative dendritic late endosomes for transport to the soma and degradation. We conclude that the vast majority of dendritic LAMP1-positive endosomes are not degradative lysosomes and that bulk degradation of dendritic cargos, such as Nsg1, Nsg2, and DNER, requires Rab7-dependent transport in late endosomes to somatic lysosomes.",

    "abstract": "Abiotic conditions have long been considered essential in structuring freshwater macroinvertebrate communities. Ecological drift, dispersal, and biotic interactions also structure communities, and although these mechanisms are more difficult to detect, they may be of equal importance in natural communities. Here, we conducted repeated surveys of locally-dominant amphipod species across ten naturally replicated stream catchments. We then used a hierarchical joint species distribution model to assess the influence of different drivers on species co-occurrences. The species had unique environmental requirements, but a distinct spatial structure in their distributions was unrelated to habitat. Species co-occurred much less frequently than predicted by their niches, which was surprising because laboratory and field evidence suggests they are capable of coexisting in equal densities. We suggest that niche preemption may limit their distribution and that a blocking effect determines which species colonizes and dominates a given stream catchment, thus resolving a long-standing conundrum in freshwater ecology.",

    "abstract": "Significant demographic fluctuations can have major genetic consequences in wild populations. The Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni) has suffered from both population declines and range fragmentation during the second half of the 20th century. In this study we analysed multilocus microsatellite data to assess the genetic structure of the species. Our analysis revealed significant genetic structuring of Lesser Kestrel populations, not only at cross-continental scale, but also regionally within Central and Eastern (CE) Mediterranean. We detected signs of genetic bottlenecks in some of the peripheral populations coupled with small effective population sizes. Values of genetic differentiation among the largest populations were low, albeit significant, whereas the small peripheral CE Mediterranean populations showed higher levels of differentiation from all other populations. Gene flow levels were relatively low among the discontinuously distributed populations of the CE Mediterranean region. We argue that the observed spatial genetic structure can be attributed at some level to the past demographic decline experienced by the species. Finally, we identify management units in the region, and inform the design of conservation actions aiming at the increase of population sizes and dispersal rates among peripheral populations.",

We analyzed the genotype and field phenotype of the barley HEB-25 multi-parent mapping population under well-watered and water-limited (WW and WL) environments for two years. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for genotype by-environment interactions was performed for ten traits including flowering time (HEA), plant grain yield (PGY). Comparison of the GWAS for traits per-se to that for QTL-by-environment interactions (QxE), indicates the prevalence of QxE mostly for reproductive traits. One QxE locus on chromosome 2, Hordeum spontaneum Dry2.2 (HsDry2.2), showed a positive and conditional effect on PGY and grain number (GN). The wild allele significantly reduced HEA, however this earliness was not conditioned by water deficit. Furthermore, BC2F1 lines segregating for the HsDry2.2 showed the wild allele confers an advantage over the cultivated in PGY, GN and harvest index as well as modified shoot morphology, longer grain filling period and reduced senescence (only under drought), therefore suggesting adaptation mechanism against water deficit other than escape. This study highlights the value of evaluating wild relatives in search of novel alleles and clues to resilience mechanism underlying crop adaptation to abiotic stress.\\n\\nHighlightA flowering-time independent reproductive advantage of wild over cultivated allele under drought identified in a barley GWAS for genotype-by-environment interactions, with modified shoot morphology, reduced senescence and longer grain filling",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA-seq) is an emergent new monitoring tool that promises to facilitate the accurate and cost effective detection of species in environmental samples. eDNA monitoring is likely to have a major impact on the ability of salmonid aquaculture industry producers and their regulators to detect the presence and abundance of pathogens and other biological threats in the surrounding environment. However, for eDNA-seq to develop into a useful bio-monitoring tool it is necessary to (a) validate that sequence datasets derived from amplification of meta-barcoding markers reflect the true species identity and abundances in biological samples, and (b) establish a low-cost sequencing method to enable the bulk processing of environmental samples. In this study, we employed an elaborate experimental design whereby different combinations of five biological agents were crossed at three abundance levels and exposed to pre-filtered and normal seawater, prior to coarse filtering and then eDNA ultrafiltration of the resultant material. We then benchmarked the low-cost, scalable, Ion Torrent sequencing method against the current gold-standard Illumina platform for eDNAseq detection in aquaculture. Based on amplicon-seq of the 18S SSU rDNA v9 region, we found that Illumina and Ion Torrent were equally good in identifying the two parasite species (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Paramoeba perurans), whereas the microalgae species Prymnesium parvum, Pseudo-nitzschia seriata and P. delicatissima could be assigned correctly only to the genus level. Illumina and Ion Torrent were also equally able to reflect community composition in our samples, whereas Ion Torrent was more sensitive in detecting species richness when the medium was unfiltered seawater. Both methods were able to reflect the correct abundances of 4 out of 5 species in samples from unfiltered seawater, despite the significant amount of background noise from both bacteria and eukaryotes. Our findings indicate that eDNA-seq offers significant potential in the monitoring of species harmful to aquaculture and for this purpose, the low-cost Ion Torrent sequencing is equally as accurate as Illumina.",

    "abstract": "Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) retrotransposons are normally suppressed in somatic tissues mainly by DNA methylation and antiviral defense. However, L1s can be desuppressed in cancers to act as insertional mutagens and cause genomic instability by creating DNA double strand breaks and chromosomal rearrangements. Whereas the frequency of somatic L1 insertions varies greatly among individual tumors, much remains to be learned about underlying genetic, cellular, or environmental factors. Here, our pan-gastrointestinal cancer genome analyses for stomach, colorectal, and esophageal tumors identified multiple correlates of L1 activity. Clinical indicators of tumor progression, such as tumor grade and patient age, showed positive association. Potential L1 expression suppressors such as TP53 and DNMT1, a DNA methyltransferase, were inactivated in tumors with frequent L1 insertions. Importantly, tumors with high immune activity, for example, due to viral infection or high tumor-antigen load, tended to carry a low number of L1 insertions in their genomes with high expression levels of L1 suppressors such as APOBEC3s and SAMHD1. Our analysis of the transcriptional effects of intragenic retrotransposon insertions demonstrated an increased risk of gene disruption in retrotransposition-prone cancers. In particular, we found a splicing-disrupting L1 insertion in an exon of MOV10, a key L1 suppressor, which caused exon skipping with evidence of nonsense-mediated decay in a tumor with a high L1 insertion load. Our results indicate that cancer immunity may contribute to genome stability by suppressing L1 retrotransposition particularly in gastrointestinal cancers.",

In invasive diseases, S. pyogenes evokes a massive host response in blood, whereas superficial diseases are characterized by a local leakage of several blood plasma proteins at the site of infection including IgG. S. pyogenes produces IdeS, a protease cleaving IgG in the lower hinge region and we find highly effective IdeS-cleavage of IgG in samples from local IgG poor microenvironments.

    "abstract": "Patterning light at the single-cell level over multiple neurons in the brain is crucial for optogenetic photostimulation that can recapitulate natural activity patterns and, thereby, determine the role of specific components of brain activity in behavior. To this end we have developed a method for projecting three-dimensional, 2-photon excitation patterns that are confined to many individual neurons. The new versatile optical scheme generates multiple extended excitation spots in a large volume with micrometric lateral and axial resolution. Two-dimensional temporally focused shapes are multiplexed several times over selected positions, thanks to the precise spatial phase modulation of the pulsed beam. This permits, under multiple configurations, the generation of tens of axially confined spots in an extended volume, spanning a range in depth of up to 500 m. We demonstrate the potential of the approach by performing multi-cell volumetric excitation of photoactivatable GCaMP in the central nervous system of Drosophila larvae, a challenging structure with densely arrayed and small diameter neurons, and by photoconverting the fluorescent protein Kaede in zebrafish larvae. Our technique paves the way for the optogenetic manipulation of a large number of neurons in intact circuits.",

    "abstract": "Effective use of semantic knowledge requires a set of conceptual representations and control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of this knowledge are retrieved and selected. It is well-established that levels of semantic knowledge increase across the lifespan. However, the effects of ageing on semantic control processes have not been assessed. I addressed this issue by comparing the performance profiles of young and older people on a verbal comprehension test. Two sets of variables were used to predict accuracy and RT in each group: (a) the psycholinguistic properties of words probed in each trial, (b) the performance on each trial by two groups of semantically-impaired neuropsychological patients. Young people demonstrated poor performance for low frequency and abstract words, suggesting that they had difficulty processing words with intrinsically weak semantic representations. Indeed, performance in this group was strongly predicted by the performance of patients with semantic dementia, who suffer from degradation of semantic knowledge. In contrast, older adults performed poorly on trials where the target semantic relationship was weak and distractor relationships strong - conditions which require high levels of controlled processing. Their performance was not predicted by the performance of semantic dementia patients, but was predicted by the performance of patients with semantic control deficits. These findings indicate that the effects of ageing on semantic cognition are more complex than has previously been assumed. While older people have larger stores of knowledge than young people, they appear to be less skilled at exercising control over the activation of this knowledge.",

This means that the demand for mitochondrial supply is changing in space and time in neurons. Since the architecture ultimately determines the output performance of these organelles, we hypothesized that the ultrastructure of axonal mitochondria could well be a major parameter of adjusting their performance to the actual energetic needs of the synapse. Our results - describing a cell-type independent and synapse-specific correlation between mitochondrial ultrastructure, mitochondrial molecular fingerprints and synaptic performance - highlight the importance of activity-dependent ultrastructural plasticity of these organelles in neurons, and suggest an even more prominent role for mitochondria in neuroplasticity, than it was thought previously.\\n\\nABSTRACTMitochondrial function in neurons is tightly linked with metabolic and signalling mechanisms that ultimately determine neuronal performance. The subcellular distribution of these organelles is dynamically regulated as they are directed to axonal release sites on demand, but whether mitochondrial internal ultrastructure and molecular properties would reflect the actual performance requirements in a synapse-specific manner, remains to be established. Here, we examined performance-determining ultrastructural features of presynaptic mitochondria in GABAergic and glutamatergic axons of mice and human. Using electron-tomography and super-resolution microscopy we found, that these features were coupled to synaptic strength: mitochondria in boutons with high synaptic activity exhibited an ultrastructure optimized for high rate metabolism and contained higher levels of the respiratory chain protein cytochrome-c than mitochondria in boutons with lower activity. The strong, cell-type independent correlation between mitochondrial ultrastructure, molecular fingerprints and synaptic performance suggests that changes in synaptic activity could trigger ultrastructural plasticity of presynaptic mitochondria, likely to adjust their performance to the actual metabolic demand.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory bulb circuits are dominated by multiple inhibitory pathways that finely tune the activity of mitral and tufted cells, the principal neurons, and regulate odor discrimination. Granule cells mediate interglomerular lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells lateral dendrites whereas diverse subtypes of periglomerular (PG) cells mediate intraglomerular lateral inhibition between their apical dendrites. Deep short axon cells form broad intrabulbar inhibitory circuits that regulate both populations of interneurons. Little is known about the extrabulbar GABAergic circuits that control the activity of these various interneurons. We examined this question using patch-clamp recordings and optogenetics in olfactory bulb slices from transgenic mice. We show that axonal projections emanating from diverse basal forebrain GABAergic neurons densely project in all layers of the olfactory bulb. These long-range GABAergic projections provide a prominent synaptic input on granule and short axon cells in deep layers as well as on selective subtypes of PG cells. Specifically, three different subclasses of type 2 PG cells receive robust and target-specific basal forebrain inputs but have little local interactions with other PG cells. In contrast, type 1 PG cells are not innervated by basal forebrain fibers but do interact with other PG cells. Thus, attention-regulated basal forebrain inputs regulate inhibition in all layers of the olfactory bulb with a previously overlooked synaptic complexity that further defines interneuron subclasses.\n\nKey points summaryO_LIBasal forebrain long-range projections to the olfactory bulb are important for olfactory sensitivity and odor discrimination.\nC_LIO_LIUsing optogenetics, we confirm that basal forebrain afferents mediate IPSCs on granule and deep short axon cells.

    "abstract": "Preparing for a mentally demanding task calls upon cognitive and motivational resources. The underlying neural implementation of these mechanisms is receiving growing attention, given the implications for professional, social, and medical contexts. While several fMRI studies converge in assigning a crucial role to a cortico-subcortical network including Anterior Cigulate Cortex (ACC) and striatum, the involvement of Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) during mental effort anticipation has yet to be replicated. This study was designed to target DLPFC contribution using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), as a more cost-effective tool measuring cortical hemodynamics. We adapted a validated mental effort task, where participants performed easy and difficult mental calculation, while measuring DLPFC activity during the anticipation phase. As hypothesized, DLPFC activity increased during preparation for a hard task as compared to an easy task. Besides replicating a previous fMRI study, these results establish fNIRS as an effective tool to investigate cortical contributions to preparation for effortful behavior. This is especially useful if one requires testing large samples (e.g., to target individual differences), populations with contraindication for functional MRI (e.g., infants or patients with metal implants), or subjects in more naturalistic environments (e.g., work or sport).",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been proposed as a tool to draw causal inferences on the role of oscillatory activity in cognitive functioning and has the potential to induce long-term changes in cerebral networks. However, the mechanisms of action of tACS are not yet clear, though previous modeling works have suggested that variability may be mediated by local and network-level brain states. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record brain activity from 17 healthy participants as they kept their eyes open (EO) or closed (EC) while being stimulated either with sham, weak, or strong alpha-tACS using a montage commonly assumed to target occipital areas. We reconstructed the activity of sources in all stimulation conditions by means of beamforming. The analysis of resting-state data revealed an interaction of the external stimulation with the endogenous alpha power difference between EO and EC in the posterior cingulate. This region is remote from occipital cortex, which showed strongest EC vs. EO alpha modulation, thus suggesting state-dependency long-range effects of tACS. In a follow-up analysis of this online-tACS effect, we find evidence that this dependency effect could be mediated by functional network changes: connection strength from the precuneus, a region adjusting for a measure of network integration in the two states (EC vs. EO during no-tACS), was significantly correlated with the state-dependency effect in the posterior cingulate (during tACS). No analogous correlation could be found for alpha power modulations in occipital cortex. Altogether, this is the first strong evidence to illustrate how functional network architectures can shape tACS effects.",

    "abstract": "Quality of memory and sleep decline with age, but the mechanistic interactions underlying the memory function of sleep in older adults are still unknown. It is widely assumed that the beneficial effect of sleep on memory relies on reactivation during Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and targeting these reactivations by cue re-exposure reliably improves memory in younger participants. Here we tested whether the reactivation mechanism during sleep is still functional in old age by applying targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during NREM sleep in healthy adults over 60 years. In contrast to previous studies in young participants, older adults memories do not generally benefit from TMR during NREM sleep. On an individual level, a subgroup of older adults still profited from cueing during sleep. These improvers tended to have a better sleep efficiency than non-improvers. In addition, the oscillatory results resembled those obtained in younger participants, involving increases in theta (~6Hz) and spindle (~13 Hz) power for remembered and gained words in a later time windows. In contrast, non-improvers showed no increases in theta activity and even strongly reduced spindle power for later gained vs. lost words. Our results suggest that reactivations during sleep might lose their functionality for memory in some older adults, while this mechanism is still intact in a subgroup of participants. Further studies need to examine more closely the determinants of preserving the memory function of sleep during healthy aging.\\n\\nGrant informationThe study was supported by grant of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) No. 100014_162388.

    "abstract": "The spinal dorsal horn (SDH) is comprised of distinct neuronal populations that process different somatosensory modalities. Somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons in the SDH have been implicated specifically in mediating mechanical pain. Identifying the transcriptomic profile of SST neurons could elucidate the unique genetic features of this population and enable selective analgesic targeting. To that end, we combined the Isolation of Nuclei Tagged in Specific Cell Types (INTACT) method and Fluorescence Activated Nuclei Sorting (FANS) to capture tagged SST nuclei in the SDH of adult male mice. Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), we uncovered more than 13,000 genes. Differential gene expression analysis revealed more than 900 genes with at least 2-fold enrichment. In addition to many known dorsal horn genes, we identified and validated several novel transcripts from pharmacologically tractable functional classes: Carbonic Anhydrase 12 (Car12), Phosphodiesterase 11A (Pde11a), Protease-Activated Receptor 3 (F2rl2) and G-protein Coupled Receptor 26 (Gpr26). In situ hybridization of these novel genes revealed differential expression patterns in the SDH, demonstrating the presence of transcriptionally distinct subpopulations within the SST population. Pathway analysis revealed several enriched signaling pathways including cyclic AMP-mediated signaling, Nitric Oxide Synthase signaling, and voltage-gated calcium channels, highlighting the importance of these pathways to SST neuron function. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the gene repertoire of SST dorsal horn neurons and reveal several candidate targets for pharmacological modulation of this pain-mediating population.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSomatostatin(SST)-expressing interneurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are required for the perception of mechanical pain. Identifying the distinctive genes expressed by SST neurons could facilitate the development of novel, circuit-targeting analgesics. Thus, we applied cell type-specific RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to provide the first transcriptional profile of SST neurons in the SDH. Bioinformatic analysis revealed hundreds of genes enriched in SST neurons, including several previously undescribed genes from druggable classes (Car12, Pde11a, F2rl2 and Gpr26). Taken together, our study unveils a comprehensive transcriptional signature for SST neurons, highlights promising candidate genes for future analgesic development, and establishes a flexible method for transcriptional profiling of any spinal cord cell type.",

Using unbiased single nucleus RNA sequencing, we identify ten GABAergic interneuron subtypes with combinatorial gene signatures in human cortical layer 1 and characterize a novel group of human interneurons with anatomical features never described in rodents having large, \\\"rosehip\\\"-like axonal boutons and compact arborization. These rosehip cells show an immunohistochemical profile (GAD1/CCK-positive, CNR1/SST/CALB2/PVALB-negative) matching a single transcriptomically-defined cell type whose molecular signature is not seen in mouse cortex.

The polarisation dynamics of auxin efflux carriers PIN-FORMED (PIN) depends on both biomechanical forces as well as chemical, molecular and genetic factors. Biomechanical forces have shown to affect the localisation of PIN transporters to the plasma membrane. We proposed a biophysical module of PIN polarisation that integrates biomechanical, molecular, and cellular processes as well as their non-linear interactions. The module was implemented as a discrete Boolean model and then approximated to a continuous dynamic system, in order to explore the relative contribution of the factors mediating PIN polarisation at the scale of single cell. Our models recovered qualitative behaviours that have been experimentally observed and enabled us to postulate that, in the context of PIN polarisation, the effects of the mechanical forces can predominate over the activity of molecular factors such as the GTPase ROP6 and the CRIB-motif CRIB-motif RIC1.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMagnesium is believed to have a physiologic role in cardiac contractility, and evidence from epidemiologic and clinical studies has suggested that low serum concentrations of magnesium may be associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF).\\n\\nObjectiveAs part of the planning effort for a large randomized trial to prevent AF with magnesium supplementation, we conducted a 12-week pilot study to assess adherence to oral magnesium supplementation and matching placebo, estimate the effect on circulating magnesium concentrations, and evaluate the feasibility of using an ambulatory monitoring device (ZioPatch) for assessing premature atrial contractions (PACs), a predictor of AF.\\n\\nDesignDouble-blind randomized pilot clinical trial comparing supplementation with 400 mg magnesium oxide daily (versus placebo) over 12 weeks of follow-up. The ZioPatch was applied for 14 days at baseline and the end of follow-up. Adherence to the assigned treatment, and changes in PACs, serum magnesium concentration, glucose and blood pressure were assessed.\\n\\nResultsA total of 59 participants, 73% women and average age 62 years, were randomized. 98% of participants completed follow-up. Those assigned to the magnesium supplement took 75% of tablets as compared to 83% for those in the placebo group. Change in magnesium concentrations was significantly greater for those given magnesium supplement compared to placebo (0.07; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.12 mEq/L; p = 0.002). ZioPatch was worn for an average of 13.0 of the requested 14 days at baseline; at the end of follow-up, the average number of days of monitoring was 13.0 days for the magnesium supplement group and 12.7 days for the placebo group. For log PAC burden (episodes per hour), the average change from baseline was -0.05 (95% CI: -0.31, 0.20) for those randomized to magnesium supplement and 0.04 (95% CI: -0.24, 0.31) for those randomized to placebo (p=0.79 for difference). Gastrointestinal problems were reported by 50% of participants in the magnesium supplement group and 7% in the placebo group. Only one person in the magnesium supplement group and none in the placebo group experienced adverse events which led to treatment discontinuation.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this pilot randomized clinic trial, although gastrointestinal side effects to the magnesium supplement were common, adherence, measured by pill counts, was very good and, as a consequence, magnesium concentrations were greater for those randomly assigned to the magnesium supplement compared to placebo. Participant acceptance of the planned monitoring with ZioPatch was also very good. While the difference in the change in PACs was not significant, this pilot study was small, short-term, and did not include participants at high risk of AF. Thus, we could not reliably evaluate the effect of magnesium supplementation on PACs.\\n\\nClinicaltrials.gov registrationNCT02837328",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUninsured trauma patients have higher mortality than their insured counterparts. One possible reason is disparities in utilization of appropriate diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography (CT), X-ray, ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examined the association between lack of insurance and use of diagnostic imaging.\\n\\nMethodsData come from the National Trauma Databank 2010-2015. Patients were determined uninsured if payment mode was self-pay or missing. The primary outcome was any diagnostic imaging procedure, and secondary outcomes included CT, X-ray, US, or MRI. Risk ratios (RRs) were adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, injury characteristics, facility characteristics. We also used the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as an instrumental variable (IV), with linear terms for year to account for annual trends in imaging use. Monte carlo simulations to test effect of hypothetical violations to IV assumptions of relevance, no direct effect, and no confounding.\\n\\nResultsOf 4,373,554 patients, 953,281 (21.8%) were uninsured. After adjusting, uninsured patients had lower chance of any imaging (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.98 to 0.98), x-ray (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.00), and MRI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.83), and higher chance of ultrasound (RR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.02). In IV analysis, uninsured status was associated with reduction in any imaging (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.70), tomography (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.62) ultrasound (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.65), and MRI (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.37) and increased likelihood of x-ray use (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.32). Simulations indicated that a direct effect RD of -0.02 would be necessary to produce observed results under the null hypothesis.\\n\\nDiscussionOur study suggests an association between insurance status and use of imaging that is unlikely to be driven by confounding or violations of IV assumptions. Mechanisms for this remain unclear, but could include unconscious provider bias or institutional financial constraints. Further research is warranted to elucidate mechanisms and assess whether differences in diagnostic imaging use mediate the association between insurance and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Madagascar is known for its unique biodiversity including its endemic primates, the lemurs. This biodiversity is threatened by deforestation, forest degradation and anthropogenic disturbances. Several mouse lemurs (genus Microcebus) have been shown to cope with habitat disturbances and degradation. However, there are 24 recognized mouse lemur species living in very different habitats, and it is not clear whether all these species respond similarly to forest degradation. Here, we review the literature on mouse lemur use of degraded habitat. We further question whether mouse lemurs show variation in degraded habitat use, with respect to forest type, conservation status and distribution range. We show that data on degraded forest (DF) use is available for 14 species and geographically aggregated in a few locations. However, data are scarce for most species, and lacking for almost half of the currently recognized species. Our results however confirm that most mouse lemur species are able to cope with, but do not necessarily respond positively to habitat degradation. We found no variation in degraded habitat use, with respect to forest type, conservation status and distribution range. However, we identified food resources availability, understory structure, predation, and tree hole availability to be the most frequently invoked factors potentially influencing DF use. The relative frequency of these four factors vary among forest types suggesting that differences may exist but still require research efforts for ecological and environmental differences among regions to be fully understood.\\n\\nRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSO_LILittle differences in the use of degraded forest (DF) between forest types, distribution ranges or conservation status.\\nC_LIO_LIVarying factors potentially affecting DF use, such as food resources, forest structure, tree hole availability and predation.\\nC_LI",

Here, we report the genome and annotation of S. pimpinellifolium  LA0480. The  LA0480 genome size (811 Mb) and the number of annotated genes (25,970) are within the range observed for other sequenced tomato species. We developed and utilized the Dragon Eukaryotic Analyses Platform (DEAP) to functionally annotate the  LA0480 protein-coding genes. Additionally, we used DEAP to compare protein function between S. pimpinellifolium and cultivated tomato. Our data suggest enrichment in genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Moreover, we present phenotypic data from one field experiment that demonstrate a greater salinity tolerance for fruit-and yield-related traits in S. pimpinellifolium compared with cultivated tomato. To understand the genomic basis for these differences in S. pimpinellifolium and S. lycopersicum, we analyzed 15 genes that have previously been shown to mediate salinity tolerance in plants. We show that S. pimpinellifolium has a higher copy number of the inositol-3-phosphate synthase and phosphatase genes, which are both key enzymes in the production of inositol and its derivatives. Moreover, our analysis indicates that changes occurring in the inositol phosphate pathway may contribute to the observed higher salinity tolerance in  LA0480. Altogether, our work provides essential resources to understand and unlock the genetic and breeding potential of S. pimpinellifolium, and to discover the genomic basis underlying its environmental robustness.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle comprises a family of diverse tissues with highly specialized morphology, function, and metabolism. Many acquired diseases - including HIV, COPD, cancer cachexia, critical illness myopathy, and sepsis - affect specific muscles while sparing others. Even monogenic muscular dystrophies tend to selectively affect certain muscle groups, despite their causative genetic mutations being present in all tissues. These observations suggest that factors intrinsic to muscle tissues influence their susceptibility to various disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, most studies have not addressed transcriptional diversity among skeletal muscles. Here we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile global mRNA expression in a wide array of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle tissues from mice and rats. Our data set, MuscleDB, reveals extensive transcriptional diversity, with greater than 50% of transcripts differentially expressed among skeletal muscle tissues. This diversity is only partly explained by fiber type composition and developmental history, suggesting that specialized transcriptional profiles establish the functional identity of muscle tissues. We find conservation in the transcriptional profiles across species as well as between males and females, indicating that these data may be useful in predicting gene expression in related species. Notably, thousands of differentially expressed genes in skeletal muscle are associated with human disease, and hundreds of these genes encode targets of drugs on the market today. We detect mRNA expression of hundreds of putative myokines that may underlie the endocrine functions of skeletal muscle. In addition to demonstrating the intrinsic diversity of skeletal muscles, these data provide a resource for generating testable hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that establish differential disease susceptibility in muscle.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSkeletal muscles are a diverse family of tissues with a common contractile function but divergent morphology, development, and metabolism. One need only reflect on the different functions of limb muscles and the diaphragm to realize the highly specialized nature of these tissues. Nevertheless, every study of global gene expression has analyzed at most one representative skeletal muscle. Here we measure gene expression from 11 different skeletal muscles in mice and rats. We show that there is no such thing as a representative skeletal muscle, as gene expression profiles vary widely among the tissues analyzed. These data are an important resource for pharmacologists, tissue engineers, and investigators studying the mechanisms of cellular specialization.",

    "abstract": "Graphs are commonly used to represent sets of sequences. Either edges or nodes can be labeled by sequences, so that each path in the graph spells a concatenated sequence. Examples include graphs to represent genome assemblies, such as string graphs and de Bruijn graphs, and graphs to represent a pan-genome and hence the genetic variation present in a population. Being able to align sequencing reads to such graphs is a key step for many analyses and its applications include genome assembly, read error correction, and variant calling with respect to a variation graph. Given the wide range of applications of this basic problem, it is surprising that algorithms with optimal runtime are, to the best of our knowledge, yet unknown. In particular, aligning sequences to cyclic graphs currently represents a challenge both in theory and practice. Here, we introduce an algorithm to compute the minimum edit distance of a sequence of length m to any path in a node-labeled directed graph (V, E) in O(|V |+m|E|) time and O(|V |) space. The corresponding alignment can be obtained in the same runtime using [Formula] space. The time complexity depends only on the length of the sequence and the size of the graph. In particular, it does not depend on the cyclicity of the graph, or any other topological features.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic RNA molecules are increasingly used to alter cellular functions. These successful applications indicate that RNA-based therapeutics might be able to target currently undruggable genes. However, to achieve this promise, an effective method for delivering therapeutic RNAs into specific cells is required. Recently, RNA aptamers emerged as promising delivery agents due to their ability of binding specific cell receptors. Crucially, these aptamers can frequently be internalized into the cells expressing these receptors on their surfaces. This property is leveraged in aptamer based drug delivery systems by combining such receptor-specific aptamers with a therapeutic \\\"cargo\\\" such that the aptamer facilitates the internalization of the cargo into the cell. The advancement of this technology however is contingent on an efficient method to produce stable molecular complexes that include specific aptamers and cargoes. A recently proposed experimental procedure for obtaining such complexes relies on conjugating the aptamer and the cargo with complementary RNA strands so that when such modified molecules are incubated together, the complementary RNA strands hybridize to form a double-stranded \\\"sticky bridge\\\" connecting the aptamer with its cargo. However, designing appropriate sticky bridge sequences guaranteeing the formation and stability of the complex while simultaneously not interfering with the aptamer or the cargo as well as not causing spurious aggregation of the molecules during incubation has proven highly challenging. To fill this gap, we developed AptaBlocks, a computational method to design sticky bridges to connect RNA-based molecules (blocks). AptaBlocks relies on a biophysically inspired theoretical model capturing the complex objectives of the design and yet is simple enough to allow for efficient parameter estimation. Given this model, the sticky bridge sequence is optimized using a Monte Carlo algorithm based on heat-bath transitions. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been verified computationally and experimentally. AptaBlocks can be used in variety of experimental settings and its preliminary version has already been leveraged to design an aptamer based delivery system for a cytotoxic drug targeting Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. It is thus expected that AptaBlocks will play a substantial role in accelerating RNA-based drug delivery design.\\n\\nAptaBlocks is available at https://github.com/wyjhxq/AptaBlocks.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen genome sequencing can reveal details of transmission histories and is a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. In particular, within-host pathogen genomic variants identified through heterozygous nucleotide base calls are a potential source of information to identify linked cases and infer direction and time of transmission. However, using such data effectively to model disease transmission presents a number of challenges, including differentiating genuine variants from those observed due to sequencing error, as well as the specification of a realistic model for within-host pathogen population dynamics.\\n\\nHere we propose a new Bayesian approach to transmission inference, BadTrIP (BAyesian epiDemiological TRansmission Inference from Polymorphisms), that explicitly models evolution of pathogen populations in an outbreak, transmission (including transmission bottlenecks), and sequencing error. BadTrIP enables the inference of host-to-host transmission from pathogen sequencing data and epidemiological data. By assuming that genomic variants are unlinked, our method does not require the computationally intensive and unreliable reconstruction of individual haplotypes. Using simulations we show that BadTrIP is robust in most scenarios and can accurately infer transmission events by efficiently combining information from genetic and epidemiological sources; thanks to its realistic model of pathogen evolution and the inclusion of epidemiological data, BadTrIP is also more accurate than existing approaches. BadTrIP is distributed as an open source package (https://bitbucket.org/nicofmay/badtrip) for the phylogenetic software BEAST2.\\n\\nWe apply our method to reconstruct transmission history at the early stages of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, showcasing the power of within-host genomic variants to reconstruct transmission events.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe present a new tool to reconstruct transmission events within outbreaks. Our approach makes use of pathogen genetic information, notably genetic variants at low frequency within host that are usually discarded, and combines it with epidemiological information of host exposure to infection. This leads to accurate reconstruction of transmission even in cases where abundant within-host pathogen genetic variation and weak transmission bottlenecks (multiple pathogen units colonising a new host at transmission) would otherwise make inference difficult due to the transmission history differing from the pathogen evolution history inferred from pathogen isolets. Also, the use of within-host pathogen genomic variants increases the resolution of the reconstruction of the transmission tree even in scenarios with limited within-outbreak pathogen genetic diversity: within-host pathogen populations that appear identical at the level of consensus sequences can be discriminated using within-host variants. Our Bayesian approach provides a measure of the confidence in different possible transmission histories, and is published as open source software. We show with simulations and with an analysis of the beginning of the 2014 Ebola outbreak that our approach is applicable in many scenarios, improves our understanding of transmission dynamics, and will contribute to finding and limiting sources and routes of transmission, and therefore preventing the spread of infectious disease.",

    "abstract": "Plasma proteins and activated immune cells are known contributors of vascular brain disorders. However, the mechanisms and routes involved are still unclear. In order to understand the cross-talk between plasma proteins and the brain, we knocked down circulating C1 inhibitor (C1INH) in wild-type (WT) mice using antisense-oligonucleotide (ASO) technique and examined the brain. C1INH is a plasma protein inhibitor of vascular inflammation induced by activation of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) and the complement system. This knockdown induced the activation of the KKS but spared the activation of the classical complement system. Activation of the KKS induced an upregulation of the bradykinin pathway in the periphery and the brain, resulting in hypotension. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, plasma protein extravasations, activated glial cells and elevated levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and iNOS were detected in brains of C1INH ASO treated mice. Infiltrating innate immune cells were evident, entering the brain through the lateral ventricle walls and the neurovascular units. The mice showed normal motor functions, however, cognition was impaired. Altogether, our results highlight the important role of regulated plasma-C1INH as a gatekeeper of the neurovascular system. Thus, manipulation of C1INH in neurovascular disorders might be therapeutically beneficial.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfter many years of concentrated research efforts, the exact cause of Crohns disease remains unknown. Its accurate diagnosis, however, helps in management and even preventing the onset of disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified 140 loci associated with CD, but these carry very small log odds ratios and are uninformative for diagnoses.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe a machine learning method - AVA,Dx (Analysis of Variation for Association with Disease) - that uses whole exome sequencing data to make predictions of CD status. Using the person-specific variation in these genes from a panel of only 111 individuals, we built disease-prediction models informative of previously undiscovered disease genes. In this panel, our models differentiate CD patients from healthy controls with 71% precision and 73% recall at the default cutoff. By additionally accounting for batch effects, we are also able to predict individual CD status for previously unseen individuals from a separate CD study (84% precision, 73% recall).\\n\\nConclusionsLarger training panels and additional features, including regulatory variants and environmental factors, e.g. human-associated microbiota, are expected to improve model performance. However, current results already position AVA,Dx as both an effective method for highlighting pathogenesis pathways and as a simple Crohns disease risk analysis tool, which can improve clinical diagnostic time and accuracy.",

While untargeted profiling methods can measure up to thousands of metabolite signals in a single experiment, many signals cannot be readily identified as known metabolites or compared across datasets, making it difficult to infer biology and to conduct well-powered meta-analyses across studies. To deal with these challenges, we developed a suite of computational methods, PAIRUP-MS, to match metabolite signals across mass spectrometry-based profiling datasets using an imputation-based approach and to generate pathway annotations for these signals. We performed meta and pathway analyses for both known and unknown signals in multiple datasets and then validated the results using genetic associations.

    "abstract": "Prenatal exposure to maternal stress and depression has been identified as a risk factor for adverse behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood. However, the molecular mechanisms through which maternal psychopathology shapes offspring development remain poorly understood. We applied transcriptome-wide screens to 149 umbilical cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n=20), depression (n=31) and PTSD with comorbid depression (n=13), compared to carefully matched trauma exposed controls (n=23) and healthy mothers (n=62). Analyses by maternal diagnoses revealed a clear pattern of gene expression signatures distinguishing neonates born to mothers with a history of psychopathology from those without. Co-expression network analysis identified distinct gene expression perturbations across maternal diagnoses, including two depression-related modules implicated in axon-guidance and mRNA stability, as well as two PTSD-related modules implicated in TNF signaling and cellular response to stress. Notably, these disease-related modules were enriched with brain-expressed genes and genetic risk loci for autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, which may imply a causal role for impaired developmental outcomes. These molecular alterations preceded changes in clinical measures at twenty-four months, including reductions in cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes in affected infants. Collectively, these findings indicate that prenatal exposure to maternal psychological distress induces neuronal, immunological and behavioral abnormalities in affected offspring and support the search for early biomarkers of exposures to adverse in utero environments and the classification of children at risk for impaired development.",

In this study, we investigate the influence of the LAB Oenococcus oeni and the spoilage yeast Brettanomyces bruxellensis on the microbial community of a Cabernet Sauvignon wine. We generated metagenomic datasets from inoculations of three strains of B. bruxellensis, in combination with two O. oeni strains, one with and one without cinnamoyl esterase activity. This esterase activity releases hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) that can subsequently be processed by some B. bruxellensis strains able to generate off-flavor compounds. We evaluated the influence of the O. oeni and B. bruxellensis on the microbial taxonomic and functional potential profile, particularly regarding off-flavor formation due to HCAs. We found that the effect on the microbial profiles depends on i) the O. oeni and B. bruxellensis strains being combined and ii) the abundance they reach in the final wine, which depends on certain unidentified conditions. We confirmed that the potential of B. bruxellensis to produce off-flavor compounds from HCAs depends on the strain. Interestingly, the samples without microbial inoculants also had this potential, suggesting that native grape microbiota could also influence the levels of HCA. We also found that the presence of B. bruxellensis does not interfere with the malolactic fermentation of the evaluated O. oeni strains, which leads to a less acidic taste. We show that metagenomic approaches can help uncover the complex wine microbial community traits, such as flavor, impacted by the simultaneous presence of O. oeni and B. bruxellensis.",

    "abstract": "Modern molecular evolutionary studies suggest the freshwater origin of cyanobacteria during the late Archean, about 2.7 Ga ago, with an even earlier evolution of oxidative photosynthesis. The large amount of oxygen required to oxygenate the Earths atmosphere during the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) ~2.4 Ga is thought to have been produced by large cyanobacterial blooms in the open ocean. This then poses the question as to whether ancient lineages of cyanobacteria would have survived the salinity transition. This study investigates the effect of increasing salinity on the photosynthetic efficiency of two modern day descendants of ancient cyanobacteria, Chroococidiopsis thermalis PCC7203 and the root species, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC7421. Organisms were cultured in fresh, brackish or sea water analogous media under a present atmospheric level (PAL) atmosphere or an atmosphere with reduced O2 and elevated CO2 (rO2eCO2). The net photosynthesis (NP) rates were determined in liquid cultures, while the O2 and redox profiles were determined in pseudomats. While C. thermalis PCC7203 was able to grow under increasing salinities under both atmospheres tested, G. violaceus PCC7421 could not make the salinity change to sea water. NP rates were reduced for C. thermalis under increasing salinities, as were the levels of dissolved O2 in the media. A gene screen indicated that C. thermalis genome carries genes for both sucrose and trehalose synthesis, whereas G. violaceus has only the later genetic component, suggesting a mechanism for their differing salt tolerances. This study supports the hypothesis of Cyanobacterial evolution in freshwater environments and their transition into increasingly salty environments during the late Archaean, prior to the GOE.",

    "abstract": "For decades, researchers have lacked the ability to rapidly correlate microbial identity with bacterial metabolism. Since specialized metabolites are critical to bacterial function and survival in the environment, we designed a data acquisition and bioinformatics technique (IDBac) that utilizes in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra of single bacterial colonies from agar plates. We demonstrated the power of our approach by discriminating between two Bacillus subtilis colonies in under 30 minutes, which differ by a single genomic mutation, solely on the basis of their differential ability to produce cyclic peptide antibiotics surfactin and plipastatin. Next, we employed our IDBac technique to detect subtle intra-species differences in the production of metal scavenging acyl-desferrioxamines in a group of eight freshwater Micromonospora isolates that share >99% sequence similarity in the 16S rRNA gene. Finally, we employed our method to simultaneously extract protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles from unidentified species of Lake Michigan sponge-associated bacteria cultivated on an agar plate. In just 3 hours, we created hierarchical protein MS groupings of 11 environmental isolates (10 MS replicates each, for a total of 110 samples) that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings. We further distinguished isolates within these groupings, which share nearly identical 16S rRNA gene sequence identity, based on inter- and intra-species differences in specialized metabolite production. To our knowledge, IDBac is the first attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production to allow the distinction of closely related bacterial colonies.\\n\\nSignificanceMass spectrometry is a powerful technique that has been used to identify bacteria via protein content, and to assess bacterial function in an environment via analysis of specialized metabolites. However, until now these analyses have operated independently, and this has resulted in the inability to rapidly connect bacterial phylogenetic identity with patterns of specialized metabolism. To bridge this gap, we designed a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data acquisition and bioinformatics pipeline (IDBac) to discriminate both intact protein and specialized metabolite spectra directly from bacterial cells grown on agar. To our knowledge, this is the first technique that organizes bacteria into highly similar phylogenetic groups and allows for comparison of metabolic differences of hundreds of isolates in just a few hours.",

The most studied such collision-detecting neuron within the optic lobe of grasshoppers has long served as a model for understanding collision avoidance behaviors and their underlying neural computations. Here, we demonstrate that this neuron detects the spatial coherence of a simulated impending object, thereby carrying out a computation akin to object segmentation critical for proper escape behavior. At the cellular level, object segmentation relies on a precise selection of the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic inputs by dendritic membrane potential-activated channels. One channel type linked to dendritic computations in many neural systems, the hyperpolarization-activated cation channel, HCN, plays a central role in this computation as its pharmacological block abolishes the neuron's spatial selectivity and impairs the generation of visually guided escape behaviors, making it directly relevant to survival. Our results elucidate how active dendritic channels produce neuronal and behavioral object specificity by discriminating between complex spatiotemporal synaptic activation patterns.",

Here, we examined training-dependent and off-line changes of two sub-processes of procedural learning: namely, sequence learning and statistical learning. Whereas sequence learning requires the acquisition of order-based relationships between the elements of a sequence, statistical learning is based on the acquisition of probabilistic associations between elements. Seventy-eight healthy young adults (58 females and 20 males) completed the modified version of the Alternating Serial Reaction Time task that was designed to measure Sequence and Statistical Learning simultaneously. After training, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: active wakefulness, quiet rest, or daytime sleep. We examined off-line changes in Sequence and Statistical Learning as well as further improvements after extended practice. Performance in Sequence Learning increased during training, while Statistical Learning plateaued relatively rapidly. After the off-line period, both the acquired sequence and statistical knowledge was preserved, irrespective of the vigilance state (awake, quiet rest or sleep). Sequence Learning further improved during extended practice, while Statistical Learning did not. Moreover, within the sleep group, cortical oscillations and sleep spindle parameters showed differential associations with Sequence and Statistical Learning. Our findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamic changes of multiple parallel learning and consolidation processes that occur during procedural memory formation.",

    "abstract": "The sensory recruitment hypothesis states that visual short term memory is maintained in the same visual cortical areas that initially encode a stimulus features. Although it is well established that the distance between features in visual cortex determines their visibility, a limitation known as crowding, it is unknown whether short term memory is similarly constrained by the cortical spacing of memory items. Here we investigated whether the cortical spacing between sequentially presented memoranda affects the fidelity of memory in humans (of both sexes). In a first experiment, we varied cortical spacing by taking advantage of the log-scaling of visual cortex with eccentricity, sequentially presenting memoranda in peripheral vision along either the radial or tangential visual axis with respect to the fovea. In a second experiment, we sequentially presented memoranda either within or beyond the critical spacing of visual crowding, a distance within which visual features cannot be perceptually distinguished due to their nearby cortical representations. In both experiments and across multiple measures, we found strong evidence that the ability to maintain visual features in memory is unaffected by cortical spacing. These results indicate that the neural architecture underpinning working memory has properties inconsistent with the known behaviour of sensory neurons in visual cortex. Instead, the dissociation between perceptual and memory representations supports a role of higher cortical areas, such as posterior parietal or prefrontal regions, or may involve an as yet unspecified mechanism in visual cortex in which stimulus features are bound to their temporal order.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAlthough much is known about the resolution with which we can remember visual objects, the cortical representation of items held in short term memory remains contentious. A popular hypothesis suggests that memory of visual features is maintained via the recruitment of the same neural architecture in sensory cortex that encodes stimuli. We investigated this claim by manipulating the spacing in visual cortex between sequentially presented memoranda such that some items shared cortical representations more than others, while preventing perceptual interference between stimuli. We found clear evidence that short term memory is independent of the intra-cortical spacing of memoranda, revealing a dissociation between perceptual and memory representations. Our data indicate that working memory relies on different neural mechanisms from sensory perception.",

    "abstract": "Fast synaptic inhibition in the nervous system depends on the transmembrane flux of Cl- ions based on the neuronal Cl- driving force. Established theories regarding the determinants of Cl- driving force have recently been questioned. Here we present biophysical models of Cl- homeostasis using the pump-leak model. Using numerical and novel analytic solutions, we demonstrate that the Na+/K+-ATPase, ion conductances, impermeant anions, electrodiffusion, water fluxes and cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play roles in setting the Cl- driving force. Our models, together with experimental validation, show that while impermeant anions can contribute to setting [Cl-]i in neurons, they have a negligible effect on the driving force for Cl- locally and cell-wide. In contrast, we demonstrate that CCCs are well-suited for modulating Cl- driving force and hence inhibitory signalling in neurons. Our findings reconcile recent experimental findings and provide a framework for understanding the interplay of different chloride regulatory processes in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome condensation by condensin is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. Metazoans have two complexes, named condensin I and II. Both are thought to act by creating looped structures in DNA, but how they do so is unknown. Condensins SMC subunits together form a composite ATPase with two pseudo-symmetric ATPase sites. We reveal that these sites have opposite functions in the condensation process. One site drives condensation, while the other site rather has a dampening function. Mutation of this dampener site hyperactivates both condensin I and II complexes. We find that hyperactive condensin I efficiently shortens chromosomes in the total absence of condensin II. The two complexes form loops with different lengths, and specifically condensin II is key to the decatenation of sister chromatids and the formation of a straight chromosomal axis.",
