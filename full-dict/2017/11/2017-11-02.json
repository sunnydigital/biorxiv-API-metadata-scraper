    "abstract": "Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed \\\"Ouija\\\" that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify \\\"metastable\\\" states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories - that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods. An open source implementation is available at http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/ouija as an R package and at http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/ouijaflow as a Python/TensorFlow package.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in a microbial population can increase the frequency of a genotype not only by increasing its exponential growth rate, but also by decreasing its lag time or adjusting the yield (resource efficiency). The contribution of multiple life-history traits to selection is a critical question for evolutionary biology as we seek to predict the evolutionary fates of mutations. Here we use a model of microbial growth to show there are two distinct components of selection corresponding to the growth and lag phases, while the yield modulates their relative importance. The model predicts rich population dynamics when there are tradeo[ff]s between phases: multiple strains can coexist or exhibit bistability due to frequency-dependent selection, and strains can engage in rock-paper-scissors interactions due to non-transitive selection. We characterize the environmental conditions and patterns of traits necessary to realize these phenomena, which we show to be readily accessible to experiments. Our results provide a theoretical framework for analyzing high-throughput measurements of microbial growth traits, especially interpreting the pleiotropy and correlations between traits across mutants. This work also highlights the need for more comprehensive measurements of selection in simple microbial systems, where the concept of an ordinary fitness landscape breaks down.",

    "abstract": "The nature of capacity limits for visual working memory has been the subject of an intense debate that has relied on models that assume items are encoded independently. Here we propose that instead, similar features are jointly encoded through a \\\"chunking\\\" process to optimize performance on visual working memory tasks. We show that such chunking can: 1) facilitate performance improvements for abstract capacity-limited systems, 2) be optimized through reinforcement, 3) be implemented by center-surround dynamics, and 4) increase effective storage capacity at the expense of recall precision. Human performance on a variant of a canonical working memory task demonstrated performance advantages, precision detriments, inter-item dependencies, and trial-to-trial behavioral adjustments diagnostic of performance optimization through center-surround chunking. Models incorporating center-surround chunking provided a better quantitative description of human performance in our study as well as in a meta-analytic dataset, and apparent differences in working memory capacity across individuals were attributable to individual differences in the implementation of chunking. Our results reveal a normative rationale for center-surround connectivity in working memory circuitry, call for re-evaluation of memory performance differences that have previously been attributed to differences in capacity, and support a more nuanced view of visual working memory capacity limitations: strategic tradeoff between storage capacity and memory precision through chunking contribute to flexible capacity limitations that include both discrete and continuous aspects.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful high-throughput technique that enables researchers to measure genome-wide transcription levels at the resolution of single cells. Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfers between ancient species contain information about the relative timing of species diversification. Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers is detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result, often, no ranking of the species tree is compatible with the full set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers. Here we propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of (possibly inconsistent) time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum cumulated confidence score. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the potential of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency. MaxTiC is freely available, distributed along with a documentation and several examples: https://github.com/ssolo/ALE/tree/master/maxtic.",

    "abstract": "Several techniques have been developed in Drosophila to control gene expression temporally. While some of these techniques are incompatible with existing GAL4 lines, others suffer from side effects on physiology or behavior. Here, we describe a method of post-translational temporal control of gene expression which is compatible with the current library of transgenic reagents. We adopted a strategy to regulate protein degradation by fusing a protein of interest to a destabilizing domain (DD) derived from the Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR). Trimethoprim (TMP), a stabilizing small molecule, binds to DD and blocks degradation of the chimeric protein. With a GFP-DD reporter, we show that this system is effective across different tissues and developmental stages in the fly. Notably, feeding flies with TMP can increase the expression level of GFP-DD up to 34 times in a dosage-dependent and reversible manner without altering the lifespan or behavior of the animal. To broaden the utility of our method, we engineered GAL80-DD flies that can be crossed to the available GAL4 lines to control the temporal pattern of gene expression with TMP. We also developed an inducible recombinase, FLP-DD, for high-efficiency sparse labeling and intersectional lineage analysis. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the DD system in manipulating neuronal activity of sensory neurons. In summary, we have developed a system to control in vivo gene expression levels with negligible background, large dynamic range, and in a reversible manner, all by feeding a small molecule to Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Human sociality depends upon the benefits of mutual aid and extensive communication. However, diverse norms and preferences complicate mutual aid, and ambiguity in meaning hinders communication. Here we demonstrate that these two problems can work together to enhance cooperation through the strategic use of deliberately ambiguous signals: covert signaling. Covert signaling is the transmission of information that is accurately received by its intended audience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow coordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or hostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the empirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling, such as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics. We introduce a novel mathematical model to assess when a covert signaling strategy will evolve, as well as how receiver attitudes coevolve with covert signals. Covert signaling plausibly serves an important function in facilitating within-group cooperative assortment by allowing individuals to pair up with similar group members when possible and to get along with dissimilar ones when necessary. This mechanism has broad implications for theories of signaling and cooperation, humor, social identity, political psychology, and the evolution of human cultural complexity.",

After a systematic review of the literature we included 65 E. coli whole genome sequences (WGS), adding 6 recently sequenced travel related isolates, and 312 MLST profiles. We included 219 MGEs described in 7 Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from human, animal and environmental samples. Despite a high overall diversity, 2 lineages were observed in the E. coli population that may function as reservoirs of the mcr-1 gene, the largest of which was linked to ST10, a sequence type known for its ubiquity in human faecal samples and in food samples. No genotypic clustering by geographical origin or isolation source was observed. Amongst a total of 13 plasmid incompatibility types, the Incl2, lncX4 and IncHI2 plasmids accounted for more than 90% of MGEs carrying the mcr-1 gene. We observed significant geographical clustering with regional spread of lncHI2 plasmids in Europe and Incl2 in Asia. These findings point towards promiscuous spread of the mcr-1 gene by efficient horizontal gene transfer dominated by a limited number of plasmid incompatibility types.",

In this paper, we explore the effects of partial selfing on the equilibrium genetic variance Vg, mutation load L and inbreeding depression{delta} under stabilizing selection acting on a arbitrary number n of quantitative traits coded by biallelic loci with additive effects. Overall, our model predicts a decrease in the equilibrium genetic variance with increasing selfing rates; however, the relationship between self-fertilization and the variables of interest depends on the strength of associations between loci, and three different regimes are observed. When the U/n ratio is low (where U is the total haploid mutation rate on selected traits) and effective recombination rates are sufficiently high, genetic associations between loci are negligible and the genetic variance, mutation load and inbreeding depression are well predicted by approximations based on single-locus models. For higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, moderate genetic associations generated by epistasis tend to increase Vg, L and{delta} , this regime being well predicted by approximations including the effects of pairwise associations between loci. For yet higher values of U/n and/or lower effective recombination, a different regime is reached under which the maintenance of coadapted gene complexes reduces Vg, L and{delta} . Simulations indicate that the values of Vg, L and{delta} are little affected by assumptions regarding the number of possible alleles per locus.",

Observed spectral features (peaks) that are not isotopologues do not directly correspond to known compounds and cannot be placed into existing metabolic networks. Spectral artifacts account for many of these unidentified peaks, and misassignments made to these artifact peaks can create large interpretative errors. Without accurate identification of artifactual features and correct assignment of real features, discerning their roles within living systems is effectively impossible.\\n\\nWe have observed three types of artifacts unique to FT-MS that often result in regions of abnormally high peak density (HPD), which we collectively refer to as HPD artifacts: i) fuzzy sites representing small regions of m/z space with a  fuzzy appearance due to the extremely high number of peaks present; ii) ringing due to a very intense peak producing side bands of decreasing intensity that are symmetrically distributed around the main peak; and iii) partial ringing where only a subset of the side bands are observed for an intense peak. Fuzzy sites and partial ringing appear to be novel artifacts previously unreported in the literature and we hypothesize that all three artifact types derive from Fourier transformation-based issues. In some spectra, these artifacts account for roughly a third of the peaks present in the given spectrum.

In plants, SSRs serve as a source of important class of molecular markers because of their hypervariabile and co-dominant nature, making them useful both for the genetic studies and marker-assisted breeding. The SSRs are widespread throughout the genome of an organism, so that a large number of SSR datasets are available, most of them from either protein-coding regions or untranslated regions. It is only recently, that their occurrence within microRNAs (miRNA) genes has received attention. As is widely known, miRNA themselves are a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with varying length of 19-22 nucleotides (nts), which play an important role in regulating gene expression in plants under different biotic and abiotic stresses. In this communication, we describe the results of a study, where miRNA-SSRs in full length pre-miRNA sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana were mined. The sequences were retrieved by annotations available at EnsemblPlants using BatchPrimer3 server with miRNA-SSR flanking primers found to be well distributed. Our analysis shows that miRNA-SSRs are relatively rare in protein-coding regions but abundant in non-coding region. All the observed 147 di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide SSRs were located in non-coding regions of all the 5 chromosomes of A. thaliana. While we confirm that miRNA-SSRs were commonly spread across the full length pre-miRNAs, we envisage that such studies would allow us to identify newly discovered markers for breeding studies.",

    "abstract": "Nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM-2) powers cell motility and tissue morphogenesis by assembling into bipolar filaments that interact with actin. Although the enzymatic properties of purified NM-2 motor fragments have been determined, the emergent properties of filament ensembles are unknown. Using single myosin filament in vitro motility assays, we report fundamental differences in filaments formed of different NM-2 motors. Filaments consisting of NM2-B moved processively along actin, while under identical conditions, NM2-A filaments did not. By more closely mimicking the physiological milieu, either by increasing solution viscosity or by copolymerization with NM2-B, NM2-A containing filaments moved processively. Our data demonstrate that both the kinetic and mechanical properties of these two myosins, in addition to the stochiometry of NM-2 subunits, can tune filament mechanical output. We propose altering NM-2 filament composition is a general cellular strategy for tailoring force production of filaments to specific functions such as maintaining tension or remodeling actin.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBread wheat has a large complex genome that makes whole genome resequencing costly. Therefore, genome complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture make re-sequencing cost effective. With a high-quality draft wheat genome now available it is possible to design capture probe sets and to use them to accurately genotype and anchor SNPs to the genome. Furthermore, in addition to genetic variation, epigenetic variation provides a source of natural variation contributing to changes in gene expression and phenotype that can be profiled at the base pair level using sequence capture coupled with bisulphite treatment. Here, we present a new 12 Mbp wheat capture probe set, that allows both the profiling of genotype and methylation from the same DNA sample. Furthermore, we present a method, based on Agilent SureSelect Methyl-Seq, that will use a single capture assay as a starting point to allow both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq.\\n\\nResultsOur method uses a single capture assay that is sequentially split and used for both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. The resultant genotype and epi-type data is highly comparable in terms of coverage and SNP/methylation site identification to that generated from separate captures for DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. Furthermore, by defining SNP frequencies in a diverse landrace from the Watkins collection we highlight the importance of having genotype data to prevent false positive methylation calls. Finally, we present the design of a new 12 Mbp wheat capture and demonstrate its successful application to re-sequence wheat.\\n\\nConclusionWe present a cost-effective method for performing both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq from a single capture reaction thus reducing reagent costs, sample preparation time and DNA requirements for these complementary analyses.",

    "abstract": "In most systems, dispersal occurs despite clear fitness costs to dispersing individuals. Theory posits that spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality pushes dispersal rates to evolve towards zero, while temporal heterogeneity in habitat quality favours non-zero dispersal rates. One aspect of dispersal evolution that has received a great deal of recent attention is a process known as spatial sorting, which has been referred to as a \\\"shy younger sibling\\\" of natural selection. More precisely, spatial sorting is the process whereby variation in dispersal ability is sorted along density clines and will, in nature, often be a transient phenomenon. Despite this transience, spatial sorting is likely a general mechanism behind non-zero dispersal in spatiotemporally varying environments. While generally transient, spatial sorting is persistent on invasion fronts, where its effect cannot be ignored, causing rapid evolution of traits related to dispersal. Spatial sorting is described in several elegant models, yet these models require a high level of mathematical sophistication and are not accessible to most evolutionary biologists or their students. Here, we frame spatial sorting in terms of the classic haploid and diploid models of natural selection. We show that, on an invasion front, spatial sorting can be conceptualized precisely as selection operating through space rather than (as with natural selection) time, and that genotypes can be viewed as having both spatial and temporal aspects of fitness. The resultant model is strikingly similar to classic models of natural selection. This similarity renders the model easy to understand (and to teach), but also suggests that many established theoretical results around natural selection could apply equally to spatial sorting.",

A comparative analysis of Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) distances was accomplished using sequence divergences of Cobitoidea to calculate intra and interspecific in superfamily, family and genus taxa. The average intraspecific K2P genetic distances of Choman loaches species was 0.005 whereas this value was 0.016 for the Cobitoidea superfamily. Molecular phylogenetic relationships were assessed using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Dendrograms obtained by these methods revealed all four Choman loaches species as distinct species among other reported Nemacheilidae Spp. These species were clustered with Oxynoemacheilus and Turcinoemacheilus genera within other species in the Nemacheilidae family. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that Cobitoidea superfamily consists of nine families ((Gyrinocheilidae + Botiidae) + ((Catostomidae + Vaillentellidae) + ((Nemacheilidae + Cobitidae) + ((Ellopostomidae + Gastromyzontidae) + Balitoridae)))) and indicated Nemacheilidae is a valid and distinct family from Balitoridae.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, the exact ways in which the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) influences cognitive function have remained mysterious. Anatomically, the OFC is characterized by remarkably broad connectivity to sensory, limbic and subcortical areas, and functional studies have implicated the OFC in a plethora of functions ranging from facial processing to value-guided choice. Notwithstanding such diversity of findings, much research suggests that one important function of the OFC is to support decision making and reinforcement learning. Here, we describe a novel theory that posits that OFCs specific role in decision-making is to provide an up-to-date representation of task-related information, called a state representation. This representation reflects a mapping between distinct task states and sensory as well as unobservable information. We summarize evidence supporting the existence of such state representations in rodent and human OFC and argue that forming these state representations provides a crucial scaffold that allows animals to efficiently perform decision making and reinforcement learning in high-dimensional and partially observable environments. Finally, we argue that our theory offers an integrating framework for linking the diversity of functions ascribed to OFC and is in line with its wide ranging connectivity.",

While lacking inherent structure, the majority of IDPs do reach a folded state via interaction with a protein partner, presenting a deep entanglement of the folding and binding process. Protein disorder has been recognized as a major determinant in several properties of proteins; yet the way the binding process is reflected in these features in general lacks this detail of description. Recent advances in database development enabled us to identify three basic scenarios of the interplay between folding and binding in unprecedented detail. These scenarios have fundamentally different properties in terms of protein sequence, structure, function and regulation, depending on the structural properties of the interacting partners. Strikingly, the existence of a binding partner and its structural properties influence all analyzed properties of proteins to the same extent as the divide between inherent order or disorder. The appreciation of this interplay between folding and binding is the basis for the successful charting of unknown territories in the protein interactome, the understanding of how different binding modes assemble regulatory networks, and the development of future pharmaceutical applications.",

    "abstract": "The spatial patterns of gene expression in early Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis have been studied experimentally and theoretically to reveal the molecular basis of morphogenesis. In particular, the gene regulatory network (GRN) of gap genes has been investigated through mathematical modeling and simulation. Although these simulation-based approaches are useful for describing complex dynamics and have revealed several important regulations in spatial patterning, they are computationally intensive because they optimize GRN with iterative simulation. Recently, the advance of experimental technologies is enabling the acquisition of comprehensive spatial expression data, and an efficient algorithm will be necessary to analyze such large-scale data. In this research, we developed an efficient algorithm to infer the GRN based on a linear reaction-diffusion model. First, we qualitatively analyzed the GRNs of gap genes and pair-rule genes based on our algorithm and showed that two mutual repressions are fundamental regulations. Then, we inferred the GRN from gap gene data, and identified asymmetric regulations in addition to the two mutual repressions. We analyzed the effect of these asymmetric regulations on spatial patterns, and showed that they have the potential to adjust peak position. Our algorithm runs in sub-second time, which is significantly smaller than the runtime of simulation-based approaches (between 8 and 160 h, for exmaple). Neverthe-less, our inferred GRN was highly correlated with the simulation-based GRNs. We also analyzed the gap gene network of Clogmia albipunctata and showed that different mutual repression regulations might be important in comparison with those of Drosophila melanogaster. As our algorithm can infer GRNs efficiently and can be applied to several different network analysis, it will be a valuable approach for analyzing large-scale data.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new concept called macrocompetition - defined as the mutual suppression of diversity/species richness of competing clades - and investigate evidence for its existence. To this end, we analyzed the distribution of two convergent nectarivorous families, hawk-moths and hummingbirds, over the continental United States to determine whether there is geographic partitioning between the families and its potential causes. Using stepwise regression, we tested for latitudinal and longitudinal biases in the species richness of both taxa and the potential role of 10 environmental variables in their distribution pattern. Hawk-moth species richness increases with longitude (eastward-bias) while that of hummingbirds declines (westward-bias). Similar geographic patterns can be seen across Canada, Mexico and South America. Hawk-moth species richness is positively correlated with higher overall temperatures (especially summer minimums), atmospheric pressure, and summer precipitation; hummingbird species richness is negatively correlated with atmospheric pressure and positively correlated with winter daily maxima. The species richness patterns reflect each familys respective anatomical differences and support the concept of macrocompetition between the two taxa. Hawk-moth species richness was highest in states with low elevation, summer-time flowering, and warm summer nights; hummingbird species richness is highest in the southwest with higher elevation, greater cool season flowering and high daytime winter temperatures. Hawk-moths and hummingbirds as distinct evolutionary technologies exhibit niche overlap and geographical partitioning. These are two of three indicators suggested by Brown and Davidson for inter-taxonomic competition. We intend the patterns revealed here to inspire further exploration into competition and community structuring between hawk-moths and hummingbirds.",

To assess the role of DNA methylation in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, we analyzed genome-wide CpG methylation, histone associations, and transcriptomic states of symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones in the model system Aiptasia. We find methylated genes are marked by histone H3K36me3 and show significant reduction of spurious transcription and transcriptional noise, revealing a role of DNA methylation in the maintenance of transcriptional homeostasis. Changes in DNA methylation and expression show enrichment for symbiosis-related processes such as immunity, apoptosis, phagocytosis recognition and phagosome formation, and unveil intricate interactions between the underlying pathways.

It has long been hypothesized that the Glomeromycotina, the mycorrhizal symbionts of the majority of plants, facilitated colonization of land by plants in the Ordovician. This view was recently challenged by the discovery of mycorrhizal associations with Mucoromycotina in several early diverging lineages of land plants. Utilizing a large, species-level database of plants mycorrhizal associations and a Bayesian approach to state transition dynamics we here show that the recruitment of Mucoromycotina is the best supported transition from a non-mycorrhizal state. We further found that transitions between different combinations of either or both of Mucoromycotina and Glomeromycotina occur at high rates and found similar promiscuity among combinations that include either or both of Glomeromycotina and Ascomycota with a nearly fixed association with Basidiomycota. Our results demonstrate that under the most likely scenario symbiosis with Mucoromycotina enabled the establishment of early land plants.",

Although we readily identified stable interactions in cis, and also between centromeres and telomeres on different chromosomes, surprisingly we identified no gene regulatory transchromosomal interactions in either mouse or human cells, including previously described interactions. We suggest that advances in the chromosome conformation capture technique and the unbiased nature of this approach allow more reliable capture of interactions between chromosomes than previous methods.

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the opportunity to delineate individual-specific brain networks. A major question is whether individual-specific network topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) is behaviorally relevant. Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the MS-HBM explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, MS-HBM parcellations generalized better to new rs-fMRI and task-fMRI data from the same subjects. More specifically, MS-HBM parcellations estimated from a single rs-fMRI session (10 minutes) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by two state-of-the-art methods using five sessions (50 minutes). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by MS-HBM was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity strength, individual-specific network topography might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.",

    "abstract": "Despite its critical importance in experimental and clinical neuroscience, at present there is no systematic method to predict which neural elements will be activated by a given stimulation regime. Here we develop a novel approach to model the effect of cortical stimulation on spiking probability of neurons in a volume of tissue, by applying an analytical estimate of stimulation-induced activation of different cell types across cortical layers. We utilize the morphology and properties of axonal arborization profiles obtained from publicly available anatomical reconstructions of the twelve main categories of neocortical neurons to derive the dependence of activation probability on cell type, layer and distance from the source. We then propagate this activity through the local network incorporating connectivity, synaptic and cellular properties. Our work predicts that (a) intracranial cortical stimulation induces selective activation across cell types and layers; (b) superficial anodal stimulation is more effective than cathodal at cell activation; (c) cortical surface stimulation focally activates layer I axons, and (d) an optimal stimulation intensity exists capable of eliciting cell activation lasting beyond the end of stimulation.",

MNT has been described as a modulator of MYC activity but little is known about MNT regulation and whether MNT has MAX-independent functions. Using a MAX deficient cell line and siRNA-mediated silencing of MAX, we show that in the absence of MAX, the total MNT levels are elevated and that MNT localizes both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In contrast, MNT is predominantly nuclear when MAX is expressed. MNT is required for optimal cell proliferation even in the absence of MAX, being the first report of a MAX-independent function of MNT. Interestingly, MNT forms homodimers and autoregulates its expression by repressing its own promoter. The tight MNT regulation and its activity in absence of MAX suggest its importance on cell homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells interact with the surrounding microenvironment achieving diverse functional outcomes. In addition to autocrine and paracrine signalling mediated by factors of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, we have recently identified that NOTCH1 can drive  lateral induction of a unique form of senescence in adjacent cells through specific induction of the NOTCH ligand JAG1. Here we show that NOTCH signalling can modulate chromatin structure both autonomously and non-autonomously. In addition to senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), oncogenic RAS-induced senescent (RIS) cells in culture exhibit a massive increase in nucleosome-free regions (NRFs). NOTCH signalling suppresses both SAHF and NFR formation in this context. Strikingly, NOTCH-induced senescent cells, or cancer cells with high JAG1 expression, also drive similar chromatin architectural changes in adjacent cells through cell-cell contact. Mechanistically, we show that NOTCH signalling represses the chromatin architectural protein HMGA1, an association found in a range of human cancers. Thus, HMGA1 is involved not only in SAHFs, but also RIS-specific NFR formation. In conclusion, this study identifies that the JAG1-NOTCH-HMGA1 axis mediates the juxtacrine regulation of chromatin architecture.",

We show that in chick neural progenitors, CDC25B activity is both required and sufficient to stimulate neurogenic divisions and to promote neuronal differentiation. We design a mathematical model showing that within a limited period of time, cell cycle length modifications cannot account for changes in the ratio of the mode of division. Using a CDC25B point mutation that cannot interact with CDK, we show that part of CDC25B activity on neurogenic divisions is independent of its action on the cell cycle.",

However, popular software tools for maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference do not yet routinely report, if inferred phylogenies reside on a terrace, or not. We believe, this is due to the unavailability of an efficient library implementation to (i) determine if a tree resides on a terrace, (ii) calculate how many trees reside on a terrace, and (iii) enumerate all trees on a terrace.\\n\\nResultsIn our bioinformatics programming practical we developed two efficient and independent C++ implementations of the SUPERB algorithm by Constantinescu and Sankoff (1995) for counting and enumerating the trees on a terrace. Both implementations yield exactly the same results and are more than one order of magnitude faster and require one order of magnitude less memory than a previous 3rd party python implementation.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe source codes are available under GNU GPL at https://github.com/terraphast\\n\\nContactAlexandros.Stamatakis@h-its.org",

    "abstract": "Given the highly dynamic and complex nature of the human gut microbial community, the ability to identify and predict time-dependent compositional patterns of microbes is crucial to our understanding of the structure and function of this ecosystem. One factor that could affect such time-dependent patterns is microbial interactions, wherein community composition at a given time point affects the microbial composition at a later time point. However, the field has not yet settled on the degree of this effect. Specifically, it has been recently suggested that only a minority of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) depend on the microbial composition in earlier times. To address the issue of identifying and predicting temporal microbial patterns we developed a new model, MTV-LMM (Microbial Temporal Variability Linear Mixed Model), a linear mixed model for the prediction of the microbial community temporal dynamics based on the community composition at previous time stamps. MTV-LMM can identify time-dependent microbes in time series datasets, which can then be used to analyze the trajectory of the microbiome over time. We evaluated the performance of MTV-LMM on three human microbiome time series datasets, and found that MTV-LMM significantly outperforms all existing methods for microbiome time series modeling. Particularly, we demonstrate that the effect of the microbial composition in previous time points on the abundance levels of an OTU at a later time point is underestimated by a factor of at least 10 when applying previous approaches. Using MTV-LMM, we demonstrate that a considerable proportion of the human gut microbiome, both in infants and adults, has a significant time-dependent component that can be predicted based on microbiome composition in earlier time points. This suggests that microbiome composition at a given time point is a major factor in defining future microbiome composition and that this phenomenon is considerably more common than previously reported for the human gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Cells require membrane-located transporter proteins to import nutrients from the environment. Many organisms have several similar transporters for the same nutrient, which differ in their affinity. Typically, high affinity transporters are expressed when substrate is scarce and low affinity ones when substrate is more abundant. The benefit of using low affinity transporters when high affinity ones are available has so far remained unclear. Here, we investigate two hypotheses. First, it was previously hypothesized that a trade-off between the affinity and the maximal catalytic rate explains this phenomenon. We find some theoretical and experimental support for this hypothesis, but no conclusive evidence. Secondly, we propose a new hypothesis: for uptake by facilitated diffusion, at saturating extracellular substrate concentrations, lowering the affinity enhances the net uptake rate by reducing the substrate efflux rate. As a consequence, there exists an optimal, external substrate concentration dependent transporter affinity. An in silico analysis of glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows that using the low affinity HXT3 transporter instead of the high affinity HXT6 enhances the steady-state flux by 36%. We tried to test this hypothesis using yeast strains expressing a single glucose transporter that was modified to have either a high or a low affinity. Due to the intimate and reciprocal link between glucose perception and metabolism, direct experimental proof for this hypothesis remained inconclusive in our hands. Still, our theoretical results provide a novel reason for the presence of low affinity transport systems which might have more general implications for enzyme catalyzed conversions.",

The identifica-tion of at-risk subjects yet showing no dementia symptoms but who will later convert to AD can be crucial for the effective treatment of AD. For this, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is expected to play a crucial role. During recent years, several Machine Learning (ML) approaches to AD-conversion prediction have been proposed using different types of MRI features. However, few studies comparing these different feature representations exist, and the existing ones do not allow to make definite conclusions. We evaluated the performance of various types of MRI features for the conversion prediction: voxel-based features extracted based on voxel-based morphometry, hippocampus volumes, volumes of the entorhinal cortex, and a set of regional volumetric, surface area, and cortical thickness measures across the brain. Regional features consistently yielded the best performance over two classifiers (Support Vector Machines and Regularized Logistic Regression), and two datasets studied. However, the performance difference to other features was not statistically significant. There was a consis-tent trend of age correction improving the classification performance, but the improvement reached statistical significance only rarely.",

We examined how these metrics change with stimulus intensity, and interpreted these changes within a framework of known physiological properties of the basilar membrane and AN. Our results reveal how neural synchrony and the recruitment of AN fibers with later first-spike latencies likely contribute to the CAP, affect auditory processing, and differ with noise exposure history in younger adults despite normal pure-tone thresholds. Moving forward, these new metrics, when applied to patient populations, can provide a means to characterize cochlear synaptopathy and other deficits in AN function in humans.\\n\\nNew and noteworthy\\n\\nLoss or inactivity of auditory nerve (AN) fibers is thought to contribute to suprathreshold auditory processing deficits, but evidence-based methods to assess these effects are not available.

    "abstract": "Improvements in visuospatial perception such as contrast sensitivity and Vernier acuity continue until late in childhood, but the neural mechanisms driving these age-related changes are currently unclear. One contributing factor could be the protracted development of spatial tuning of neuronal populations across the visual cortex. Here we tested this possibility using population receptive field (pRF) mapping (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008) in 6-to 12-year-old children and adults. We fitted pRF models to BOLD signals measured in areas V1-V4 and V3a during fMRI whilst participants watched wedge and ring stimuli traversing the visual field. Cortical magnification and the width of pRF tuning functions changed with viewing eccentricity in all participants. However, there were no age-related changes in pRF size, shape, cortical magnification, or map consistency across any of the visual areas measured. These results suggest that visuospatial perception in late childhood beyond age 6 years is not substantially limited by low-level spatial tuning properties of neuronal populations in visual cortex. Instead, performance improvements in this period may reflect more efficient use of the spatial information available in the visual system when forming perceptual judgments. These findings are an important step towards disentangling which neural mechanisms contribute to the eventual emergence of mature spatial vision, and for understanding the processes that determine the scope for visual plasticity at different stages of life.",

    "abstract": "Interaction between the genotype and the environment (GxE) has a strong impact on the yield of major crop plants. Although influential, taking GxE explictily into account in plant breeding has remained difficult. Recently GxE has been predicted from environmental and genomic covariates, but existing works have not shown that generalization to new environments and years without access to in-season data is possible and practical applicability remains unclear. Using data from a Barley breeding program in Finland, we construct an in-silico experiment to study the viability of GxE prediction under practical constraints. We show that the response to the environment of a new generation of untested Barley cultivars can be predicted in new locations and years using genomic data, machine learning and historical weather observations for the new locations. Our results highlight the need for models of GxE: non-linear effects clearly dominate linear ones and the interaction between the soil type and daily rain is identified as the main driver for GxE for Barley in Finland. Our study implies that genomic selection can be used to capture the yield potential in GxE effects for future growth seasons, providing a possible means to achieve yield improvements, needed for feeding the growing population.",

    "abstract": "Commitment to mitosis is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the major B-type cyclin, Cdc13, is necessary and sufficient to drive mitotic entry. Furthermore, Cdc13 is also sufficient to drive S phase, demonstrating that a single cyclin can regulate alternating rounds of replication and mitosis and providing the foundation of the quantitative model of CDK function. It has been assumed that Cig2, a B-type cyclin expressed only during S-phase and incapable of driving mitosis in wild-type cells, was specialized for S-phase regulation. Here, we show that Cig2 is capable of driving mitosis. Cig2/CDK activity drives mitotic catastrophe--lethal mitosis in inviably small cells--in cells that lack CDK inhibition by tyrosine-phosphorylation. Moreover, Cig2/CDK can drive mitosis in the absence of Cdc13/CDK activity and constitutive expression of Cig2 can rescue loss of Cdc13 activity. These results demonstrate that in fission yeast, not only can the presumptive M-phase cyclin drive S phase, but the presumptive S-phase cyclin can drive M phase, further supporting the quantitative model of CDK function. Furthermore, these results provide an explanation, previously proposed on the basis of computational analyses, for the surprising observation that cells expressing a single-chain Cdc13-Cdc2 CDK do not require Y15 phosphorylation for viability. Their viability is due to the fact that in such cells, which lack Cig2/CDK complexes, Cdc13/CDK activity is unable to drive mitotic catastrophe.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade there has been growing criticism of the use of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to approximate discrete state-space, continuous-time Markov chain population models. In particular, several authors have demonstrated the failure of Diffusion Approximation, as it is often called, to approximate expected extinction times for populations that start in a quasi-stationary state.\\n\\nIn this work we investigate a related, but distinct, population dynamics property for which Diffusion Approximation fails: invasion probabilities. We consider the situation in which a few individual are introduced into a population and ask whether their collective lineage can successfully invade. Because the population count is so small during the critical period of success or failure, the process is intrinsically stochastic and discrete. In addition to demonstrating how and why the Diffusion Approximation fails in the large population limit, we contrast this analysis with that of a sometimes more successful alternative WKB-like approach. Through numerical investigations, we also study how these approximations perform in an important intermediate regime. In a surprise, we find that there are times when the Diffusion Approximation performs well: particularly when parameters are near-critical and the population size is small to intermediate.",

We used a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear molecular methods to identify potential units of conservation of westslope cutthroat trout, a taxon native to montane river basins of the northwestern U.S. and southwestern Canada. Mitogenomic sequencing identified two major lineages composed of nine monophyletic clades, and a well-supported subclade within one of these, largely delineated by river basins. Analyses of microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms corroborated most of these groupings, sometimes with less resolution but demonstrating more complex connections among clades. The mitochondrial and nuclear analyses revealed that Pleistocene glacial cycles profoundly influenced the distribution and divergence of westslope cutthroat trout, that this taxon crossed the Continental Divide in two separate events, and that genetically pure but nonindigenous fish were widely distributed. Herein, we recognize nine geographically discrete, cytonuclear lineages largely circumscribed by major river basins as potential units of conservation: 1) John Day; 2) Coeur dAlene; 3) St. Joe; 4) North Fork Clearwater; 5) Salmon; 6) Clearwater headwaters; 7) Clearwater-eastern Cascades; 8) neoboreal, consisting of most of the Columbia upstream from central Washington, the Fraser in British Columbia, and the South Saskatchewan in Alberta; and 9) Missouri.",

We developed a targeted cfDNA sequencing technology using novel off-the-shelf molecular barcodes for error correction, in combination with custom solution hybrid capture enrichment. Modelling based on cfDNA yields from 58 patients shows that our assay, which requires 25ng of cfDNA input, should be applicable to >95% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Sequencing of a 163.3 kb target region including 32 genes detected 100% of single nucleotide variants with 0.15% variant frequency in cfDNA spike-in experiments. Molecular barcode error correction reduced false positive mutation calls by 98.6%. In a series of 28 patients with metastatic colorectal cancers, 80 out of 91 (88%) mutations previously detected by tumour tissue sequencing were called in the cfDNA. Call rates were similar for single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions. Mutations only called in cfDNA but not detectable in matched tumour tissue included, among others, a subclonal resistance driver mutation to anti-EGFR antibodies in the KRAS gene, multiple activating PIK3CA mutations in each of two patients (indicative of parallel evolution), and TP53 mutations originating from clonal haematopoiesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cfDNA off-target read analysis allows the reconstruction of genome wide copy number aberration profiles from 71% of these 28 cases. This error-corrected ultra-deep cfDNA sequencing assay with a target region that can be readily customized enables broad insights into cancer genomes and evolution.",

However these techniques have not yet been applied to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, in which a larger genome, slower generation times, and a complex life cycle make them difficult to implement. Here we demonstrate the viability of de novo mutation studies in P. falciparum for the first time. Using a set of clinical samples and novel methods of sequencing, library preparation, and genotyping, we have genotyped low-complexity regions of the genome with a high degree of accuracy. Despite its slower evolutionary rate compared to bacterial or viral species, de novo mutation can be detected in P. falciparum across timescales of just 1-2 years and evolutionary rates in low-complexity regions of the genome can be up to twice that detected in the rest of the genome. The increased mutation rate allows the identification of separate clade expansions that cannot be found using previous genomic epidemiology approaches and could be a crucial tool for mapping residual transmission patterns in disease elimination campaigns and reintroduction scenarios.",

    "abstract": "X-ray crystallographic studies of class I peptide-MHC molecules (pMHC) continue to provide important insights into immune recognition, however their success depends on generation of diffraction-quality crystals, which remains a significant challenge. While protein engineering techniques such as surface-entropy reduction and lysine methylation have proven utility in facilitating and/or improving protein crystallisation, they risk affecting the conformation and biochemistry of the class I MHC antigen binding groove. An attractive alternative is the use of noncovalent crystallisation chaperones, however these have not been developed for pMHC. Here we describe a method for promoting class I pMHC crystallisation, by exploiting its natural ligand interaction with the immunoregulatory receptor LILRB1 as a novel crystallisation chaperone. First, focussing on a model HIV-1-derived HLA-A2-restricted peptide, we determined a 2.4[A] HLA-A2/LILRB1 structure, which validated that co-crystallisation with LILRB1 does not alter conformation of the antigenic peptide. We then demonstrated that addition of LILRB1 enhanced the crystallisation of multiple pMHC complexes, and identified a generic condition for initial co-crystallisation. LILRB1 chaperone-based pMHC crystallisation enabled structure determination for class I pMHC previously intransigent to crystallisation, including both conventional and post-translationally-modified peptides, of diverse lengths. LILRB1 chaperone-mediated crystallisation should expedite molecular insights into the immunobiology of diverse immune-related diseases and immunotherapeutic strategies, particularly involving class I pMHC complexes that are challenging to crystallise. Moreover, since the LILRB1 recognition interface involves predominantly non-polymorphic regions of the MHC molecule, the approach we outline could prove applicable to a diverse range of class I pMHC.",

    "abstract": "The vaginal microbiome plays an influential role in several disease states in reproductive age women, including bacterial vaginosis (BV). While demographic characteristics are associated with differences in vaginal microbiome community structure, little is known about the influence of sexual and hygiene habits. Furthermore, associations between the vaginal microbiome and risk symptoms of bacterial vaginosis have not been fully elucidated. Using Bayesian network (BN) analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence results, demographic and extensive questionnaire data, we describe both novel and previously documented associations between habits of women and their vaginal microbiome. The BN analysis approach shows promise in uncovering complex associations between disparate data types. Our findings based on this approach support published associations between specific microbiome members (e.g., Eggerthella, Gardnerella, Dialister, Sneathia and Ruminococcaceae), the Nugent score (a BV diagnostic) and vaginal pH (a risk symptom of BV). Additionally, we found that several microbiome members were directly connected to other risk symptoms of BV (such as vaginal discharge, odor, itch, irritation, and yeast infection) including L. jensenii, Corynebacteria, and Proteobacteria. No direct connections were found between the Nugent Score and risk symptoms of BV other than pH, indicating that the Nugent Score may not be the most useful criteria for assessment of clinical BV. We also found that demographics (i.e., age, ethnicity, previous pregnancy) were associated with the presence/absence of specific vaginal microbes. The resulting BN revealed several as-yet undocumented associations between birth control usage, menstrual hygiene practices and specific microbiome members. Many of these complex relationships were not identified using common analytical methods, i.e., ordination and PERMANOVA. While these associations require confirmatory follow-up study, our findings strongly suggest that future studies of the vaginal microbiome and vaginal pathologies should include detailed surveys of participants sanitary, sexual and birth control habits, as these can act as confounders in the relationship between the microbiome and disease. Although the BN approach is powerful in revealing complex associations within multidimensional datasets, the need in some cases to discretize the data for use in BN analysis can result in loss of information. Future research is required to alleviate such limitations in constructing BN networks. Large sample sizes are also required in order to allow for the incorporation of a large number of variables (nodes) into the BN, particularly when studying associations between metadata and the microbiome. We believe that this approach is of great value, complementing other methods, to further our understanding of complex associations characteristic of microbiome research.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism whereby anesthetics cause loss of consciousness (LOC) is poorly understood. Current theories suggest that impaired representation of information in cortico-thalamic networks contributes to LOC under anesthesia. We sought to determine whether such changes are present in auditory cortex using information theoretic analysis of multiunit responses in rats. We tested the effects of three agents with different molecular targets: isoflurane, which acts at multiple pre- and postsynaptic loci, propofol, which acts primarily on GABAA receptors, and dexmedetomidine, an 2 adrenergic agonist. We reasoned that changes in the representation of sensory stimuli causative for LOC would be present regardless of the molecular target of the anesthetic. All three agents caused LOC, as assayed by the loss of righting reflex (LORR). We presented acoustic stimuli that varied across a wide range of temporal and spectral dynamics under control, sub-hypnotic (i.e. dose too low to cause LORR), just-hypnotic (a dose just sufficient to cause LORR) and recovery conditions. Changes in mutual information (MI) between the stimulus and spike responses under anesthesia diverged in two ways from predictions of a model in which stimulus representation is impaired upon LOC. First, the sign of changes in MI was agent-specific: MI increased under dexmedetomidine, while it decreased under isoflurane and propofol. Second, there was no consistent change in MI when transitioning from sub-hyptnotic to just-hypnotic doses: for none of the agents did MI decrease at the higher dose, and in some cases MI actually increased relative to the sub-hypnotic dose. Changes in MI under anesthesia were strongly correlated with changes in precision and reliability of spike timing, consistent with the importance of temporal stimulus features in driving auditory cortical activity. These data indicate that primary sensory cortex is not the locus for changes in information representation causative for LOC under anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~21 nucleotide-long regulatory RNAs that arise from endonucleolytic processing of hairpin precursors. Many function as essential post-transcriptional regulators of target mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. Alongside miRNAs, plants also produce large numbers of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are distinguished from miRNAs primarily by their biogenesis (typically processed from long double-stranded RNA instead of single-stranded hairpins) and functions (typically via roles in transcriptional regulation instead of post-transcriptional regulation). Next-generation DNA sequencing methods have yielded extensive datasets of plant small RNAs, resulting in many miRNA annotations, occasionally inaccurately curated. The sheer number of endogenous siRNAs compared to miRNAs has been a major factor in the erroneous annotation of siRNAs as miRNAs. Here, we provide updated criteria for the confident annotation of plant miRNAs, suitable for the era of \\\"big data\\\" from DNA sequencing. The updated criteria emphasize replication, the minimization of false positives, and they require next-generation sequencing of small RNAs. We argue that improved annotation systems are needed for miRNAs and all other classes of plant small RNAs. Finally, to illustrate the complexities of miRNA and siRNA annotation, we review the evolution and functions of miRNAs and siRNAs in plants.",

We provide conditions to guarantee that the full system forms patterns if the reduced system does, and vice-versa.

It is necessary to keep a temperature within 100 {+/-} 5 {degrees} C., with a vapor pressure of 6 to 7 bars, an average density of H3PO4 (1470 g/l) and the solid rate in the feed acid less than 2%. After the reaction phase, the slurry is conveyed to the granulator where it is mixed with the recycled product at a recycling rate (RT) close to 3 and a K ratio between 0.1 and 0.2. This parameter is very important to be monitored to ensure a Good penetration of heat into the next phase in a relatively short time. During the drying process, the product humidity at the outlet must be in the range of 3.5% to 5% to allow the reaction to continue during the developing period. At the exit of the drying tube, the product is in very variable grains diameter (D), the objective of the following step is to extract the grain size range between 2 and 4 mm. To do so we changed the mesh size of the lower webs to 3/50 and 3.2 / 30 mm, which reduces the quantity of particle size less than 2%. Thus, the particles of diameter more than 3.15 mm must be continuously controlled to reach 64%. This portion will ensure conformity of the product for D50 and for the two intervals [2-3.15 mm] and [3.15-4 mm]. In the Storage Hall the reaction continues, the unconverted phosphate will be attacked by the unreacted H3PO4, and according to a monitoring of the evolution of the chemical composition of the final product (TSP). The required ripening time is limited to 21 days. During this study, we were able to identify and modify a number of parameters in different production phases to improve the quality of TSP according to AFCOME, knowing that each phase of the process is a client of the previous phase and supplier of the next one.",

    "abstract": "Organisms rarely experience a homogeneous environment. Rather, ecological and evolutionary dynamics unfold in spatially structured and fragmented landscapes, with dispersal as the central process linking these dynamics across spatial scales. Because dispersal is a multi-causal and highly plastic life-history trait, finding general drivers that are of importance across species is challenging but highly relevant for ecological forecasting.\\n\\nWe here tested whether two fundamental ecological forces and main determinants of local population dynamics, top-down and bottom-up control, generally explain dispersal in spatially structured communities. In a coordinated distributed experiment spanning a wide range of actively dispersing organisms, from protozoa to vertebrates, we show that bottom-up control, that is resource limitation, consistently increased dispersal. While top-down control, that is predation risk, was an equally important dispersal driver as bottom-up control, its effect depended on prey and predator space use and whether dispersal occurred on land, in water or in the air: species that routinely use more space than their predators showed increased dispersal in response to predation, specifically in aquatic environments. After establishing these general causes of dispersal, we used a metacommunity model to show that bottom-up and top-down control of dispersal has important consequences for local population fluctuations as well as cascading effects on regional metacommunity dynamics. Context-dependent dispersal reduced local population fluctuations and desynchronized dynamics between communities, two effects that increase population and community stability.\\n\\nOur study provides unprecedented insights into the generality of the positive resource dependency of dispersal as well as a robust experimental test of current theory predicting that predator-induced dispersal is modulated by prey and predator space use. Our experimental and theoretical work highlights the critical importance of the multi-causal nature of dispersal as well as its cascading effects on regional community dynamics, which are specifically relevant to ecological forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Genome evolution in disparate species is synopsized to highlight the role of common genetic variants during their adaptation, and an evolutionary perspective is provided to infer lifestyle-related disease progression in humans. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a multi-factorial disease, where maladaptation due to a sedentary lifestyle and faulty diet can influence its prognosis, but the genetic basis for its differential severity remains unknown. As a healthy diet and lifestyle may restrict its prognosis, we hypothesize that a hierarchy of common genetic variants may differentially modulate that severity in a subpopulation. We suggest that the loss-of-function paradigm due to a genetic variant may give rise to a broad spectrum of CVD severity in conjunction with other variants. Here, we have inferred that CAD severity may be a consequence of the plasticity of common variants exclusive among patients with disparate disease severity. Most importantly, we have used a small and outbred subpopulation to demonstrate that common genetic variants can be exploited to trace this unique facet of CAD etiology. Moreover, we corroborate our hypothesis by reporting that a hierarchical plasticity of the LDLR gene, which has been implicated in a differential response to lipid metabolism, is associated with differential CVD severity.\\n\\nCan we gain insight to the genetic etiology of diseases using a limited number of genomes (few hundred)? Can small data sets lend insights that large data sets may subsequently confirm? Here, I show how common genetic variants, which were identified only from hundreds of individuals, may be used to gain unique insights regarding the disease etiology of a common lifestyle-related disease.",

To investigate potential non-canonical binding modes we collected in-depth and accurate HLA peptidomics datasets covering 54 HLA-I alleles and developed novel algorithms to analyze these data. Our results reveal frequent (442 unique peptides) and statistically significant C-terminal extensions for at least eight alleles, including the common HLA-A03:01, HLA-A31:01 and HLA-A68:01. High resolution crystal structure of HLA-A68:01 with such a ligand uncovers structural changes taking place to accommodate C-terminal extensions and helps unraveling sequence and structural properties predictive of the presence of these extensions. Scanning viral proteomes with the new C-terminal extension motifs identifies many putative epitopes and we demonstrate direct recognition by human CD8+ T cells of a C-terminally extended epitope from cytomegalovirus.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural mechanisms of loss and recovery of consciousness remains an active area of scientific and clinical interest. Recent models and theories of consciousness implicate thalamus or neocortex as the dominant regions that control global state change, but experimentally testing these theories requires parsing the response properties of the complex thalamocortical network. In this work, we explore information processing using chronic recordings of multiunit activity between thalamus and cortex by targeting either the corticothalamic or thalamocortical pathway with direct electrical stimulation under subhypnotic and just-hypnotic states of isoflurane or dexmedetomidine induced unconsciousness. We found that mutual information between the stimulus and response in the corticothalamic circuit decreases with loss of consciousness, and that the change is not reciprocated in the thalamocortical direction. These changes in mutual information were moderately correlated with changes in evoked rate, and a strong effect of isoflurane on spontaneous and evoked rate accounts for a large portion of the change in mutual information. Further, we found cortical synchrony to increase under sub-and just-hypnotic doses of dexmedetomidine and isoflurane, suggesting cortical responses become more causally dependent on thalamocortical input at reduced levels of consciousness, or unconsciousness. We believe these changes suggest loss of consciousness is associated with a decrease in the number of available cortical network states, and may suggest cognitive unbinding from ascending sensory input.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal cortical activity patterns relative to both peripheral input and local network activity carry information about stimulus identity and context. GABAergic interneurons are reported to regulate spiking at millisecond precision in response to sensory stimulation and during gamma oscillations; their role in regulating spike timing during induced network bursts is unclear. We investigated this issue in murine auditory thalamo-cortical (TC) brain slices, in which TC afferents induced network bursts similar to previous reports in vivo. Spike timing relative to TC afferent stimulation during bursts was poor in pyramidal cells and SOM+ interneurons. It was more precise in PV+ interneurons, consistent with their reported contribution to spiking precision in pyramidal cells. Optogenetic suppression of PV+ cells unexpectedly improved afferent-locked spike timing in pyramidal cells. In contrast, our evidence suggests that PV+ cells do regulate the spatio-temporal spike pattern of pyramidal cells during network bursts, whose organization is suited to ensemble coding of stimulus information. Simulations showed that suppressing PV+ cells reduces the capacity of pyramidal cell networks to produce discriminable spike patterns. By dissociating temporal precision with respect to a stimulus versus internal cortical activity, we identified a novel role for GABAergic cells in regulating information processing in cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "The primary target of Influenza A virus (IAV) is epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. In contrast to epithelial cells, productive infection of most IAV strains is either blocked or highly inefficient in macrophages. The exact nature of the defect in IAV replication in human macrophages remains unknown. In this study, we showed that primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are inefficient in IAV release even when compared to a monocytic cell line differentiated to macrophage-like cells, despite comparable levels of expression of viral glycoproteins at the plasma membrane. Correlative fluorescence scanning electron microscopy revealed that formation of budding structures at the cell surface is inefficient in MDM even though clustering of a viral glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), is observed, suggesting that IAV particle assembly is blocked in human MDM. Using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we further determined that association between HA and the viral ion channel protein M2 is defective at the plasma membrane of MDM. In contrast, HA and another glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) associate with each other on the MDM surface efficiently. Notably, the defect in association between HA and M2 in MDM was reversed upon inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D. Altogether, these results suggest that HA-M2 association on the plasma membrane is a discrete step in the IAV assembly process, which is separable from the association between HA and NA and susceptible to suppression by actin cytoskeleton. Overall, our study revealed the presence of a cell-type-specific mechanism negatively regulating IAV assembly at the plasma membrane.\\n\\nImportanceIdentification of host cell determinants promoting or suppressing replication of many viruses has been aided by analyses of host cells that impose inherent blocks on viral replication. In this study, we show that primary human MDM are not permissive to IAV replication due to a defect at the virus particle formation step. This defect is specific to primary human macrophages, since a human monocytic cell line differentiated to macrophage-like cells supports IAV particle formation. We further identified association between two viral transmembrane proteins, HA and M2, on the cell surface as a discrete assembly step, which is defective in MDM. Defective HA-M2 association in MDM is rescued by disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, revealing a previously unknown, negative role for actin polymerization, which is generally thought to play positive roles in IAV assembly. Overall, our study uncovered a host-mediated restriction of association between viral transmembrane components during IAV assembly.",

However, the statistical properties and function of the T cell pool in an individual, under normal physiological conditions, are poorly understood. In this study, we report a comprehensive, quantitative characterization of the T cell repertoire from over 1.9 million cells, yielding over 200,000 high quality paired {beta} sequences in 5 healthy human subjects. The dataset was obtained by leveraging recent biotechnology developments in deep RNA sequencing of lymphocytes via single-cell barcoding in emulsion. We report non-random associations and non-monogamous pairing between the  and {beta} chains, lowering the theoretical diversity of the T cell repertoire, and increasing the frequency of public clones shared among individuals. T cell clone size distributions closely followed a power law, with markedly longer tails for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells than CD4+ helper T cells. Furthermore, clonality estimates based on paired chains from single T cells were lower than that from single chain data. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of sequencing {beta} pairs to accurately quantify lymphocyte receptor diversity.",
