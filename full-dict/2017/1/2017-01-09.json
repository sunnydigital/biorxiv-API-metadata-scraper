    "abstract": "Prokaryotic evolution is affected by horizontal transfer of genetic material through recombination. Inference of an evolutionary tree of bacteria thus relies on accurate identification of the population genetic structure and recombination-derived mosaicism. Rapidly growing databases represent a challenge for computational methods to detect recombinations in bacterial genomes. We introduce a novel algorithm called fastGEAR which identifies lineages in diverse microbial alignments, and recombinations between them and from external origins. The algorithm detects both recent recombinations (affecting a few isolates) and ancestral recombinations between detected lineages (affecting entire lineages), thus providing insight into recombinations affecting deep branches of the phylogenetic tree. In sim-ulations, fastGEAR had comparable power to detect recent recombinations and outstanding power to detect the ancestral ones, compared to state-of-the-art methods, often with a fraction of computational cost. We demonstrate the utility of the method by analysing a collection of 616 whole-genomes of a recombinogenic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, for which the method provided a high-resolution view of recombination across the genome. We examined in detail the penicillin-binding genes across the Streptococcus genus, demonstrating previously undetected genetic exchanges between different species at these three loci. Hence, fastGEAR can be readily applied to investigate mosaicism in bacterial genes across multiple species. Finally, fastGEAR correctly identified many known recombination hotspots and pointed to potential new ones.

    "abstract": "The aging brain undergoes structural changes, affecting brain homeostasis, neuronal function and consequently cognition. The complex architecture of dendritic arbors poses a challenge to understanding age-dependent morphological alterations, behavioral plasticity and remodeling following brain injury. Here, we use the PVD polymodal neurons of C. elegans as a model to study how aging affects neuronal plasticity. Using confocal live imaging of C. elegans PVD neurons, we demonstrate age-related progressive morphological alterations of intricate dendritic arbors. We show that insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutations (daf-2) fail to inhibit the progressive morphological aging of dendrites and do not prevent the minor decline in response to harsh touch during aging. We uncovered that PVD aging is characterized by a major decline in regenerative potential of dendrites following experimental laser dendrotomy. Furthermore, the remodeling of transected dendritic trees via AFF-1-mediated self-fusion can be restored in old animals by DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutations, and can be differentially reestablished by ectopic expression of AFF-1 fusion protein (fusogen). Thus, AFF-1 fusogen ectopically expressed in the PVD and mutations in DAF-2/IGF-1R, differentially rejuvenate some aspects of dendritic regeneration following injury.\\n\\nSummary statementEctopic expression of AFF-1 fusogen or low activity of IGF-1R/DAF-2 rejuvenate the regeneration potential of dendrites following injury in aging C. elegans",

    "abstract": "We show that in model neuronal cultures, where the probability of interneuronal connection formation decreases exponentially with increasing distance between the neurons, there exists a small number of spatial nucleation centers of a network spike, from where the synchronous spiking activity starts propagating in the network typically in the form of circular traveling waves. The number of nucleation centers and their spatial locations are unique and unchanged for a given realization of neuronal network but are different for different networks. In contrast, if the probability of interneuronal connection formation is independent of the distance between neurons, then the nucleation centers do not arise and the synchronization of spiking activity during a network spike occurs spatially uniform throughout the network. Therefore one can conclude that spatial proximity of connections between neurons is important for the formation of nucleation centers. It is also shown that fluctuations of the spatial density of neurons at their random homogeneous distribution typical for the experiments in vitro do not determine the locations of the nucleation centers. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.",

However, the mechanism by which this brain state can implement both the \\\"selective\\\" plasticity needed to consolidate novel memory traces as well as the \\\"general\\\" plasticity necessary to maintain a well-functioning neuronal system is unclear. Recent findings show that both of these functions differentially affect neurons based on their intrinsic firing rate, a ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity. Furthermore, they are both implemented by the NREM slow oscillation, which also distinguishes neurons based on firing rate during sequential activity at the DOWN->UP transition. These findings suggest a mechanism by which spiking activity during the slow oscillation acts to maintain network statistics that promote a skewed distribution of neuronal firing rates, and \\\"perturbation\\\" of that activity by hippocampal replay acts to integrate new memory traces into the existing cortical network.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe availability of dense genotypes and whole-genome sequence variants from various sources offers the opportunity to compile large data sets consisting of tens of thousands of animals with genotypes for millions of polymorphic sites that may enhance the power of genomic analyses. The imputation of missing genotypes ensures that all individuals have genotypes for a shared set of variants.\\n\\nResultsWe evaluated the accuracy of imputation from dense genotypes to whole-genome sequence variants in 249 Fleckvieh and 450 Holstein cattle using Minimac and FImpute. The sequence variants of a subset of the animals were reduced to the variants that were included in the Illumina BovineHD genotyping array and subsequently inferred in silico using either within- or multi-breed reference populations. The accuracy of imputation varied considerably across chromosomes and dropped at regions where the bovine genome contains segmental duplications. Depending on the imputation strategy, the correlation between imputed and true genotypes ranged from 0.898 to 0.952. The accuracy of imputation was higher with Minimac than FImpute particularly for rare alleles. Considering a multi-breed reference population increased the accuracy of imputation, particularly when FImpute was used to infer genotypes. When the sequence variants were imputed using Minimac, the true genotypes were more correlated to predicted allele dosages than best-guess genotypes. The computing costs to impute 23,256,743 sequence variants in 6958 animals were 10-fold higher with Minimac than FImpute. Association studies with imputed sequence variants revealed seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for milk fat percentage. Two known causal mutations in the DGAT1 and GHR genes were the most significantly associated variants at two QTL on chromosomes 14 and 20 when Minimac was used to infer genotypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe population-based imputation of millions of sequence variants in large cohorts provides accurate genotypes and is computationally feasible. Using a reference population that includes individuals from many breeds increases the accuracy of imputation particularly at low-frequency variants. Considering allele dosages rather than best-guess genotypes as explanatory variables is advantageous for association studies with imputed sequence variants.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying folding of mammalian chromosomes remain poorly understood. The transcription factor CTCF is a candidate regulator of chromosomal structure. Using the auxin-inducible degron system in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that CTCF is absolutely and dose-dependently required for looping between CTCF target sites and segmental organization into topologically associating domains (TADs). Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding, and CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Further, our data supports that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer-blocking but not direct chromatin barrier activity. These results define the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, and provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=178 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/095802_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (49K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@79c6c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8e61forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c2eedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf7f3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Karp combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. In this text we apply Karp to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads, commonly used in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show Karp is accurate across a variety of read lengths and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, and show that relative to other widely used classification methods Karp can reveal stronger statistical association signals and should empower future discoveries.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn the forests of northeastern North America, invasive insects and pathogens are causing major declines in some tree species and a subsequent reorganization of associated forest communities. Using observations and experiments to investigate the consequences of such declines are hampered because trees are long-lived. Simulation models can provide a means to forecast possible futures based on different scenarios of tree species decline, death, and removal. Such modeling is particularly urgent for species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation species in many northeast forest regions that is declining due to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Here, we used an individual-based forest simulator, SORTIE-ND, to forecast changes in forest communities in central Massachusetts over the next 200 years under a range of scenarios: a no-adelgid, status-quo scenario; partial resistance of hemlock to the adelgid; adelgid irruption and total hemlock decline over 25 years, adelgid irruption and salvage logging of hemlock trees; and two scenarios of preemptive logging of hemlock and hemlock/white pine.We applied the model to six study plots comprising a range of initial species mixtures, abundances, and levels of hemlock dominance. Simulations indicated that eastern white pine, and to a lesser extent black birch and American beech, would gain most in relative abundance and basal area following hemlock decline. The relative dominance of these species depended on initial conditions and the amount of hemlock mortality, and their combined effect on neighborhood-scale community dynamics. Simulated outcomes were little different whether hemlock died out gradually due to the adelgid or disappeared rapidly following logging. However, if eastern hemlock were to become partially resistant to the adelgid, hemlock would be able to retain its dominance despite substantial losses of basal area. Our modeling highlights the complexities associated with secondary forest succession due to ongoing hemlock decline and loss. We emphasize the need both for a precautionary approach in deciding between management intervention or simply doing nothing in these declining hemlock forests, and for clear aims and understanding regarding desired community- and ecosystem-level outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Despite continued advances in sequencing technologies, there is a need for methods that can efficiently sequence large numbers of genes from diverse species. One approach to accomplish this is targeted capture (hybrid enrichment). While these methods are well established for genome resequencing projects, cross-species capture strategies are still being developed and generally focus on the capture of conserved regions, rather than complete coding regions from specific genes of interest. The resulting data is thus useful for phylogenetic studies, but the wealth of comparative data that could be used for evolutionary and functional studies is lost. Here we design and implement a targeted capture method that enables recovery of complete coding regions across broad taxonomic scales. Capture probes were designed from multiple reference species and extensively tiled in order to facilitate cross-species capture. Using novel bioinformatics pipelines we were able to recover nearly all of the targeted genes with high completeness from species that were up to 200 myr divergent. Increased probe diversity and tiling for a subset of genes had a large positive effect on both recovery and completeness. The resulting data produced an accurate species tree, but importantly this same data can also be applied to studies of molecular evolution and function that will allow researchers to ask larger questions in broader phylogenetic contexts. Our method demonstrates the utility of cross-species approaches for the capture of full length coding sequences, and will substantially improve the ability for researchers to conduct large-scale comparative studies of molecular evolution and function.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid incompatibility resulting from deleterious gene combinations is thought to be an important step towards reproductive isolation and speciation. Here we demonstrate involvement of a silent epiallele in hybrid incompatibility. In Arabidopsis thaliana strain Col-0, one of the two copies of a duplicated histidine biosynthesis gene, HISN6B is not expressed, for reasons that have been unclear, making its paralog, HISN6A essential. By contrast, in strain Cvi-0, HISN6B is essential because HISN6A is mutated. As a result of these differences, Cvi-0 x Col-0 hybrid progeny that are homozygous for both Col-0 HISN6B and Cvi-0 HISN6A do not survive. We show that HISN6B is not a defective pseudogene in the Col-0 strain, but a stably silenced epiallele. Mutating HISTONE DEACETYLASE 6 (HDA6) or the cytosine methyltransferase genes, MET1 or CMT3 erases HISN6Bs silent locus identity in Col-0, reanimating the gene such that hisn6a lethality and hybrid incompatibility are circumvented. These results show that HISN6-dependent hybrid lethality is a revertible epigenetic phenomenon and provide additional evidence that epigenetic variation has the potential to limit gene flow between diverging populations of a species.\\n\\nSignificance statementDeleterious mutations in different copies of a duplicated gene pair have the potential to cause hybrid incompatibility between diverging subpopulations, contributing to reproductive isolation and speciation. This study demonstrates a case of epigenetic gene silencing, rather than pseudogene creation by mutation, contributing to a lethal gene combination upon hybridization of two strains of Arabidopsis thaliana. The findings provide direct evidence that naturally occurring epigenetic variation can contribute to incompatible hybrid genotypes, reducing gene flow between strains of the same species.",

    "abstract": "Linear mixed models are widely used in humans, animals, and plants to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A characteristic of experimental designs for plants is that experimental units are typically multiple-plant plots of families or lines that are replicated across environments. This structure can present computational challenges to conducting a genome scan on raw (plot-level) data. Two-stage methods have been proposed to reduce the complexity and increase the computational speed of whole-genome scans. The first stage of the analysis fits raw data to a model including environment and line effects, but no individual marker effects. The second stage involves the whole genome scan of marker tests using summary values for each line as the dependent variable. Missing data and unbalanced experimental designs can result in biased estimates of marker association effects from two-stage analyses. In this study, we developed a weighted two-stage analysis to reduce bias and improve power of GWAS while maintaining the computational efficiency of two-stage analyses. Simulation based on real marker data of a diverse panel of maize inbred lines was used to compare power and false discovery rate of the new weighted two-stage method to single-stage and other two-stage analyses and to compare different two-stage models. In the case of severely unbalanced data, only the weighted two-stage GWAS has power and false discovery rate similar to the one-stage analysis. The weighted GWAS method has been implemented in the open-source software TASSEL.",

    "abstract": "Grapevines, like other perennial crops, are affected by so-called  trunk diseases, which damage the trunk and other woody tissues. Mature grapevines typically contract more than one trunk disease and often multiple grapevine trunk pathogens (GTPs) are recovered from infected tissues. The co-existence of different GTP species in complex and dynamic microbial communities complicates the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development especially under vineyard conditions. The objective of this study was to develop and optimize a community-level transcriptomics (i.e., metatranscriptomics) approach that can monitor simultaneously the virulence activities of multiple GTPs in planta. The availability of annotated genomes for the most relevant co-infecting GTPs in diseased grapevine wood provided the unprecedented opportunity to generate a multi-species reference for mapping and quantifying DNA and RNA sequencing reads. We first evaluated popular sequence read mappers using permutations of multiple simulated datasets. Alignment parameters of the selected mapper were optimized to increase the specificity and sensitivity for its application to metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses. Initial testing on grapevine wood experimentally inoculated with individual GTPs confirmed the validity of the method. Using naturally-infected field samples expressing a variety of trunk disease symptoms, we show that our approach provides quantitative assessments of species composition as well as genome-wide transcriptional profiling of potential virulence factors, namely cell wall degradation, secondary metabolism and nutrient uptake for all co-infecting GTPs.",

The epigenetic effect of the flour moth is induced by changes in ontogenetic development, such as increased temperature on pupae development, little nutritious food, different salts in food of certain chemicals into eggs. We found this mechanism may explain the intermittent clearance of this effect at some individuals and/or progeny of a pair in the generation chain in which the effect transfers. As the nature of the observed phenomenon could related to sirtuin genes, we hypothesize an association of these genes and non-coding small Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The key is that the survival of RNA over many generations carries a number of practical implications. It is evident that the reaction to environmental change can manifest through RNA. It follows that there may be evolutionary significance in the long-term transmission of traits to future generations.",

    "abstract": "The organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is dictated by microtubule nucleators or organizing centers. Toxoplasma gondii, an important human parasite, has an array of 22 regularly spaced cortical microtubules stemming from a hypothesized organizing center, the apical polar ring. Here, we examine the functions of the apical polar ring by characterizing two of its components, KinesinA and APR1, and discovered that its putative role in templating can be separated from its mechanical stability. Parasites that lack both KinesinA and APR1 ({Delta}kinesinA{Delta}apr1) are capable of generating 22 cortical microtubules. However, the apical polar ring is fragmented in live{Delta} kinesinA{Delta}apr1 parasites, and is undetectable by electron microscopy after detergent extraction. Disintegration of the apical polar ring results in the detachment of groups of microtubules from the apical end of the parasite. These structural defects are linked to a diminished ability of the parasite to move and to invade host cells, as well as decreased secretion of effectors important for these processes. Together, the findings demonstrate the importance of the structural integrity of the apical polar ring and the microtubule array in the Toxoplasma lytic cycle, which is responsible for massive tissue destruction in acute toxoplasmosis.",

    "abstract": "MotivationA complex disease is usually driven by a number of genes interwoven into networks, rather than a single gene product. Network comparison or differential network analysis has become an important means of revealing the underlying mechanism of pathogenesis and identifying clinical biomarkers for disease classification. Most studies, however, are limited to network correlations that mainly capture the linear relationship among genes, or rely on the assumption of a parametric probability distribution of gene measurements. They are restrictive in real application.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a new Joint density based non-parametric Differential Interaction Network Analysis and Classification (JDINAC) method to identify differential interaction patterns of network activation between two groups. At the same time, JDINAC uses the network biomarkers to build a classification model. The novelty of JDINAC lies in its potential to capture non-linear relations between molecular interactions using high-dimensional sparse data as well as to adjust confounding factors, without the need of the assumption of a parametric probability distribution of gene measurements. Simulation studies demonstrate that JDINAC provides more accurate differential network estimation and lower classification error than that achieved by other state-of-the-art methods. We apply JDINAC to a Breast Invasive Carcinoma dataset, which includes 114 patients who have both tumor and matched normal samples. The hub genes and differential interaction patterns identified were consistent with existing experimental studies. Furthermore, JDINAC discriminated the tumor and normal sample with high accuracy by virtue of the identified biomarkers. JDINAC provides a general framework for feature selection and classification using high-dimensional sparse omics data.\\n\\nAvailabilityR scripts available at https://github.com/jijiadong/JDINAC\\n\\nContactlxie@iscb.org\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at bioRxiv online.",

    "abstract": "Biological model curation provides new insights by integrating biological knowledge-fragments, assessing their uncertainty, and analyzing the reliability of potential interpretations. Here we integrate published results about circadian clocks in Drosophila melanogaster while exploring economies of scale in biological model curation. Clocks govern rhythms of gene-expression that impact fitness, health, cancer, memory, mental functions, and more. Human clock insights have been repeatedly pioneered in flies. Flies simplify investigating complex gene regulatory networks, which express proteins cyclically using environmentally entrained interlocking feedback loops that act as clocks. Simulations could simplify research further. We found that very few computational models test their quality directly against experimentally observed time series scattered in the literature. We designed FlyClockbase for integrating such scattered data to enable robust efficient access for biologists and modelers. To this end we have been defining data structures that simplify the construction and maintenance of Versioned Biological Information Resources (VBIRs) that prioritize simplicity, openness, and therefore maintainability. We aim to simplify the preservation of more raw data and relevant annotations from experiments in order to multiply the long-term value of wet-lab datasets for modelers interested in meta-analyses, parameter estimates, and hypothesis testing. Currently FlyClockbase contains over 400 wildtype time series of core circadian components systematically curated from 86 studies published between 1990 and 2015. Using FlyClockbase, we show that PERIOD protein amount peak time variance unexpectedly exceeds that of TIMELESS. We hypothesize that PERIODs exceedingly more complex phosphorylation rules are responsible. Variances of daily event times are easily confounded by errors. We improved result reliability by a human error analysis of our data handling; this revealed significance-degrading outliers, possibly violating a presumed absence of wildtype heterogeneity or lab evolution. Separate analyses revealed elevated stochasticity in PCR-based peak time variances; yet our reported core difference in peak time variances appears robust. Our study demonstrates how biological model curation enhances the understanding of circadian clocks. It also highlights diverse broader challenges that are likely to become recurrent themes if models in molecular systems biology aim to integrate  all relevant knowledge. We developed a trans-disciplinary workflow, which demonstrates the importance of developing compilers for VBIRs with a more biology-friendly logic that is likely to greatly simplify biological model curation. Curation-limited grand challenges, including personalizing medicine, critically depend on such progress if they are indeed to integrate  all relevant knowledge.\\n\\nGeneral Article SummaryCircadian clocks impact health and fitness by controlling daily rhythms of gene-expression through complex gene-regulatory networks. Deciphering how they work requires experimentally tracking changes in amounts of clock components. We designed FlyClockbase to simplify data-access for biologists and modelers, curating over 400 time series observed in wildtype fruit flies from 25 years of clock research. Substantial biological model curation was essential for identifying differences in peak time variance of the clock-proteins  PERIOD and  TIMELESS, which probably stem from differences in phosphorylation-network complexity.\\n\\nWe repeatedly encountered systemic limitations of contemporary data analysis strategies in our work on circadian clocks. Thus, we used it as an opportunity for composing a panoramic view of the broader challenges in biological model curation, which are likely to increase as biologists aim to integrate all existing expertise in order to address diverse grand challenges. We developed and tested a trans-disciplinary research workflow, which enables biologists and compiler-architects to define biology-friendly compilers for efficiently constructing and maintaining Versioned Biological Information Resources (VBIRs). We report insights gleaned from our practical clock research that are essential for defining a VBIRs infrastructure, which improves the efficiency of biological model curation to the point where it can be democratized.\\n\\nStatement of data availabilityStabilizing Versioned Variant of this file: QQv1r4_2017m07d14_Lion\\n\\nBefore final publication FlyClockbase will be at https://github.com/FlyClockbase For review purposes FlyClockbase QQv1r4 will be provided as a zip-archive in the uploaded Supplemental Material; it is also available upon request from L.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new framework for analyzing cross-frequency coupling in multichannel electrophysiological recordings. The generalized eigendecomposition-based cross-frequency coupling framework (gedCFC) is inspired by source separation algorithms combined with dynamics of mesoscopic neurophysiological processes. It is unaffected by factors that confound traditional CFC methods such as non-stationarities, non-sinusoidality, and non-uniform phase angle distributions--attractive properties considering that brain activity is neither stationary nor perfectly sinusoidal. The gedCFC framework opens new opportunities for conceptualizing CFC as network interactions with diverse spatial/topographical distributions. five specific methods within the gedCFC framework are detailed, with validations in simulated data and applications in several empirical datasets. gedCFC accurately recovers physiologically plausible CFC patterns embedded in noise where traditional CFC methods perform poorly. It is also demonstrated that spike-field coherence in multichannel local field potential data can be analyzed using the gedCFC framework, with significant advantages over traditional spike-field coherence analyses. Null-hypothesis testing is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri Kuwayama) is the insect vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the pathogen associated with citrus Huanglongbing (HLB, citrus greening). HLB threatens citrus production worldwide. Suppression or reduction of the insect vector using chemical insecticides has been the primary method to inhibit the spread of citrus greening disease. Accurate structural and functional annotation of the Asian citrus psyllid genome, as well as a clear understanding of the interactions between the insect and CLas, are required for development of new molecular-based HLB control methods. A draft assembly of the D. citri genome has been generated and annotated with automated pipelines. However, knowledge transfer from well-curated reference genomes such as that of Drosophila melanogaster to newly sequenced ones is challenging due to the complexity and diversity of insect genomes. To identify and improve gene models as potential targets for pest control, we manually curated several gene families with a focus on genes that have key functional roles in D. citri biology and CLas interactions. This community effort produced 530 manually curated gene models across developmental, physiological, RNAi regulatory, and immunity-related pathways. As previously shown in the pea aphid, RNAi machinery genes putatively involved in the microRNA pathway have been specifically duplicated. A comprehensive transcriptome enabled us to identify a number of gene families that are either missing or misassembled in the draft genome. In order to develop biocuration as a training experience, we included undergraduate and graduate students from multiple institutions, as well as experienced annotators from the insect genomics research community. The resulting gene set (OGS v1.0) combines both automatically predicted and manually curated gene models. All data are available on https://citrusgreening.org/.",

    "abstract": "Populations of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) transform direct thalamic inputs into a cortical representation which acquires new spatio-temporal properties. One of these properties, motion selectivity, has not been strongly tied to putative neural mechanisms, and its origins remain poorly understood. Here we propose that motion selectivity is acquired through the recurrent mechanisms of a network of strongly connected neurons. We first show that a bank of V1 spatiotemporal receptive fields can be generated accurately by a network which receives only instantaneous inputs from the retina. The temporal structure of the receptive fields is generated by the long timescale dynamics associated with the high magnitude eigenvalues of the recurrent connectivity matrix. When these eigenvalues have complex parts, they generate receptive fields that are inseparable in time and space, such as those tuned to motion direction. We also show that the recurrent connectivity patterns can be learnt directly from the statistics of natural movies using a temporally-asymmetric Hebbian learning rule. Probed with drifting grating stimuli and moving bars, neurons in the model show patterns of responses analogous to those of direction-selective simple cells in primary visual cortex. These computations are enabled by a specific pattern of recurrent connections, that can be tested by combining connectome reconstructions with functional recordings.*\\n\\nAuthor summaryDynamic visual scenes provide our eyes with enormous quantities of visual information, particularly when the visual scene changes rapidly. Even at modest moving speeds, individual small objects quickly change their location causing single points in the scene to change their luminance equally fast. Furthermore, our own movements through the world add to the velocities of objects relative to our retinas, further increasing the speed at which visual inputs change. How can a biological system process efficiently such vast amounts of information, while keeping track of objects in the scene? Here we formulate and analyze a solution that is enabled by the temporal dynamics of networks of neurons.",

However, a lack of consensus about benchmarking datasets and evaluation metrics complicates proper performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their programs on datasets of unprecedented complexity and realism. Benchmark metagenomes were generated from ~700 newly sequenced microorganisms and ~600 novel viruses and plasmids, including genomes with varying degrees of relatedness to each other and to publicly available ones and representing common experimental setups. Across all datasets, assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes, while performance was substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below the family level. Parameter settings substantially impacted performances, underscoring the importance of program reproducibility. While highlighting current challenges in computational metagenomics, the CAMI results provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.",

Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X2 = 20.42, p = 0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships amongst them.

    "abstract": "Humans form complex social networks that include numerous non-reproductive bonds with non-kin. Navigating these networks presents a considerable cognitive challenge thought to have comprised a driving force in human brain evolution. Yet, little is known about how and to what extent the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in which it is embedded. By combining social network analysis and multi-voxel pattern analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we show that social network information about direct relationships, bonds between third parties, and aspects of the broader network topology is accurately perceived and automatically activated upon seeing a familiar other.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing has become a powerful tool for studying emerging infectious diseases; however, genome sequencing directly from clinical samples without isolation remains challenging for viruses such as Zika, where metagenomic sequencing methods may generate insufficient numbers of viral reads. Here we present a protocol for generating coding-sequence complete genomes comprising an online primer design tool, a novel multiplex PCR enrichment protocol, optimised library preparation methods for the portable MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the Illumina range of instruments, and a bioinformatics pipeline for generating consensus sequences. The MinION protocol does not require an internet connection for analysis, making it suitable for field applications with limited connectivity. Our method relies on multiplex PCR for targeted enrichment of viral genomes from samples containing as few as 50 genome copies per reaction. Viral consensus sequences can be achieved starting with clinical samples in 1-2 days following a simple laboratory workflow. This method has been successfully used by several groups studying Zika virus evolution and is facilitating an understanding of the spread of the virus in the Americas.",

Despite progresses in super-resolution microscopy, discriminating and quantifying these processes is a challenge, requiring tracking of rapidly moving, sub-diffraction objects in a crowded, noisy environment. Here we use Differential Dynamic Microscopy with different contrast mechanisms to provide a thorough characterization of the dynamics in the Drosophila oocyte. We study the movement of vesicles and the elusive motion of a cytoplasmic F-actin mesh, a known regulator of cytoplasmic flows. We find that cytoplasmic motility constitutes a combination of directed motion and random diffusion. While advection is mainly attributed to microtubules, we find that active diffusion is driven by the actin cytoskeleton, although it is also enhanced by the flow. We also find that an important dynamic link exists between vesicles and cytoplasmic F-actin motion, as recently suggested in mouse oocytes.",

Pediatric onset IBD represents [&ge;]25% of all IBD diagnoses and often presents with intestinal stricturing, perianal disease, and failed response to conventional treatments. NOD2 was the first and is the most replicated locus associated with adult IBD, to date. To determine the role of NOD2 and other genes in pediatric IBD, we performed whole-exome sequencing on a cohort of 1,183 patients with pediatric onset IBD (ages 0-18.5 years). We identified 92 probands who were homozygous or compound heterozygous for rare and low frequency NOD2 variants accounting for approximately 8% of our cohort, suggesting a Mendelian recessive inheritance pattern of disease. Additionally, we investigated the contribution of recessive inheritance of NOD2 alleles in adult IBD patients from the Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC)-Geisinger Health System DiscovEHR study, which links whole exome sequences to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from 51,289 participants. We found that ~7% of cases in this adult IBD cohort, including ~10% of CD cases, can be attributed to recessive inheritance of NOD2 variants, confirming the observations from our pediatric IBD cohort. Exploration of EHR data showed that 14% of these adult IBD patients obtained their initial IBD diagnosis before 18 years of age, consistent with early onset disease. Collectively, our findings show that recessive inheritance of rare and low frequency deleterious NOD2 variants account for 7-10% of CD cases and implicate NOD2 as a Mendelian disease gene for early onset Crohns Disease.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPediatric onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents [&ge;]25% of IBD diagnoses; yet the genetic architecture of early onset IBD remains largely uncharacterized. To investigate this, we performed whole-exome sequencing and rare variant analysis on a cohort of 1,183 pediatric onset IBD patients. We found that 8% of patients in our cohort were homozygous or compound heterozygous for rare or low frequency deleterious variants in the nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene. Further investigation of whole-exome sequencing of a large clinical cohort of adult IBD patients uncovered recessive inheritance of rare and low frequency NOD2 variants in 7% of cases and that the relative risk for NOD2 variant homozygosity has likely been underestimated. While it has been reported that having >1 NOD2 risk alleles is associated with increased susceptibility to Crohns Disease (CD), our data formally demonstrate what has long been suspected: recessive inheritance of NOD2 alleles is a mechanistic driver of early onset IBD, specifically CD, likely due to loss of NOD2 protein function. Our data suggest that a subset of IBD-CD patients with early disease onset is characterized by recessive inheritance of NOD2 alleles, which has important implications for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of IBD.",

    "abstract": "In adaptive radiations species diversify rapidly to occupy an array of ecological niches. In these different niches, species might be exposed to parasites through different routes and at different levels. If this is the case, adaptive radiations should be accompanied by a turnover in parasite communities. How the adaptive radiation of host species might be entangled with such a turnover of parasite communities is poorly documented in nature. In the present study, we examined the intestinal parasite faunas of eleven species belonging to the tribe Tropheini, one of several adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika. The most parsimonious ancestral foraging strategy among Tropheini is relatively unselective substrate ingestion by browsing of aufwuchs. Certain lineages however evolved more specialized foraging strategies, such as selective combing of microscopic diatoms or picking of macro-invertebrates. We found that representatives of such specialized lineages bear reduced infection with intestinal acanthocephalan helminths. Possibly, the evolution of selective foraging strategies entailed reduced ingestion of intermediate invertebrate hosts of these food-web transmitted parasites. In Tropheini, trophic specialization is therefore intertwined with divergence in parasite infection. We conclude that the study of parasite communities could improve our understanding of host evolution, ecological speciation and the origin of adaptive radiations.",

    "abstract": "Interaction with social partners during or after a stressful episode aids recovery in humans and other mammals. We asked if a comparable phenomenon exists in zebrafish (Danio rerio) that live in shoals in the wild. In the first experiment, we observed that most quantifiable parameters of swimming behavior were similar when zerbafish swam alone or with companions. However, after exposure to an alarm substance (Schreckstoff), individuals recovering alone continued to display behaviors associated with fear after removal of the stimulus, while those recovering with companions did not. In the next two experiments, we examined the role of familiarity of companions. Subjects spent more time in the vicinity of familiar companions in a two-choice assay. While both familiar and unfamiliar companions reduced behavioral signs of distress, familiar companions additionally modulated cortisol and endogenous isotocin in subjects. Shortly after being united with familiar companions, isotocin spiked followed by a dampening of circulating cortisol levels. These results suggest that zebrafish experience fear attenuation in the presence of others and familiar companions are more effective at buffering the stress associated with escaping predation. Changes in behavior, circulating cortisol and isotocin levels due to social partners are reminiscent of changes due to amelioration of fear in some mammalian species in the presence of companions. The two phenomena may be related.",

    "abstract": "During a proteolytically-driven maturation process, the ortho-retroviral capsid protein (CA) assembles to form the convex shell that surrounds the viral genome. In some orthoretroviruses, including Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV), CA carries a short and hydrophobic spacer peptide (SP) at its C-terminus early in the maturation process, which is progressively removed as maturation proceeds. In this work, we show that RSV CA assembles in vitro at physiological temperatures, forming hexamer tubes that effectively model the mature capsid surface. Tube assembly is strongly influenced by electrostatic effects, and is a nucleated process that remains thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, but is effectively arrested by the large Gibbs energy barrier associated with nucleation. RSV CA tubes are multi-layered, being formed by nested and concentric tubes of capsid hexamers. However the spacer peptide acts as a layering determinant during tube assembly. If only a minor fraction of CA-SP is present, multi-layered tube formation is blocked, and single-layered tubes predominate. This likely prevents formation of biologically aberrant multi-layered capsids in the virion. The generation of single-layered hexamer tubes facilitated 3D helical image reconstruction from cryo-electron microscopy data, revealing the basic tube architecture.",

    "abstract": "This proceedings paper is the first in a series of three papers developing mathematical models for the complex relationship between pain and the sleep-wake cycle. Here, we briefly review what is known about the relationship between pain and the sleep-wake cycle in humans and laboratory rodents in an effort to identify constraints for the models. While it is well accepted that sleep behavior is regulated by a daily (circadian) timekeeping system and homeostatic sleep drive, the joint modulation of these two primary biological processes on pain sensitivity has not been considered. Under experimental conditions, pain sensitivity varies across the 24 h day, with highest sensitivity occurring during the evening in humans. Pain sensitivity is also modulated by sleep behavior, with pain sensitivity increasing in response to the build up of homeostatic sleep pressure following sleep deprivation or sleep disruption. To explore the interaction between these two biological processes using modeling, we first compare the magnitude of their effects across a variety of experimental pain studies in humans. To do this comparison, we normalize the results from experimental pain studies relative to the range of physiologicallymeaningful stimulation levels. Following this normalization, we find that the estimated impact of the daily rhythm and of sleep deprivation on experimental pain measurements is surprisingly consistent across different pain modalities. We also review evidence documenting the impact of circadian rhythms and sleep deprivation on the neural circuitry in the spinal cord underlying pain sensation. The characterization of sleep-dependent and circadian influences on pain sensitivity in this review paper is used to develop and constrain the mathematical models introduced in the two companion articles.",

    "abstract": "Recent genetic studies have established that the KhoeSan populations of southern Africa are distinct from all other African populations and have remained largely isolated during human prehistory until about 2,000 years ago. Dozens of different KhoeSan groups exist, belonging to three different language families, but very little is known about their population history. We examine new genome-wide polymorphism data and whole mitochondrial genomes for more than one hundred South Africans from the =Khomani San and Nama populations of the Northern Cape, analyzed in conjunction with 19 additional southern African populations. Our analyses reveal fine-scale population structure in and around the Kalahari Desert. Surprisingly, this structure does not always correspond to linguistic or subsistence categories as previously suggested, but rather reflects the role of geographic barriers and the ecology of the greater Kalahari Basin. Regardless of subsistence strategy, the indigenous Khoe-speaking Nama pastoralists and the N|u-speaking =Khomani (formerly hunter-gatherers) share ancestry with other Khoe-speaking forager populations that form a rim around the Kalahari Desert. We reconstruct earlier migration patterns and estimate that the southern Kalahari populations were among the last to experience gene flow from Bantu-speakers, approximately 14 generations ago. We conclude that local adoption of pastoralism, at least by the Nama, appears to have been primarily a cultural process with limited genetic impact from eastern Africa.\\n\\nData depositionData files are freely available on the Henn Lab website: http://ecoevo.stonybrook.edu/hennlab/data-software/\\n\\nSummaryDistinct, spatially organized ancestries demonstrate fine-scale population structure in southern Africa, implying a more complex history of the KhoeSan than previously thought. Southern KhoeSan ancestry in the Nama and =Khomani is shared in a rim around the Kalahari Desert. We hypothesize that there was recent migration of pastoralists from East Africa into southern Africa, independent of the Bantu-expansion, but the spread of pastoralism within southern Africa occurred largely by cultural diffusion.",
