    "abstract": "Contrary to what is often assumed in population genetics, independently segregating loci do not have completely independent ancestries, since all loci are inherited through a single, shared population pedigree. Previous work has shown that the non-independence between gene genealogies of independently segregating loci created by the population pedigree is weak in panmictic populations, and predictions made from standard coalescent theory are accurate for populations that are at least moderately sized. Here, we investigate patterns of coalescence in pedigrees of structured populations. We find that the pedigree creates deviations away from the predictions of the structured coalescent that persist on a longer timescale than in the case of panmictic populations. Nevertheless, we find that the structured coalescent provides a reasonable approximation for the coalescent process in structured population pedigrees so long as migration events are moderately frequent and there are no migration events in the recent pedigree of the sample. When there are migration events in the recent sample pedigree, we find that distributions of coalescence in the sample can be modeled as a mixture of distributions from different initial sample configurations. We use this observation to motivate a maximum-likelihood approach for inferring migration rates and mutation rates jointly with features of the pedigree such as recent migrant ancestry and recent relatedness. Using simulation, we show that our inference framework accurately recovers long-term migration rates in the presence of recent migration events in the sample pedigree.",

    "abstract": "1.Interpretation of pathological gait has, for decades, offered insight into amputee anomalies and diseases such as cerebral palsy. Gait analysis has been actively used at the Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahatya Samiti for such purposes. The normative gait data used to compare data obtained from amputees, however, has been collected from laboratories under dissimilar conditions, skewing interpretation. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were extractedfrom 43 male Indian subjects using a 7.5m walkway and the BTS Bioengineering GAITLAB setup. Working under the hypothesis that a lack of cross-cultural validity was somewhat responsible for variations in normative gait, we attempted to develop a region-specific data set for use at the headquarters of the Jaipur Foot Organization Bhagwan Mahaveer Viklang Sahatya Samiti (BMVSS). Stratified random sampling was used to recruit subjects and measures were taken to ensure minimal effects of extraneous variables. Statistical analysis was performed on obtained data using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to gauge the effect age and ethnicity had on normative values of the parameters investigated. We found statistically significant p-values for a few spatiotemporal parameters in the analysis of variance for both age and ethnicity. While the results were much less significant than initially hypothesized, the study proved an efficient way to create a normative gait data set exclusively for use at the gait laboratory of the Jaipur Foot Organization, thereby eliminating potential erroneous interpretation of pathological gait when comparing said gait to normative gait data obtained in laboratories under dissimilar conditions.",

    "abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed significantly to the understanding of complex disease genetics. However, GWAS only report associated signals and do not necessarily identify culprit genes. As most signals occur in non-coding regions of the genome, it is often challenging to assign genomic variants to the underlying causal mechanism(s). Topologically associating domains (TADs) are primarily cell-type independent genomic regions that define interactome boundaries and can aid in the designation of limits within which an association most likely impacts gene function. We describe and validate a computational method that uses the genic content of TADs to discover candidate genes. Our method, called \\\"TAD_Pathways,\\\" performs a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis over genes that reside within TAD boundaries corresponding to GWAS signals for a given trait or disease. We applied our pipeline to the GWAS catalog entries associated with bone mineral density (BMD), identifying  Skeletal System Development (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p=1.02x10-5) as the top ranked pathway. In many cases, our method implicated a gene other than the nearest gene. Our molecular experiments describe a novel example: ACP2, implicated at the canonical  ARHGAP1 locus. We found ACP2 to be an important regulator of osteoblast metabolism, whereas ARHGAP1 was not supported. Our results via the example of BMD demonstrate how basic principles of three-dimensional genome organization can define biologically informed association windows.",

    "abstract": "Cyclically stretched cells are known to exhibit a strain-induced reorientation response. In this study, we comprehensively analyse this behaviour for human fibroblasts subjected to a highly non-uniform strain field within a polymethylsiloxane microdevice. We demonstrate a strong correlation between the strain amplitude and the degree of cell alignment perpendicular to the principal strain direction (stretching avoidance). Analogously, our results indicate that the strain gradient amplitude and direction also regulate this reorientation through a coordinated gradient avoidance response. We stipulate that strain gradients are thus biologically relevant mechanical cues sensed by cells. To gain insight into the underlying mechanosensing processes, we also studied focal adhesion reorganization and the effect of modulating myosin-II contractility. The extracted focal adhesion orientation distributions are similar to those obtained for the cell bodies, and their density is increased by the presence of stretching forces. Moreover, it was found that the myosin-II activity promoter calyculin-A has little effect on the cellular response, while the inhibitor blebbistatin suppresses cell and focal adhesion alignment and reduces focal adhesion density. These results confirm that similar internal structures involved in sensing and responding to strain direction and amplitude are also key players in strain gradient mechanosensing and avoidance.",

    "abstract": "Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is a powerful tool based on protein evolution and introduced to predict protein fold and protein-protein interactions which has been applied also to the prediction of entire interactomes. We have used DCA to analyse three proteins of the iron-sulfur biogenesis machine, an essential metabolic pathway conserved in all organisms. We show that, although based on a relatively small number of sequences due to its distribution in genomes, we can correctly recapitulate all the features of the fold of the CyaY/frataxin family, a protein involved in the human disease Friedreichs ataxia. This result gave us confidence in the use of this tool. Application of DCA to the iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein IscU, which has been suggested to function both as an ordered and a disordered form, allows us to clearly distinguish evolutionary traces of the structured species, suggesting that, if present in the cell, the disordered form has not left any evolutionary imprinting. We observe instead, for the first time, direct indications of how the protein can dimerize head-to-head and bind 4Fe4S clusters. Analysis of the alternative scaffold protein IscA provides strong support to a coordination of the cluster mediated by a dimeric rather than a tetrameric form as previously suggested. Our analysis also suggests the presence in solution of a mixture of monomeric and dimeric species and guide us to the prevalent one. Finally, we used DCA to analyse protein-protein interactions between some of these proteins and discuss the potentialities and the limitations of the method.",

Classical models for the distribution of allele frequencies, using forward simulation, coalescent theory, or the diffusion approximation, have been applied extensively for demographic inference, medical study design, and evolutionary studies. Here we propose a tractable model of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of allele frequencies that is closely related to the diffusion approximation but avoids many of its limitations and approximations. We show that the approach is typically faster, more numerically stable, and more easily generalizable than the state-of-the-art software implementation of the diffusion approximation. We present a number of applications to human sequence data, including demographic inference with a five-population joint frequency spectrum and a discussion of the transferability of demographic histories across populations.",

The genetic requirements for many such complex components have been described, and the biochemical activities of complex components characterised in vitro, yet the molecular mechanisms by which these biochemical activities impact transcriptional regulation in vivo remain ill-defined. Using an inducible system with fine temporal resolution, we show that the Nucleosome Remodelling and Deacetylation (NuRD) complex directly regulates chromatin architecture at enhancer regions in ES cells, in turn influencing the activity of RNA polymerase II via Mediator. Through this mechanism NuRD restricts Mediator access to enhancer chromatin during lineage commitment, thereby enabling appropriate transcriptional regulation. In contrast, acetylation levels of histone H3 lysine 27 are not immediately impacted by NuRD activity, correlating with transcriptional response only after expression levels have changed. These findings provide a detailed, molecular picture of genome-wide modulation of lineage-specific transcription by an abundant chromatin remodelling complex.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity in life courses among individuals of a population influences the speed of adaptive evolutionary processes, but it is less clear how biotic and abiotic environmental fluctuations influence such heterogeneity. We investigate principal drivers of variability in sequence of stages during an individuals life in a stage-structured population. We quantify heterogeneity by measuring population entropy, which computes the rate of diversification of individual life courses of a Markov chain. Using individual data of a primate population, we show that density regulates the stage composition of the population, but its entropy and the generating moments of heterogeneity are independent of density. This lack of influence of density on heterogeneity is neither due to low year-to-year variation in entropy nor due to differences in survival among stages, but due to differences in stage transitions. Our analysis thus shows that well-known classical ecological selective forces, such as density regulation, are not linked to potential selective forces governing heterogeneity through underlying stage dynamics. Despite evolution acting heavily on individual variability in fitness components, our understanding is poor whether observed heterogeneity is adaptive and how it evolves and is maintained. Our analysis illustrates how entropy represents a more integrated measure of diversity compared to the population structural composition, giving us new insights about the underlying drivers of individual heterogeneity within populations and potential evolutionary mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Balancing exploration and exploitation is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning. Previous neuroimaging studies of the exploration-exploitation dilemma could not completely disentangle these two processes, making it difficult to unambiguously identify their neural signatures. We overcome this problem using a task in which subjects can either observe (pure exploration) or bet (pure exploitation). Insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showed significantly greater activity on observe trials compared to bet trials, suggesting that these regions play a role in driving exploration. A model-based analysis of task performance suggested that subjects chose to observe until a critical evidence threshold was reached. We observed a neural signature of this evidence accumulation process in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings support theories positing an important role for anterior cingulate cortex in exploration, while also providing a new perspective on the roles of insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSitting down at a familiar restaurant, you may choose to order an old favorite or sample a new dish. In reinforcement learning theory, this is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. The optimal solution is known to be intractable; therefore, humans must use heuristic strategies. Behavioral studies have revealed several candidate strategies, but identifying the neural mechanisms underlying these strategies is complicated due to the fact that exploration and exploitation are not perfectly dissociable in standard tasks. Using an \\\"observe or bet\\\" task, we identify for the first time pure neural correlates of exploration and exploitation in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "The Trail Making Test is a widely used test of executive function and has been thought to be strongly associated with general cognitive function. We examined the genetic architecture of the trail making test and its shared genetic aetiology with other tests of cognitive function in 23 821 participants from UK Biobank. The SNP-based heritability estimates for trail-making measures were 7.9 % (part A), 22.4 % (part B), and 17.6 % (part B - part A). Significant genetic correlations were identified between trail-making measures and verbal-numerical reasoning (rg > 0.6), general cognitive function (rg > 0.6), processing speed (rg > 0.7), and memory (rg > 0.3). Polygenic profile analysis indicated considerable shared genetic aetiology between trail making, general cognitive function, processing speed, and memory (standardized {beta} between 0.03 and 0.08). These results suggest that trail making is both phenotypically and genetically strongly associated with general cognitive function and processing speed.",

    "abstract": "The alignment among three or more nucleotides/amino-acids sequences at the same time is known as Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), an NP-hard optimization problem. The time complexity of finding an optimal alignment raises exponentially when the number of sequences to align increases. In this work, we deal with a multiobjective version of the MSA problem where the goal is to simultaneously optimize the accuracy and conservation of the alignment. A parallel version of the Hybrid Multiobjective Memetic Metaheuristics for Multiple Sequence Alignment is proposed. In order to evaluate the parallel performance of our proposal, we have selected a pull of datasets with different number of sequences (up to 1000 sequences) and study its parallel performance against other well-known parallel metaheuristics published in the literature, such as MSAProbs, T-Coffee, Clustal {Omega}, and MAFFT. The comparative study reveals that our parallel aligner is around 25 times faster than the sequential version with 32 cores, obtaining a parallel efficiency around 80%.",

To begin to understand the ways in which the desert adapted rodent P. eremicus survives, we performed an experiment by which we subjected reproductively mature adults to profound acute dehydration, during which they lost on average 23% of their body weight. Animals react via a series of changes in the kidney, which include modulating expression of genes responsible for reducing the rate of transcription, and maintaining water and salt balance. Extracellular matrix turnover appears to be decreased, and apoptosis is limited. Serum Creatinine and other biomarkers of kidney injury are not elevated, which is different than the canonical human response, suggesting that transcriptional changes caused by acute dehydration effectively prohibit widespread kidney damage in the cactus mouse.",

    "abstract": "Genetics can provide a systematic approach to discovering the tissues and cell types relevant for a complex disease or trait. Identifying these tissues and cell types is critical for following up on non-coding allelic function, developing ex-vivo models, and identifying therapeutic targets. Here, we analyze gene expression data from several sources, including the GTEx and PsychENCODE consortia, together with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 48 diseases and traits with an average sample size of 169,331, to identify disease-relevant tissues and cell types. We develop and apply an approach that uses stratified LD score regression to test whether disease heritability is enriched in regions surrounding genes with the highest specific expression in a given tissue. We detect tissue-specific enrichments at FDR < 5% for 34 diseases and traits across a broad range of tissues that recapitulate known biology. In our analysis of traits with observed central nervous system enrichment, we detect an enrichment of neurons over other brain cell types for several brain-related traits, enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder but excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index, and enrichments in the cortex for schizophrenia and in the striatum for migraine. In our analysis of traits with observed immunological enrichment, we identify enrichments of T cells for asthma and eczema, B cells for primary biliary cirrhosis, and myeloid cells for Alzheimer's disease, which we validated with independent chromatin data. Our results demonstrate that our polygenic approach is a powerful way to leverage gene expression data for interpreting GWAS signal.",

We present an unsupervised approach based on the direct-coupling analysis of homologous proteins. We show its capability to quantify mutations where methods without context dependence fail.

Brain decoding has primarily been used in cognitive neurosciences to predict differences between pairs of stimuli (e.g. faces vs. houses), but how distinct brain/perceptual states can be decoded following the presentation of continuous sensory stimuli is unclear. Here, we developed a novel approach to decode brain activity recorded with magnetoencephalography while participants discriminated the coherence of two intermingled clouds of dots. Seven levels of visual motion coherence were tested and participants reported the colour of the most coherent cloud. The decoding approach was formulated as a ranked-classification problem, in which the model was evaluated by its capacity to predict the order of a pair of trials, each tested with two distinct visual motion coherence levels. Two brain states were decoded as a function of the degree of visual motion coherence. Importantly, perceptual motion coherence thresholds were found to match the decoder boundaries in a fully data-driven way. The algorithm revealed the earliest categorization in hMT+, followed by V1/V2, IPS, and vlPFC.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMitogenome diversity is staggering among early branching animals with respect to size, gene density and content, gene orders, and number of tRNA genes, especially in cnidarians. This last point is of special interest as tRNA cleavage drives the maturation of mitochondrial mRNAs and is a primary mechanism for mt-RNA processing in animals. Mitochondrial RNA processing in non-bilaterian metazoans, some of which possess a single tRNA gene in their mitogenomes, is essentially unstudied despite its importance in understanding the evolution of mitochondrial transcription in animals.\\n\\nResultsWe characterized the mature mitochondrial mRNA transcripts in a species of the octocoral genus Sinularia (Alcyoniidae: Octocorallia), and defined precise boundaries of transcription units using different molecular methods. Most mt-mRNAs were polycistronic units containing two or three genes and 5 and/or 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) of varied length. The octocoral specific, mtDNA-encoded mismatch repair gene, mtMutS, was found to undergo alternative polyadenylation (APA), and exhibited differential expression of alternate transcripts suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism for this gene. In addition, a long noncoding RNA complementary to the ATP6 gene (lncATP6) potentially involved in antisense regulation was detected.\\n\\nConclusionsMt-mRNA processing in octocorals bearing a single mt-tRNA is complex. Considering the variety of mitogenome arrangements known in cnidarians, and in general among non-bilaterian metazoans, our findings provide a first glimpse into the complex mtDNA transcription, mt-mRNA processing, and regulation among early branching animals and represents a first step towards understanding its functional and evolutionary implications.",

    "abstract": "Sheep was one of the first domesticated livestock species in the Anatolia region of contemporary Iran and eventually spread world-wide. Previous studies have shown that French sheep populations likely harbour a large part of European domesticated sheep diversity in a relatively small geographical region, offering a powerful model for the study of adaptation. We studied the diversity of 27 French sheep populations by genotyping 542 individuals for more than 500 000 SNPs. We found that French sheep breeds were divided into two main groups, corresponding to northern and southern origins and additionally we identified admixture events between northern and southern populations. The genetic diversity of domesticated animals results from adaptation of populations to constraints imposed by farmers and environmental conditions. We identified 126 genomic regions likely affected by selection. In many cases, we found evidence for parallel selection events in different genetic backgrounds, most likely for different mutations. Some of these regions harbour genes potentially involved in morphological traits (SOCS2, NCAPG/LCORL, MSRB3), coat colour (MC1R) and adaptation to environmental conditions (ADAMTS9). Closer inspection of two of these regions clarified their evolutionary history: at the LCORL/NCAPG locus we found evidence for introgression of an adaptive allele from a southern population into northern populations and by resequencing MC1R in some breeds we confirmed different mutations in this gene are responsible for the same phenotypic trait. Our study illustrates how dense genetic data in multiple populations allows the deciphering of evolutionary history of populations and of their adaptive mutations.",

However, correlation fails to distinguish sources as different as changes in neural signal amplitudes or noise levels. This ambiguity substantially diminishes the value of FC for inferring system properties and clinical states. Network modelling approaches may avoid ambiguities, but require specific assumptions. We present an enhancement to FC analysis with improved specificity of inferences, minimal assumptions and no reduction in flexibility. The Additive Signal Change (ASC) approach characterises FC changes into certain prevalent classes involving additions of signal. With FMRI data, the approach reveals a rich diversity of signal changes underlying measured changes in FC, bringing into question standard interpretations. The ASC method can also be used to disambiguate other measures of dependency, such as regression and coherence, providing a flexible tool for the analysis of neural data.",

While such an effect is known to play a significant role in specific situations, estimating its strength from data and, experimentally, in physiological conditions appears to be far from simple. Here we show that the susceptibility of ceRNAs to different types of perturbations affecting their competitors (and hence their tendency to crosstalk) can be encoded in quantities as intuitive and as simple to measure as correlation functions. We confirm this scenario by extensive numerical simulations and validate it by re-analyzing PTENs crosstalk pattern from TCGA breast cancer database. These results clarify the links between different quantities used to estimate the intensity of ceRNA crosstalk and provide new keys to analyze transcriptional datasets and effectively probe ceRNA networks in silico.",

    "abstract": "The development of reproductive barriers against parent species is crucial during hybrid speciation, and post-zygotic isolation can be important in this process. Genetic incompatibilities that normally isolate the parent species can become sorted in hybrids to form reproductive barriers towards either parent. However, the extent to which this sorting process is systematically biased and therefore predictable in which loci are involved and which alleles are favored is largely unknown. Theoretically, reduced fitness in hybrids due to the mixing of differentiated genomes can be resolved through rapid evolution towards allelic combinations ancestral to lineage-splitting of the parent species, as these alleles have successfully coexisted in the past. However, for each locus, this effect may be influenced by its chromosomal location, function, and interactions with other loci. We use the Italian sparrow, a homoploid hybrid species that has developed post-zygotic barriers against its parent species, to investigate this prediction. We show significant bias towards fixation of the ancestral allele among 57 nuclear intragenic SNPs, particularly those with a mitochondrial function whose ancestral allele came from the same parent species as the mitochondria. Consistent with increased pleiotropy leading to stronger fitness effects, genes with more protein-protein interactions were more biased in favor of the ancestral allele. Furthermore, the number of protein-protein interactions was especially low among candidate incompatibilities still segregating within Italian sparrows, suggesting that low pleiotropy allows steep intraspecific clines in allele frequencies to form. Finally, we report evidence for pervasive epistatic interactions within one Italian sparrow population, particularly involving loci isolating the two parent species but not hybrid and parent. However there was a lack of classic incompatibilities and no admixture linkage disequilibrium. This suggests that parental genome admixture can continue to constrain evolution and prevent genome stabilization long after incompatibilities have been purged.",

For example, shifts in the pattern of evolutionary integration may allow the exploration of novel regions of the morphospace by lineages. Here we use phylogenetic trees to study the pace of evolution of several traits and their pattern of evolutionary correlation across clades and over time. We use regimes mapped to the branches of the phylogeny to test for shifts in evolutionary integration. Our approach incorporates the uncertainty related to phylogeny, ancestral state estimates and parameter estimates to produce posterior distributions using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo. We implemented the use of summary statistics to test for regime shifts based on a series of attributes of the model that can be directly relevant to biological hypotheses. In addition, we extend Felsensteins pruning algorithm to the case of multivariate Brownian motion models with multiple rate regimes. We performed extensive simulations to explore the performance of the method under a series of scenarios. Finally, we provide two test cases; the evolution of a novel buccal morphology in fishes of the family Centrarchidae and a shift in the trajectory of evolution of traits during the radiation of anole lizards to and from the Caribbean islands.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial transplantation is currently being explored as a means to repair and restore proper organelle function in a variety of inherited and acquired disorders of energy metabolism. The optimal preparation and application of donor mitochondria is unknown, but most studies in vivo have used injection techniques or, for tissue studies, unpackaged mitochondria (organelles isolated and suspended in buffer) in transplant experiments. Packaging in lipid rafts can increase recipient cell uptake of some compounds and objects. We present the first data comparing recipient cell uptake of unpackaged mitochondria to recipient cell uptake of mitochondria packaged in cell membrane lipids. Mitochondria and membranes were prepared from autologous cells and applied to cells (fibroblasts) in culture. Both unpackaged and lipid-packaged mitochondria were taken into recipient cells and the donor mitochondria showed evidence, in each case, of retained functionality and the ability to merge with the recipient mitochondrial matrix. However, lipid packaging appeared to enhance the uptake of functional mitochondria. Current studies of mitochondrial transplantation in animal models might fruitfully explore the utility and efficacy of lipid-packaged mitochondria in transplant experiments.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual constancy requires neural representations that are selective for object identity, but also tolerant for identity-preserving transformations. How such representations arise in the brain and contribute to perception remains unclear. Here we studied tolerant representations of sound identity in the auditory system by recording multi-unit activity in tonotopic auditory cortex of ferrets discriminating the identity of vowels which co-varied across orthogonal stimulus dimensions (fundamental frequency, sound level, location and voicing). We found that neural decoding of vowel identity was most successful across the same orthogonal dimensions over which animals generalized their behavior. We also decoded orthogonal sound features and behavioral variables including choice and accuracy to show a behaviorally-relevant, multivariate and multiplexed representation of sound, with each variable represented over a distinct time-course. Finally, information content and timing of sound feature encoding was modulated by task-engagement and training, suggesting that tolerant representations during perceptual constancy are attentionally and experience-dependent.",

We use population-level RAD-seq data to investigate whether four endemic deep water species (Diplotaxodon spp.) have experienced divergent selection within this environment.

    "abstract": "Nuclear actin influences transcription in a manner dependent on its dynamics of polymerisation and nucleocytoplasmic translocation. Using human somatic cells and transcriptionally-silent Xenopus egg extracts, we show that actin dynamics is also required for DNA replication. We identify many actin regulators in replicating nuclei from Xenopus egg extracts, and show that in human cells, nuclear actin filaments form in early G1 and disassemble prior to S-phase. In either system, treatments that stabilise nuclear actin filaments abrogate nuclear transport and initiation of DNA replication. Mechanistically, actin directly binds RanGTP-importin complexes and disruption of its dynamics hinders cargo release. This prevents both nuclear pore complex (NPC) formation and active nuclear transport, which we show is required throughout DNA replication. Nuclear formin activity is required for two further steps: loading of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto chromatin and initiation of DNA replication. Thus, actin dynamics and formins are involved in several nuclear processes essential for cell proliferation.",

Channels formed by vertebrate , {beta} and {gamma} ENaC proteins are activated by shear force (SF) and mediate electrolyte/fluid-homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. Here, we report an interdependent activity of ENaC and the ECM that mediates SF effects in murine arteries and heterologously expressed channels. Furthermore, replacement of conserved extracellular N-glycosylated asparagines of ENaC decreased the SF response indicating that the attached N-glycans provide a connection to the ECM. Insertion of N-glycosylation sites into a channel subunit, innately lacking these motifs, increased its SF response. These experiments confirm an interdependent channel/ECM activity of mechanosensitive ENaC channel and highlight the role of channel N-glycans as new constituents for the translation of mechanical force into cellular signals.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that voluntary spatial attention can affect neural processing of visual stimuli that do not enter conscious awareness (i.e. invisible stimuli), supporting the notion that attention and awareness are dissociable processes (Watanabe et al., 2011; Wyart, Dehaene, & Tallon-Baudry, 2012). To date, however, no study has demonstrated that these effects reflect enhancement of the neural representation of invisible stimuli per se, as opposed to other neural processes not specifically tied to the stimulus in question. In addition, it remains unclear whether spatial attention can modulate neural representations of invisible stimuli in direct competition with highly salient and visible stimuli. Here we developed a novel electroencephalography (EEG) frequency-tagging paradigm to obtain a continuous readout of human brain activity associated with visible and invisible signals embedded in dynamic noise. Participants (N = 23) detected occasional contrast changes in one of two flickering image streams on either side of fixation. Each image stream contained a visible or invisible signal embedded in every second noise image, the visibility of which was titrated and checked using a two-interval forced-choice detection task. Steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were computed from EEG data at the signal and noise frequencies of interest. Cluster-based permutation analyses revealed significant neural responses to both visible and invisible signals across posterior scalp electrodes. Control analyses revealed that these responses did not reflect a subharmonic response to noise stimuli. In line with previous findings, spatial attention increased the neural representation of visible signals. Crucially, spatial attention also increased the neural representation of invisible signals. As such, the present results replicate and extend previous studies by demonstrating that attention can modulate the neural representation of invisible signals that are in direct competition with highly salient masking stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that control many aspects of plant growth. The SL signalling mechanism is homologous to that of karrikins (KARs), smoke-derived compounds that stimulate seed germination. In angiosperms, the SL receptor is an /{beta} hydrolase known as DWARF14 (D14); its close homologue, KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), functions as a KAR receptor, and likely recognizes an uncharacterized, endogenous signal. Previous phylogenetic analyses have suggested that the KAI2 lineage is ancestral in land plants, and that canonical D14-type SL receptors only arose in seed plants; this is paradoxical, however, as non-vascular plants synthesize and respond to SLs. Here, we have used a combination of phylogenetic and structural approaches to re-assess the evolution of the D14/KAI2 family in land plants. We analyzed 339 members of the D14/KAI2 family from land plants and charophyte algae. Our phylogenetic analyses show that the divergence between the eu-KAI2 lineage and the DDK (D14/DLK2/KAI2) lineage that includes D14 occurred very early in land plant evolution. We identify characteristic structural features of D14 and KAI2 proteins, and use homology modelling to show that the earliest members of the DDK lineage structurally resemble KAI2, and not D14 proteins. Furthermore, we show that probable SL receptors in non-seed plants do not have D14-like structure. Our results suggest that SL perception has relatively relaxed structural requirements, and that the evolution from KAI2-like to D14-like protein structure in the DDK lineage may have been driven by interactions with protein partners, rather than being required for SL perception itself.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCritically ill patients hospitalized in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are at increased risk of acquiring potentially life-threatening infections with opportunistic pathogens. The gut microbiota of ICU patients forms an important reservoir for these infectious agents. To suppress gut colonization with opportunistic pathogens, a prophylactic antibiotic regimen, termed  Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), may be used. SDD has previously been shown to improve clinical outcome in ICU patients, but the impact of ICU hospitalization and SDD on the gut microbiota remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize the composition of the gut microbiota and its antimicrobial resistance genes ( the resistome) of ICU patients during SDD.\\n\\nResultsDuring ICU-stay, 30 fecal samples of ten patients were collected. Additionally, feces were collected from five of these patients after transfer to a medium-care ward and cessation of SDD. As a control group, feces from ten healthy subjects were collected twice, with a one-year interval. Gut microbiota and resistome composition were determined using 16S rRNA phylogenetic profiling and nanolitre-scale quantitative PCRs.\\n\\nThe microbiota of the ICU patients differed from the microbiota of healthy subjects and was characterized by low microbial diversity, decreased levels of E. coli and of anaerobic Gram-positive, butyrate-producing bacteria of the Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa, and an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and enterococci. Four resistance genes (aac(6')-Ii, ermC, qacA, tetQ), providing resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, disinfectants and tetracyclines respectively, were significantly more abundant among ICU patients than in healthy subjects, while a chloramphenicol resistance gene (catA) and a tetracycline resistance gene (tetW) were more abundant in healthy subjects.\\n\\nConclusionsThe microbiota and resistome of ICU patients and healthy subjects were noticeably different, but importantly, levels of E. coli remained low during ICU hospitalization, presumably due to SDD therapy. Selection for four antibiotic resistance genes was observed, but none of these are of particular concern as they do not contribute to clinically relevant resistance. Our data support the ecological safety of SDD, at least in settings with low levels of circulating antibiotic resistance.",
