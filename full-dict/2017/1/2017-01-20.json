    "abstract": "SummaryThe wide range of RNA-seq applications and their high computational needs require the development of pipelines orchestrating the entire workflow and optimizing usage of available computational resources. We present aRNApipe, a project-oriented pipeline for processing of RNA-seq data in high performance cluster environments. aRNApipe is highly modular and can be easily migrated to any high performance computing (HPC) environment. The current applications included in aRNApipe combine the essential RNA-seq primary analyses, including quality control metrics, transcript alignment, count generation, transcript fusion identification, alternative splicing, and sequence variant calling. aRNApipe is project-oriented and dynamic so users can easily update analyses to include or exclude samples or enable additional processing modules. Workflow parameters are easily set using a single configuration file that provides centralized tracking of all analytical processes. Finally, aRNApipe incorporates interactive web reports for sample tracking and a tool for managing the genome assemblies available to perform an analysis.\\n\\nAvailability and documentationhttps://github.com/HudsonAlpha/aRNAPipe; DOI:10.5281/zenodo.202950\\n\\nContactrmyers@hudsonalpha.org\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Modern digital pathology departments have grown to produce whole-slide image data at petabyte scale, an unprecedented treasure chest for medical machine learning tasks. Unfortunately, most digital slides are not annotated at the image level, hindering large-scale application of supervised learning. Manual labeling is prohibitive, requiring pathologists with decades of training and outstanding clinical service responsibilities. This problem is further aggravated by the United States Food and Drug Administrations ruling that primary diagnosis must come from a glass slide rather than a digital image. We present the first end-to-end framework to overcome this problem, gathering annotations in a nonintrusive manner during a pathologists routine clinical work: (i) microscope-specific 3D-printed commodity camera mounts are used to video record the glass-slide-based clinical diagnosis process; (ii) after routine scanning of the whole slide, the video frames are registered to the digital slide; (iii) motion and observation time are estimated to generate a spatial and temporal saliency map of the whole slide. Demonstrating the utility of these annotations, we train a convolutional neural network that detects diagnosis-relevant salient regions, then report accuracy of 85.15% in bladder and 91.40% in prostate, with 75.00% accuracy when training on prostate but predicting in bladder, despite different pathologists examining the different tissues. When training on one patient but testing on another, AUROC in bladder is 0.7929 0.1109 and in prostate is 0.9568{+/-}0.0374. Our tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/aschaumberg/deepscope.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenetic processes demand the coordinated allocation of cells and tissues to their final destination in a spatio-temporal controlled way. Identifying how these morphogenetic movements are directed and implemented is essential for understanding morphogenesis. Topographical and scalar differences in adhesion and contractility within and between cells are essential, yet, the role that membrane remodeling may play remains less clear. To clarify how surface turnover and dynamics may modulate tissue arrangements we studied epiboly in the zebrafish. During epiboly the blastoderm expands as a result of an asymmetry of mechanical tension along the embryo surface. In this scenario, we found that the membrane removal by macropinocytosis of the external yolk cell syncytial layer (E-YSL) ahead of the blastoderm is key for epiboly progression In early zebrafish embryos, the activity of the GTPase Rab5ab was essential for endocytosis, and interference in its expression exclusively in the yolk cell resulted in the reduction of yolk cell actomyosin contractility, the disruption of cortical and internal yolk flows, a disequilibrium in force balance and as a result epiboly impairment. We conclude that regulated membrane remodeling is crucial for directing cell and tissue mechanics and coordinating morphogenetic movements during epiboly.",

    "abstract": "Within the nematode genus Caenorhabditis, C. briggsae and C. nigoni are among the most closely related species known. They differ in sexual mode, with C. nigoni retaining the ancestral XO male-XX female outcrossing system, while C. briggsae females recently evolved self-fertility and an XX-biased sex ratio. Wild-type C. briggsae and C. nigoni can produce fertile hybrid XX female progeny, but XO progeny are either 100% inviable (when C. briggsae is the mother) or viable but sterile (when C. nigoni is the mother). A recent study provided evidence suggesting that loss of the Cbr-him-8 meiotic regulator in C. briggsae hermaphrodites allowed them to produce viable and fertile hybrid XO male progeny when mated to C. nigoni. Because such males would be useful for a variety of genetic experiments, we sought to verify this result. Preliminary crosses with wild-type C. briggsae hermaphrodites occasionally produced fertile males, but they could not be confirmed to be interspecies hybrids. Using an RNA interference protocol that eliminates any possibility of self-progeny in Cbr-him-8 hermaphrodites, we find sterile males bearing the C. nigoni X chromosome, but no fertile males bearing the C. briggsae X, as in wild-type crosses. Our results suggest that the apparent rescue of XO hybrid viability and fertility is due to incomplete purging of self-sperm prior to mating.",

    "abstract": "Here we report the findings from the first two years of an arbovirus surveillance study conducted in Machala, Ecuador, a dengue endemic region (2014-2015). Patients with suspected dengue virus (DENV) infections (index cases, n=324) were referred from five Ministry of Health clinical sites. A subset of DENV positive index cases (n = 44) were selected, and individuals from the index household and four neighboring homes within 200-meters were recruited (n = 400). Individuals who entered the study, other than index cases, are referred to as associates. In 2014, 70.9% of index cases and 35.6% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. In 2015, 28.3% of index cases and 12.8% of associates had acute or recent DENV infections. For every DENV infection captured by passive surveillance, we detected an additional three acute or recent DENV infections in associates. Of associates with acute DENV infections, 68% reported dengue-like symptoms, with the highest prevalence of symptomatic acute infections in children under 10 years of age. The first chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections were detected on epidemiological week 12 in 2015. 43.1% of index cases and 3.5% of associates had acute CHIKV infections. No Zika virus infections were detected. Phylogenetic analyses of isolates of DENV from 2014 revealed genetic relatedness and shared ancestry of DENV1, DENV2 and DENV4 genomes from Ecuador with those from Venezuela and Colombia, indicating presence of viral flow between Ecuador and surrounding countries. Enhanced surveillance studies, such as this, provide high-resolution data on symptomatic and inapparent infections across the population.",

    "abstract": "Zika has emerged as a global public health concern. Although its rapid geographic expansion can be attributed to the success of its Aedes mosquito vectors, local epidemiological drivers are still poorly understood. The city of Feira de Santana played a pivotal role in the early phases of the Chikungunya and Zika epidemics in Brazil. Here, using a climate-driven transmission model, we show that low Zika observation rates and a high vectorial capacity in this region were responsible for a high attack rate during the 2015 outbreak and the subsequent decline in cases in 2016, when the epidemic was peaking in the rest of the country. Our projections indicate that the balance between the loss of herd-immunity and the frequency of viral re-importation will dictate the transmission potential of Zika in this region in the near future. Sporadic outbreaks are expected but unlikely to be detected under current surveillance systems.",

MinION sequencing targeting 16S rDNA detected all of 20 bacteria present in the mock bacterial community. Time course analysis indicated that sequence data obtained during the first 5-minute sequencing were enough to detect all 20 bacteria species in the mock sample and determine their compositions with sufficient accuracy. Additionally, using a clinical sample extracted from the pleural effusion of a patient with empyema, we could identify major bacteria in a pleural effusion by rapid sequencing and analysis. All of these results are comparable to or even better than the conventional 16S rDNA sequencing results using IonPGM sequencer.

    "abstract": "The Siddis are a unique Indian tribe of African, South Asian and European ancestry. While their ancestral origins have been traced to the Bantu populations from sub-Saharan Africa, their population history has remained an enigmatic question. Here, we have traced the biogeographical origin of the Siddis employing an admixture based algorithm, Geographical Population Structure (GPS). We evaluated 14 Siddi genomes in reference to 5 African populations from the 1000 Genomes project and 7 Bantu populations from the Human Genome Diversity project. GPS assigned the Siddi genomes to west Zambia and the present-day border between Zimbabwe and northeastern Botswana, overlapping with one of the principal areas of secondary Bantu settlement in Africa, ~1700 years before present (YBP). This is concordant with the secondary Bantu dispersal route from the east African Bantu center that brought the African ancestors of the Siddis to settlement sites in southeast Africa, from where they were disseminated to India, by the Portuguese. Our results also suggest that while the Siddi genomes are significantly different from that of the Bantus, they displayed the highest genomic proximity to the Luhyas and North-East Bantus from Kenya, and that ancestral Siddis are likely to have split from the Luhyas, ~2700 YBP, in congruence with known Bantu expansion and population migration routes. Together with historical, linguistic and anthropological evidences our findings shine light on the genetic relatedness between populations, fine-scale population structure and recapitulate the population history of the Siddis, in the ethnohistorical context of India.",

    "abstract": "Processes that involve moving fronts of populations are prevalent in ecology and cell biology. A common approach to describe these processes is a lattice-based random walk model, which can include mechanisms such as crowding, birth, death, movement and agent-agent adhesion. However, these models are generally analytically intractable and it is computationally expensive to perform sufficiently many realisations of the model to obtain an estimate of average behaviour that is not dominated by random fluctuations. To avoid these issues, both mean-field and corrected mean-field continuum descriptions of random walk models have been proposed. However, both continuum descriptions are inaccurate outside of limited parameter regimes, and corrected mean-field descriptions cannot be employed to describe moving fronts. Here we present an alternative description in terms of the dynamics of groups of contiguous occupied lattice sites and contiguous vacant lattice sites. Our description provides an accurate prediction of the average random walk behaviour in all parameter regimes. Critically, our description accurately predicts the persistence or extinction of the population in situations where previous continuum descriptions predict the opposite outcome. Furthermore, unlike traditional mean-field models, our approach provides information about the spatial clustering within the population and, subsequently, the moving front.",

We generated a bovine exome capture design and used it to sequence and call mutations from a lactating dairy cow model genetically divergent for fertility (Fert+, n=8; Fert-, n=8). We compared mutations called from liver and muscle transcriptomes from the same animals. Our exome capture demonstrated 99.1% coverage of the exome design of 56.7MB, whereas transcriptomes covered 55 and 46.5% of the exome, or 24.4 and 20.7MB, in liver and muscle respectively after filtering. We found that specificity of SNVs in the transcriptome data is approximately 75% following basic hard-filtering, and could be increased to above 80% by increasing the minimum threshold of reads covering SNVs, but this effect was negated in more highly covered SNVs. RNA-DNA differences, SNVs found in transcriptome but not exome, were discovered and shown to have significantly increased levels of transition mutations in both tissues. Functional annotation of non-synonymous SNVs specific to the high and low fertility phenotypes identified immune response-related genes, supporting previous work that has identified differential expression in the same genes. Publically available RNAseq data may be analysed in a similar way to further increase the utility of this resource.\\n\\nSummaryThe exome and transcriptome both relate to the same protein-coding regions of the genome. There has been sparse research on characterising mutations in RNA and DNA within the same individuals. Here we characterise the similarities in our Holstein dairy cow animal model. We offer practical and biological results indicating that RNA sequencing is a useful proxy of exome sequencing, itself shown to be applicable to this livestock species using a previously untested commercial application. This potentially unlocks public RNA sequencing data for further analysis, also indicating that RNA-DNA differences may associate with transcriptomic divergence.",

    "abstract": "Global change is heating up ecosystems fuelling biodiversity loss and species extinctions. High-trophic-level predators are especially prone to extinction due to an energetic mismatch between increasing feeding rates and metabolism with warming. Different adaptation mechanisms such as decreasing body size to reduce energy requirements (morphological response) as well as direct effects of adaptation to feeding parameters (physiological response) have been proposed to overcome this problem. Here, we use protist-bacteria microcosm experiments to show how those adaptations may have the potential to buffer the impact of warming on predator-prey interactions. After adapting the ciliate predator Tetrahymena pyriformis to three different temperatures (15{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C) for approximately 20 generations we conducted functional response experiments on bacterial prey along an experimental temperature gradient (15{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C). We found an increase of maximum feeding rates and half-saturation densities with rising experimental temperatures. Adaptation temperature had on average slightly negative effects on maximum feeding rates, but maximum feeding rates increased more strongly with rising experimental temperature in warm adapted predators than in cold adapted predators. There was no effect of adaptation temperature on half-saturation densities characterising foraging efficiency. Besides the mixed response in functional response parameters, predators also adapted by decreasing body size. As smaller predators need less energy to fulfil their energetic demands, maximum feeding rates relative to the energetic demands increased slightly with increased adaptation temperature. Accordingly, predators adapted to 25{degrees}C showed the highest feeding rates at 25{degrees}C experimental temperature, while predators adapted to 15{degrees}C showed the highest maximum feeding rate at 15{degrees}C. Therefore, adaptation to different temperatures potentially avoids an energetic mismatch with warming. Especially a shift in body size with warming additionally to an adaptation of physiological parameters potentially helps to maintain a positive energy balance and prevent predator extinction with rising temperatures.",

These methods cannot model structural variants or variants that nest or overlap. A variation graph is a mathematical structure that can encode arbitrarily complex genetic variation. We present the first haplotype model that operates on a variation graph-embedded population reference cohort. We describe an algorithm to calculate the likelihood that a haplotype arose from this cohort through recombinations and demonstrate time complexity linear in haplotype length and sublinear in population size. We furthermore demonstrate a method of rapidly calculating likelihoods for related haplotypes. We describe mathematical extensions to allow modelling of mutations. This work is an essential step forward for clinical genomics and genetic epidemiology since it is the first haplotype model which can represent all sorts of variation in the population.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research have investigated the impact of clinical depression on memory, which has revealed biases and in some cases impairments. However, little is understood about the effects of sub-clinical symptoms of depression on memory performance in the general population. Here we report the effects of symptoms of depression on memory problems in a large population-derived cohort (N = 2544), 87% of whom reported at least one symptom of depression. Specifically, we investigate the impact of depressive symptoms on subjective memory complaints, objective memory performance on a standard neuropsychological task and, in a subsample (n = 288), objective memory in affective contexts. There was a dissociation between subjective and objective memory performance, with depressive symptoms showing a robust relationship with self-reports of memory complaints, even after adjusting for age, gender, general cognitive ability and symptoms of anxiety, but not with performance on the standardised measure of verbal memory. Contrary to our expectations, hippocampal volume (assessed in a subsample, n = 592) did not account for significant variance in subjective memory, objective memory or depressive symptoms. Nonetheless, depressive symptoms were related to poorer memory for pictures presented in negative contexts, even after adjusting for memory for pictures in neutral contexts. Thus the symptoms of depression, associated with subjective memory complaints, appear better assessed by memory performance in affective contexts, rather than standardised memory measures. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the impact of depressive symptoms on memory functioning in the general population.",

    "abstract": "Colonies of several ant species within the subfamily Dorylinae alternate stereotypical discrete phases of foraging and reproduction. Such phasic cycles are thought to be adaptive because they minimize the amount of foraging and the related costs, and at the same time enhance the colony-level ability to rely on patchily distributed food sources. In order to investigate these hypotheses, we use here a simple computational approach to study the population dynamics of two species of virtual ant colonies that differ quantitatively in their foraging investment. One species, which we refer to as \\\"phasic\\\", forages only half of the time, mirroring the phasic activity of some army ants; the other \\\"non-phasic\\\" species forages instead all the time. We show that, when foraging costs are relatively high, populations of phasic colonies grow on average faster than non-phasic populations, outcompeting them in mixed populations. Interestingly, such tendency becomes more consistent as food becomes more difficult to find but locally abundant. According to our results, reducing the foraging investment, for example by adopting a phasic lifestyle, can result in a reproductive advantage, but only in specific conditions. We thus suggest phasic colony cycles to have emerged together with the doryline specialization in feeding on the brood of other eusocial insects, a resource that is hard to obtain but highly abundant if available.",

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplemental GPS on the immune responses involved in sows milk-derived exosomal shuttle RNAs (esRNAs) using RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq. Of the 213 identified miRNA types, a total of 26 conserved miRNAs were differently expressed in response to GPS supplementation, including 10 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated miRNAs in GPS feeding group. In addition, exosomal transcriptome analysis identified 14,696 protein-coding genes in sows milk exosomes, and 283 genes with 204 and 79 candidates showing up and down-regulation were significantly responded to GPS supplementation. Integrated analysis of each differently expressed miRNA with significantly expressed genes further revealed the presence of 51 highly conserved miRNA-gene interactions that were annotated to be related to immunoregulatory functions. This work provided an important advance in the functional identification of dietary GPS supplementation and more fundamental information about how GPS promoted the immune response and healthy growth of the infant from mothers at molecular levels.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and empirical work posits the existence of a common magnitude system in the brain. Such a proposal implies that manipulating stimuli in one magnitude dimension (e.g. time) should interfere with the subjective estimation of another magnitude dimension (e.g. space). Here, we asked whether a generalized Bayesian magnitude estimation system would sample sensory evidence using a common, amodal prior. Two psychophysical experiments separately tested participants on their perception of duration, surface, and numerosity when non-target magnitude dimensions and the rate of sensory evidence accumulation were manipulated. First, we found that duration estimation was resilient to changes in surface or numerosity, whereas lengthening (shortening) duration yielded under- (over-) estimations of surface and numerosity. Second, the perception of numerosity and surface were affected by changes in the rate of sensory evidence accumulation, whereas duration was not. Our results suggest that a generalized magnitude system based on Bayesian computations would minimally necessitate multiple priors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe plant immune system is innate, encoded in the germline. Using it efficiently, plants are capable of recognizing a diverse range of rapidly evolving pathogens. A recently described phenomenon shows that plant immune receptors are able to recognize pathogen effectors through the acquisition of exogenous protein domains from other plant genes.\\n\\nResultsWe showed that plant immune receptors with integrated domains are distributed unevenly across their phylogeny in grasses. Using phylogenetic analysis, we uncovered a major integration clade, whose members underwent repeated independent integration events producing diverse fusions. This clade is ancestral in grasses with members often found on syntenic chromosomes. Analyses of these fusion events revealed that homologous receptors can be fused to diverse domains. Furthermore, we discovered a 43 amino acids long motif that was associated with this dominant integration clade and was located immediately upstream of the fusion site. Sequence analysis revealed that DNA transposition and/or ectopic recombination are the most likely mechanisms of NLR-ID formation.\\n\\nConclusionsThe identification of this subclass of plant immune receptors that is naturally adapted to new domain integration will inform biotechnological approaches for generating synthetic receptors with novel pathogen  baits.",
