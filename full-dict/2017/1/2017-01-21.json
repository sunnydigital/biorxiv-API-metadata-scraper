    "abstract": "NODDI-DTI is a simplification of the NODDI model that, when its underlying assumptions are met, allows extraction of biophysical parameters from standard single-shell DTI data, permitting biophysical analysis of DTI datasets.\\n\\nIn contrast to the NODDI signal model, the NODDI-DTI signal model contains no CSF compartment, restricting its application to voxels with very low CSF partial-volume contamination. This simplification allowed derivation of simple analytical relations between parameters representing axon density, v and dispersion,{tau} , and DTI invariants (MD and FA) through moment expansion of the NODDI-DTI signal model. These relations formally allow extraction of biophysical parameters from DTI data. It should be emphasised that the NODDI-DTI model inherits the strong assumptions of the NODDI model, and so is nominally restricted to analysis of healthy brains.\\n\\nNODDI-DTI parameter estimates were computed by applying the proposed analytical relations to DTI parameters extracted from the first shell of data, and compared to parameters extracted by fitting the NODDI-DTI model to (i) both shells (recommended) and (ii) the first shell (as for DTI) of data in the white matter of three different in vivo diffusion datasets. NODDI-DTI parameters estimated from DTI and NODDI-DTI parameters estimated by fitting the model to the first shell of data gave similar errors compared to two-shell NODDI-DTI estimates. The NODDI-DTI method gave unphysical parameter estimates in a small percentage of voxels, reflecting voxelwise DTI estimation error or NODDI-DTI model invalidity. In the course of evaluating the NODDI-DTI model it was found that diffusional kurtosis strongly biased DTI-based MD values, and so a novel heuristic correction requiring only DTI data was derived and used to account for this bias.\\n\\nOur results demonstrate that NODDI-DTI is a promising model and technique to interpret restricted datasets acquired for DTI analysis with greater biophysical specificity, though its limitations must be borne in mind.",

    "abstract": "A viral quasispecies, the ensemble of viral strains populating an infected person, can be highly diverse. For optimal assessment of virulence, pathogenesis and therapy selection, determining the haplotypes of the individual strains can play a key role. As many viruses are subject to high mutation and recombination rates, high-quality reference genomes are often not available at the time of a new disease outbreak. We present SAVAGE, a computational tool for reconstructing individual haplotypes of intrahost virus strains without the need for a high-quality reference genome. SAVAGE makes use of either FM-index based data structures or ad-hoc consensus reference sequence for constructing overlap graphs from patient sample data. In this overlap graph, nodes represent reads and/or contigs, while edges reflect that two reads/contigs, based on sound statistical considerations, represent identical haplotypic sequence. Following an iterative scheme, a new overlap assembly algorithm that is based on the enumeration of statistically well-calibrated groups of reads/contigs then efficiently reconstructs the individual haplotypes from this overlap graph. In benchmark experiments on simulated and on real deep coverage data, SAV-AGE drastically outperforms generic de novo assemblers as well as the only specialized de novo viral quasispecies assembler available so far. When run on ad-hoc consensus reference sequence, SAVAGE performs very favorably in comparison with state-of-the-art reference genome guided tools. We also apply SAVAGE on two deep coverage samples of patients infected by the Zika and the hepatitis C virus, respectively, which sheds light on the genetic structures of the respective viral quasispecies.",

    "abstract": "Variation in baseline ploidy is seen throughout the tree of life, yet the factors that determine why one ploidy level is selected over another remain poorly understood. Experimental evolution studies using asexual fungal microbes with manipulated ploidy levels intriguingly reveals a propensity to return to the historical baseline ploidy, a phenomenon that we term  ploidy drive. We evolved haploid, diploid, and polyploid strains of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans under three different nutrient limitation environments to test whether these conditions, hypothesized to select for low ploidy levels, could counteract ploidy drive. Strains generally maintained or acquired smaller genome sizes in minimal medium and under phosphorus depletion compared to in a complete medium, while mostly maintained or acquired increased genome sizes under nitrogen depletion. Surprisingly, improvements in fitness often ran counter to changes in total nuclear genome size; in a number of scenarios lines that maintained their original genome size often increased in fitness more than lines that converged towards diploidy. Combined, this work demonstrates a role for both the environment and genotype in determination of the rate of ploidy drive, and highlights questions that remain about the force(s) that cause genome size variation.",

    "abstract": "In the cerebral cortex, sensory information travels along feedforward connections through a hierarchy of areas, which, in turn, send a denser network of feedback connections to lower-order areas. Feedback has been implicated in attention, expectation, and sensory context, but the cellular mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Using specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections in the primate visual cortex, we have identified the cellular mechanisms of feedback-mediated modulations of early sensory processing. Specifically, we found that feedback modulates receptive field size, surround suppression and response gain, similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention. A recurrent network model captured these effects. These feedback-mediated modulations allow higher-order cortical areas to dynamically regulate spatial resolution, sensitivity to image features, and efficiency of coding natural images in lower-order cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "The Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) governs photoprotection in the majority of cyanobacteria. It is structurally and functionally modular, comprised of a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD), an N-terminal effector domain (NTD) and a ketocarotenoid; the chromophore spans the two domains in the ground state and translocates fully into the NTD upon illumination. Using both the canonical OCP1 and the presumably more primitive OCP2 from Fremyella diplosiphon, we show that an NTD-CTD heterodimer forms when the domains are expressed as separate polypeptides. The carotenoid is required for the heterodimeric association, assembling an orange complex which is stable in the dark. Both OCP1 and OCP2 heterodimers are photoactive, undergoing light-driven heterodimer dissociation, but differ in their ability to reassociate in darkness, setting the stage for bioengineering photoprotection in cyanobacteria as well as for developing new photoswitches for biotechnology. Additionally, we reveal that homodimeric CTD can bind carotenoid in the absence of NTD, and name this truncated variant the C-terminal domain-like Carotenoid Protein (CCP). This finding supports the hypothesis that the OCP evolved from an ancient fusion event between genes for two different carotenoid-binding proteins ancestral to the NTD and CTD. We suggest that the CCP and its homologs constitute a new family of carotenoproteins within the NTF2-like superfamily found across all kingdoms of life.",

    "abstract": "Human infections by Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, are associated with a current widespread outbreak in the Americas, and have been associated with neurological complications and adverse fetal outcomes such as microcephaly in pregnant women. A suitable non-human primate model is urgently needed. To evaluate ZIKV infectivity, pathogenesis, and persistence, we inoculated 4 marmosets with ZIKV and followed them by clinical monitoring and serial sampling of body fluids for up to 11 weeks. We found that marmosets experimentally infected with ZIKV reproduced key features of the human disease, including (1) asymptomatic infection, (2) brief period of detectable virus in serum (<1 week), (3) detection in other body fluids (urine, saliva, semen, and stool) for at least 2 weeks following acute infection, and (4) persistence in lymph nodes, but not other tissues, at 1 month post-infection. ZIKV-positive saliva and serum samples, but not urine, were found to be infectious in cell culture. By day 6 post-inoculation, most marmosets exhibited detectable neutralizing antibody responses concurrent with activation of NK cell and B cell subsets and an increase in circulating cytokines associated with type II interferon signaling, Transcriptome profiling revealed enrichment of immune responses to active viral infection, with up-regulation of both type I and II interferon signaling pathways, anduncovered potential host biomarkers. These results suggest that a New World monkey model of acute ZIKV infection mimics the human disease, and is likely to be useful for testing of drug and vaccine candidates.",

    "abstract": "The closure of the Isthmus of Panama has long been considered to be one of the best defined biogeographic calibration points for molecular divergence-time estimation. However, geological and biological evidence has recently cast doubt on the presumed timing of the initial isthmus closure around 3 Ma but has instead suggested the existence of temporary land bridges as early as the Middle or Late Miocene. The biological evidence supporting these earlier land bridges was based either on only few molecular markers or on concatenation of genome-wide sequence data, an approach that is known to result in potentially misleading branch lengths and divergence times, which could compromise the reliability of this evidence. To allow divergence-time estimation with genomic data using the more appropriate multi-species coalescent model, we here develop a new method combining the SNP-based Bayesian species-tree inference of the software SNAPP with a molecular clock model that can be calibrated with fossil or biogeographic constraints. We validate our approach with simulations and use our method to reanalyze genomic data of Neotropical army ants (Dorylinae) that previously supported divergence times of Central and South American populations before the isthmus closure around 3 Ma. Our reanalysis with the multi-species coalescent model shifts all of these divergence times to ages younger than 3 Ma, suggesting that the older estimates supporting the earlier existence of temporary land bridges were artifacts resulting at least partially from the use of concatenation. We then apply our method to a new RAD-sequencing data set of Neotropical sea catfishes (Ariidae) and calibrate their species tree with extensive information from the fossil record. We identify a series of divergences between groups of Caribbean and Pacific sea catfishes around 10 Ma, indicating that processes related to the emergence of the isthmus led to vicariant speciation already in the Late Miocene, millions of years before the final isthmus closure.",

    "abstract": "Selection is commonly described by assigning constant relative fitness values to genotypes. Yet population density is often regulated by crowding. Relative fitness may then depend on density, and selection can change density when it acts on a density-regulating trait. When strong density-dependent selection acts on a density-regulating trait, selection is no longer describable by density-independent relative fitnesses, even in demographically stable populations. These conditions are met in most previous models of density-dependent selection (e.g. \\\"K-selection\\\" in the logistic and Lotka-Volterra models), suggesting that density-independent relative fitnesses must be replaced with more ecologically explicit absolute fit-nesses unless selection is weak. Here we show that density-independent relative fitnesses can also accurately describe strong density-dependent selection under some conditions. We develop a novel model of density-regulated population growth with three ecologically intuitive traits: fecundity, mortality, and competitive ability. Our model, unlike the logistic or Lotka-Volterra, incorporates a density-dependent juvenile \\\"reproductive excess\\\", which largely decouples density-dependent selection from the regulation of density. We find that density-independent relative fitnesses accurately describe strong selection acting on any one trait, even fecundity, which is both density-regulating and subject to density-dependent selection. Pleiotropic interactions between these traits recovers the familiar K-selection behavior. In such cases, or when the population is maintained far from demographic equilibrium, our model offers a possible alternative to relative fitness.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbionts may play an important role in the evolution of the Insecta. Bacteria such as Wolbachia, Cardinium, and Rickettsia are known to manipulate host reproduction to facilitate their own. Indeed, there are many documented cases where Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria: Rickettsiaceae) induces one of four manipulative phenotypes (cytoplasmic incompatibility, male killing, feminization, and parthenogenesis). The scale of infection among species has been a major subject of investigation, but quantification has been difficult because various approaches have yielded different estimates. One under-appreciated aspect of this problem arises when multiple--yet independent--samples are taken within a taxon. When independent samples within a taxon are treated as levels of a hierarchy, the problem is greatly simplified because data are partially pooled according to taxon. Here, we present a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate infection frequency where multiple independent samples were collected across several taxonomic levels. We apply this model to estimate the rates of infection for Wolbachia in the Lepidoptera, and then extend the model to account for phylogenetic non-independence. In addition, we highlight the current knowledge regarding Wolbachia and its effects within Lepidoptera. Our model estimates that the rate of endosymbiont infection for the Lepidoptera is approximately 12%. Given our limited knowledge regarding the phenotypes induced by these endosymbionts and the low infection rate, we urge caution when extrapolating the results of positive assays.",

    "abstract": "Sensory neurons capture information from the environment and convert it into signals that can greatly impact the survival of an organism. These systems are thus under heavy selective pressure, including for the most efficient use of energy to support their sensitivity and efficiency1. In this regard, the vertebrate photoreceptor cells face a dual challenge. They not only need to preserve their membrane excitability via ion pumps by ATP hydrolysis2 but also maintain a highly membrane rich organelle, the outer segment, which is the primary site of phototransduction, creating a considerable biosynthetic demand. How photoreceptors manage carbon allocation to balance their catabolic and anabolic demands is poorly understood. One metabolic feature of the retina is its ability to convert the majority of its glucose into lactate3,4 even in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon, aerobic glycolysis, is found in cancer and proliferating cells, and is thought to promote biomass buildup to sustain proliferation5,6. The purpose of aerobic glycolysis in the retina, its relevance to photoreceptor physiology, and its regulation, are not understood. Here, we show that rod photoreceptors rely on glycolysis for their outer segment (OS) biogenesis. Genetic perturbations targeting allostery or key regulatory nodes in the glycolytic pathway impacted the OS size. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling was found to regulate glycolysis, with antagonism of this pathway resulting in anabolic deficits. These data demonstrate the cell autonomous role of the glycolytic pathway in OS maintenance and provide evidence that aerobic glycolysis is part of a metabolic program that supports the biosynthetic needs of a normal neuronal cell type.",

    "abstract": "The antagonistic coevolution of parasite infectivity and host resistance alters the biological functionality of species, with effects spanning to communities and ecosystems. Still, studies describing long-term host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics in nature are largely missing. Furthermore, the role of host resistance mechanisms for parasite evolution is poorly understood, necessitating for the molecular and phenotypic characterization of both coevolving parasites and their hosts. We combined long-term field sampling (2007-2014), in vitro cross-infections and time-shift experiments with bacteriophage whole genome sequencing and bacterial (Flavobacterium columnare) CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) profiling to show the molecular details of the phage-bacterium arms race in the environment. Bacteria were generally resistant to phages from the past and susceptible to phages in the future. The bacterial resistance selected for increased phage infectivity and host range, correlating directly with the expansion of phage genome size by 2656 bp. In the bacterial host, two CRISPR loci were identified: a type II-C locus and an RNA-targeting type VI-B locus. While maintaining a core set of conserved spacers, phage-matching spacers appeared in the variable end of both CRISPR loci over time. The appearance of these CRISPR spacers in the bacterial host often corresponded with arms race -manner molecular changes in the protospacers of the coevolving phage population. However, the phenotypic data indicated that the relative role of constitutive defence may be more important in high phage pressure, highlighting the importance of our findings for understanding microbial community ecology and in the development of phage therapy applications.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecium is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and a frequent cause of bloodstream infections in hospitalized patients. Here, we identify genes that contribute to growth of E. faecium in human serum. We first sequenced the genome of E. faecium E745, a vancomycin-resistant clinical isolate, to completion and then compared its transcriptome during exponential growth in rich medium and in human serum by RNA-seq. This analysis revealed that 27.8% of genes on the E. faecium E745 genome were differentially expressed in these two conditions. A gene cluster with a role in purine biosynthesis was among the most upregulated genes in E. faecium E745 upon growth in serum. A high-throughput transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) approach was used to identify conditionally essential genes in E. faecium E745 during growth in serum. Genes involved in de novo nucleotide biosysnthesis (including pyrK_2, pyrF, purD, purH) and a gene encoding a phosphotransferase system subunit (manY_2) were thus identified to be contributing to E. faecium growth in human serum. Transposon mutants in pyrK_2, pyrF, purD, purH and manY_2 were isolated from the library and their impaired growth in human serum was confirmed. In addition, the pyrK_2 and manY_2 mutants also exhibited significantly attenuated virulence in an intravenous zebrafish infection model. We conclude that genes involved in carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism of E. faecium are essential for growth in human serum and contribute to the pathogenesis of this organism.",
