    "abstract": "AbstractSeveral recent studies have demonstrated that the bottom-up signaling of a visual stimulus is subserved by interareal gamma-band synchronization, whereas top-down influences are mediated by alpha-beta band synchronization. These processes may implement top-down control of stimulus processing if top-down and bottom-up mediating rhythms are coupled via cross-frequency interaction. To test this possibility, we investigated Granger-causal influences among awake male macaque primary visual area V1, higher visual area V4 and parietal control area 7a during attentional task performance. Top-down 7a-to-V1 beta-band influences enhanced visually driven V1-to-V4 gamma-band influences. This enhancement was spatially specific and largest when beta-band activity preceded gamma-band activity by [~]0.1 s, suggesting a causal effect of top-down processes on bottom-up processes. We propose that this cross-frequency interaction mechanistically subserves the attentional control of stimulus selection.\\n\\nSignificance StatementContemporary research indicates that the alpha-beta frequency band underlies top-down control, while the gamma-band mediates bottom-up stimulus processing. This arrangement inspires an attractive hypothesis, which posits that top-down beta-band influences directly modulate bottom-up gamma band influences via cross-frequency interaction. We evaluate this hypothesis determining that beta-band top-down influences from parietal area 7a to visual area V1 are correlated with bottom-up gamma frequency oscillations from V1 to area V4, in a spatially specific manner, and that this correlation is maximal when top-down activity precedes bottom-up activity. These results show that for top-down processes such as spatial attention, elevated top-down beta-band influences directly enhance feedforward stimulus induced gamma-band processing, leading to enhancement of the selected stimulus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInhibition of programmed death-ligand one (PD-L1) with atezolizumab can induce durable clinical benefit (DCB) in patients with metastatic urothelial cancers, including complete remissions in patients with chemotherapy refractory disease. Although mutation load and PD-L1 immune cell (IC) staining have been associated with response, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for clinical use. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the peripheral blood immune environment and to conduct detailed analyses of mutation load, predicted neoantigens and immune cellular infiltration in tumors to enhance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of response and resistance.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsThe goals of this study were to (1) evaluate the association of mutation load and predicted neoantigen load with therapeutic benefit, and (2) determine whether intratumoral and peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR) clonality inform clinical outcomes in urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab. We hypothesized that an elevated mutation load in combination with T cell clonal dominance among intratumoral lymphocytes prior to treatment or among peripheral T cells after treatment would be associated with effective tumor control upon treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-seq) of pre-treatment tumor samples as well as TCR sequencing of matched, serially collected peripheral blood collected before and after treatment with atezolizumab. These parameters were assessed for correlation with DCB (defined as progression free survival (PFS) > 6 months), PFS, and overall survival (OS), both alone and in the context of clinical and intratumoral parameters known to be predictive of survival in this disease state.\\n\\nPatients with DCB displayed a higher proportion of tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) (n=24, Mann-Whitney p=0.047). Pre-treatment peripheral blood TCR clonality below the median was associated with improved PFS (n=29, log-rank p=0.048) and OS (n=29, log-rank p=0.011). Patients with DCB also demonstrated more substantial expansion of tumor-associated TCR clones in the peripheral blood 3 weeks after starting treatment (n=22, Mann-Whitney p=0.022). The combination of high pre-treatment peripheral blood TCR clonality with elevated PD-L1 IC staining in tumor tissue was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes (n=10, HR (mean)=89.88, HR (median)=23.41, 95% CI (2.43, 506.94), p(HR>1)=0.0014). Marked variations in mutation loads were seen with different somatic variant calling methodologies, which in turn impacted associations with clinical outcomes. Missense mutation load, predicted neoantigen load and expressed neoantigen load did not demonstrate significant association with DCB (n=25, Mann-Whitney p=0.22, n=25, Mann-Whitney p=0.55, and n=25, Mann-Whitney p=0.29 respectively). Instead, we found evidence of time-varying effects of somatic mutation load on progression-free survival in this cohort (n=25, p=0.044). A limitation of our study is its small sample size (n=29), a subset of the patients treated on IMvigor 210 (NCT02108652). Given the number of exploratory analyses performed, we intend for these results to be hypothesis-generating.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate the complex nature of immune response to checkpoint blockade and the compelling need for greater interrogation and data integration of both host and tumor factors. Incorporating these variables in prospective studies will facilitate identification and treatment of resistant patients.",

    "abstract": "Structural covariance examines covariation of grey matter morphology between brain regions and across individuals. Despite significant interest in the influence of age on structural covariance patterns, no study to date has provided a complete lifespan perspective--bridging childhood with early, middle, and late adulthood--on the development of structural covariance networks. Here, we investigate the lifespan trajectories of structural covariance in six canonical neurocognitive networks: default, dorsal attention, frontoparietal control, somatomotor, ventral attention, and visual. By combining data from five open access data sources, we examine the structural covariance trajectories of these networks from 6-94 years of age in a sample of 1580 participants. Using partial least squares, we show that structural covariance patterns across the lifespan exhibit two significant, age-dependent trends. The first trend is a stable pattern whose integrity declines over the lifespan. The second trend is an inverted-U that differentiates young adulthood from other age groups. Hub regions, including posterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, appear particularly influential in the expression of this second age-dependent trend. Overall, our results suggest that structural covariance provides a reliable definition of neurocognitive networks across the lifespan and reveal both shared and network-specific trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Research has not yet reached a consensus on why humans match probabilities instead of maximise in a probability learning task. The most influential explanation is that they search for patterns in the random sequence of outcomes. Other explanations, such as expectation matching, are plausible, but do not consider how reinforcement learning shapes peoples choices.\\n\\nWe aimed to quantify how human performance in a probability learning task is affected by pattern search and reinforcement learning. We collected behavioural data from 84 young adult participants who performed a probability learning task wherein the majority outcome was rewarded with 0.7 probability, and analysed the data using a reinforcement learning model that searches for patterns. Model simulations indicated that pattern search, exploration, recency (discounting early experiences), and forgetting may impair performance.\\n\\nOur analysis estimated that 85% (95% HDI [76, 94]) of participants searched for patterns and believed that each trial outcome depended on one or two previous ones. The estimated impact of pattern search on performance was, however, only 6%, while those of exploration and recency were 19% and 13% respectively. This suggests that probability matching is caused by uncertainty about how outcomes are generated, which leads to pattern search, exploration, and recency.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical reactions within individual cells result from the interactions of molecules, often in small numbers. Consequently, the inherent stochasticity of binding and diffusion processes generate noise along the cascade that leads to the synthesis of a protein from its encoding gene. As a result, isogenic cell populations display phenotypic variability even in homogeneous environments. The extent and consequences of this stochastic gene expression have only recently been assessed on a genome-wide scale, in particular owing to the advent of single cell transcriptomics. However, the evolutionary forces shaping this stochasticity have yet to be unraveled. We took advantage of two recently published data sets of the single-cell transcriptome of the domestic mouse Mus musculus in order to characterize the effect of natural selection on gene-specific transcriptional stochasticity. We showed that noise levels in the mRNA distributions (a.k.a. transcriptional noise) significantly correlate with three-dimensional nuclear domain organization, evolutionary constraint on the encoded protein and gene age. The position of the encoded protein in biological pathways, however, is the main factor that explains observed levels of transcriptional noise, in agreement with models of noise propagation within gene networks. Because transcriptional noise is under widespread selection, we argue that it constitutes an important component of the phenotype and that variance of expression is a potential target of adaptation. Stochastic gene expression should therefore be considered together with mean expression level in functional and evolutionary studies of gene expression.",

Such replicates allow to capture underlying biological variability and control for experimental ones. However, during data production researchers often lack clear definitions to what constitutes a \\\"bad\\\" replicate which should be discarded and if data from failed replicates is published downstream analysis by groups using this data can be hampered. Here we develop a probability model to weigh a given RNA-Seq experiment as a representative of an experimental condition when performing alternative splicing analysis. Using both synthetic and real life data we demonstrate that this model detects outlier samples which are consistently and significantly different compared to samples from the same condition. Using both synthetic and real life data we perform extensive evaluation of the algorithm in different scenarios involving perturbed samples, mislabeled samples, no-signal groups, and different levels of coverage, and show it compares favorably with current state of the art tools.\\n\\nAvailabilityProgram and code will be available at majiq.biociphers.org",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic options for the treatment of an increasing variety of cancers have been expanded by the introduction of a new class of drugs, commonly referred to as checkpoint blocking agents, that target the host immune system to positively modulate anti-tumor immune response. Although efficacy of these agents has been linked to a pre-existing level of tumor immune infiltrate, it remains unclear why some patients exhibit deep and durable responses to these agents therapy while others do not benefit. To examine the influence of tumor genetics on tumor immune state, we interrogated the relationship between somatic mutation and copy number alteration with infiltration levels of 7 immune cell types across 40 tumor cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Levels of cytotoxic T, regulatory T, total T, natural killer, and B cells, as well as monocytes and M2 macrophages, were estimated using a novel set of transcriptional signatures that were designed to resist interference from the cellular heterogeneity of tumors. Tumor mutational load and estimates of tumor purity were included in our association models to adjust for biases in multi-modal genomic data. Copy number alterations, mutations summarized at the gene level, and position-specific mutations were evaluated for association with tumor immune infiltration. We observed a strong relationship between copy number loss of a large region of chromosome 9p and decreased lymphocyte estimates in melanoma, pancreatic, and head/neck cancers. Mutations in the oncogenes PIK3CA, FGFR3, and RAS/RAF family members, as well as the tumor supressor TP53, were linked to changes in immune infiltration, usually in restricted tumor types. Associations of specific WNT/beta-catenin pathway genetic changes with immune state were limited, but we noted a link between 9p loss and the expression of the WNT receptor FZD3, suggesting that there are interactions between 9p alteration and WNT pathways. Finally, two different cell death regulators, CASP8 and DIDO1, were often mutated in head/neck tumors that had higher lymphocyte infiltrates. In summary, our study supports the relevance of tumor genetics to questions of efficacy and resistance in checkpoint blockade therapies. It also highlights the need to assess genome-wide influences during exploration of any specific tumor pathway hypothesized to be relevant to therapeutic response. Some of the observed genetic links to immune state, like 9p loss, may influence response to cancer immune therapies. Others, like mutations in cell death pathways, may help guide combination therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Category learning is a critical neurobiological function that allows organisms to simplify a complex world. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) is often active in neurobiological studies of category learning; however, the specific role this region serves in category learning remains uncertain. Previous category learning studies have hypothesized that the rlPFC is involved in switching between rules, whereas others have emphasized rule abstraction and evaluation. We aimed to clarify the role of rlPFC in category learning and dissociate switching and evaluation accounts using two common types of category learning tasks: matching and classification. The matching task involved matching a reference stimulus to one of four target stimuli. In the classification task, participants were shown a single stimulus and learned to classify it into one of two categories. Matching and classification are similar but place different demands on switching and evaluation. In matching, a rule can be known with certainty after a single correct answer. In classification, participants may need to evaluate evidence for a rule even after an initial correct response. This critical difference allows isolation of evaluative functions from switching functions. If the rlPFC is primarily involved in switching between representations, it should cease to be active once participants settle on a given rule in both tasks. If the rlPFC is involved in rule evaluation, its activation should persist in the classification task, but not matching. The results revealed that rlPFC activation persisted into correct trials in classification, but not matching, suggesting that it continues to be involved in the evaluations of evidence for a rule even after participants have arrived at the correct rule.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDifferences between rule-based matching and classification tasks were highlighted.\\nC_LIO_LIRostrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in evaluation of evidence for a rule in rule-based category learning tasks.\\nC_LI",

Models of these syndromic disorders have been used to better characterize the molecular and physiological processes disrupted by these mutations4. Two fundamental questions remain - how biologically similar are the mouse models of syndromic forms of ASD, and how relevant are these mouse models to their human analogs? To address these questions, we performed integrative transcriptomic analyses of seven independent mouse models of three syndromic forms of ASD generated across five laboratories, and assessed dysregulated genes and their pathways in human postmortem brain from patients with ASD and unaffected controls. These cross-species analyses converged on shared disruptions in myelination and axon development across both syndromic and idiopathic ASD, highlighting both the face validity of mouse models for these disorders and identifying novel convergent molecular phenotypes amendable to rescue with therapeutics.",

First, we optimise efficient guide-RNA expression from novel chick U6-mini-vectors, provide a strategy for rapid somatic gene knockout and establish protocol for evaluation of mutational penetrance by targeted next generation sequencing. We show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of transcription factors causes a reduction in their cognate enhancer-driven reporter activity. Next, we assess endogenous enhancer function using both enhancer deletion and nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) effector fusions to modulate enhancer chromatin landscape, thus providing the first report of epigenome engineering in a developing embryo. Finally, we use the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system to activate an endogenous target promoter.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide molecular gene expression studies generally compare expression values for each gene across multiple conditions followed by cluster and gene set enrichment analysis to determine whether differentially expressed genes are enriched in specific biochemical pathways, cellular components, biological processes, and/or molecular functions, etc. This approach to analyzing differences in gene expression enables discovery of gene function, but is not useful to determine whether pre-defined groups of genes share or diverge in their expression patterns in response to treatments nor to assess the correctness of pre-defined gene set groupings. Here we present a simple method that changes the dimension of comparison by treating genes as variable traits to directly assess significance of differences in expression levels among pre-defined gene groups. Because expression distributions are typically skewed (thus unfit for direct assessment using Gaussian statistical methods) our method involves transforming expression data to approximate a normal distribution followed by dividing the genes into groups, then applying Gaussian parametric methods to assess significance of observed differences. This method enables the assessment of differences in gene expression distributions within and across samples, enabling hypothesis-based comparison among groups of genes. We demonstrate this method by assessing the significance of specific gene groups differential response to heat stress conditions in maize.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Macroscopic cortical networks are important for cognitive function, but it remains challenging to construct anatomically plausible individual structural connectomes from human neuroimaging. We introduce a new technique for cortical network mapping, based on inter-regional similarity of multiple morphometric parameters measured using multimodal MRI. In three cohorts (two human, one macaque), we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) have a complex topological organisation comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions, and greater inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger inter-regional co-expression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing macaque MSNs to tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was related to axonal connectivity. Finally, variation in the degree of human MSN nodes accounted for about 40% of between-subject variability in IQ. Morphometric similarity mapping provides a novel, robust and biologically plausible approach to understanding how human cortical networks underpin individual differences in psychological functions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) has been a model species for ecological and evolutionary research. Genomic and transcriptomic resources for this species would promote investigation of genetic mechanisms that underpin plastic responses to environmental stress, such as climate warming. Moreover, such resources would aid comparative studies of complex traits at the molecular level, such as the transition from oviparous to viviparous reproduction, which happened at least four times within Sceloporus.\\n\\nFindingsA de novo transcriptome assembly for Sceloporus undulatus, Sund_v1.0, was generated using over 179 million Illumina reads obtained from three tissues (whole brain, skeletal muscle, and embryo) as well as previously reported liver sequences. The Sund_v1.0 assembly had an average contig length of 782 nucleotides and an E90N50 statistic of 2,550 nucleotides. Comparing S. undulatus transcripts with the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) for tetrapod species yielded 97.2% gene representation. A total of 13,422 protein-coding orthologs were identified in comparison to the genome of the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, which is the closest related species with genomic data available.\\n\\nConclusionsThe multi-tissue transcriptome of S. undulatus is the first for a member of the family Phrynosomatidae, offering an important resource to advance studies of adaptation in this species and genomic research in reptiles.",

    "abstract": "Recent fossil finds have highlighted extensive morphological diversity within our genus, Homo, and the co-existence of a number of species. However, little is known about the evolutionary processes responsible for producing this diversity. Understanding the action of these processes can provide insight into how and why our lineage evolved and diversified. Here, we examine cranial and mandibular variation and diversification from the earliest emergence of our genus at 2.8 Ma until the Late Pleistocene (0.126-0.0117 Ma), using statistical tests developed from quantitative genetics theory to evaluate whether stochastic (genetic drift) versus non-stochastic (selection) processes were responsible for the observed variation. Results show that random processes can account for species diversification for most traits, including neurocranial diversification, and across all time periods. Where selection was found to shape diversification, we show that: 1) adaptation was important in the earliest migration of Homo out of Africa; 2) selection played a role in shaping mandibular and maxillary diversity among Homo groups, possibly due to dietary differences; and 3) Homo rudolfensis is adaptively different from other early Homo taxa, including the earliest known Homo specimen. These results show that genetic drift, and likely small population sizes, were important factors shaping the evolution of Homo and many of its novel traits, but that selection played an essential role in driving adaptation to new contexts.",

Consequently, we conducted the largest ever longitudinal study of the hormonal correlates of womens preferences for facial masculinity (N=584). Analyses showed no compelling evidence that preferences for facial masculinity were related to changes in womens salivary steroid hormone levels. Furthermore, both within-subject and between-subject comparisons showed no evidence that oral contraceptive use decreased masculinity preferences. However, women generally preferred masculinized over feminized versions of mens faces, particularly when assessing mens attractiveness for short-term, rather than long-term, relationships. Our results do not support the hypothesized link between womens preferences for facial masculinity and their hormonal status.",

    "abstract": "The cohesin complex mediates DNA-DNA interactions both between (sister chromatid cohesion) and within chromosomes (DNA looping) via a process thought to involve entrapment of DNAs within its tripartite ring. It has been suggested that intra- chromosome loops are generated through processive extrusion of DNAs through the lumen of cohesins ring. Scc2 (Nipbl) is essential for loading cohesin onto chromosomes but not for maintaining sister chromatid cohesion following DNA replication. It has therefore been assumed that Scc2 is involved exclusively in the cohesin loading process. However, it is possible that the stimulation of cohesins ABC-like ATPase by Scc2 also has a post-loading function, for example driving loop extrusion. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule tracking, we show that Scc2 binds dynamically to chromatin, principally through an association with cohesin. Scc2s movement within chromatin is consistent with a \\\"stop-and-go\\\" or \\\"hopping\\\" motion. We suggest that a low diffusion coefficient, a low stoichiometry relative to cohesin, and a high affinity for chromosomal cohesin enables Scc2 to move rapidly from one chromosomal cohesin complex to another, performing a function distinct from loading.",

    "abstract": "Canonical Notch signaling requires the presence of a membrane bound ligand and a corresponding transmembrane Notch receptor. Receptor engagement induces multiple proteolytic cleavage events culminating in the nuclear accumulation of the Notch intracellular domain and its binding to a transcriptional co-factor to mediate gene expression. Notch signaling networks are essential regulators of vascular patterning and angiogenesis, as well as myriad other biological processes. Delta-like 4 (Dll4) encodes the earliest Notch ligand detected in arterial cells, and is enriched in sprouting endothelial tip cells. Dll4 expression has often been inferred by proxy using a lacZ knockin reporter allele. This is problematic, as a single copy of Dll4 is haploinsufficient. Additionally, Notch activity regulates Dll4 transcription, making it unclear whether these reporter lines accurately reflect Dll4 expression. Accordingly, accurately defining Dll4 expression is essential for determining its role in development and disease. To address these limitations, we generated a novel BAC transgenic allele with a nuclear-localized {beta}-galactosidase reporter (Dll4-BAC-nlacZ). Through a comparative analysis, we show the BAC line overcomes previous issues of haploinsufficiency, it recapitulates Dll4 expression in vivo, and allows superior visualization and imaging. As such, this novel Dll4 reporter is an important addition to the growing Notch toolkit.\\n\\nSummary Statement:\\n\\nWe have developed a novel reporter line, free from complicating factors associated with previous alleles, for monitoring Dll4 expression, at a cellular resolution, in the developing and adult mouse.",

    "abstract": "Most bilaterian animals excrete toxic metabolites through specialized organs, such as nephridia and kidneys, which share morphological and functional correspondences. In contrast, the excretory mechanisms in non-nephrozoans are largely unknown, and therefore the reconstruction of ancestral excretory mechanisms is problematic. Here, we investigated the excretory mode of members of the Xenacoelomorpha, the sister group to Nephrozoa, and Cnidaria, the sister group to Bilateria. By combining gene expression, inhibitor experiments and exposure to varying environmental ammonia conditions we show that both, Xenacoelomorpha and Cnidaria, are able to excrete across digestive-associated tissues. Based on these results we propose that digestive-associated tissues functioned as excretory sites before the evolution of specialized organs in nephrozoans. We conclude that diffusion was likely the ancestral mode of excretion, whilst the emergence of a compact, multiple-layered bilaterian body plan necessitated the evolution of active transport excretory mechanisms that was later recruited into the specialized excretory organs.",

Computational methods have been developed for eQTL mapping using gene expression data from microarray or RNA-seq technology. Application of these methods for eQTL mapping in tumor tissues is problematic because tumor tissues are composed of both tumor and infiltrating normal cells (e.g. immune cells) and eQTL effects may vary between tumor and infiltrating normal cells. To address this challenge, we have developed a new method for eQTL mapping using RNA-seq data from tumor samples. Our method separately estimates the eQTL effects in tumor and infiltrating normal cells using both total expression and allele-specific expression (ASE). We demonstrate that our method controls type I error rate and has higher power than some alternative approaches. We applied our method to study RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and illustrated the similarities and differences of eQTL effects in tumor and normal cells.",

Although nDNA- and mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS proteins physically interact, their transcriptional regulation profoundly diverges, thus questioning their co-regulation. To address mtDNA-nDNA gene co-expression, we analyzed [~]8,500 RNA-seq Gene-Tissue-Expression (GTEx) experiments encompassing 48 human tissues. We found overall positive cross-tissue mtDNA-nDNA OXPHOS gene co-expression. Nevertheless, alternatively-spliced variants, as well as certain OXPHOS genes, did not converge into the main OXPHOS gene cluster, suggesting tissue-specific flavor of OXPHOS gene expression. Finally, unlike non-brain body sites, and neocortex and cerebellum ( mammalian brain), negative mito-nuclear expression correlation was found in the hypothalamus, basal ganglia and amygdala ( ancient brain). Analyses of co-expression, DNase-seq and ChIP-seq experiments identified candidate RNA-binding genes and CEBPb as best explaining this phenomenon. We suggest that evolutionary convergence of the  mammalian brain into positive mtDNA-nDNA OXPHOS co-expression reflects adjustment to novel bioenergetics needs.",

These interactions are typically mediated through environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves and also other microbes. A very common environmental modification is a change of the environmental pH. Here we show that changing and reacting to the pH leads to a feedback loop that can determine the fate of bacterial populations. We find experimentally that these pH changes can decide the fate of bacterial populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Moreover, modifying the pH can determine the interactions between different species. Understanding how single species change the pH and react to it allowed us to estimate their pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs--bistability, succession, murder suicide, and mutualism--that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus reoccur in different microbial systems.",

E. faecalis can subvert or evade immune-mediated clearance, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we examined E. faecalis-mediated subversion of macrophage activation. We observed that E. faecalis actively prevents NF-{kappa}B signaling in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages in the presence of Toll-like receptor agonists and during polymicrobial infection with Escherichia coli. E. faecalis and E. coli co-infection in a mouse model of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) resulted in a suppressed macrophage transcriptional response in the bladder compared to E. coli infection alone. Finally, we demonstrated that co-inoculation of E. faecalis with E. coli into catheterized bladders significantly augmented E. coli CAUTI. Taken together, these results support that E. faecalis suppression of NF-{kappa}B-driven responses in macrophages promotes polymicrobial CAUTI pathogenesis.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySynergistic polymicrobial infections can contribute to both disease severity and persistence. Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli are frequently co-isolated from polymicrobial urinary tract infections. Immunomodulation by co-infecting microbes can result in a more permissive environment for pathogens to establish infection. Presently, we do not yet understand how these microbes overcome host immunity to establish polymicrobial infections. To address this, we investigated how the immunosuppressive function of E. faecalis can contribute to acute infection. We defined that E. faecalis is able to suppress macrophages in vitro, despite the presence of E. coli. We also demonstrated E. faecalis ability to augment E. coli titers in vivo to establish kidney infection. Our findings raise the prospect that E. faecalis can alter host immunity to increase susceptibility to other uropathogens.",

    "abstract": "Development and fitness of any organism rely on properly controlled gene expression. This is especially true for plants, as their development is determined by both internal and external cues. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are embedded in the genetic cascades that integrate and translate those cues into developmental programs. miRNAs negatively regulate their target genes mainly post-transcriptionally through two co-existing mechanisms; mRNA cleavage and translational inhibition. It is unclear whether the efficiency of miRNA-guided regulation is generally influenced by factors like ambient temperature or developmental stage. Here we show that plant miRNA accumulation, as well as miRNAs mode of action can be temperature- and development-sensitive. Higher temperatures tend to induce a more pronounced accumulation of mature miRNAs. Both parameters have also an impact on the expression patterns of the core players involved in miRNA performance. We show that efficiency of miRNA-mediated gene silencing declines with age during vegetative development in a temperature-dependent manner. Co-existence of cleavage and translational inhibition was also found to be dependent on temperature and developmental stage. Therefore, each miRNA family specifically regulates their respective targets, while temperature and growth influence the performance of miRNA-dependent regulation in a more general way.",

These isoform switches have been observed for thousands of Zea mays and Vitis vinifera genes and have been linked to development and stress response. In Arabidopsis thaliana however, isoform switches have only been reported for 812 genes and the characteristics of these genes, nor the implications of the isoform switches on their protein functions, are currently well understood. Here we present a dataset of isoform dominance and switching for all genes in the AtRTD2 annotation based on a protocol that was benchmarked on simulated data and validated through comparison with a published RT-PCR panel. We report 138,722 isoform switches for 8,162 genes across 206 public RNA-Seq samples and find that these switches change the protein sequences in 23% of the cases. The observed isoform switches show high consistency across replicates and reveal reproducible patterns in response to treatment and development. We also demonstrate that genes with different ages, expression breadths, and functions show large differences in the frequency at which they switch isoforms and in the effect that these isoform switches have on their protein sequences. Finally, we showcase how the detected isoform switches can be applied to gain further insight in the regulation of a genes expression and function.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIsoform switching through alternative splicing has been reported for thousands of genes in plants, yet genome-wide datasets to study the implications for gene functions are thus far not available. Here we present the first reference dataset of isoform dominance and switching for Arabidopsis thaliana based on 206 public RNA-Seq samples and provide novel insights in the regulation and functional consequences of alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a synthetic circuit in E. coli demonstrated that two proteins engineered with LAA tags targeted to the native protease ClpXP are susceptible to crosstalk due to competition for degradation between proteins. To understand proteolytic crosstalk beyond the single protease regime, we investigated in E. coli a set of synthetic circuits designed to probe the dynamics of existing and novel degradation tags fused to fluorescent proteins. These circuits were tested using both microplate reader and single-cell assays. We first quantified the degradation rates of each tag in isolation. We then tested if there was crosstalk between two distinguishable fluorescent proteins engineered with identical or different degradation tags. We demonstrated that proteolytic crosstalk was indeed not limited to the LAA degradation tag, but was also apparent between other diverse tags, supporting the complexity of the E. coli protein degradation system.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome have neurological and muscle impairments due to an additional copy of the human 21st chromosome (HSA21). Only a few of ~200 HSA21 genes encoding protein have been linked to specific Down syndrome phenotypes, while the remainder are understudied. To identify poorly characterized HSA21 genes required for nervous system function, we studied behavioral phenotypes caused by loss-of-function mutations in conserved HSA21 orthologs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We identified ten HSA21 orthologs that are required for neuromuscular behaviors: cle-1 (COL18A1), cysl-2 (CBS), dnsn-1 (DONSON), eva-1 (EVA1C), mtq-2 (N6ATM1), ncam-1 (NCAM2), pad-2 (POFUT2), pdxk-1 (PDXK), rnt-1 (RUNX1), and unc-26 (SYNJ1). We also found that three of these genes are required for normal release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This includes a known synaptic gene unc-26 (SYNJ1), as well as uncharacterized genes pdxk-1 (PDXK) and mtq-2 (N6ATM1). As the first systematic functional analysis of HSA21 orthologs, this study may serve as a platform to understand genes that underlie phenotypes associated with Down syndrome.\\n\\nARTICLE SUMMARYDown syndrome causes neurological and muscle dysfunction due to an extra 21st chromosome. This chromosome has over 200 genes, most of which are understudied. To address this, we studied whether reducing function of these gene equivalents in the worm C. elegans caused neuronal or muscle defects. We identified ten genes conserved between human and worm that mediate function of behaviors. Among these, we show the uncharacterized genes mtq-2 and pdxk-1 are important for synaptic transmission and are exclusively expressed in nervous system. Our analysis may reveal functions of poorly studied genes that affect nervous system function in Down syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Kobresia pastures in the eastern Tibetan highlands occupy 450000 km2 and form the worlds largest pastoral alpine ecosystem. The main constituent is an endemic dwarf sedge, Kobresia pygmaea, which forms a lawn with a durable turf cover anchored by a felty root mat, and occurs from 3000 m to nearly 6000 m a.s.l. The existence and functioning of this unique ecosystem and its turf cover have not yet been explained against a backdrop of natural and anthropogenic factors, and thus its origin, drivers, vulnerability or resilience remain largely unknown. Here we present a review on ecosystem diversity, reproduction and ecology of the key species, pasture health, cycles of carbon (C), water and nutrients, and on the paleo-environment. The methods employed include molecular analysis, grazing exclusion, measurements with micro-lysimeters and gas exchange chambers, 13C and 15N labelling, eddy-covariance flux measurements, remote sensing and atmospheric modelling.\\n\\nThe following combination of traits makes Kobresia pygmaea resilient and highly competitive: dwarf habit, predominantly below-ground allocation of photo assimilates, mixed reproduction strategy with both seed production and clonal growth, and high genetic diversity. Growth of Kobresia pastures is co-limited by low rainfall during the short growing season and livestock-mediated nutrient withdrawal. Overstocking has caused pasture degradation and soil deterioration, yet the extent remains debated. In addition, we newly describe natural autocyclic processes of turf erosion initiated through polygonal cracking of the turf cover, and accelerated by soil-dwelling endemic small mammals. The major consequences of the deterioration of the vegetation cover and its turf include: (1) the release of large amounts of C and nutrients and (2) earlier diurnal formation of clouds resulting in (3) decreased surface temperatures with (4) likely consequences for atmospheric circulation on large regional and, possibly global, scales.\\n\\nPaleo-environmental reconstruction, in conjunction with grazing experiments, suggests that the present grazing lawns of Kobresia pygmaea are synanthropic and may have existed since the onset of pastoralism. The traditional migratory rangeland management was sustainable over millennia and possibly still offers the best strategy to conserve, and possibly increase, the C stocks in the Kobresia turf, as well as its importance for climate regulation.",

It has previously been shown that both selection acting to increase codon translational efficiency and selection acting to decrease codon biosynthetic cost contribute to differences in codon bias. However, it is unknown how these two factors interact or how they affect molecular sequence evolution.\\n\\nResultsThrough analysis of 1,320 bacterial genomes we show that bacterial genes are subject to multi-objective selection-driven optimisation of codon use. Here, selection acts to simultaneously decrease transcript biosynthetic cost and increase transcript translational efficiency, with highly expressed genes under the greatest selection. This optimisation is not simply a consequence of the more translationally efficient codons being less expensive to synthesise. Instead, we show that tRNA gene copy number alters the cost-efficiency trade-off of synonymous codons such that for many species such that selection acting on transcript biosynthetic cost and translational efficiency act in opposition. Finally, we show that genes highly optimised to reduce cost and increase efficiency show reduced rates of synonymous and non-synonymous mutation.\\n\\nConclusionsThis analysis provides a simple mechanistic explanation for variation in evolutionary rate between genes that depends on selection-driven cost-efficiency optimisation of the transcript. These findings reveal how optimisation of resource allocation to mRNA synthesis is a critical factor that determines both the evolution and composition of genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral non-chlamydial microbial pathogens are associated with clinical signs of active trachoma in trachoma-endemic communities with a low prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection. In the Solomon Islands, the prevalence of Ct among children is low despite the prevalence of active trachoma being moderate. We therefore set out to investigate whether active trachoma was associated with a common non-chlamydial infection or with a dominant polymicrobial community dysbiosis in the Solomon Islands.\\n\\nMethodsWe studied DNA from conjunctival swabs collected from 257 Solomon Islanders with active trachoma and matched controls. Droplet digital PCR was used to test for pathogens suspected to be able to induce follicular conjunctivitis. Polymicrobial community diversity and composition were studied by sequencing of hypervariable regions of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene in a subset of 54 cases and 53 controls.\\n\\nResultsAlthough Ct was associated with active trachoma, the number of infections was low (cases: 3.9%, controls: 0.4%). Estimated prevalence (cases, controls) of each non-chlamydial infection was as follows: S. aureus (1.9%, 1.9%), Adenoviridae (1.2%, 1.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (5.8%, 4.3%), H. influenzae (7.4%, 11.7%), M. catarrhalis (2.3%, 4.7%) and S. pneumoniae (7.0%, 6.2%). There was no statistically significant association between clinical signs of trachoma and presence or load of any of the non-Ct infections that were assayed. Inter-individual variations in the conjunctival microbiome were characterised by differences in the levels of Corynebacterium, Proprionibacterium, Helicobacter and Paracoccus, but diversity and relative abundance of these specific genera did not differ significantly between cases and controls.\\n\\nDiscussionIt is unlikely that the prevalent trachoma-like follicular conjunctivitis in the Solomon Islands has a dominant bacterial aetiology. Before implementing community-wide azithromycin distribution for trachoma, policy makers should consider that clinical signs of trachoma can be observed in the absence of any detectable azithromycin-susceptible organism.",

We included 219 MGEs described in 7 Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from human, animal and environmental samples. Despite a high overall diversity, 2 lineages were observed in the E. coli population that may function as reservoirs of the mcr-1 gene, the largest of which was linked to ST10, a sequence type known for its ubiquity in human faecal samples and in food samples. No genotypic clustering by geographical origin or isolation source was observed. Amongst a total of 13 plasmid incompatibility types, the Incl2, lncX4 and IncHI2 plasmids accounted for more than 90% of MGEs carrying the mcr-1 gene. We observed significant geographical clustering with regional spread of lncHI2 plasmids in Europe and Incl2 in Asia.

    "abstract": "Brief epochs of beta oscillations have been implicated in sensorimotor control in the basal ganglia of task-performing healthy animals. However, which neural processes underlie their generation and how they are affected by sensorimotor processing remains unclear. To determine the mechanisms underlying transient beta oscillations in the local field potential (LFP), we combined computational modeling of the subthalamo-pallidal network for the generation of beta oscillations with realistic stimulation patterns derived from single unit data. The single unit data were recorded from different basal ganglia subregions in rats performing a cued choice task. In the recordings we found distinct firing patterns in the striatum, globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus related to sensory and motor events during the behavioral task. Using these firing patterns to generate realistic inputs to our network model lead to transient beta oscillations with the same time course as the rat LFP data. In addition, our model can account for further non-intuitive aspects of beta modulation, including beta phase resets following sensory cues and correlations with reaction time. Overall, our model can explain how the combination of temporally regulated sensory responses of the subthalamic nucleus, ramping activity of the subthalamic nucleus, and movement-related activity of the globus pallidus, leads to transient beta oscillations during behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTransient beta oscillations emerge in the normal functioning cortico-basal ganglia loop during behavior. In this work we employ a unique approach connecting a computational model closely with experimental data. In this way we achieve a simulation environment for our model that mimics natural input patterns in awake behaving animals. Using this approach we demonstrate that a computational model for beta oscillations in Parkinsons disease can also account for complex patterns of transient beta oscillations in healthy animals. Therefore, we propose that transient beta oscillations in healthy animals share the same mechanism with pathological beta oscillations in Parkinsons disease. This important result connects functional and pathological roles of beta oscillations in the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "The rubber hand illusion (RHI) allows insights into how the brain resolves conflicting multisensory information regarding body position and ownership. Previous neuroimaging studies have reported a variety of neurophysiological correlates of illusory hand ownership, with conflicting results likely originating from differences in experimental parameters and control conditions. Here, we overcome these limitations by using a fully automated and precisely-timed visuo-tactile stimulation setup to record evoked responses and oscillatory responses in the human EEG. Importantly, we relied on a combination of experimental conditions to rule out confounds of attention, body-stimulus position and stimulus duration, and on the combination of two control conditions to identify neurophysiological correlates of illusory hand ownership. In two separate experiments we observed a consistent illusion-related attenuation of ERPs around 330 ms over frontocentral electrodes, as well as decreases of frontal alpha and beta power during the illusion that could not be attributed to changes in attention, body-stimulus position or stimulus duration. Our results reveal neural correlates of illusory hand ownership in late and likely higher-order rather than early sensory processes, and support a role of premotor and possibly intraparietal areas in mediating illusory body ownership.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative inward currents help produce slow oscillations through a negative-slope conductance region of their current-voltage relationship that is well approximated by a linear negative conductance. We used dynamic clamp injections of a linear current with this conductance, INL, to explore why some neurons can generate intrinsic slow oscillations whereas others cannot. We addressed this question, in synaptically isolated neurons of the crab Cancer borealis, after blocking action potentials. The pyloric network consists of distinct pacemaker group and follower neurons, all of which express the same complement of ionic currents. When the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron, a member of the pacemaker group, was injected with INL using dynamic clamp, it consistently produced slow oscillations. In contrast, the lateral pyloric (LP) or ventral pyloric (VD) follower neurons, failed to oscillate with INL. To understand these distinct behaviors, we compared outward current levels of PD, LP and VD neurons. We found that LP and VD neurons had significantly larger high-threshold potassium currents (IHTK) than PD, and LP had lower transient potassium current, IA. Reducing IHTK pharmacologically enabled both LP and VD neurons to produce oscillations with INL, whereas modifying IA levels did not affect INL-induced oscillations. Using phase-plane and bifurcation analysis of a simplified model cell, we demonstrate that large levels of IHTK can block INL-induced oscillatory activity, whereas generation of oscillations is almost independent of IA levels. These results demonstrate the importance of a balance between inward pacemaking currents and high-threshold K+current levels in determining slow oscillatory activity.",

    "abstract": "The cerebellum plays an important role in motor learning as part of a cortico-striato-cerebellar network. Patients with cerebellar degeneration typically show impairments in different aspects of motor learning, including implicit motor sequence learning. How cerebellar dysfunction affects interactions in this cortico-striato-cerebellar network is poorly understood. The present study investigated the effect of cerebellar degeneration on activity in causal interactions between cortical and subcortical regions involved in motor learning. We found that cerebellar patients showed learning-related increase in activity in two regions known to be involved in learning and memory, namely parahippocampal cortex and cerebellar Crus I. The cerebellar activity increase was observed in non-learners of the patient group whereas learners showed an activity decrease. Dynamic causal modelling analysis revealed that modulation of M1 to cerebellum and putamen to cerebellum connections were significantly more negative for sequence compared to random blocks in controls, replicating our previous results, and did not differ in patients. In addition, a separate analysis revealed a similar effect in connections from SMA and PMC to M1 bilaterally. Again, neural network changes were associated with learning performance in patients. Specifically, learners showed a negative modulation from right SMA to right M1 that was similar to controls, whereas this effect was close to zero in non-learners. These results highlight the role of cerebellum in motor learning and demonstrate the functional role cerebellum plays as part of the cortico-striato-cerebellar network.",

    "abstract": "Although aging is often associated with cognitive decline, there is considerable variability among individuals and across domains of cognition. Within language, several indicators of semantic processing show stability throughout the lifespan. However, older adults have increased difficulty with phonological aspects of language, especially in language production. While these behavioral patterns are established, the neurobiology associated with these behaviors are less clear. Previously we have shown that, older adults were slower and less accurate in phonological compared to semantic decisions, and that older adults didnt exhibit brain-behavior relationships. In the present study, we examined phonological and semantic processes in the presence of task-irrelevant information. Older and younger adults made phonological and semantic decisions about pictures in the presence of either phonologically-related or semantically-related words, which were unrelated to the task. Behavioral results indicated that overall older adults had slower reaction times and lower accuracy compared to younger adults, and that all adults were less efficient when making phonological compared to semantic decisions. Patterns of brain activation for the semantic condition showed that all adults engaged typical left-hemisphere language regions, and that this activation was positively correlated with efficiency. In contrast, the phonological condition elicited activation in bilateral precuneus and cingulate, but only younger adults showed a significant relationship between activation and efficiency. Our results suggest that the relationship between behavior and neural activation when processing phonological information declines with age, but that the core semantic system continues to be engaged throughout the lifespan, even in the presence of task-irrelevant information.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat resistance genes (NLRs) allow plants to detect microbial effectors. We hypothesized that NLR expression patterns would reflect organ-specific differences in effector challenge and tested this by carrying out a meta-analysis of expression data for 1,235 NLRs from 9 plant species. We found stable NLR root/shoot expression ratios within species, suggesting organ-specific hardwiring of NLR expression patterns in anticipation of distinct challenges. Most monocot and dicot plant species preferentially expressed NLRs in roots. In contrast, Brassicaceae species, including oilseed rape and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, were unique in showing NLR expression skewed towards the shoot across multiple phylogenetically distinct groups of NLRs. The Brassicaceae NLR expression shift coincides with loss of the endomycorrhization pathway, which enables intracellular root infection by symbionts. We propose that its loss offer two likely explanations for the unusual Brassicaceae NLR expression pattern: loss of NLR-guarded symbiotic components and elimination of constraints on general root defences associated with exempting symbionts from targeting. This hypothesis is consistent with the existence of Brassicaceae-specific receptors for conserved microbial molecules and suggests that Brassicaceae species are rich sources of unique antimicrobial root defences.",

I set up a scholarly foraging experiment to try to estimate readership for my own body of work: a personal web site with  reprint pdf files available for downloading and a web statistics program engaged to count these downloads. (I made the site topically rather than author-oriented to increase potential audience size.) Despite this, human users are difficult to count. There are a lot of bots, spiders, and other web programs that increasingly mimic human behavior (e.g., with IP- and chrono-camouflage), and humans own behaviors are changing (e.g., reading papers online many times). From four years of data, after culling both automated activity (a fascinating ecosystem) and humans reading repeatedly online, my papers receive [~]4000-8000 downloads per year, about an order of magnitude higher than the number of citations they receive annually. This is a conservative minimum, because these publications can be obtained from other sources as well. On average, this body of work may be being read at an approximately 10:1 download-to-citation ratio. At a more granular scale, downloads do not correlate with citations; there are some papers being downloaded at about a 100:1 ratio, and it turns out these are exactly how they were meant to be used (e.g., an instruction manual). How intensively someone reads a paper is of course highly variable, but this exercise gives us an idea of how broad our publications impacts actually are.

    "abstract": "Modeling metastasis in vivo with animals is a priority for both revealing mechanisms of tumor dissemination and developing therapeutic methods. While conventional intravenous injection of tumor cells provides an efficient and consistent system for studying tumor cell extravasation and colonization, studying spontaneous metastasis derived from orthotopic tumor sites has the advantage of modeling more aspects of the metastatic cascade, but is challenging as it is difficult to detect small numbers of metastatic cells. In this work, we developed an approach for quantifying spontaneous metastasis in the syngeneic mouse B16 system using real time PCR. We first transduced B16 cells with lentivirus expressing firefly luciferase Luc2 gene for bioluminescence imaging. Next, we developed a real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for the detection of luciferase-expressing, metastatic tumor cells in mouse lungs and other organs. To illustrate the approach, we quantified lung metastasis in both spontaneous and experimental scenarios using B16F0 and B16F10 cells in C57BL/6Ncrl and NOD-Scid Gamma (NSG) mice. We tracked B16 melanoma metastasis with both bioluminescence imaging and qPCR, which were found to be self-consistent. Using this assay, we can quantitatively detect one Luc2 positive tumor cells out of 104 tissue cells, which corresponds to a metastatic burden of 1.8x104 metastatic cells per whole mouse lung. More importantly, the qPCR method was at least a factor of 10 more sensitive in detecting metastatic cell dissemination and should be combined with bioluminescence imaging as a high-resolution, end-point method for final metastatic cell quantitation. Given the rapid growth of primary tumors in many mouse models, assays with improved sensitivity can provide better insight into biological mechanisms that underpin tumor metastasis.",

Our results reveal that hundreds of acylsugars are produced across the Solanaceae family and even within a single plant, revealing this phenotype to be hyper-diverse. The relatively short biosynthetic pathway experienced repeated cycles of innovation over the last 100 million years that include gene duplication and divergence, gene loss, evolution of substrate preference and promiscuity.

    "abstract": "It is well established that learning can occur without external feedback, yet normative reinforcement learning theories have difficulties explaining such instances of learning. Recently, we reported on a confidence-based reinforcement learn-ing model for the model case of perceptual learning (Guggenmos, Wilbertz, Hebart, & Sterzer, 2016), according to which the brain capitalizes on internal monitoring processes when no external feedback is available. In the model, internal confidence prediction errors - the difference between current confidence and expected confidence - serve as teaching signals to guide learning. In the present paper, we explore an extension to this idea. The main idea is that the neural information processing pathways activated for a given sensory stimulus are subject to fluctuations, where some pathway configurations lead to higher confidence than others. Confidence prediction errors strengthen pathway configurations for which fluctuations lead to above-average confidence and weaken those that are associated with below-average con-fidence. We show through simulation that the model is capable of self-reinforced perceptual learning and can benefit from exploratory network fluctuations. In addition, by simulating different model parameters, we show that the ideal confidence-based learner should (i) exhibit high degrees of network fluctuation in the initial phase of learning, but re-duced fluctuations as learning progresses, (ii) have a high learning rate for network updates for immediate performance gains, but a low learning rate for long-term maximum performance, and (iii) be neither too under-nor too overconfident. In sum, we present a model in which confidence prediction errors strengthen favorable network fluctuations and enable learning in the absence of external feedback. The model can be readily applied to data of real-world perceptual tasks in which observers provided both choice and confidence reports.",

    "abstract": "When chilled to temperatures below their critical thermal minimum, chill susceptible insects can suffer tissue damage and die. The mechanisms that cause this chilling injury are not well understood but a growing body of evidence suggests that a loss of ion and water homeostasis in the cold leads to hemolymph hyperkalemia that depolarizes cells, leading to cell death. The apparent root of this cascade of issues is the net leak of osmolytes down their concentration gradients in the cold. Many insects, however, are capable of adjusting their thermal physiology, and cold-acclimated Drosophila can maintain homeostasis and avoid chilling injury better than warm-acclimated flies. Here, we test whether the cold-induced loss of osmotic homeostasis is associated with a loss of epithelial barrier function in Drosophila, and provide the first evidence of cold-induced epithelial barrier failure in an invertebrate. Flies exposed to 0{degrees} C had increased rates of paracellular leak through the gut epithelia, but cold acclimation reduced paracellular permeability, both before and during cold stress, and improved cold tolerance. This adjustment in barrier function was associated with changes in the abundance of select septate junction proteins and the appearance of a tortuous ultrastructure in subapical intercellular regions of contact between adjacent midgut epithelial cells. Thus, cold causes paracellular leak in a chill susceptible insect and cold acclimation can mitigate this effect, at least partly through changes in the composition and structure of transepithelial barriers.\\n\\nSummary StatementChilling disrupts barrier function of the gut of flies and cold acclimation can mitigate this problem through changes in paracellular occluding junctions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSialic acids are nine carbon sugars ubiquitously found on the surfaces of vertebrate cells and are involved in various immune response-related processes. In humans, at least 58 genes spanning diverse functions, from biosynthesis and activation to recycling and degradation, are involved in sialic acid biology. Because of their role in immunity, sialic acid biology genes have been hypothesized to exhibit elevated rates of evolutionary change. Consistent with this hypothesis, several genes involved in sialic acid biology have experienced higher rates of non-synonymous substitutions in the human lineage than their counterparts in other great apes, perhaps in response to ancient pathogens that infected hominins millions of years ago (paleopathogens). To test whether sialic acid biology genes have also experienced more recent positive selection during the evolution of the modern human lineage, reflecting adaptation to contemporary cosmopolitan or geographically-restricted pathogens, we examined whether their protein-coding regions showed evidence of recent hard and soft selective sweeps. This examination involved the calculation of four measures that quantify changes in allele frequency spectra, extent of population differentiation, and haplotype homozygosity caused by recent hard and soft selective sweeps for 55 sialic acid biology genes using publicly available whole genome sequencing data from 1,668 humans from three ethnic groups. To disentangle evidence for selection from confounding demographic effects, we compared the observed patterns in sialic acid biology genes to simulated sequences of the same length under a model of neutral evolution that takes into account human demographic history. We found that the patterns of genetic variation of most sialic acid biology genes did not significantly deviate from neutral expectations and were not significantly different among genes belonging to different functional categories. Those few sialic acid biology genes that significantly deviated from neutrality either experienced soft sweeps or population-specific hard sweeps. Interestingly, while most hard sweeps occurred on genes involved in sialic acid recognition, most soft sweeps involved genes associated with recycling, degradation and activation, transport, and transfer functions. We propose that the lack of signatures of recent positive selection for the majority of the sialic acid biology genes is consistent with the view that these genes regulate immune responses against ancient rather than contemporary cosmopolitan or geographically restricted pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is a natural resident of the aquatic environment, where a common nutrient is the chitinous exoskeletons of microscopic crustaceans. Chitin utilization requires chitinases, which degrade this insoluble polymer into soluble chitin oligosaccharides. These oligosaccharides also serve as an inducing cue for natural transformation in Vibrio species. There are 7 predicted endochitinase-like genes in the V. cholerae genome. Here, we systematically dissect the contribution of each gene to growth on chitin as well as induction of natural transformation. Specifically, we created a strain that lacks all 7 putative chitinases and from this strain, generated a panel of strains where each expresses a single chitinase. We also generated expression plasmids to ectopically express all 7 chitinases in our chitinase deficient strain. Through this analysis, we found that low levels of chitinase activity are sufficient for natural transformation, while growth on insoluble chitin as a sole carbon source requires more robust and concerted chitinase activity. We also assessed the role that the three uptake systems for the chitin degradation products GlcNAc, (GlcNAc)2, and (GlcN)2, play in chitin utilization and competence induction. Cumulatively, this study provides mechanistic details for how this pathogen utilizes chitin to thrive and evolve in its environmental reservoir.\\n\\nORIGINALITY-SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, interacts with the chitinous shells of crustacean zooplankton in the aquatic environment, which serves as an environmental reservoir for this pathogen.

Also, chitin serves as an inducing cue for natural transformation - an important mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in this species.

    "abstract": "Unlike synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability is assumed to be a stable property of neurons. For example, learning of somatic conductances is generally not incorporated into computational models, and the discharge pattern of neurons in response to test stimuli is frequently used as a basis for phenotypic classification. However, it is increasingly evident that signal processing properties of neurons are more generally plastic on the timescale of minutes. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic firing patterns of CA3 neurons of the rat hippocampus in vitro undergo rapid long-term plasticity in response to a few minutes of only subthreshold synaptic conditioning. This plasticity on the spike-timing could also be induced by intrasomatic injection of subthreshold depolarizing pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors, indicating that discharge dynamics are modulated locally. Cluster analysis of firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the patterns initially exhibited by the cells. We used a conductance-based model to decide appropriate pharmacological blockade, and found that the observed transitions are likely due to recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances. We conclude that CA3 neurons adapt their conductance profile to the subthreshold activity of their input, so that their intrinsic firing pattern is not a static signature, but rather a reflection of their history of subthreshold activity. In this way, recurrent output from CA3 neurons may collectively shape the temporal dynamics of their embedding circuits.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDespite being widely conserved across the animal phyla, it is still a mystery why nerve cells present diverse discharge dynamics upon somatic step currents. Adding a new timing dimension to the intrinsic plasticity literature, here we show that CA3 neurons rapidly adapt through the space of known firing patterns in response to the subthreshold signals that they receive from their embedding circuit. This result implies that CA3 neurons collectively adjust their network processing to the temporal statistics of their circuit.",
