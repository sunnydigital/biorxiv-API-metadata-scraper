    "abstract": "Heritability is essential for understanding the biological causes of disease, but requires laborious patient recruitment and phenotype ascertainment. Electronic health records (EHR) passively capture a wide range of clinically relevant data and provide a novel resource for studying the heritability of traits that are not typically accessible. EHRs contain next-of-kin information collected via patient emergency contact forms, but until now, these data have gone unused in research. We mined emergency contact data at three academic medical centers and identified millions of familial relationships while maintaining patient privacy. Identified relationships were consistent with genetically-derived relatedness. We used EHR data to compute heritability estimates for 500 disease phenotypes. Overall, estimates were consistent with literature and between sites. Inconsistencies were indicative of limitations and opportunities unique to EHR research. These analyses provide a novel validation of the use of EHRs for genetics and disease research.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe demonstrate that next-of-kin information can be used to identify familial relationships in the EHR, providing unique opportunities for precision medicine studies.",

    "abstract": "Heritable variance in psychological traits may reflect genetic and biological processes that are not necessarily specific to these particular traits but pertain to a broader range of phenotypes. We tested the possibility that Five-Factor Model personality domains and their 30 facets, as rated by people themselves and their knowledgeable informants, reflect polygenic influences that have been previously associated with educational attainment. In a sample of over 3,000 adult Estonians, polygenic scores for educational attainment (EPS; interpretable as estimates of molecular genetic propensity for education) were correlated with various personality traits, particularly from the Neuroticism and Openness domains. The correlations of personality traits with phenotypic educational attainment closely mirrored their correlations with EPS. Moreover, EPS predicted an aggregate personality trait tailored to capture maximum amount of variance in educational attainment almost as strongly as it predicted the attainment itself. We discuss possible interpretations and implications of these findings.",

In the last two decades, cognitive neuroscientists have sought to elucidate this issue by exploring the common neural basis of the experience of beauty. Still, empirical evidence for such common neural basis of different forms of beauty is not conclusive. To address this question, we performed an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing neuroimaging studies of beauty appreciation of faces and visual art by non-expert adults (49 studies, 982 participants, meta-data are available at https://osf.io/s9xds/). We observed that perceiving these two forms of beauty activated distinct brain regions: while the beauty of faces convergently activated the left ventral striatum, the beauty of visual art convergently activated the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC). However, a conjunction analysis failed to reveal any common brain regions for the beauty of visual art and faces. The implications of these results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "During the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode zygote, the polarity cues distribution and daughter cell fates depend on the correct positioning of the mitotic spindle, which results from both centering and cortical pulling forces. Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling forces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn consequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of these forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule availability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull. Importantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99 cortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior crescent. After delaying anaphase onset, we detected this positional pulling force regulation in C. elegans as a precocious spindle rocking with respect to anaphase onset. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex. Indeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the centrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it modulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control, predicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent controlled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic progression. We found in particular that the oscillation onset position resists changes in cellular geometry and moderate variations of active force generator count. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to a posterior crescent sets the spindles final position, reflecting polarity through the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior crescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity. This novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force generator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold needed for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in cell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.",

    "abstract": "The visual system takes advantage of redundancies in the scene by extracting summary statistics from a set of items. Similarly, in many social situations where scrutinizing each individuals expression is inefficient, human observers make snap judgments of crowds of people by reading \\\"crowd emotion\\\" to avoid danger (e.g., mass panic or violent mobs) or to seek help. However, how the brain accomplishes this feat remains unaddressed. Here we report a set of behavioral and fMRI studies in which participants made avoidance or approach decisions by choosing between two facial crowds presented in the left and right visual fields (LVF/RVF). Participants were most accurate for crowds containing task-relevant cues: avoiding angry crowds and approaching happy crowds. This effect was amplified by sex-linked facial cues (angry male/happy female crowds) and highly lateralized, with better recognition of the task-congruent facial crowd when presented in LVF. fMRI results showed that the dorsal visual stream was preferentially activated in crowd emotion processing, with intraparietal sulcus and superior frontal gyrus predicting behavioral crowd emotion efficiency, whereas the ventral visual stream showed greater involvement in individual face emotion processing, with fusiform cortex activity predicting the accuracy of decisions about individual face emotion. Our results shed new light on the distinction between global vs. local processing of face stimuli, revealing differential involvement of the left and right hemispheres and the dorsal and ventral pathways in reading crowd vs. individual emotion.",

    "abstract": "Microbes may maximize the number of daughter cells per time or per amount of nutrients consumed. These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in E. coli, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhen cells compete for nutrients, those that grow faster and produce more offspring per time are favored by natural selection. In contrast, when cells need to maximize the cell number at a limited nutrient supply, fast growth does not matter and an efficient use of nutrients (i.e. high biomass yield) is essential. This raises a basic question about metabolism: can cells achieve high growth rates and yields simultaneously, or is there a conflict between the two goals? Using a new modeling method called Enzymatic Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM), we predict cellular growth rates and find that growth rate/yield trade-offs and the ensuing preference for enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways are not universal, but depend on growth conditions such as external glucose and oxygen concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Action observation can facilitate the acquisition of novel motor skills, however, there is considerable individual variability in the extent to which observation promotes motor learning. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in brain function or structure can predict subsequent observation-related gains in motor learning. Subjects underwent an anatomical MRI scan and resting-state fMRI scans to assess pre-observation grey matter volume and pre-observation resting-state functional connectivity (FC), respectively. On the following day, subjects observed a video of a tutor adapting her reaches to a novel force field. After observation, subjects performed reaches in a force field as a behavioral assessment of gains in motor learning resulting from observation. We found that individual differences in resting-state FC, but not grey matter volume, predicted post-observation gains in motor learning. Pre-observation resting-state FC between left S1 and bilateral PMd, M1, S1 and left SPL was positively correlated with behavioral measures of post-observation motor learning. Sensory-motor resting-state FC can thus predict the extent to which observation will promote subsequent motor learning.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe show that individual differences in pre-observation brain function can predict subsequent observation-related gains in motor learning.

    "abstract": "Optimal mating decisions depend on stable signaling systems because any independent changes in either the signal or its perception could carry a fitness cost. However, since the perception and production of specific mating signals are often mediated by different tissues and cell types, the genetic and cellular mechanisms that drive and maintain their coupling on the evolutionary and physiological timescales remain unknown for most animal species. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, sensory perception and synthesis of an inhibitory mating pheromone is regulated by the action of Gr8a, a member of the Gustatory receptor gene family. Particularly, Gr8a acts as a pheromone chemoreceptor in the sensory system of males and females, and, independently regulates pheromone synthesis in the male fat body and oenocytes. These data provide a relatively simple molecular explanation for how genetic coupling allows for the robust and stable flow of social information at the population level.",

Specifically, we present a comprehensive, survey-based analysis of the structural properties of small {beta}-barrels (SBBs). We first consider the defining characteristics of the SBB fold, as well as the various systems of nomenclature used to describe it. In order to begin elucidating how such vast functional diversity is achieved by a relatively simple protein domain, we then explore the anatomy of the SBB fold and some of its representative structural variants. Many types of SBB proteins assemble into cyclic oligomers that act as the biologically-functional entity. These oligomers exhibit a great deal of plasticity even at the quaternary structural level--including homomeric and heteromeric assemblies, rings of variable subunit stoichiometries (pentamer, hexamer, etc.), as well as higher-order oligomers (e.g., double-rings) and fibrillar polymers. We conclude with three themes that emerge from the SBBs unique structure{leftrightarrow}function versatility.",

    "abstract": "White matter tracts are commonly analyzed in studies of micro-structural integrity and anatomical connectivity in the brain. Over the last decade, it has been an open problem as to how best to cluster white matter fibers, extracted from whole-brain tractography, into anatomically meaningful groups. Some existing techniques use region of interest (ROI) based clustering, atlas-based labeling, or unsupervised spectral clustering. ROI-based clustering is popular for analyzing anatomical connectivity among a set of ROIs, but it does not always partition the brain into recognizable fiber bundles. Here we propose an approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn shape features of the fiber bundles, which are then exploited to cluster white matter fibers. To achieve such clustering, we first need to re-parameterize the fibers in an intrinsic space. The clustering is performed in induced parameterized coordinates. To our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches for fiber clustering using deep learning techniques. The results show strong accuracy - on a par with or better than other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe complexity of metabolic networks can make the origin and impact of profound changes in central metabolism occurring during disease difficult to understand. Computer simulations can help unravel this complexity, and progress has advanced in genome-scale metabolic models. However, many current models produce unrealistic results when challenged to simulate abnormal metabolism as they include incorrect specification and localization of reactions and transport steps, incorrect reaction parameters, and confounding of prosthetic groups and free metabolites in reactions. Other common drawbacks are due to their scale, such as being difficult to parameterise and simulation results being hard to interpret. Therefore, it remains important to develop smaller, manually curated models to represent central metabolism accurately.\\n\\nResultsWe present MitoCore, a manually curated constraint-based computer model of human metabolism that incorporates the complexity of central metabolism and simulates this metabolism successfully under normal and abnormal conditions, including hypoxia and mitochondrial diseases. MitoCore describes 324 metabolic reactions, 83 transport steps between mitochondrion and cytosol, and 74 metabolite inputs and outputs through the plasma membrane, to produce a model of manageable scale for easy data interpretation. Its key innovations include accurate partitioning of metabolism between cytosol and mitochondrial matrix; correct modelling of connecting transport steps; proper differentiation of prosthetic groups and free co-factors in reactions; and a new representation of the respiratory chain and the proton motive force. MitoCores default parameters simulate normal cardiomyocyte metabolism, and to improve usability and allow comparison with other models and types of analysis, its reactions and metabolites have extensive annotation, and cross-reference identifiers from Virtual Metabolic Human database and KEGG. These innovations--including over 100 reactions absent or modified from Recon 2--are essential to model central metabolism accurately.\\n\\nConclusionWe anticipate MitoCore as a research tool for scientists, from experimentalists looking to interpret data and generate further hypotheses, to experienced modellers predicting the consequences of disease or using computationally intensive methods that are infeasible with larger models, as well as a teaching tool for those new to modelling and needing a small manageable model on which to learn and experiment.",

We assumed 10,000 SNPs, 400 QTLs, two groups of 70 selected DH lines, and 4,900 SCs. The heritabilities for the assessed SCs were 30, 60 and 100%. The scenarios included three sampling processes of DH lines, two sampling processes of SCs for testing, two SNP densities, DH lines from distinct and same populations, DH lines from populations with lower LD, two genetic models, three statistical models, and three statistical approaches. We derived a model for genomic prediction based on SNP average effects of substitution and dominance deviations. The prediction accuracy is not affected by the linkage phase. The prediction of untested SCs is very efficient. The accuracies and coincidences ranged from approximately 0.8 and 0.5, respectively, under low heritability, to 0.9 and 0.7, assuming high heritability. Additionally, we highlighted the relevance of the overall LD and evidenced that efficient prediction of untested SCs can be achieved for crops that show no heterotic pattern, for reduced training set size (10%), for SNP density of 1 cM, and for distinct sampling processes of DH lines, based on random choice of the SCs for testing.",

    "abstract": "Some images stick in your mind for days or even years, while others seem to vanish quickly from memory. We tested whether differences in image memorability 1) are already evident immediately after encoding, 2) produce different rates of forgetting, and 3) whether the retrieval of images with different memorability scores affords differential degrees of cognitive load, mirrored by graded pupillary and blink rate responses. We monitored participants eye activity while they viewed a sequence of >1200 images in a repetition detection paradigm. 240 target images from 3 non-overlapping memorability classes were repeated at 4 different lags. Overall, performance decreased log-linearly with time. Differences in memorability were already visible at the shortest lag (~ 20 sec) and became more pronounced as time passed on. The rate of forgetting was steepest for low memorable images. We found that pupils dilated significantly more to correctly identified targets than correctly rejected distractors. Importantly, this \\\"pupil old/new effect\\\" increased with increasing number of lags and decreasing image memorability. A similar modulation of blink rates corroborated these findings. These results suggest that during memory retrieval of scenes, image inherent characteristics pose differential degrees of cognitive load on observers as seen in their eyes.",

    "abstract": "Translational repression of maternal mRNAs is an essential regulatory mechanism during early embryonic development. Repression of the Drosophila nanos mRNA, required for the formation of the anterior-posterior body axis, depends on the protein Smaug binding to two Smaug recognition elements (SREs) in the nanos 3 UTR. In a comprehensive mass-spectrometric analysis of the SRE-dependent repressor complex, we identified Smaug, Cup, Me31B, Trailer hitch, eIF4E and PABPC, in agreement with earlier data. As a novel component, the RNA-dependent ATPase Belle (DDX3) was found, and its involvement in deadenylation and repression of nanos was confirmed in vivo. Smaug, Cup and Belle bound stoichiometrically to the SREs, independently of RNA length. Binding of Me31B and Tral was also SRE-dependent, but their amounts were proportional to the length of the RNA and equimolar to each other. We suggest that  coating of the RNA by a Me31B*Tral complex may be at the core of repression.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins can cause a wide spectrum of diseases. Since IDRs lack a fixed three-dimensional structure, the mechanism by which such mutations cause disease is often unknown. Here, we employ a proteomic screen to investigate the impact of mutations in IDRs on protein-protein interactions. We find that mutations in disordered cytosolic regions of three transmembrane proteins (GLUT1, ITPR1 and CACNA1H) lead to an increased binding of clathrins. In all three cases, the mutation creates a dileucine motif known to mediate clathrin-dependent trafficking. Follow-up experiments on GLUT1 (SLC2A1), a glucose transporter involved in GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein mislocalizes to intracellular compartments. A systematic analysis of other known disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of gained dileucine motifs in cytosolic tails of transmembrane proteins. Dileucine motif gains thus appear to be a recurrent cause of disease.",

    "abstract": "2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is a hypoxic metabolite with potentially important epigenetic signaling roles. The mechanisms underlying 2-HG generation are poorly understood, but evidence suggests a potential regulatory role for the sirtuin family of lysine deacetylases. Thus, we hypothesized that the acetylation status of the major 2-HG-generating enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) may govern their 2-HG generating activity. In-vitro acetylation of these enzymes, with confirmation by western blotting, mass spectrometry, and reversibility by incubation with recombinant sirtuins, yielded no effect on 2-HG generating activity. In addition, while elevated 2-HG in hypoxia is associated with the activation of lysine deacetylases, we found that mice lacking mitochondrial SIRT3 exhibited hyperacetylation and elevated 2-HG. These data suggest there is no direct link between enzyme acetylation and 2-HG production. Furthermore, our observed effects of in-vitro acetylation on the canonical activities of IDH, MDH and LDH appeared to contrast sharply with previous findings wherein acetyl-mimetic lysine mutations resulted in inhibition of these enzymes. Overall these data suggest that a causal relationship should not be assumed, between acetylation of metabolic enzymes and their activities, canonical or otherwise.",

    "abstract": "The metazoan genome is compartmentalized in megabase-scale areas of highly interacting chromatin known as topologically associating domains (TADs), typically identified by computational analyses of Hi-C sequencing data. TADs are demarcated by boundaries that are largely conserved across cell types and even across species, although, increasing evidence suggests that the seemingly invariant TAD boundaries may exhibit plasticity and their insulating strength can vary. However, a genome-wide characterization of TAD boundary strength in mammals is still lacking. A systematic classification and characterization of TAD boundaries may generate new insights into their function. In this study, we first use fused two-dimensional lasso as a machine learning method to improve Hi-C contact matrix reproducibility, and, subsequently, we categorize TAD boundaries based on their insulation score. We demonstrate that higher TAD boundary insulation scores are associated with elevated CTCF levels and that they may differ across cell types. Intriguingly, we observe that super-enhancer elements are preferentially insulated by strong boundaries, i.e. boundaries of higher insulation score. Furthermore, we perform a pan-cancer analysis to demonstrate that strong TAD boundaries and super-enhancer elements are frequently co-duplicated in cancer patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that super-enhancers insulated by strong TAD boundaries may be exploited, as a functional unit, by cancer cells to promote oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The identification of constraints, due to gene interactions, in the order of accumulation of mutations during cancer progression can allow us to single out therapeutic targets. Cancer progression models (CPMs) use genotype frequency data from cross-sectional samples to try to identify these constraints, and return Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of genes. On the other hand, fitness landscapes, which map genotypes to fitness, contain all possible paths of tumor progression. Thus, we expect a correspondence between DAGs from CPMs and the fitness landscapes where evolution happened. But many fitness landscapes --e.g., those with reciprocal sign epistasis-- cannot be represented by CPMs. Using simulated data under 500 fitness landscapes, I show that CPMs performance (prediction of genotypes that can exist) degrades with reciprocal sign epistasis. There is large variability in the DAGs inferred from each landscape, which is also affected by mutation rate, detection regime, and fitness landscape features, in ways that depend on CPM method. And the same DAG is often observed in very different landscapes, which differ in more than 50% of their accessible genotypes. Using a pancreatic data set, I show that this many-to-many relationship affects the analysis of empirical data. Fitness landscapes that are widely different from each other can, when evolutionary processes run repeatedly on them, both produce data similar to the empirically observed one, and lead to DAGs that are very different among themselves. Because reciprocal sign epistasis can be common in cancer, these results question the use and interpretation of CPMs.",

    "abstract": "As the systems biology community generates and collects data at an unprecedented rate, there is a growing need for interactive data exploration tools to explore the datasets. These tools need to combine advanced statistical analyses, relevant knowledge from biological databases, and interactive visualizations in an application with clear user interfaces. To answer specific research questions tools must provide specialized user interfaces and visualizations. While these are application-specific, the underlying components of a data analysis tool can be shared and reused later. Application developers can therefore compose applications of reusable services rather than implementing a single monolithic application from the ground up for each project.\\n\\nOur approach for developing data exploration applications in systems biology builds on the microservice architecture. Microservice architectures separates an application into smaller components that communicate using language-agnostic protocols. We show that this design is suitable in bioinformatics applications where applications often use different tools, written in different languages, by different research groups. Packaging each service in a software container enables re-use and sharing of key components between applications, reducing development, deployment, and maintenance time.\\n\\nWe demonstrate the viability of our approach through a web application, MIxT blood-tumor, for exploring and comparing transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples in breast cancer patients. The application integrates advanced statistical software, up-to-date information from biological databases, and modern data visualization libraries.\\n\\nThe web application for exploring transcriptional profiles, MIxT, is online at mixt-blood-tumor.bci.mcgill.ca and open-sourced at github.com/fjukstad/mixt.

The analysis of scRNA-seq data is complicated by excess zero or near zero counts, the so-called dropouts due to the low amounts of mRNA sequenced within individual cells. Downstream analysis of scRNA-seq would be severely biased if the dropout events are not properly corrected. We introduce scImpute, a statistical method to accurately and robustly impute the dropout values in scRNA-seq data. ScImpute automatically identifies gene expression values affected by dropout events, and only perform imputation on these values without introducing new bias to the rest data. ScImpute also detects outlier or rare cells and excludes them from imputation. Evaluation based on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data on mouse embryos, mouse brain cells, human blood cells, and human embryonic stem cells suggests that scImpute is an effective tool to recover transcriptome dynamics masked by dropout events. scImpute is shown to correct false zero counts, enhance the clustering of cell populations and subpopulations, improve the accuracy of differential expression analysis, and aid the study of gene expression dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Plant species differ in the amounts of energy allocated to different reproductive tissues, driving differences in their ecology and energy flows within ecosystems. While it is widely agreed that energy allocation is key to reproductive outcomes, few studies have estimated how reproductive effort (RE) is partitioned among different pools, for multiple species in a community. In plants, RE can be partitioned in several meaningful ways: seed versus non-seed tissues; into flowers that form seeds and those that fail to develop; into pre-versus post-pollination tissues, and into successful versus aborted ovules. Evolutionary theory suggests several hypotheses about how these tissues should be coordinated across species. To quantify variation in allocation to different reproductive tissues, we collected detailed RE measurements for a year from 14 perennial species in a recurrent-fire coastal heath community in eastern Australia. Overall we found that total accessory costs - the proportion of RE not directly invested in provisioning the seed - were very large, varying from 95.8% to 99.8% across the study species. These results suggest that studies using seed or fruit production as measures of RE may underestimate it by 10-to 500-fold. We propose a suitable alternative that well-approximates true RE. When comparing species, we found strong support for three evolutionary trade-offs that are predicted to arise when a given energy pool is divided into different tissue masses and counts across species: 1) between successful pollen-attraction costs and mature ovule count, 2) between total reproductive costs and seed count, and 3) between seedset and relative investment in pollen-attraction costs. As a result of these trade-offs, species were also predicted to show coordinated shifts in the amounts invested in floral construction, in seedset and seed size. These shifts in investment were indeed observed, with the amount allocated to discarded tissues increasing with seed size and the amount allocated to pollen-attraction decreasing with seed size. It is already well-established that the seed size axis aligns with the colonization-competition life history spectrum; here we show that relative construction costs of pollen-attraction versus provisioning tissues and seedset are also part of this trajectory, expanding our understanding of the relatives sizes of floral and fruiting structures observed across angiosperms.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the polygenicity (proportion of causally associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) and discoverability (effect size variance) of causal SNPs for human traits is currently of considerable interest. SNP-heritability is proportional to the product of these quantities. We present a basic model, using detailed linkage disequilibrium structure from an extensive reference panel, to estimate these quantities from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. We apply the model to diverse phenotypes and validate the implementation with simulations. We find model polygenicities ranging from [~=] 2 x 10-5 to [~=] 4 x 10-3, with discoverabilities similarly ranging over two orders of magnitude. A power analysis allows us to estimate the proportions of phenotypic variance explained additively by causal SNPs reaching genome-wide significance at current sample sizes, and map out sample sizes required to explain larger portions of additive SNP heritability. The model also allows for estimating residual inflation (or deflation from over-correcting of z-scores), and assessing compatibility of replication and discovery GWAS summary statistics.\n\nAuthor SummaryThere are ~10 million common variants in the genome of humans with European ancestry. For any particular phenotype a number of these variants will have some causal effect. It is of great interest to be able to quantify the number of these causal variants and the strength of their effect on the phenotype.\n\nGenome wide association studies (GWAS) produce very noisy summary statistics for the association between subsets of common variants and phenotypes. For any phenotype, these statistics collectively are difficult to interpret, but buried within them is the true landscape of causal effects. In this work, we posit a probability distribution for the causal effects, and assess its validity using simulations. Using a detailed reference panel of ~11 million common variants - among which only a small fraction are likely to be causal, but allowing for non-causal variants to show an association with the phenotype due to correlation with causal variants - we implement an exact procedure for estimating the number of causal variants and their mean strength of association with the phenotype. We find that, across different phenotypes, both these quantities - whose product allows for lower bound estimates of heritability - vary by orders of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons and Parkinsons Diseases (HD and PD) are neurodegenerative disorders that share some pathological features but are disparate in others. For example, while both diseases are marked by aberrant protein aggregation in the brain, the specific proteins that aggregate and types of neurons affected differ. A better understanding of the molecular similarities and differences between these two diseases may lead to a more complete mechanistic picture of both the individual diseases and the neurodegenerative process in general. We sought to characterize the common transcriptional signature of HD and PD as well as genes uniquely implicated in each of these diseases using mRNA-Seq data from post mortem human brains in comparison to neuropathologically normal controls. The enriched biological pathways implicated by HD differentially expressed genes show remarkable consistency with those for PD differentially expressed genes and implicate the common biological processes of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, transcriptional dysregulation, and neuron-associated functions. Comparison of the differentially expressed (DE) genes highlights a set of consistently altered genes that span both diseases. In particular, processes involving nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are the most prominent among the genes common to HD and PD. When the combined HD and PD data are compared to controls, relatively few additional biological processes emerge as significantly enriched suggesting that most pathways are independently seen within each disorder. Despite showing comparable numbers of DE genes, DE genes unique to HD are enriched in far more coherent biological processes than the DE genes unique to PD, suggesting that PD may represent a more heterogeneous disorder.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic microbes confront a constant evolutionary conflict between the pressure to maintain genome stability and the need to adapt to mounting external stresses. Prokaryotes often respond with elevated mutation rates, but to date little evidence exists of stable eukaryotic hypermutators in nature. Whole genome resequencing of the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deuterogattii identified an outbreak lineage characterized by a nonsense mutation in MSH2. This defect in mismatch repair results in a moderate mutation rate increase in typical genes, and a larger increase in genes containing homopolymer runs. This allows facile inactivation of genes with coding homopolymer runs including FRR1, which encodes the target of the immunosuppresive antifungal drugs FK506 and rapamycin. Our study identifies a eukaryotic hypermutator lineage spread over two continents and suggests that pathogenic eukaryotic microbes may experience similar selection pressures on mutation rate as bacterial pathogens, particularly during long periods of clonal growth or while expanding into new environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman dental mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as highly accessible and attractive MSCs for use in regenerative medicine, yet some of their features are not as well characterized as in other MSCs. Hypoxia-preconditioning and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) overexpression significantly improve MSC therapeutics, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. In the present study, we characterize immunomodulatory properties of dental MSCs and determine changes in their ability to modulate adaptive and innate immune populations after HIF-1 alpha overexpression.\\n\\nMethodsHuman dental MSCs were stably transduced with GFP (MSCs) or GFP-HIF-1 alpha lentivirus vectors (HIF-MSCs). Hypoxic-like metabolic profile was confirmed by mitochondrial and glycolysis stress test. Capacity of HIF-MSCs to modulate T cell activation, dendritic cell differentiation, monocyte migration and polarizations towards macrophages and NK cell lytic activity was assessed by a number of functional assays in co-cultures. Expression of relevant factors were determined by PCR analysis and ELISA.\\n\\nResultsWhile HIF-1 alpha overexpression did not modify inhibition of T cell activation by MSCs, HIF-MSCs impaired dendritic cell differentiation more efficiently. HIF-MSCs induced also higher attraction of monocytes, which differentiate into suppressor macrophages, and exhibited enhanced resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis, which support the improved therapeutic capacity of HIF-MSCs. HIF-MSCs also displayed a pro-angiogenic profile characterized by increased expression of CXCL12/SDF1 and CCL5/RANTES and complete loss of CXCL10/IP10 transcription.\\n\\nConclusionsImmunomodulation and expression of trophic factors by dental MSCs make them perfect candidates for cell therapy. Overexpression of HIF-1 alpha enhances these features and increases their resistance to allogenic NK cell lysis and, hence, their potential in vivo lifespan. Our results further support the use of HIF-1 alpha-expressing dental MSCs for cell therapy in tissue injury and immune disorders.",

This response involves modulation of expression of a large number of proteins which help the cell counter stress.

MarA and SoxS are known to control multiple antibiotic resistance and superoxide regulon respectively. Rob has been observed to control similar downstream targets as MarA and SoxS.

    "abstract": "Latent toxoplasmosis is known to be associated with specific changes in animal and human behavior and human personality. Many toxoplasmosis-associated shifts, such as an extroversion-introversion shift or a trust -suspicion shift, go in opposite directions in men and women. The stress coping hypothesis suggests that such behavioral effects of toxoplasmosis are side effects of chronic stress caused by lifelong parasitosis and associated health disorders. Several studies have searched for, and typically found, indices of impaired health in infected subjects. However, subjects were always aware of their toxoplasmosis status, which could influence obtained data and cause false-positive results of the studies. Here we searched for differences in physical and mental health status among 39 Toxoplasma-infected and 40 Toxoplasma-free female university students who completed identical questionnaires (N-70, and anamnestic questionnaire), before and 3 years after they were informed of their toxoplasmosis status. Our results showed that infected women showed indices of poorer health status, not only after, but also before they were informed of their infection. In accordance with previously published data, these indices were more numerous and stronger in Rh-negative than in Rh-positive women. Present results suggest that observed indices of poorer health and symptoms of chronic stress in Toxoplasma-infected subjects are real. Due to its high (30%) prevalence, toxoplasmosis could represent an important factor for public health.",

    "abstract": "People can employ adaptive strategies to increase the likelihood that previously encoded information will be successfully retrieved. One such strategy is to constrain retrieval towards relevant information by re-implementing the neurocognitive processes that were engaged during encoding. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics with which constraining retrieval towards semantic versus non-semantic information affects the processing of new \\\"foil\\\" information encountered during a memory test. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data acquired during an initial study phase revealed that semantic compared to non-semantic processing was associated with alpha decreases in a left frontal electrode cluster from around 600ms after stimulus onset. Successful encoding of semantic versus non-semantic foils during a subsequent memory test was related to decreases in alpha oscillatory activity in the same left frontal electrode cluster, which emerged relatively late in the trial at around 1000-1600ms after stimulus onset. Across subjects, left frontal alpha power elicited by semantic processing during the study phase correlated significantly with left frontal alpha power associated with semantic foil encoding during the memory test. Furthermore, larger left frontal alpha power decreases elicited by semantic foil encoding during the memory test predicted better subsequent semantic foil recognition in an additional surprise foil memory test. These findings indicate that constraining retrieval towards semantic information involves re-implementing semantic encoding operations that are mediated by alpha oscillations, and that such re-implementation occurs at a late stage of memory retrieval perhaps reflecting additional monitoring processes.",

While frameworks may differ on how a LoT may be implemented computationally, they all share the property that they are built from a set of atomic symbols and rules by which these symbols can be combined. In this work we show how the set of productions of a LoT grammar can be effectively selected from a broad repertoire of possible productions by an inferential process starting from experimental data. We then test this method in the language of geometry, a specific LoT model (Amalric et al., 2017). Finally, despite the fact of the geometrical LoT not being a universal (i.e. Turing-complete) language, we show an empirical relation between a sequences probability and its complexity consistent with the theoretical relationship for universal languages described by Levins Coding Theorem.",

Yet, the role of limited proteolysis in this process is still obscured due to the absence of studies. Previously, we showed that limited proteolysis by the caspase-related protease separase (EXTRA SPINDLE POLES [ESP]) modulates development in plants through the cleavage of unknown substrates. Here we used a modified version of the positional proteomics method COmbined FRActional DIagonal Chromatography (COFRADIC) to survey the proteolytic landscape of wild-type and separase mutant RADIALLY SWOLLEN 4 (rsw4) root tip cells, as an attempt to identify targets of separase. We have discovered that proteins involved in the establishment of pH homeostasis and sensing, and lipid signalling in wild-type cells, suggesting novel potential roles for separase. We also observed significant accumulation of the protease PRX34 in rsw4 which negatively impacts growth. Furthermore, we observed an increased acetylation of N-termini of rsw4 proteins which usually comprise degrons identified by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting that separase intersects with additional proteolytic networks. Our results hint to potential pathways by which separase could regulate development suggesting also novel proteolytic functions.",

    "abstract": "Label-free quantification using data-independent acquisition (DIA) is a robust method for deep and accurate proteome quantification1,2. However, when lacking a pre-existing spectral library, as is often the case with studies of novel post-translational modifications (PTMs), samples are typically analyzed several times: one or more data dependent acquisitions (DDA) are used to generate a spectral library followed by DIA for quantification. This type of multi-injection analysis results in significant cost with regard to sample consumption and instrument time for each new PTM study, and may not be possible when sample amount is limiting and/or studies require a large number of biological replicates. Recently developed software (e.g. DIA-Umpire) has enabled combined peptide identification and quantification from a data-independent acquisition without any pre-existing spectral library3,4. Still, these tools are designed for protein level quantification. Here we demonstrate a software tool and workflow that extends DIA-Umpire to allow automated identification and quantification of PTM peptides from DIA.

    "abstract": "Understanding dispersal and gene flow is an important focus of evolutionary biology, conservation biology and pest management. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is a worldwide pest of Brassica vegetable and oilseed cropping systems. This insect has high dispersal ability, which has important consequences for population dynamics and the potential spread of insecticide resistance genes. Population genetic studies of the diamondback moth have found little evidence of population structure, suggesting that frequent intermixing occurs within regions, however the patterns of local and regional dispersal remain to be identified. For this and many other pest species, understanding dispersal is crucial for developing integrated management tactics such as forecasting systems and insecticide resistance management plans. In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) methods have provided previously unparalleled resolution for population genetic studies in a wide range of species. Here, we assessed the potential of NGS-derived molecular markers to provide new insights about population structure in the diamondback moth. We use restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) to discover hundreds to thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in nine field and laboratory-reared populations collected from Australia. Genotypic data from RAD-Seq markers identified a cryptic species, P. australiana, among individuals collected from a wild host, Diplotaxis sp., indicating strong divergence in the nuclear genomes of two Australian Plutella lineages. Significant genetic differentiation was detected among populations of P. xylostella used in our study, however this could be explained by reduced heterozogosity and genetic drift in laboratory-reared populations founded by relatively few individuals. This study demonstrates that RAD-Seq is a powerful method for generating SNP markers for population genetic studies in this species.",

    "abstract": "Ecological theories of sexual reproduction assume that sexuality is advantageous in certain conditions, for example, in biotically or abiotically more heterogeneous environments. Such theories thus could be tested by comparative studies. However, the published results of these studies are rather unconvincing. Here we present the results of a new comparative study based solely on the ancient asexual clades. The association with biotically or abiotically homogeneous environments in these asexual clades was compared with the same association in their sister, or closely related, sexual clades. Using the conservative definition of ancient asexuals (i.e. age > 1 million years), we found six pairs for which relevant ecological data are available. The difference between the homogeneity type of environment associated with the sexual and asexual species was then compared in an exact binomial test. Based on available literature, the results showed that the vast majority of ancient asexual clades tend to be associated with biotically or abiotically, biotically, and abiotically more homogeneous environments than their sexual controls. In the exploratory part of the study, we found that the ancient asexuals often have durable resting stages, enabling life in subjectively homogeneous environments, live in the absence of intense biotic interactions, and are very often sedentary, inhabiting benthos and soil. The consequences of these findings for the ecological theories of sexual reproduction are discussed.",

We discuss ways to overcome these inferential limitations.",

    "abstract": "ARTICLE SUMMARYTranscription factors are vital in plants to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli and to control developmental processes. In this study, we annotated and classified transcription factors in polyploid bread wheat into gene families and explored the NAC family in detail. We combined phylogenetic analysis and transcriptome analysis, using publicly available RNA-seq data, to characterize the NAC gene family and provide hypotheses for putative functions of many NAC transcription factors. This study lays the groundwork for future studies on transcription factors in wheat which may be of great agronomic relevance.\\n\\nABSTRACTMany important genes in agriculture correspond to transcription factors which regulate a wide range of pathways from flowering to responses to disease and abiotic stresses. In this study, we identified 5,776 transcription factors in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) and classified them into gene families. We further investigated the NAC family exploring the phylogeny, C-terminal domain conservation and expression profiles across 308 RNA-seq samples. Phylogenetic trees of NAC domains indicated that wheat NACs divided into eight groups similar to rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). C-terminal domain motifs were frequently conserved between wheat, rice and barley within phylogenetic groups, however this conservation was not maintained across phylogenetic groups. We explored gene expression patterns across a wide range of developmental stages, tissues, and abiotic stresses. We found that more phylogenetically related NACs shared more similar expression patterns compared to more distant NACs. However, within each phylogenetic group there were clades with diverse expression profiles. We carried out a co-expression analysis on all wheat genes and identified 37 modules of co-expressed genes of which 23 contained NACs. Using GO term enrichment we obtained putative functions for NACs within co-expressed modules including responses to heat and abiotic stress and responses to water: these NACs may represent targets for breeding or biotechnological applications. This study provides a framework and data for hypothesis generation for future studies on NAC transcription factors in wheat.",

    "abstract": "Peach is a climacteric species whose ripening is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene. A crosstalk mechanism with auxin is necessary to support climacteric ethylene synthesis. The homeostasis control of auxin is regulated also by the activity of peptide hormones (PHs), acting both as short and long distant ligands. In this work, we investigated the role of CTG134, a peach gene encoding a GOLVEN-like PH isolated in mesocarp at the onset of ripening.\\n\\nIn peach fruit, CTG134 was expressed during the climacteric transition and its mRNA level was induced by auxin and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatments, whereas it was minimally affected by ethylene. To better elucidate its function, CTG134 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and tobacco, which showed abnormal root hair growth, similar to wild-type plants treated with a synthetic form of the peptide. Molecular surveys demonstrated an impaired hormonal crosstalk, resulting in a re-modulated expression of a set of genes involved in both ethylene and auxin domains. In addition, the promoter of pCTG134 fused with GUS reporter highlighted gene activity in plant organs in which the auxin-ethylene interplay is known to occur. These data support the role of pCTG134 as mediator in an auxin-ethylene regulatory circuit.\\n\\nHighlightThe role of the peach RGF/GLV peptide during root hair formation in Arabidopsis and tobacco supports its involvement in a cross-hormonal auxin-ethylene regulatory circuit.",

    "abstract": "KAMO and Blend provide particularly effective tools to manage automatically the merging of large numbers of datasets from serial crystallography. The requirement for manual intervention in the process can be reduced by extending Blend to support additional clustering options such as use of more accurate cell distance metrics and use of reflection-intensity correlation coefficients to infer \"distances\" among sets of reflec- tions. This increases the sensitivity to differences in unit cell parameters and allows for clustering to assemble nearly complete datasets on the basis of intensity or ampli- tude differences. If datasets are already sufficiently complete to permit it, one applies KAMO once and clusters the data using intensities only. If starting from incomplete datasets, one applies KAMO twice, first using cell parameters. In this step we use either the simple cell vector distance of the original Blend, or we use the more sensi- tive NCDist. This step tends to find clusters of sufficient size so that, when merged, each cluster is sufficiently complete to allow reflection intensities or amplitudes to be compared. One then uses KAMO again using the correlation between the reflections having a common hkl to merge clusters in a way sensitive to structural differences that may not have perturbed the cell parameters sufficiently to make meaningful clusters.\n\nMany groups have developed effective clustering algorithms that use a measurable physical parameter from each diffraction still or wedge to cluster the data into cate- gories which then can be merged, one hopes, to yield the electron density from a single protein form. Since these physical parameters are often largely independent from one another, it should be possible to greatly improve the efficacy of data clustering software by using a multi-stage partitioning strategy. Here, we have demonstrated one possible approach to multi-stage data clustering. Our strategy is to use unit-cell clustering until merged data is sufficiently complete then to use intensity-based clustering. We have demonstrated that, using this strategy, we are able to accurately cluster datasets from crystals that have subtle differences.",

Understanding the physics of such motor-filament materials is critical to developing a physical model of the cytoskeleton and the design of biomimetic active materials. Here, we demonstrate through experiments and simulations that the rigidity and connectivity of filaments in active biopolymer networks regulates the anisotropy and the length scale of the underlying deformations, yielding materials with varying contractility. Semi-flexible filaments that can be compressed and bent by motor stresses undergo deformations that are predominantly biaxial. By contrast, rigid filament bundles contract via actomyosin sliding deformations that are predominantly uniaxial. Networks dominated by filament buckling are robustly contractile under a wide range of connectivities, while networks dominated by actomyosin sliding can be tuned from contractile to extensile through reduced connectivity via cross-linking. These results identify physical parameters that control the forces generated within motor-filament arrays, and provide insight into the self-organization and mechanics of cytoskeletal assemblies.",

Here, we use a DNA-based, fluorescent chloride reporter to measure lysosomal chloride in Caenorhabditis elegans as well as murine and human cell culture models of lysosomal diseases. We find that the lysosome is highly enriched in chloride, and that chloride reduction correlates directly with a loss in the degradative function of the lysosome. In nematodes and mammalian cell culture models of diverse lysosomal disorders, where previously only lysosomal pH dysregulation has been described, massive reduction of lumenal chloride is observed that is ~104-fold greater than the accompanying pH change. Reducing chloride within the lysosome impacts Ca2+ release from the lysosome and impedes the activity of specific lysosomal enzymes indicating a broader role for chloride in lysosomal function. -149 words.",

This organization maximizes performance of a model output neuron on a stimulus discrimination task. We also report a novel canonical circuit in each mushroom body compartment with previously unidentified connections: reciprocal Kenyon cell to modulatory neuron connections, modulatory neuron to output neuron connections, and a surprisingly high number of recurrent connections between Kenyon cells. Stereotyped connections between output neurons could enhance the selection of learned responses. The complete circuit map of the mushroom body should guide future functional studies of this learning and memory center.",

    "abstract": "A significant proportion of individuals develop recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) following initial disease. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly effective treatment method for recurrent CDI, has been demonstrated to induce microbiota recovery, a critical component of disease recovery. However, identification of the specific microbes and their functions that directly impact recovery from CDI remains difficult. We assessed for associations among microbial community members and metabolites in patients with recurrent CDI following treatment with FMT over time to identify groups of bacteria with potential restorative functions. Using 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing, we observed marked similarity of the microbiota between recipients following FMT (n = 6, sampling up to 6 months post-FMT) and their respective donors. Increased levels of the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) butyrate, acetate, and propionate were observed post-FMT. To take into account longitudinal sampling and intra-individual differences, we applied a generalized estimating equation approach to model metabolite concentrations with the presence of specific members of the microbiota. Microbial metabolites that were increased following FMT associated with members classified within the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and unclassified Clostridiales families. In contrast, members of these taxa were inversely associated with primary bile acids. The longitudinal aspect of this study allowed us to characterize individualized patterns of recovery, revealing variability between and within patients following FMT.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEClostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an urgent and serious healthcare-associated problem. In recent years, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been successfully used to treat recurrent CDI, a frequent outcome of disease. While it is apparent that FMT promotes recovery of the microbiota, it is unclear how microbes and their functions promote recovery from disease. This study aimed to identify associations among microbes and metabolites following FMT and to identify critical microbial functions following FMT treatment for recurrent CDI. Overall, recovery of the metabolome was highly dynamic and individualized in all patients, who were all successfully treated. Our results suggest that microbial changes following FMT may be highly specific to the donor-recipient relationship. Further understanding of the host-microbe environments necessary to enable successful transplantation of microbes during FMT could aid development of specific microbial therapeutics for recurrent CDI and other gastrointestinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Measures of general deleteriousness, like CADD or PolyPhen, have become indispensable tools in the interpretation of genetic variants. However, these measures say little about where in the organism these deleterious effects will be most apparent. An additional, complementary measure is needed to link deleterious variants (as determined by e.g., CADD) to tissues in which their effect will be most meaningful. Here, we introduce TiSAn (Tissue Specific Annotation), a tool that predicts how related a genomic position is to a given tissue (http://github.com/kevinVervier/TiSAn). TiSAn uses machine learning on genome-scale, tissue-specific data to discriminate variants relevant to a tissue from those having no bearing on the development or function of that tissue. Predictions are then made genome-wide, and these scores can then be used to contextualize and filter variants of interest in whole genome sequencing or genome wide association studies (GWAS). We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of TiSAn by introducing predictive models for human heart and human brain, and detecting tissue-relevant variations in large cohorts for autism spectrum disorder (TiSAn-brain) and coronary artery disease (TiSAn-heart). We find that TiSAn is better able to prioritize genetic variants according to their tissue-specific action than the current state of the art method, GenoSkyLine.",

Through whole-genome sequencing, additional types of genetic variants can be observed. These variants are abundant and to know which are functional is challenging. We have analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 510 of the Simons Simplex Collections quad families and focused our attention on intronic variants.

The difference of 26 events is significantly larger than expected (p-val = 0.01) and using reasonable extrapolation shows that de novo intronic indels can contribute to at least 10% of simplex autism. The significance increases if we restrict to the half of the autism targets that are intolerant to damaging variants in the normal human population, which half we expect to be even more enriched for autism genes. For these 273 targets we observe 43 and 20 events in affected and unaffected siblings, respectively (p-value of 0.005). There was no significant signal in the number of de novo intronic indels in any of the control sets of genes analyzed. We see no signal from de novo substitutions in the introns of target genes.",

We used optogenetic and ablation experiments to probe the nature of rhythm generation in the locomotor circuit. We found that multiple sections of forward locomotor circuitry are capable of independently generating rhythms. By perturbing different components of the motor circuit, we localize the source of secondary rhythms to cholinergic motor neurons in the midbody. Using rhythmic optogenetic perturbation we demonstrate bidirectional entrainment of oscillations between different body regions. These results show that, as in many other vertebrates and invertebrates, the C. elegans motor circuit contains multiple oscillators that coordinate activity to generate behavior.",

    "abstract": "Facial expression and eye gaze provide a shared signal about threats. While averted-gaze fear clearly points to the source of threat, direct-gaze fear renders the source of threat ambiguous. Dual processing routes have been proposed to mediate these processes: reflexive processing via magnocellular (M-) pathway and reflective processing via parvocellular (P-) pathway. We investigated how observers trait anxiety modulates Mand P-pathway processing of clear and ambiguous threat cues. We performed fMRI on a large cohort (N=108) widely ranging in trait anxiety while they viewed fearful or neutral faces with averted or directed gaze. We adjusted luminance and color of the stimuli to selectively engage M- or P-pathway processing. We found that higher anxiety facilitated processing of averted-gaze fear projected to M-pathway, but impaired perception of direct-gaze fear projected to P-pathway. Increased right amygdala reactivity was associated with higher anxiety, only for averted-gaze fear presented to M-pathway. Conversely, increased left amygdala reactivity was associated with higher anxiety for P-biased, direct-gaze fear. This lateralization was more pronounced with higher anxiety. Our findings suggest that trait anxiety has differential effects on perception of clear and ambiguous facial threat cues via selective engagement of M and P pathways and lateralization of amygdala reactivity.",

We assembled a diverse panel of 696 Escherichia coli strains for which we obtained genomes and measured growth phenotypes in 214 conditions. We integrated variant effect predictors to derive gene-level probabilities of loss of function for every gene across strains. We combined these probabilities with information on conditional gene essentiality in the reference K-12 strain to predict the strains growth defects, providing significant predictions for up to 38% of tested conditions.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Sepsis affects nearly 1 million people in the United States per year, has a mortality rate of 28-50m% and requires more than $20 billion a year in hospital costs. Over a quarter century of research has not yielded a single reliable diagnostic test or a directed therapeutic agent for sepsis. Central to this insufficiency is the fact that sepsis remains a clinical/physiological diagnosis representing a multitude of molecularly heterogeneous pathological trajectories. Advances in computational capabilities offered by High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms call for an evolution in the investigation of sepsis to attempt to define the boundaries of traditional research (bench, clinical and computational) through the use of computational proxy models. We present a novel investigatory and analytical approach, derived from how HPC resources and simulation are used in the physical sciences, to identify the epistemic boundary conditions of the study of clinical sepsis via the use of a proxy agent-based model of systemic inflammation. Design: Current predictive models for sepsis use correlative methods are limited by patient heterogeneity and data sparseness. We address this issue by using an HPC version of a system-level validated agent-based model of sepsis, the Innate Immune Response ABM (IIRBM), as a proxy system in order to identify boundary conditions for the possible behavioral space for sepsis. We then apply advanced analysis derived from the study of Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) to identify novel means for characterizing system behavior and providing insight into the tractability of traditional investigatory methods. Results: The behavior space of the IIRABM was examined by simulating over 70 million sepsis patients for up to 90 days for the following parameters: cardio-respiratory-metabolic resilience; microbial invasiveness; microbial toxigenesis; and degree of nosocomial exposure. In addition to using established methods for describing parameter space, we developed two novel methods for characterizing the behavior of a RDS: Probabilistic Basins of Attraction (PBoA) and Stochastic Trajectory Analysis (STA). Computationally generated behavioral landscapes demonstrated attractor structures around stochastic regions of behavior that could be described in a complementary fashion through use of PBoA and STA. The stochasticity of the boundaries of the attractors highlights the challenge for correlative attempts to characterize and classify clinical sepsis. Conclusions: HPC simulations of models like the IIRABM can be used to generate approximations of the behavior space of sepsis to both establish \\\"boundaries of futility\\\" with respect to existing investigatory approaches and apply system engineering principles to investigate the general dynamic properties of sepsis to provide a pathway for developing control strategies. The issues that bedevil the study and treatment of sepsis, namely clinical data sparseness and inadequate experimental sampling of system behavior space, are fundamental to nearly all biomedical research, manifesting in the \\\"Crisis of Reproducibility\\\" at all levels. HPC-augmented simulation-based research offers an investigatory strategy more consistent with that seen in the physical sciences (which combine experiment, theory and simulation), and an opportunity to utilize the leading advances in HPC, namely deep machine learning and evolutionary computing, to form the basis of an iterative scientific process to meet the full promise of Precision Medicine (right drug, right patient, right time).",

    "abstract": "EmrE is a small multidrug resistance transporter found in E. coli that confers resistance to toxic polyaromatic cations due to its proton-coupled antiport of these substrates. Here we show that EmrE breaks the rules generally deemed essential for coupled antiport. NMR spectra reveal that EmrE can simultaneously bind and cotransport proton and drug. The functional consequence of this finding is an exceptionally promiscuous transporter: Not only can EmrE export diverse drug substrates, it can couple antiport of a drug to either one or two protons, performing both electrogenic and electroneutral transport of a single substrate. We present a new kinetically-driven free exchange model for EmrE antiport that is consistent with these results and recapitulates {Delta}pH-driven concentrative drug uptake. Our results suggest that EmrE sacrifices coupling efficiency for initial transport speed and multidrug specificity.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEEmrE facilitates E. coli multidrug resistance by coupling drug efflux to proton import. This antiport mechanism has been thought to occur via a pure exchange model which achieves coupled antiport by restricting when the single binding pocket can alternate access between opposite sides of the membrane. We test this model using NMR titrations and transport assays and find it cannot account for EmrE antiport activity. We propose a new kinetically-driven free exchange model of antiport with fewer restrictions that better accounts for the highly promiscuous nature of EmrE drug efflux. This model expands our understanding of coupled antiport and has implications for transporter design and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Diverse biological systems utilize gene-expression fluctuations ( noise) to drive lineage-commitment decisions1-5. However, once a commitment is made, noise becomes detrimental to reliable function6,7 and the mechanisms enabling post-commitment noise suppression are unclear. We used time-lapse imaging and mathematical modeling, and found that, after a noise-driven event, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strongly attenuated expression noise through a non-transcriptional negative-feedback circuit. Feedback is established by serial generation of RNAs from post-transcriptional splicing, creating a precursor-product relationship where proteins generated from spliced mRNAs auto-deplete their own precursor un-spliced mRNAs. Strikingly, precursor auto-depletion overcomes the theoretical limits on conventional noise suppression--minimizing noise far better than transcriptional auto-repression--and dramatically stabilizes commitment to the active-replication state. This auto-depletion feedback motif may efficiently suppress noise in other systems ranging from detained introns to non-sense mediated decay.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions between male and female heterogamety are common in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Theoretical studies of these transitions have found that, when all genotypes are equally fit, continuous paths of intermediate equilibria link the two sex chromosome systems. This observation has led to a belief that neutral evolution along these paths can drive transitions, and that arbitrarily small fitness differences among sex chromosome genotypes can determine the system to which evolution leads. Here, we study stochastic evolutionary dynamics along these equilibrium paths. We find non-neutrality, both in transitions retaining the ancestral pair of sex chromosomes and in those creating a new pair. In fact, substitution rates are strongly biased in favor of dominant sex determining chromosomes, which fix with higher probabilities than mutations of no effect. Using diffusion approximations, we show that this non-neutrality is a result of  drift-induced selection operating at every point along the equilibrium paths: stochastic jumps off the paths return, on average, with a directional bias in favor of the dominant segregating sex chromosome. Our results offer novel explanations for the ubiquity of transitions between male and female heterogamety and the preponderance of dominant major sex determining genes.",

    "abstract": "Founder populations are ideally suited for studies on the clinical effects of alleles that are rare in general populations but occur at higher frequencies in these isolated populations. Whole genome sequencing in 98 South Dakota Hutterites, a founder population of European descent, and subsequent imputation to the Hutterite pedigree revealed 660,238 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 98.9% non-coding) that are rare (<1%) or absent in European populations, but occur at frequencies greater than 1% in the Hutterites. We examined the effects of these rare in European variants on plasma levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) in 828 Hutterites and applied a Bayesian hierarchical framework to prioritize potentially causal variants based on functional annotations. We identified two novel non-coding rare variants associated with LDL-C (rs17242388 in LDLR) and HDL-C (rs189679427 between GOT2 and APOOP5), and replicated previous associations of a splice variant in APOC3 (rs138326449) with TG and HDL-C. All three variants are at well-replicated loci in genome wide association study (GWAS) but are independent from and have larger effect sizes than the known common variation in these regions. We also identified variants at two novel loci (rs191020975 in EPHA6 and chr1:224811120 in CNIH3) at suggestive levels of significance with LDL-C. Candidate expression quantitative loci (eQTL) analyses in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in the Hutterites suggest that these rare non-coding variants are likely to mediate their effects on lipid traits by regulating gene expression. Overall, we provide insights into the mechanisms regulating lipid traits and potentially new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Chitin utilization by the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae is required for its persistence and evolution via horizontal gene transfer in the marine environment. Genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of the chitin disaccharide chitobiose are encoded by the chb operon. The orphan sensor kinase ChiS is critical for regulation of this locus, however, the mechanisms downstream of ChiS activation that result in expression of the chb operon are poorly understood. Using an unbiased transposon mutant screen, we uncover that the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA is a regulator of the chb operon. SlmA has not previously been implicated in gene regulation. Also, SlmA is a member of the TetR family of proteins, which are generally transcriptional repressors. In vitro, we find that SlmA binds directly to the chb operon promoter, and in vivo, we show that this interaction is, surprisingly, required for transcriptional activation of this locus and for chitobiose utilization. Using point mutations that disrupt distinct functions of SlmA, we find that DNA-binding, but not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for transcriptional activation. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcriptional regulator in V. cholerae in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae is a natural resident of the aquatic environment and causes disease when ingested in the form of contaminated food or drinking water. In the aquatic environment, the shells of marine zooplankton, which are primarily composed of chitin, serve as an important food source for this pathogen. The genes required for the utilization of chitin are tightly regulated in V. cholerae, however, the exact mechanism underlying this regulation is currently unclear. Here, we uncover that a protein involved in regulating cell division is also important for regulating the genes involved in chitin utilization. This is a newly identified property for this cell division protein and the significance of a common regulator for these two disparate activities remains to be understood.",

    "abstract": "In many social situations, we make a snap judgment about crowds of people relying on their overall mood (termed \\\"crowd emotion\\\"). Although reading crowd emotion is critical for interpersonal dynamics, the sociocultural aspects of this process have not been explored. The current study examined how culture modulates the processing of crowd emotion in Korean and American observers. Korean and American participants were briefly presented with two groups of faces that were individually varying in emotional expressions and asked to choose which group between the two they would rather avoid. We found that Korean participants were more accurate than American participants overall, in line with the framework on cultural viewpoints: Holistic versus analytic processing in East Asians versus Westerners. Moreover, we found a speed advantage for other-race crowds in both cultural groups. Finally, we found different hemispheric lateralization patterns: American participants were more accurate for angry crowds presented in the left visual field and happy crowds presented in the right visual field, replicating previous studies, whereas Korean participants did not show an interaction between emotional valence and visual field. This work suggests that culture plays a role in modulating our crowd emotion perception of groups of faces and responses to them.",
