    "abstract": "Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between multiple genes, is an important genetic component underlying phenotypic variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to model and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants. However, because of the large combinatorial search space of interactions, most epistasis mapping methods face enormous computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical power due to multiple test correction. Here, we present a novel, alternative strategy for mapping epistasis: instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic effects -- the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing marginal epistatic effects, we can identify candidate variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact, thus potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with standard epistatic mapping procedures. Our method is based on a variance component model, and relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. We refer to our method as the \\\"MArginal ePIstasis Test\\\", or MAPIT. With simulations, we show how MAPIT can be used to estimate and test marginal epistatic effects, produce calibrated test statistics under the null, and facilitate the detection of pairwise epistatic interactions. We further illustrate the benefits of MAPIT in a QTL mapping study by analyzing the gene expression data of over 400 individuals from the GEUVADIS consortium.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEpistasis is an important genetic component that underlies phenotypic variation and is also a key mechanism that accounts for missing heritability. Identifying epistatic interactions in genetic association studies can help us better understand the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. However, the ability to identify epistatic interactions in practice faces important statistical and computational challenges. Standard statistical methods scan through all-pairs (or all high-orders) of interactions, and the large number of interaction combinations results in slow computation time and low statistical power. We propose an alternative mapping strategy and a new variance component method for identifying epistasis. Our method examines one variant at a time, and estimates and tests its marginal epistatic effect -- the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing for marginal epistatic effects, we can identify variants that are involved in epistasis without the need of explicitly searching for interactions. Our method also relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient and robust parameter inference, and accurate p-value computation. We illustrate the benefits of our method using simulations and real data applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have allowed for greater investigation into microbial regulation of mercury toxicity in the environment. In wetlands in particular, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence methylmercury (MeHg) production both through chemical interactions and through substrate effects on microbiomes. We conducted microcosm experiments in two disparate wetland environments (oligotrophic unvegetated and high-C vegetated sediments) to examine the impacts of plant leachate and inorganic mercury loadings (20 mg/L HgCl2) on microbiomes, DOM cycling, and MeHg production in the St. Louis River Estuary. Our research reveals the greater relative capacity for mercury methylation in vegetated over unvegetated sediments. Further, our work shows how mercury cycling in oligotrophic unvegetated sediments may be susceptible to DOM inputs in the St. Louis River Estuary: microcosms receiving leachate produced substantially more MeHg than unamended microcosms. We also demonstrate (1) changes in microbiome structure towards Clostridia, (2) metagenomic shifts toward fermentation, and (3) degradation of complex DOM; all of which coincide with elevated net MeHg production in unvegetated microcosms receiving leachate. Finally, we examine microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as known potential methylators and identify important organisms for future research in the Great Lakes region. Together, our work shows the influence of wetland vegetation in controlling MeHg production in the Great Lakes region and provides evidence that this may be due to both enhanced microbial activity as well as differences in microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Molecular motors are thought to generate force and directional motion via nonequilibrium switching between energy surfaces. Because all enzymes can undergo such switching, we hypothesized that the ability to generate rotary motion and torque is not unique to highly adapted biological motor proteins, but is instead a common feature of enzymes. We used molecular dynamics simulations to compute energy surfaces for hundreds of torsions in three enzymes, adenosine kinase, protein kinase A, and HIV-1 protease, and used these energy surfaces within a kinetic model that accounts for intersurface switching and intrasurface probability flows. When substrate is out of equilibrium with product, we find computed torsion rotation rates up ~140 cycle s-1, with stall torques up to ~2 kcal mol-1 cycle-1, and power outputs up to ~50 kcal mol-1 s-1. We argue that these enzymes are instances of a general phenomenon of directional probability flows on asymmetric energy surfaces for systems out of equilibrium. Thus, we conjecture that cyclic probability fluxes, corresponding to rotations of torsions and higher-order collective variables, exist in any chiral molecule driven between states in a non-equilibrium manner; we call this the Asymmetry-Directionality conjecture. This is expected to apply as well to synthetic chiral molecules switched in a nonequilibrium manner between energy surfaces by light, redox chemistry, or catalysis.",

Synthesizing recent developments in the network ecology literature, we point to several potential solutions to these issues: integrating network metrics and their terminology across sub-disciplines; benchmarking new network algorithms and models to increase mechanistic understanding; and improving tools for sharing ecological network research, in particular \\\"model\\\" data provenance, to increase the reproducibility of network models and analyses.

    "abstract": "Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is an important cause of quality loss in many cereal crops and is particularly prevalent and damaging in wheat. Resistance to PHS is therefore a valuable target trait in many breeding programmes. The Phs-A1 locus on wheat chromosome arm 4AL has been consistently shown to account for a significant proportion of natural variation to PHS in diverse mapping populations. However the deployment of sprouting resistance is confounded by the fact that different candidate genes, including the tandem duplicated Plasma Membrane 19 (PM19) genes and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (TaMKK3-A) gene, have been proposed to underlie Phs-A1. To further define the Phs-A1 locus, we constructed a physical map across this interval in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat. We established close proximity of the proposed candidate genes which are located within a 1.2 Mb interval. An association analysis of diverse germplasm used in previous genetic mapping studies suggests that TaMKK3-A, and not PM19, is the major gene underlying the Phs-A1 effect in European, North American, Australian and Asian germplasm. We identified the non-dormant TaMKK3-A allele at low frequencies within the A-genome diploid progenitor Triticum urartu genepool, and show an increase in the allele frequency in modern varieties. In UK varieties, the frequency of the dormant TaMKK3-A allele was significantly higher in bread-making quality varieties compared to feed and biscuit-making cultivars. Analysis of exome capture data from 58 diverse hexaploid wheat accessions identified fourteen haplotypes across the extended Phs-A1 locus and four haplotypes for TaMKK3-A. Analysis of these haplotypes in a collection of UK and Australian cultivars revealed distinct major dormant and non-dormant Phs-A1 haplotypes in each country, which were either rare or absent in the opposing germplasm set. The diagnostic markers and haplotype information reported in the study will help inform the choice of germplasm and breeding strategies for the deployment of Phs-A1 resistance into breeding germplasm.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression patterns during development are orchestrated in part by thousands of distant-acting transcriptional enhancers. However, identifying enhancers that are essential for expression of their target genes has proven challenging. Genetic perturbation of individual enhancers in some cases results in profound molecular and developmental phenotypes, but in mild or no phenotypes in others. Topological maps of long-range regulatory interactions may provide the means to identify enhancers critical for developmental gene expression. Here, we leveraged chromatin topology to characterize and disrupt the major promoter-enhancer interaction for Pitx1, which is essential for hindlimb development. We found that Pitx1 primarily interacts with a single distal enhancer in the hindlimb. Using genome editing, we deleted this enhancer in the mouse. Although loss of the enhancer completely disrupts the predominant topological interaction in the Pitx1 locus, Pitx1 expression in the hindlimb is only reduced by ~14%, with no apparent changes in spatial distribution or evidence of regulatory compensation. Pitx1 enhancer null mice did not exhibit any of the characteristic morphological defects of the Pitx1-/- mutant. Our results indicate that Pitx1 expression is robust to the loss of its primary enhancer interaction, suggesting disruptions of regulatory topology at essential developmental genes may have mild phenotypic effects.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons and Parkinsons Diseases (HD and PD) are neurodegenerative disorders that share some pathological features but are disparate in others. For example, while both diseases are marked by aberrant protein aggregation in the brain, the specific proteins that aggregate and types of neurons affected differ. A better understanding of the molecular similarities and differences between these two diseases may lead to a more complete mechanistic picture of both the individual diseases and the neurodegenerative process in general. We sought to characterize the common transcriptional signature of HD and PD as well as genes uniquely implicated in each of these diseases using mRNA-Seq data from post mortem human brains in comparison to neuropathologically normal controls. The enriched biological pathways implicated by HD differentially expressed genes show remarkable consistency with those for PD differentially expressed genes and implicate the common biological processes of neuroinflammation, apoptosis, transcriptional dysregulation, and neuron-associated functions. Comparison of the differentially expressed (DE) genes highlights a set of consistently altered genes that span both diseases. In particular, processes involving nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) and transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are the most prominent among the genes common to HD and PD. When the combined HD and PD data are compared to controls, relatively few additional biological processes emerge as significantly enriched suggesting that most pathways are independently seen within each disorder. Despite showing comparable numbers of DE genes, DE genes unique to HD are enriched in far more coherent biological processes than the DE genes unique to PD, suggesting that PD may represent a more heterogeneous disorder.",

The homeostasis control of auxin is regulated also by the activity of peptide hormones (PHs), acting both as short and long distant ligands. In this work, we investigated the role of CTG134, a peach gene encoding a GOLVEN-like PH isolated in mesocarp at the onset of ripening.\\n\\nIn peach fruit, CTG134 was expressed during the climacteric transition and its mRNA level was induced by auxin and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatments, whereas it was minimally affected by ethylene. To better elucidate its function, CTG134 was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and tobacco, which showed abnormal root hair growth, similar to wild-type plants treated with a synthetic form of the peptide. Molecular surveys demonstrated an impaired hormonal crosstalk, resulting in a re-modulated expression of a set of genes involved in both ethylene and auxin domains. In addition, the promoter of pCTG134 fused with GUS reporter highlighted gene activity in plant organs in which the auxin-ethylene interplay is known to occur. These data support the role of pCTG134 as mediator in an auxin-ethylene regulatory circuit.\\n\\nHighlightThe role of the peach RGF/GLV peptide during root hair formation in Arabidopsis and tobacco supports its involvement in a cross-hormonal auxin-ethylene regulatory circuit.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dual roles of demographic and selective processes in the buildup of population divergence is one of the most challenging tasks in evolutionary biology. In the Northern hemisphere in particular, species genetic makeup has been largely influenced by severe climatic oscillations of the Quaternary Period. Here, we investigated the demographic history of Atlantic Salmon across the entire species range using 2035 anadromous individuals from 77 sampling sites from North America and Eurasia genotyped at 4,656 SNPs. By combining results from admixture graphs, geogenetic maps and an approximate Bayesian computation framework, we validate previous hypotheses pertaining to secondary contact between European and Northern American populations, but also demonstrate that European populations from different glacial refugia have been exchanging alleles in contemporary times. We further identify the major sources of admixture from the southern range of North America to more northern populations along with a strong signal of secondary gene flow between genetic regional groups. We hypothesize that these patterns reflects the spatial redistribution of ancestral variation across the entire American range. Results also point to a role for linked selection in the form of background selection and or positive hitchhiking. Altogether, differential introgression and linked selective effects likely played an underappreciated role in shaping the genomic landscape of species in the Northern hemisphere Therefore we conclude that such heterogeneity among loci should be systematically integrated into demographic inferences of the divergence process, even between incompletely reproductively isolated populations.",

Previously, we reported that the eIF2 kinases Heme Regulator Inhibitor (HRI) and Protein Kinase R (PKR) control distinct activities of diverse bacterial pathogens. Specifically for Listeria monocytogenes, it was shown that in HRI-deficient cells there was a reduction in the translocation of the pathogen to the cytosolic compartment as well as reduced loading of pathogen-derived antigens on MHC-1 complexes. Here we show that Hri -/- mice, as well as wild-type mice treated with a HRI inhibitor, are more susceptible to listeriosis. In the first few hours of L. monocytogenes infection, Hri -/- mice supported greater pathogen proliferation in the liver compared to that observed in Hri +/+ mice. This greater susceptibility of Hri -/- mice was not due to deficits in immune cell development as proportions and numbers of innate and adaptive cell compartments were largely normal and these mice could mount potent antibody responses to a model T cell-dependent antigen. Using in vitro cellular infection assays, we show that the rate of pathogen efflux from infected Hri -/- macrophages and fibroblasts is significantly higher than that observed in infected Hri +/+ cells. In contrast to the stark differences between Hri +/+ and Hri -/- cells in the infection dynamics of virulent L. monocytogenes, HRI was entirely dispensable for killing non-virulent strains of L. monocytogenes. These results suggest that in wild-type cells, HRI helps ensure the cellular confinement of virulent L. monocytogenes and loading of cytosolic-derived antigens on MHC-1 complexes that limit pathogen spreading and activating innate immune responses, respectively.",

Here, we report that curaxin, a small molecule anticancer drug candidate, which destabilizes nucleosomes via disruption of histone/DNA interactions, can induce TRAIN independently of the p53 status of a cell. Furthermore, curaxin inhibits oncogene-induced transformation in an interferon-dependent manner, suggesting that cancer prevention by curaxin, previously attributed to its p53-activating and NF-kappaB-inhibiting activities, may also involve the induction of the interferon response to epigenetic derepression of the cellular \\\"repeatome.\\\" Moreover, we observed that another type of drugs decondensing chromatin, histone deacetylase inhibitor, also induces TRAIN.

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which the sensory environment instructs metabolic homeostasis remains poorly understood. In this report, we show that oxygen, a potent environmental signal, is an important regulator of whole body lipid metabolism. C. elegans oxygen-sensing neurons reciprocally regulate peripheral lipid metabolism under normoxia in the following way: under high oxygen and food absence, URX sensory neurons are activated, and stimulate fat loss in the intestine, the major metabolic organ for C. elegans. Under lower oxygen conditions or when food is present, the BAG sensory neurons respond by repressing the resting properties of the URX neurons. A genetic screen to identify modulators of this effect led to the identification of a BAG-neuron-specific neuropeptide called FLP-17, whose cognate receptor EGL-6 functions in URX neurons. Thus, BAG sensory neurons counterbalance the metabolic effect of tonically active URX neurons via neuropeptide communication. The combined regulatory actions of these neurons serve to precisely tune the rate and extent of fat loss, to the availability of food and oxygen.",

    "abstract": "Bone development, maintenance, and regeneration are remarkably sensitive to mechanical cues. Consequently, mechanical stimulation has long been sought as a putative target to promote endogenous healing after fracture. Given the transient nature of bone repair, tissue-level mechanical cues evolve rapidly over time after injury and are challenging to measure non-invasively. The objective of this work was to develop and characterize an implantable strain sensor for non-invasive monitoring of axial strain across a rodent femoral defect during functional activity. Herein, we present the design, characterization, and in vivo demonstration of the devices capabilities for quantitatively interrogating physiological dynamic strains during bone regeneration. Ex vivo experimental characterization of the device showed that it exceeded the technical requirements for sensitivity, signal resolution, and electromechanical stability. The digital telemetry minimized power consumption, enabling long-term intermittent data collection. Devices were implanted in a rat 6 mm femoral segmental defect model and after three days, data were acquired wirelessly during ambulation and synchronized to corresponding radiographic videos, validating the ability of the sensor to non-invasively measure strain in real-time. Lastly, in vivo strain measurements were utilized in a finite element model to estimate the strain distribution within the defect region. Together, these data indicate the sensor is a promising technology to quantify local tissue mechanics in a specimen specific manner, facilitating more detailed investigations into the role of the mechanical environment in dynamic skeletal healing and remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis of renewing tissues requires balanced proliferation, differentiation and movement. This is particullary important in the intestinal epithelium where lineage tracing suggests that stochastic differentiation choices are intricately coupled to position. To determine how position is achieved we followed proliferating cells in intestinal organoids and discovered that behaviour of mitotic sisters predicted long-term positioning. Normally, 70% of sisters remain neighbours while 30% lose contact separating after cytokinesis. Postmitotic placements predict differences in positions of sisters later: adjacent sisters reach similar positions; one separating sister remains close to its birthplace, the other moves upward. Computationally modelling crypt dynamics confirmed post-mitotic separation as a mechanism for placement of sisters into different niches. Separation depends on interkinetic nuclear migration, cell size, and asymmetric tethering by a basal process. These processes are altered when Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) is mutant and separation is lost. We conclude that post-mitotic placement enables stochastic niche exit and when defective, supports the clonal expansion of Apc mutant cells.",

    "abstract": "The stochastic simulation algorithm commonly known as Gillespies algorithm (originally derived for modelling well-mixed systems of chemical reactions) is now used ubiquitously in the modelling of biological processes in which stochastic effects play an important role. In well mixed scenarios at the sub-cellular level it is often reasonable to assume that times between successive reaction/interaction events are exponentially distributed and can be appropriately modelled as a Markov process and hence simulated by the Gillespie algorithm. However, Gillespies algorithm is routinely applied to model biological systems for which it was never intended. In particular, processes in which cell proliferation is important (e.g. embryonic development, cancer formation) should not be simulated naively using the Gillespie algorithm since the history-dependent nature of the cell cycle breaks the Markov process. The variance in experimentally measured cell cycle times is far less than in an exponential cell cycle time distribution with the same mean.\\n\\nHere we suggest a method of modelling the cell cycle that restores the memoryless property to the system and is therefore consistent with simulation via the Gillespie algorithm. By breaking the cell cycle into a number of independent exponentially distributed stages we can restore the Markov property at the same time as more accurately approximating the appropriate cell cycle time distributions. The consequences of our revised mathematical model are explored analytically as far as possible. We demonstrate the importance of employing the correct cell cycle time distribution by recapitulating the results from two models incorporating cellular proliferation (one spatial and one non-spatial) and demonstrating that changing the cell cycle time distribution makes quantitative and qualitative differences to the outcome of the models. Our adaptation will allow modellers and experimentalists alike to appropriately represent cellular proliferation - vital to the accurate modelling of many biological processes - whilst still being able to take advantage of the power and efficiency of the popular Gillespie algorithm.",

    "abstract": "The phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding protein 14-3-3 is known to regulate actin, this function has been previously attributed to sequestration of phosphorylated cofilin. The deep branching eukaryote Giardia lamblia lacks cofilin and all other canonical actin-binding proteins (ABPs), and 14-3-3 was identified as an actin-associated protein in Giardia, yet its role in actin regulation was unknown. Gl14-3-3 depletion resulted in an overall disruption of actin organization characterized by ectopically distributed short actin filaments. Using phosphatase and kinase inhibitors, we demonstrated that actin phosphorylation correlated with destabilization of the actin network and increased complex formation with 14-3-3, while blocking actin phosphorylation stabilized actin filaments and attenuated complex formation. Giardia's sole Rho family GTPase, GlRac, modulates Gl14-3-3's association with actin, providing the first connection between GlRac and the actin cytoskeleton in Giardia. Giardia actin contains two putative 14-3-3 binding motifs, one of which (S330) is conserved in mammalian actin. Mutation of these sites reduced, but did not completely disrupt, the association with 14-3-3. Native gels and overlay assays indicate that intermediate proteins are required to support complex formation between 14-3-3 and actin. Overall, our results support a role for 14-3-3 as a negative regulator of actin filament formation.\\n\\nImportanceGiardia lacks canonical actin binding proteins. 14-3-3 was identified as an actin interactor but the significance of this interaction was unknown. Loss of 14-3-3 results in ectopic short actin filaments, indicating that 14-3-3 is an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in Giardia. Drug studies indicate that 14-3-3 complex formation is in part phospho-regulated. We demonstrate that complex formation is downstream of Giardias sole Rho family GTPase, GlRac, this result provides the first mechanistic connection between GlRac and actin in Giardia. Native gels and overlay assays indicate intermediate proteins are required to support the interaction between 14-3-3 and actin suggesting that 14-3-3 is regulating multiple actin complexes.

    "abstract": "Animals communicate using signals perceived via multiple sensory modalities but usually invest more heavily in one of type of signal. This pattern, observed by Darwin1 and many researchers since, led to development of the transfer hypothesis (see also transferal effect2 and tradeoff hypothesis3,4), which predicts a negative relationship between investment in different signaling modalities dictated by the relative costs and benefits of each. One factor that influences costs and benefits, and is central to the sensory drive hypothesis5 posed to account for signal evolution, is the suitability of the environment for different types of signals. Movement into a dark habitat, for example, should favor investment in acoustic over visual signals. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to analyze the joint effect of transfer and sensory drive on plumage and song variation in 52 species of a large radiation of passerine birds, the New World warblers (Parulidae), and to estimate temporal patterns in the accumulation of differences in visual and vocal signals and habitat along the evolutionary history of this lineage. We found evidence for the predicted negative correlations between a variety of song and plumage traits that vary with habitat type. Plumage contrast to background and chromatic diversity were both negatively related to syllable variety when vegetation structure was a covariate: birds with a greater variety of song syllables and less colorful plumages live in closed or darker habitats. Also as predicted, achromatic or brightness diversity was related to vegetation structure. In addition, disparity-through-time analyses showed that when one set of traits (i.e. songs or colors) diversified at a relatively high rate the other did not, as predicted by the transfer hypothesis. Our results show that sensory drive influences the transfer of investment between traits in different sensory modalities. This interaction between mechanisms shaping signals may be a major determinant in the evolution of animal communication.",

Large-scale removal of non-native trout from 35 montane lakes in California provided repeated experimental fisheries that allowed us to explore how environmental parameters affect the three potential contributors to overall selection: the fitness-trait correlation, trait variability, and fitness variability. Our results demonstrate that fishing rapidly altered the size structure of harvested populations, and that the magnitude of change was primarily driven by the fitness-trait correlation (net selectivity). Fishing-induced selection was repeatable overall but was also influenced by environmental (lake size and quality) and demographic (size structure) parameters. Decomposing fishing-induced selection into its key components can improve the management of stocks experiencing fishing-induced selection by identifying the drivers of selection and therefore the appropriate target for management.",

It is argued that the MinION may allow for portable and affordable de novo sequencing of even complex genomes in the near future, despite the currently error-prone nature of its reads. Through continuous updates to the MinION hardware and the development of new assembly pipelines, both sequencing accuracy and assembly quality have already risen rapidly. However, this fast pace of development has also lead to a lack of oversight in the expanding landscape of analysis tools, as performance evaluations are outdated quickly. Now that the MinION is approaching a state of maturity, a thorough comparative benchmarking effort of de novo assembly pipelines may be at place.",

    "abstract": "The Canaanites inhabited the Levant region during the Bronze Age and established a culture which became influential in the Near East and beyond. However, the Canaanites, unlike most other ancient Near Easterners of this period, left few surviving textual records and thus their origin and relationship to ancient and present-day populations remain unclear. In this study, we sequenced five whole-genomes from ~3,700-year-old individuals from the city of Sidon, a major Canaanite city-state on the Eastern Mediterranean coast. We also sequenced the genomes of 99 individuals from present-day Lebanon to catalogue modern Levantine genetic diversity. We find that a Bronze Age Canaanite-related ancestry was widespread in the region, shared among urban populations inhabiting the coast (Sidon) and inland populations (Jordan) who likely lived in farming societies or were pastoral nomads. This Canaanite-related ancestry derived from mixture between local Neolithic populations and eastern migrants genetically related to Chalcolithic Iranians. We estimate, using linkage-disequilibrium decay patterns, that admixture occurred 6,600-3,550 years ago, coinciding with massive population movements in the mid-Holocene triggered by aridification ~4,200 years ago. We show that present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite-related population, which therefore implies substantial genetic continuity in the Levant since at least the Bronze Age. In addition, we find Eurasian ancestry in the Lebanese not present in Bronze Age or earlier Levantines. We estimate this Eurasian ancestry arrived in the Levant around 3,750-2,170 years ago during a period of successive conquests by distant populations such as the Persians and Macedonians.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have evolved a variety of mechanisms to interact with host cells for their adaptive benefits, including subverting host immune responses and hijacking host DNA replication/transcription machineries [1-3]. Although interactions between viral and host proteins have been studied extensively, little is known about how the vial genome may interact with the host genome and how such interactions could affect the activities of both the virus and the host cell. Since the three-dimensional organization of a genome can have significant impact on genomic activities such as transcription and replication, we hypothesize that such structure-based regulation of genomic functions also applies to viral genomes depending on their association with host genomic regions and their spatial locations inside the nucleus. Here, we used Tethered Chromosome Conformation Capture (TCC) to investigate viral-host genome interactions between the adenovirus and human lung fibroblast cells. We found viral-host genome interactions were enriched in certain active chromatin regions and chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. The contacts by viral DNA seems to impact the structure and function of the host genome, leading to remodeling of the fibroblast epigenome. Our study represents the first comprehensive analysis of viral-host interactions at the genome structure level, revealing unexpectedly specific virus-host genome interactions. The non-random nature of such interactions indicates a deliberate but poorly understood mechanism for targeting of host DNA by foreign genomes.",

    "abstract": "Maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is increasingly recognized as the cause of an epidemic of microcephaly and other neurological anomalies in human fetuses. However, it remains unclear how ZIKV gains access to the highly vulnerable population of neural progenitors of the fetal central nervous system (CNS), and which cell types of the CNS may serve as viral reservoirs. To model viral interaction with cells of the fetal CNS in vitro, we investigated the tropism of ZIKV for different iPS-derived human cells, with a particular focus on microglia-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells. We show that ZIKV infected isogenic neural progenitors, astrocytes and microglia-like cells, but was only cytotoxic to neural progenitors. Infected glial cells propagated the virus and maintained viral load over time, leading to viral spread to susceptible cells. ZIKV-infected microglia, when co-cultured with pre-established neural spheroids, invaded the tissue and initiated neural infection. Since microglia derive from primitive macrophages originating in anatomical proximity to the maternal vasculature of the placenta, we propose that they may act in vivo as a viral reservoir for ZIKV and, owing to their natural ability to traverse the embryo, can establish infection of the fetal brain. Infection of immature neural stem cells by invading microglia may occur in the early stages of pregnancy, before vascular circulation is established. Our data are also consistent with the virus affecting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may allow infection of the brain at later stages.",

    "abstract": "Auditory selective attention is vital in natural soundscapes. But, it is unclear how attentional focus on the primary dimension of auditory representation - acoustic frequency - might modulate basic auditory functional topography during active listening. In contrast to visual selective attention, which is supported by motor-mediated optimization of input across saccades and pupil dilation, the primate auditory system has fewer means of differentially sampling the world. This makes spectrally-directed endogenous attention a particularly crucial aspect of auditory attention. Using a novel functional paradigm combined with quantitative MRI, we establish that human frequency-band-selective attention drives activation in both myeloarchitectonically-estimated auditory core, and across the majority of tonotopically-mapped non-primary auditory cortex. The attentionally-driven best-frequency maps show strong concordance with sensory-driven maps in the same subjects across much of the temporal plane, with poor concordance in non-auditory areas. There is significantly greater activation across most of auditory cortex when best frequency is attended, versus ignored. Moreover, the single frequency bands that evoke the least activation and the frequency bands that elicit the least activation when attention is directed to them also correspond closely. Finally, the results demonstrate that there is spatial correspondence between the degree of myelination and the strength of the tonotopic signal across a number of regions in auditory cortex. Strong frequency preferences across tonotopically-mapped auditory cortex spatially correlate with R1-estimated myeloarchitecture, indicating shared functional and anatomical organization that may underlie intrinsic auditory regionalization.\\n\\nSignificancePerception is an active process especially sensitive to attentional state. Listeners direct auditory attention to track a violins melody within an ensemble performance, or to follow a voice in a crowded cafe. Although diverse pathologies reduce quality of life by impacting such spectrally-directed auditory attention, its neurobiological bases are unclear. We demonstrate that human primary and non-primary auditory cortical activation is modulated by spectrally-directed attention in a manner that recapitulates its tonotopic sensory organization. Further, the graded activation profiles evoked by single frequency bands are correlated with attentionally-driven activation when these bands are presented in complex soundscapes. Finally, we observe a strong concordance in the degree of cortical myelination and the strength of tonotopic activation across several auditory cortical regions.",

Membrin is a ubiquitously important protein mediating ER-to-Golgi membrane fusion, and hence it is unclear how these mutations result in a disorder restricted to the nervous system. Here we use a multi-layered strategy to elucidate the consequences of Membrin mutations from protein to neuron. We show that the pathogenic mutations cause partial reductions in SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, these alterations were sufficient to profoundly impair dendritic growth in novel Drosophila models of GOSR2-PME. We also observed axonal trafficking abnormalities in this model, as well as synaptic malformations, trans-synaptic instability and hyperactive synaptic transmission. Our study highlights how dendritic growth is vulnerable even to subtle secretory pathway deficits, uncovers a previously uncharacterized role for Membrin in synaptic function, and provides a comprehensive explanatory basis for genotype-phenotype relationships in GOSR2-PME.",

    "abstract": "Natural environments convey information through multiple sensory modalities, all of which contribute to peoples percepts. Although it has been shown that visual or auditory content of scene categories can be decoded from brain activity, it remains unclear where and how humans integrate different sensory inputs and represent scene information beyond a specific sensory modality domain. To address this question, we investigated how categories of scene images and sounds are represented in several brain regions. A mixed gender group of healthy human subjects participated the present study, where their brain activity was measured with fMRI while viewing images or listening to sounds of different places. We found that both visual and auditory scene categories can be decoded not only from modality-specific areas, but also from several brain regions in the temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortex. Intriguingly, only in the prefrontal cortex, but not in any other regions, categories of scene images and sounds appear to be represented in similar activation patterns, suggesting that scene representations in the prefrontal cortex are modality-independent. Furthermore, the error patterns of neural decoders indicate that category-specific neural activity patterns in the middle and superior frontal gyri are tightly linked to categorization behavior. Our findings demonstrate that complex scene information is represented at an abstract level in the prefrontal cortex, regardless of the sensory modality of the stimulus.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceOur experience in daily life requires the integration of multiple sensory inputs such as images, sounds, or scents from the environment. Here, for the first time, we investigated where and how in the brain information about the natural environment from multiple senses is merged to form modality-independent representations of scene categories. We show direct decoding of scene categories across sensory modalities from patterns of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. We also conclusively tie these neural representations to human categorization behavior based on the errors from the neural decoder and behavior. Our findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex is a central hub for integrating sensory information and computing modality-independent representations of scene categories.",

    "abstract": "MSH2 is the core protein of MutS-homolog family involved in recognition and repair of the errors in the DNA. While other members of MutS-homolog family reportedly regulate mitochondrial stability, meiosis, and fertility, MSH2 is believed to participate mainly in mismatch repair. The search for polymorphism in MSH2 sequence in tomato accessions revealed both synonymous and nonsynonymous SNPs; however, SIFT algorithm predicted that none of the SNPs influenced MSH2 protein function. The silencing of MSH2 gene expression by RNAi led to phenotypic abnormalities in highly-silenced lines, particularly in the stamens with highly reduced pollen formation. MSH2 silencing exacerbated formation of UV-B induced thymine dimers and blocked light-induced repair of the dimers. The MSH2 silencing also affected the progression of male meiosis to a varying degree with either halt of meiosis at zygotene stage or formation of diploid tetrads. The immunostaining of male meiocytes with centromere localized CENPC (Centromere protein C) protein antibody showed the presence of 48 univalent along with 24 bivalent chromosomes suggesting abnormal tetraploid meiosis. The mitotic cells of root tips of silenced lines showed diploid nuclei but lacked intervening cell plates leading to cells with syncytial nuclei. Thus we speculate that tetraploid pollen mother cells may have arisen due to the fusion of syncytial nuclei before the onset of meiosis. It is likely that in addition to Mismatch repair (MMR), MSH2 may have an additional role in regulating ploidy stability.",

    "abstract": "Despite possessing related ancestral genomes, hexaploid wheat behaves as a diploid during meiosis. The wheat Ph1 locus promotes accurate synapsis and crossover of homologous chromosomes. Interspecific hybrids between wheat and wild relatives are exploited by breeders to introgress important traits from wild relatives into wheat, although in hybrids between hexaploid wheat and wild relatives, which possess only homoeologues, crossovers do not take place during meiosis at metaphase I. However, in hybrids between Ph1 deletion mutants and wild relatives, crossovers do take place. A single Ph1 deletion (ph1b) mutant has been exploited for the last 40 years for this activity. We show here that selection of chemical induced mutant lines possessing mutations in TaZIP4-B2 exhibit high levels of homoeologous crossovers when crossed with a wild relative. Exploitation of Tazip4-B2 mutants rather than mutants with whole Ph1 locus deletions may improve introgression of wild relative chromosome segments into wheat. Such mutant lines may be more stable over multiple generations, as multivalents causing accumulation of chromosome translocations are less frequent.\\n\\nKey messageExploiting the ZIP4 homologue within the wheat Ph1 locus has identified two wheat mutants through a non-GM route, which can be exploited as an alternative to the Chinese Spring ph1b mutant in wheat introgression strategies.",

Here, we describe the use of a reagentless mRNA fluorescent biosensor based upon the single stranded binding (SSB) protein. In this study, SSB showed similar binding properties to mRNA, to that of its native substrate, ssDNA. Furthermore, fluorescently labelled MDCC-SSB gave the same fluorescence response with both ssDNA and ssRNA, in a concentration dependent manner. When directly compared to RT-qPCR, we found the biosensor to be more reproducible with no product lost through purification.

Quantitative modeling of repaired DNA in time series after Cas9 activation reveals a relatively slow repair rate (~6h). Furthermore, the double strand break is predominantly repaired in an error-prone fashion (at least 70%). Both classical and microhomology-mediated end-joining pathways are active and contribute to the repair in a stochastic manner. However, the balance between these two pathways changes over time and can be altered by chemical inhibition of DNAPKcs or additional ionizing radiation.

    "abstract": "Quantifying the effect of vital resources on transcription and translation helps to understand the degree to which the concentration of each resource must be regulated for achieving homeostasis. Utilizing the synthetic transcription-translation (TX-TL) system, we study the impact of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) and magnesium (Mg2+), on gene expression. Recent observations of the counterintuitive phenomenon of suppression of gene expression at high NTP concentrations have led to the speculation that such suppression is due to the consumption of resources by transcription, hence leaving fewer resources for translation. In this work, we investigate an alternative hypothesis: direct suppression of the translation rate via stoichiometric mismatch in necessary reagents. We observe NTP-dependent suppression even in the early phase of gene expression, contradicting the resource limitation argument. To further decouple the contributions of transcription and translation, we performed gene expression experiments with purified mRNA. Simultaneously monitoring mRNA and protein abundances allowed us to extract a time-dependent translation rate. Measuring translation rates for different Mg2+ and NTP concentrations, we observe a complex resource dependence. We demonstrate that translation is the rate-limiting process that is directly inhibited by high NTP concentrations. Additional Mg2+ can partially reverse this inhibition. In several experiments, we observe two maxima of the translation rate viewed as a function of both Mg2+ and NTP concentration, which can be explained in terms of an NTP-independent effect on the ribosome complex and an NTP-Mg2+ titration effect. The non-trivial compensatory effects of abundance of different vital resources signals the presence of complex regulatory mechanisms to achieve optimal gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The current era of worsening hypercompetition in biomedical research has drawn attention to the possibility of decreasing marginal returns from research funding. Recent work has described decreasing marginal returns as a function of annual dollars granted to individual scientists. However, different fields of research incur varying cost structures. Therefore, we developed a Grant Support Index (GSI) that focuses on grant activity code, as opposed to field of study or cost. In a cohort of over 71,000 unique scientists funded by NIH between 1996 and 2014 we analyzed the association of grant support (as measured by annual GSI) with 3 bibliometric outcomes, maximum Relative Citation Ratio (which arguably reflects a scientists most influential work), median Relative Citation Ratio, and annual weighted Relative Citation Ratio (which is more dependent on publication counts). We found that for all 3 measures marginal returns decline as annual GSI increases. Thus, we confirm prior findings of decreasing marginal returns with higher levels of research funding support.",

    "abstract": "We report the case of a patient (MB, young female human subject) who systematically experiences confusion between perceived facial identities when electrically stimulated inside the lateral section of the right fusiform gyrus. In the presence of a face stimulus (an experimenter or a photograph), intracerebral electrical stimulation in this region generates a perceptual hallucination of an individual facial part integrated within the whole perceived face, i.e. facial palinopsia. In the presence of a distracting stimulus (visual scene or object picture), the patient also experiences an individual face percept superimposed on the non-face stimulus. The stimulation site evoking this category-selective transient palinopsia is localized in a region showing highly selective responses to faces both with functional magnetic resonance imaging (\\\"Fusiform Face Area\\\", \\\"FFA\\\") and intracerebral electrophysiological recordings during fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS). Importantly, the largest electrophysiological response to fast periodic changes of facial identity is also found at this location. Altogether, these observations suggest that a local face-selective region of the right lateral fusiform gyrus suffices to generate a vivid percept of an individual face, supporting the active role of this region in individual face representation.",
