    "abstract": "Humans prioritize different semantic qualities of a complex stimulus depending on their behavioral goals. These semantic features are encoded in distributed neural populations, yet it is unclear how attention might operate across these distributed representations. To address this, we presented participants with naturalistic video clips of animals behaving in their natural environments while the participants attended to either behavior or taxonomy. We used models of representational geometry to investigate how attentional allocation affects the distributed neural representation of animal behavior and taxonomy. Attending to animal behavior transiently increased the discriminability of distributed population codes for observed actions in anterior intraparietal, pericentral, and ventral temporal cortices. Attending to animal taxonomy while viewing the same stimuli increased the discriminability of distributed animal category representations in ventral temporal cortex. For both tasks, attention selectively enhanced the discriminability of response patterns along behaviorally relevant dimensions. These findings suggest that behavioral goals alter how the brain extracts semantic features from the visual world. Attention effectively disentangles population responses for downstream read-out by sculpting representational geometry in late-stage perceptual areas.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions facilitate local adaptation of beneficial mutations and modulate genetic polymorphism, but the extent of their effects within the genome is still insufficiently understood. The genome of Anopheles funestus, a malaria mosquito endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, contains an impressive number of paracentric polymorphic inversions, which are unevenly distributed among chromosomes and provide an excellent framework for investigating the genomic impacts of chromosomal rearrangements. Here we present results of a fine-scale analysis of genetic variation within the genome of two weakly differentiated populations of Anopheles funestus inhabiting contrasting moisture conditions in Cameroon. Using population genomic analyses, we found that genetic divergence between the two populations is centered on regions of the genome corresponding to three inversions, which are characterized by high values of FST, absolute sequence divergence and fixed differences. Importantly, in contrast to the 2L chromosome arm, which is collinear, nucleotide diversity is significantly reduced along the entire length of three autosome arms bearing multiple overlapping chromosomal rearrangements. These findings support the idea that interactions between reduced recombination and natural selection within inversions contribute to sculpt nucleotide polymorphism across chromosomes in An. funestus.",

Haplotype data provide an alternative method for detecting associations between variants in weak linkage disequilibrium with genotyped variants and a given trait of interest. A genome-wide haplotype association study for MDD was undertaken utilising a family-based population cohort, Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (n = 18 773), as a discovery cohort with UK Biobank used as a population-based cohort replication cohort (n = 25 035). Fine mapping of haplotype boundaries was used to account for overlapping haplotypes potentially tagging the same causal variant. Within the discovery cohort, two haplotypes exceeded genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) for an association with MDD. One of these haplotypes was nominally significant in the replication cohort (P < 0.05) and was located in 6q21, a region which has been previously associated with bipolar disorder, a psychiatric disorder that is phenotypically and genetically correlated with MDD. Several haplotypes with P < 10-7 in the discovery cohort were located within gene coding regions associated with diseases that are comorbid with MDD. Using such haplotypes to highlight regions for sequencing may lead to the identification of the underlying causal variants.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThere is considerable interest in comparing functional genomic data across species. One goal of such work is to provide an integrated understanding of genome and phenotype evolution. Most comparative functional genomic studies have relied on multiple pairwise comparisons between species, an approach that does not incorporate information about the evolutionary relationships among species. The statistical problems that arise from not considering these relationships can lead pairwise approaches to the wrong conclusions, and are a missed opportunity to learn about biology that can only be understood in an explicit phylogenetic context. Here we examine two recently published studies that compare gene expression across species with pairwise methods, and find reason to question the original conclusions of both. One study interpreted pairwise comparisons of gene expression as support for the ortholog conjecture, the hypothesis that orthologs tend to be more similar than paralogs. The other study interpreted pairwise comparisons of embryonic gene expression across distantly related animals as evidence for a distinct evolutionary process that gave rise to phyla. In each study, distinct patterns of pairwise similarity among species were originally interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary processes, but instead we find they reflect species relationships. These reanalyses concretely demonstrate the inadequacy of pairwise comparisons for analyzing functional genomic data across species. It will be critical to adopt phylogenetic comparative methods in future functional genomic work. Fortunately, phylogenetic comparative biology is also a rapidly advancing field with many methods that can be directly applied to functional genomic data.\\n\\nSignificanceComparisons of genome function between species are providing important insight into the evolutionary origins of diversity. Here we demonstrate that comparative functional genomics studies can come to the wrong conclusions if they do not take the relationships of species into account and instead rely on pairwise comparisons between species, as is common practice. We re-examined two previously published studies and found problems with pairwise comparisons that draw both their original conclusions into question. One study had found support for the ortholog conjecture and the other had concluded that the evolution of gene expression was different between animal phyla than within them. Our results demonstrate that to answer evolutionary questions about genome function, it is critical to consider evolutionary relationships.",

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a  molecular signature) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of  omics.

By adopting a system biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous  omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple  omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures.

    "abstract": "TRPV1 promotes cationic currents across cellular membranes in response to multiple stimuli such as increased temperature, binding of chemicals, low pH and voltage. The molecular underpinnings of TRPV1 gating, in particular the mechanism of temperature sensitivity, are still largely unknown. Here, we used molecular simulations and electrophysiology to shed light on the closed to open transition. Specifically, we found that gating of TRPV1 relies on the motion of an evolutionarily conserved amino acid (N676) in the middle of the S6 helix. On rotation, the side chain of this asparagine faces either the central pore or the S4-S5 linker. Only in the former case is the central pore hydrated and thus conductive. Interestingly, when N676 rotates toward the linker, we observe hydration of four so far unreported small nonpolar cavities. Based on these findings, we propose a model for TRPV1 gating involving the dynamic hydration of these four cavities. Free energy calculations indicate that this gating mechanisms is markedly temperature dependent favoring the open state at high temperature. On the basis of this model, which is able to rationalize a wealth of seemingly conflicting and/or unrelated experimental observations, we predicted the behavior of two single residue mutants, M572A and F580Y, the consequences of which we confirmed experimentally.",

For an unbiased quantification of sensory scenes we tracked natural communication behavior of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus rostratus in their Neotropical rainforest habitat with high spatio-temporal resolution over several days. In the context of courtship and aggression we observed large quantities of electrocommunication signals. Echo responses and acknowledgment signals clearly demonstrated the behavioral relevance of these signals. The known tuning properties of peripheral electrosensory neurons suggest, however, that they are barely activated by these obviously relevant signals. Frequencies of courtship signals are clearly mismatched with the frequency tuning of neuronal population activity. Our results emphasize the importance of quantifying sensory scenes derived from freely behaving animals in their natural habitats for understanding the evolution and function of neural systems.",

Historical records indicate that migrants from Persia brought Zoroastrianism to India, but there is debate over the timing of these migrations. Here we present novel genome-wide autosomal, Y-chromosome and mitochondrial data from Iranian and Indian Zoroastrians and neighbouring modern-day Indian and Iranian populations to conduct the first genome-wide genetic analysis in these groups. Using powerful haplotype-based techniques, we show that Zoroastrians in Iran and India show increased genetic homogeneity relative to other sampled groups in their respective countries, consistent with their current practices of endogamy. Despite this, we show that Indian Zoroastrians (Parsis) intermixed with local groups sometime after their arrival in India, dating this mixture to 690-1390 CE and providing strong evidence that the migrating group was largely comprised of Zoroastrian males. By exploiting the rich information in DNA from ancient human remains, we also highlight admixture in the ancestors of Iranian Zoroastrians dated to 570 BCE-746 CE, older than admixture seen in any other sampled Iranian group, consistent with a long-standing isolation of Zoroastrians from outside groups. Finally, we report genomic regions showing signatures of positive selection in present-day Zoroastrians that might correlate to the prevalence of particular diseases amongst these communities.",

Here we show using de novo genome sequencing, that colpodean ciliates have the meiotic genes required for sex and these genes are under functional constraint. Along with these genomic data, we argue that these ciliates are sexual given the cytological observations of both micronuclei and macronuclei within their cells, and the behavioral observations of brief fusions as if the cells were mating. The challenge that colpodean ciliates pose is therefore not to evolutionary theory, but to our ability to induce microbial eukaryotic sex in the laboratory.\\n\\nContact: dunthorn@rhrk.uni-kl.de",

In the Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris), a North American songbird, populations on the Atlantic coast and interior southern United States are known to be allopatric during the breeding season, but efforts to map connectivity with wintering ranges in Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean have been largely inconclusive. Using genomic and morphological data from natural history specimens and banded birds, we found evidence of three genetically differentiated populations with distinct wintering ranges and molt-migration phenologies. In addition to confirming that the Atlantic coast population remains allopatric throughout the annual cycle, we identified an unexpected migratory divide within the interior breeding range. Populations breeding in the Lower Mississippi River Valley winter on the Yucatan Peninsula, and are parapatric with other interior populations that winter in mainland Mexico and Central America. Across the interior breeding range, genetic ancestry is also associated with variation in wing length; suggesting that selective pressures may be promoting morphological divergence in populations with different migration strategies.",

Moreover, on public benchmarks, Opal is substantially more accurate than both alignment-based and alignment-free methods (e.g. on SimHC20.500, Opal achieves 95% F1-score while Kraken and CLARK achieve just 91% and 88%, respectively); this improvement is likely due to the fact that the latter methods cannot handle computationally-costly long-range dependencies, which our even-coverage, low-density fingerprints resolve. Notably, capturing these long-range dependencies drastically improves Opals ability to detect unknown species that share a genus or phylum with known bacteria. Additionally, the family of hash functions Opal uses can be generalized to other sequence analysis tasks that rely on k-mer based methods to encode long-range dependencies.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific reverse engineering of transcriptional networks has uncovered master regulators (MRs) of cellular networks in various cancers, yet the application of this method to neuropsychiatric disorders is largely unexplored. Here, using RNA-Seq data on postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and control subjects, we deconvolved the transcriptional network to identify MRs that mediate expression of a large body of target genes. Together with an independent RNA-Seq data on cultured cells derived from olfactory neuroepithelium, we identified TCF4, a leading SCZ risk locus implicated by genome-wide association studies, as one of the top candidate MRs that may be potentially dysregulated in SCZ. We validated the dysregulated TCF4-related transcriptional network through examining the transcription factor binding footprints inferred from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal ATAC-Seq data, as well as direct binding sites obtained from ChIP-seq data in SH-SY5Y cells. The predicted TCF4 transcriptional targets were enriched for genes showing transcriptomic changes upon knockdown of TCF4 in hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC) and glutamatergic neurons (Glut_N), based on observations from three separate cell lines. The altered TCF4 gene network perturbations in NPC, as compared to that in Glut_N, was more similar to the expression differences in the TCF4 gene network observed in the DLPFC of individuals with SCZ. Moreover, TCF4-associated gene expression changes in NPC were more enriched than Glut_N for pathways involved in neuronal activity, genome-wide significant SCZ risk genes, and SCZ-associated de novo mutations. Our results suggest that TCF4 may potentially serve as a MR of a gene network that confers susceptibility to SCZ at early stage of neurodevelopment, highlighting the importance of network dysregulation involving core genes and many hundreds of peripheral genes in conferring susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between proteins and DNA is a key driving force in a significant number of biological processes such as transcriptional regulation, repair, recombination, splicing, and DNA modification. The identification of DNA-binding sites and the specificity of target proteins in binding to these regions are two important steps in understanding the mechanisms of these biological activities. A number of high-throughput technologies have recently emerged that try to quantify the affinity between proteins and DNA motifs. Despite their success, these technologies have their own limitations and fall short in precise characterization of motifs, and as a result, require further downstream analysis to extract useful and interpretable information from a haystack of noisy and inaccurate data. Here we propose MotifMark, a new algorithm based on graph theory and machine learning, that can find binding sites on candidate probes and rank their specificity in regard to the underlying transcription factor. We developed a pipeline to analyze experimental data derived from compact universal protein binding microarrays and benchmarked it against two of the most accurate motif search methods. Our results indicate that MotifMark can be a viable alternative technique for prediction of motif from protein binding microarrays and possibly other related high-throughput techniques.",

    "abstract": "While RNA is often created from linear splicing during transcription, recent studies have found that non-canonical splicing sometimes occurs. Non-canonical splicing joins 3 and 5 and forms the socalled circular RNA. It is now believed that circular RNA plays important biological roles such as affecting susceptibility in some diseases. within these few years, several experimental methods have been developed to enrich circular RNA while degrade linear RNA. Although several useful software tools for circRNA detection have been developed as well, these tools may miss many circular RNA. Also, existing tools are slow for large data because those tools often depend on reads mapping. In this paper, we present a new computational approach, named CircMarker, based on k-mers rather than reads mapping for circular RNA detection. CircMarker takes advantage of transcriptome annotation files to create k-mer table for circular RNA detection. Empirical results show that CircMarker outperforms existing tools in circular RNA detection on accuracy and efficiency in many simulated and real datasets.

Nevertheless, studies of editorial board composition remain rare, especially those focusing on journals publishing research in the increasingly globalized fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Using metrics for quantifying the diversity of ecological communities, we quantified international representation on the 1985-2014 editorial boards of twenty-four environmental biology journals. Over the course of three decades there were 3831 unique scientists based in 70 countries that served as editors. The size of the editorial community increased over time - there were 420% more editors serving in 2014 than in 1985 - as did the number of countries in which editors were based. Nevertheless, editors based outside the  Global North (the group of economically developed countries with high per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that collectively concentrate most global wealth) were extremely rare. Furthermore, 67.06% of all editors were based in either the USA or UK. Consequently, Geographic Diversity - already low in 1985 - remained unchanged through 2014. We argue that this limited geographic diversity can detrimentally affect the creativity of scholarship published in journals, the progress and direction of research, the composition of the STEM workforce, and the development of science in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia (i.e., the  Global South).",

The preys body orientation relative to a predator at the onset of the escape response (initial orientation) could affect evasion outcome, because the turn angle and its duration before the initiation of escape locomotion would be smaller when the initial orientation is more away from the predator. We tested this hypothesis by recording the escape responses of juvenile red sea bream (Pagrus major) in response to the predatory scorpion fish (Sebastiscus marmoratus) using a high-speed video camera. Our results show that an increased initial orientation (i.e., more away from the predator) increases escape probability. Our results also indicate that an increase in the initial orientation decreases the turn angle and its duration. The flight initiation distance tends to be small when the initial orientation is away from the predator, suggesting that the prey might have a blind zone of sensory perception. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating initial orientation into both empirical and theoretical studies of the kinematics of predator-prey interactions.\\n\\nSummary statementOur predator-prey experiments reveal that the preys initial body orientation relative to a predator affects the preys turn angle and its duration, and consequently affects escape probability.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDDifferential expression analysis on the basis of RNA-Seq count data has become a standard tool in transcriptomics. Several studies have shown that prior normalization of the data is crucial for a reliable detection of transcriptional differences. Until now it is not clear whether and how the transcriptomic approach can be used for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics. The potential side effects that may result from direct application of transcriptomic tools to metatranscriptomic count data have not been studied so far.\\n\\nMETHODSWe propose a model for differential expression in metatranscriptomics that explicitly accounts for variations in the taxonomic composition of transcripts across different samples. As a main consequence the correct normalization of metatranscriptomic count data requires the taxonomic separation of the data into organism-specific bins. Then the taxon-specific scaling of organism profiles yields a valid normalization and allows to recombine the scaled profiles into a metatranscriptomic count matrix. This matrix can then be analyzed with statistical tools for transcriptomic count data. For taxon-specific scaling and recombination of scaled counts we provide a simple R script.\\n\\nRESULTSWhen applying transcriptomic tools for differential expression analysis directly to metatranscriptomic data the organism-independent (global) scaling of counts implies a high risk of falsely predicted functional differences. In simulation studies we show that incorrect normalization not only tends to loose significant differences but especially can produce a large number of false positives. In contrast, taxon-specific scaling can equalize the variation of relative library sizes from different organisms and therefore shows a reliable detection of significant differences in all simulations. On real metatranscriptomic data the results from taxon-specific and global scaling can largely differ. In our study, global scaling shows a high number of extra predictions which are not supported by single transcriptome analyses. Inspection of the scaling error suggests that these extra predictions may actually correspond to artifacts of an incorrect normalization.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSAs in transcriptomics, a proper normalization of count data is also essential for differential expression analysis in metatranscriptomics. Our model implies a taxon-specific scaling of counts for normalization of the data. The application of taxon-specific scaling consequently removes taxonomic composition variations from functional profiles and therefore effectively prevents the risk of false predictions due to incorrect normalization.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression data, such as those generated by next generation sequencing technologies (RNA-seq), are of an inherently relative nature: the total number of sequenced reads has no biological meaning. This issue is most often addressed with various normalization techniques which all face the same problem: once information about the total mRNA content of the origin cells is lost, it cannot be recovered by mere technical means. Additional knowledge, in the form of an unchanged reference, is necessary; however, this reference can usually only be estimated. Here we propose a novel method where sample normalization is unnecessary, but important insights can be obtained nevertheless. Instead of trying to recover absolute abundances, our method is entirely based on ratios, so normalization factors cancel by default. Although the differential expression of individual genes cannot be recovered this way, the ratios themselves can be differentially expressed (even when their constituents are not). Yet, most current analyses are blind to these cases, while our approach reveals them directly. Specifically, we show how the differential expression of gene ratios can be formalized by decomposing log-ratio variance (LRV) and deriving intuitive statistics from it. Although small LRVs have been used to detect proportional genes in gene expression data before, we focus here on the change in proportionality factors between groups of samples (e.g. tissue-specific proportionality). For this, we propose a statistic that is equivalent to the squared t-statistic of one-way ANOVA, but for gene ratios. In doing so, we show how precision weights can be incorporated to account for the peculiarities of count data, and, moreover, how a moderated statistic can be derived in the same way as the one following from a hierarchical model for individual genes. We also discuss approaches to deal with zero counts, deriving an expression of our statistic that is able to incorporate them. In providing a detailed analysis of the connections between the differential expression of genes and the differential proportionality of pairs, we facilitate a clear interpretation of new concepts. The proposed framework is applied to a data set from GTEx consisting of 98 samples from the cerebellum and cortex, with selected examples shown. A computationally efficient implementation of the approach in R has been released as an addendum to the propr package.1",

    "abstract": "In the mammary gland, vimentin intermediate filaments are expressed in stromal cells and in basal epithelial cell populations including gland-reconstituting mammary stem cells (MaSC), with largely undefined functions. Here, we studied how vimentin deficiency affects mouse mammary gland development. Our results demonstrate that in adult vimentin knockout mice (Vim-/-) mammary ductal outgrowth is delayed. The adult Vim-/- glands are characterised by dilated ducts, an imbalance in the proportion of basal to luminal mammary epithelial cells and a reduction in cells expressing Slug (Snai2), an established MaSC regulator. All of these features are indicative of reduced progenitor cell activity. Accordingly, isolated Vim-/- mammary epithelial cells display reduced capacity to form mammospheres, and altered organoid structure, compared to wt counterparts, when plated in a 3D matrix in vitro. Importantly, altered basal epithelial cell number translates into defects in Vim-/- mammary gland regeneration in vivo in cleared fat pad transplantation studies. Furthermore, we show that vimentin contributes to stem-like cell properties in triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, wherein vimentin depletion reduces tumorsphere formation and alters expression of breast cancer stem cell-associated surface markers. Together, our findings identify vimentin as a positive regulator of stemness in the developing mouse mammary gland and in breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "While the vast majority of genome size variation in plants is due to differences in repetitive sequence, we know little about how selection acts on repeat content in natural populations. Here we investigate parallel changes in intraspecific genome size and repeat content of domesticated maize (Zea mays) landraces and their wild relative teosinte across altitudinal gradients in Mesoamerica and South America. We combine genotyping, low coverage whole-genome sequence data, and flow cytometry to test for evidence of selection on genome size and individual repeat abundance. We find that population structure alone cannot explain the observed variation, implying that clinal patterns of genome size are maintained by natural selection. Our modeling additionally provides evidence of selection on individual heterochromatic knob repeats, likely due to their large individual contribution to genome size. To better understand the phenotypes driving selection on genome size, we conducted a growth chamber experiment using a population of highland teosinte exhibiting extensive variation in genome size. We find weak support for a positive correlation between genome size and cell size, but stronger support for a negative correlation between genome size and the rate of cell production. Reanalyzing published data of cell counts in maize shoot apical meristems, we then identify a negative correlation between cell production rate and flowering time. Together, our data suggest a model in which variation in genome size is driven by natural selection on flowering time across altitudinal clines, connecting intraspecific variation in repetitive sequence to important differences in adaptive phenotypes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenome size in plants can vary by orders of magnitude, but this variation has long been considered to be of little to no functional consequence. Studying three independent adaptations to high altitude in Zea mays, we find that genome size experiences parallel pressures from natural selection, causing a linear reduction in genome size with increasing altitude. Though reductions in repetitive content are responsible for the genome size change, we find that only those individual loci contributing most to the variation in genome size are individually targeted by selection. To identify the phenotype influenced by genome size, we study how variation in genome size within a single teosinte population impacts leaf growth and cell division. We find that genome size variation correlates negatively with the rate of cell division, suggesting that individuals with larger genomes require longer to complete a mitotic cycle. Finally, we reanalyze data from maize inbreds to show that faster cell division is correlated with earlier flowering, connecting observed variation in genome size to an important adaptive phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Under the influence of selection pressures imposed by natural environments, organisms maintain competitive fitness through underlying molecular evolution of individual genes across the genome. For molecular evolution, how multiple interdependent molecular constraints play a role in determination of fitness under different environmental conditions is largely unknown. Here, using Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS), we quantitated empirical fitness of [~]2000 single site mutants of Gentamicin-resistant gene (GmR). This enabled a systematic investigation of effects of different physical and chemical environments on the fitness landscape of the gene. Molecular constraints of the fitness landscapes seem to bear differential strengths in an environment dependent manner. Among them, conformity of the identified directionalities of the environmental selection pressures with known effects of the environments on protein folding proves that along with substrate binding, protein stability is the common strong constraint of the fitness landscape. Our study thus provides mechanistic insights into the molecular constraints that allow accessibility of mutational fates in environment dependent manner.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEnvironmental conditions play a central role in both organismal adaptations and underlying molecular evolution. Understanding of environmental effects on evolution of genotype is still lacking a depth of mechanistic insights needed to assist much needed ability to forecast mutational fates. Here, we address this issue by culminating high throughput mutational scanning using deep sequencing. This approach allowed comprehensive mechanistic investigation of environmental effects on molecular evolution. We monitored effects of various physical and chemical environments onto single site mutants of model antibiotic resistant gene. Alongside, to get mechanistic understanding, we identified multiple molecular constraints which contribute to various degrees in determining the resulting survivabilities of mutants. Across all tested environments, we find that along with substrate binding, protein stability stands out as the common strong constraints. Remarkable direct dependence of the environmental fitness effects on the type of environmental alteration of protein folding further proves that protein stability is the major constraint of the gene. So, our findings reveal that under the influence of environmental conditions, mutational fates are channeled by various degrees of strengths of underlying molecular constraints.",

    "abstract": "Identifying causal effects in non-experimental data is an enduring challenge. One proposed solution that recently gained popularity is the idea to use genes as instrumental variables (i.e. Mendelian Randomization - MR). However, this approach is problematic because many variables of interest are genetically correlated, which implies the possibility that many genes could affect both the exposure and the outcome directly or via unobserved confounding factors. Thus, pleiotropic effects of genes are themselves a source of bias in non-experimental data that would also undermine the ability of MR to correct for endogeneity bias from non-genetic sources. Here, we propose an alternative approach, GIV regression, that provides estimates for the effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of pleiotropy. As a valuable byproduct, GIV regression also provides accurate estimates of the chip heritability of the outcome variable. GIV regression uses polygenic scores (PGS) for the outcome of interest which can be constructed from genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. By splitting the GWAS sample for the outcome into non-overlapping subsamples, we obtain multiple indicators of the outcome PGS that can be used as instruments for each other, and, in combination with other methods such as sibling fixed effects, can address endogeneity bias from both pleiotropy and the environment. In two empirical applications, we demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable estimates of the chip heritability of educational attainment (EA) and show that standard regression and MR provide upwardly biased estimates of the effect of body height on EA.",

The sensitivity for detecting the presence of ctDNA and genomic changes in ctDNA is limited by its low concentration compared to cell-free DNA of non-tumour origin. We studied the feasibility for enrichment of ctDNA by size selection, in plasma samples collected before and during chemotherapy treatment in 13 patients with recurrent high-grade serous ovarian cancer. We evaluated the effects using targeted and whole genome sequencing. Selecting DNA fragments between 90-150 bp before analysis yielded enrichment of mutated DNA fraction of up to 11-fold. This allowed identification of adverse copy number alterations, including MYC amplification, otherwise not observed. Size selection allows detection of tumour alterations masked by non-tumour DNA in plasma and could help overcome sensitivity limitations of liquid biopsy for applications in early diagnosis, detection of minimal residual disease, and genomic profiling.",

Using genomic assembly and metagenomic read recruitment, we found major shifts in the community structure over small variations of depth, with most microbes showing a distribution limited to layers approximately 30 meters thick (stenobathic). Only some representatives of the SAR11 clade and the Sphingomonadaceae appeared to be eurybathic, spanning a greater range of depths. These results were confirmed by studying a single gene (rhodopsin) for which we also found narrow depth distributions. Our results highlight the importance of considering vertical distribution as a major element when analyzing the presence of marine clades and species or comparing the microbiome present at different locations.",

Signal motion centered at 90{degrees} had to be roughly twice as large as motion centered at 0{degrees} to be judged as equivalent. This distortion of acoustic space around the listener suggests that the perceived velocity of moving sound sources changes as a function of azimuth around the head.

    "abstract": "Plant-insect interaction system has been a widely studied model of the ecosystem. Attempts have long been made to understand the numerical behaviour of this counter system and make improvements in it from initial simple analogy based approach with predator-prey model to the recently developed mathematical interpretation of plant-insect interaction including concept of plant immune interventions Caughley and Lawton (1981). In our current work, we propose an improvement in the model, based on molecular interactions behind plant defense mechanism and its effect on the plant growth and insect herbivory. Motivated from an interaction network of plant biomolecules given by Louis and Shah (2014) and extending the model of Chattopadhyay, et al (2001), we propose here a mathematical model to show how plant insect interaction system is governed by the molecular components inside. Insect infestation mediated induction of Botrytis Induced Kinase-1 (BIK-1) protein causes inhibition of Phyto Alexin Deficient-4 (PAD4) protein. Lowered PAD4, being responsible for initiating plant defense mechanism, results in degraded plant immune potential and thus causes loss of plant quality. We adapt these interactions in our model to show how they influence the plant insect interaction system and also to reveal how silencing BIK-1 may aid in enhanced production of plant biomass by increasing plant immunity mediated by increase in PAD4 and associated antixenotic effects. We hypothesize the significance of BIK-1 inhibition which could result in the improvement of the plant quality. We explain the interaction system in BIK-1 inhibition using mathematical model. Further, we adopted the plethora of computational modeling and simulations techniques to identify the mechanisms of molecular inhibition.",

Examination of cross-locus correlations was used to test for evidence of subgroups by examining whether there was clustering of independent genetic variants associated with eleven other complex traits and disorders in people with depression. We found evidence of a subgroup within depression using age of natural menopause variants (P = 1.69 x 10-3) and this effect remained significant in females (P = 1.18 x 10-3), but not males (P = 0.186). However, no evidence for this subgroup (P > 0.05) was found in Generation Scotland, iPSYCH, a UK Biobank replication cohort or the GERA cohort.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of traits with complex genetic architecture is crucial for selecting superior candidates in animal and plant breeding and for guiding decisions in personalized medicine. Whole-genome prediction (WGP) has revolutionized these areas but has inherent limitations in incorporating intricate epistatic interactions. Downstream \\\"omics\\\" data are expected to integrate interactions within and between different biological strata and provide the opportunity to improve trait prediction. Yet, predicting traits from parents to progeny has not been addressed by a combination of \\\"omics\\\" data. Here, we evaluate several \\\"omics\\\" predictors -- genomic, transcriptomic and metabolic data -- measured on parent lines at early developmental stages, and demonstrate that the integration of transcriptomic with genomic data leads to higher success rates in the correct prediction of untested hybrid combinations in maize. Despite the high predictive ability of genomic data, transcriptomic data alone outperformed them and other predictors for the most complex heterotic trait, dry matter yield. An eQTL analysis revealed that transcriptomic data integrate genomic information from both, adjacent and distant sites relative to the expressed genes. Together, these findings suggest that downstream predictors capture physiological epistasis that is transmitted from parents to their hybrid offspring. We conclude that the use of downstream \\\"omics\\\" data in prediction can exploit important information beyond structural genomics for leveraging the efficiency of hybrid breeding.\\n\\nKey messageComplementing genomic data with other \\\"omics\\\" predictors can increase the probability of success for predicting the best hybrid combinations using complex agronomic traits.\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "Visual systems transduce, process and transmit light-dependent environmental cues. Computation of visual features depends on the types of photoreceptor neurons (PR) present, the organization of the eye and the wiring of the underlying neural circuit. Here, we describe the circuit architecture of the visual system of Drosophila larvae by mapping the synaptic wiring diagram and neurotransmitters. By contacting different targets, the two larval PR-subtypes create parallel circuits potentially underlying the computation of absolute light intensity and temporal light changes already within this first visual processing center. Locally processed visual information then signals via dedicated projection interneurons to higher brain areas including the lateral horn and mushroom body. The stratified structure of the LON suggests common organizational principles with the adult fly and vertebrate visual systems. The complete synaptic wiring diagram of the LON paves the way to understanding how circuits with reduced numerical complexity control wide ranges of behaviors.",

Despite its central role in preserving the fidelity of mitosis, the strength of the SAC varies widely between cell types. How the SAC is adapted to different cellular contexts remains largely unknown. Here we show that both cell size and cell fate impact SAC strength. While smaller cells have a stronger SAC, cells with a germline fate show increased SAC activity relative to their somatic counterparts across all cell sizes. We find that enhanced SAC activity in the germline blastomere P1 requires proper specification of cell fate downstream of the conserved PAR polarity proteins, supporting a model in which checkpoint factors are distributed asymmetrically during early germ cell divisions. Our results indicate that size scaling of SAC activity is modulated by cell fate and reveal a novel interaction between asymmetric cell division and the SAC.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an important approach to modelling causality in non-experimental settings. MR uses genetic instruments to test causal relationships between exposures and outcomes of interest. Individual genetic variants have small effects, and so, when used as instruments, render MR liable to weak instrument bias. Polygenic scores have the advantage of larger effects, but may be characterized by direct pleiotropy, which violates a central assumption of MR.\\n\\nWe developed the MR-DoC twin model by integrating MR with the Direction of Causation twin model. This model allows us to test pleiotropy directly. We considered the issue of parameter identification, and given identification, we conducted extensive power calculations. MR-DoC allows one to test causal hypotheses and to obtain unbiased estimates of the causal effect given pleiotropic instruments (polygenic scores), while controlling for genetic and environmental influences common to the outcome and exposure. Furthermore, MR-DoC in twins has appreciably greater statistical power than a standard MR analysis applied to singletons, if the unshared environmental effects on the exposure and the outcome are uncorrelated. Generally, power increases with: 1) decreasing residual exposure-outcome correlation, and 2) decreasing heritability of the exposure variable.\\n\\nMR-DoC allows one to employ strong instrumental variables (polygenic scores, possibly pleiotropic), guarding against weak instrument bias and increasing the power to detect causal effects. Our approach will enhance and extend MRs range of applications, and increase the value of the large cohorts collected at twin registries as they correctly detect causation and estimate effect sizes even in the presence of pleiotropy.",

Recently, a subset of FOXP3+ cells with low CD25 expression was found to be increased in peripheral blood from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, although its functional significance remains controversial. Here we find in comparisons with healthy donors that the frequency of FOXP3+ cells within CD127lowCD25low CD4+ T cells (here defined as CD25lowFOXP3+ T cells) is increased in patients affected by autoimmune disease of varying severity, from combined immunodeficiency with active autoimmunity, SLE to type 1 diabetes. We show that CD25lowFOXP3+ T cells share phenotypic features resembling conventional CD127lowCD25highFOXP3+ Tregs, including demethylation of the Treg-specific epigenetic control region in FOXP3 that is highly enriched in HELIOS+ cells, and lack of IL-2 production. As compared to conventional Tregs, more CD25lowFOXP3+HELIOS+ T cells are in cell cycle (33.0% vs 20.7% Ki-67+; P = 1.3 x 10-9) and express the late-stage inhibitory receptor PD-1 (67.2% vs 35.5%; P = 4.0 x 10-18), while having reduced expression of the early-stage inhibitory receptor CTLA-4, as well as other Treg markers, such as FOXP3 and CD15s. The number of CD25lowFOXP3+ T cells are highly correlated (P = 1.2 x 10-19) with the proportion of CD25highFOXP3+ T cells in cell cycle (Ki-67+). These findings suggest that CD25lowFOXP3+ T cells represent a subset of Tregs that are derived from CD25highFOXP3+ T cells, and are a peripheral marker of recent Treg expansion in response to an autoimmune reaction in tissues.\\n\\nHighlights- FOXP3+ compartment within CD127lowCD25low T cells is expanded in autoimmune patients.\\n\\n- Increased numbers of CD25lowFOXP3+ T cells are a circulating marker of autoimmunity.\\n\\n- CD25lowFOXP3+ HELIOS+ T cells are fully demethylated at the FOXP3 TSDR.\\n\\n- CD25lowFOXP3+ T cells could represent a terminal stage of regulatory T cells.",

Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Ki-67 in human hTERT-RPE1, WI-38, IMR90, hTERT-BJ cell lines and primary fibroblast cells slowed entry into S phase and coordinately downregulated genes related to DNA replication. Some gene expression changes were partially relieved in Ki-67-depleted hTERT-RPE1 cells by co-depletion of the Rb checkpoint protein, but more thorough suppression of the transcriptional and cell cycle defects was observed upon depletion of cell cycle inhibitor p21. Notably, induction of p21 upon depletion of Ki-67 was a consistent hallmark of cell types in which transcription and cell cycle distribution were sensitive to Ki-67; these responses were absent in cells that did not induce p21. Furthermore, upon Ki-67 depletion, a subset of inactive x (Xi) chromosomes in female hTERT-RPE1 cells displayed several features of compromised heterochromatin maintenance, including decreased H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 labeling. These chromatin alterations were limited to Xi chromosomes localized away from the nuclear lamina and were not observed in checkpoint-deficient 293T cells. Altogether, our results indicate that Ki-67 integrates normal S phase progression and Xi heterochromatin maintenance in p21 checkpoint-proficient human cells.",

Using a brain-wide dataset of 34 neuron types, we identified 420 genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with variability in one or more of 11 electrophysiological parameters. The majority of these correlations were consistent in an independent sample of 12 visual cortex cell types. Many associations reported here have the potential to provide new insights into how neurons generate functional diversity, and correlations of ion channel genes like Gabrd and Scn1a (Nav1.1) with resting potential and spiking frequency are consistent with known causal mechanisms. These results suggest that despite the complexity linking gene expression to electrophysiology, there are likely some general principles that govern how individual genes establish phenotypic diversity across very different cell types.",

These interactions are usually represented as large and complex networks, calling for the development of appropriated tools to exploit the functional information they contain. Random walk with restart is the state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach. It explores the network vicinity of gene/protein seeds to study their functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each others in the networks.\\n\\nIn the present study, we extended the random walk with restart algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. The walk can now explore different layers of physical and functional interactions between genes and proteins, such as protein-protein interactions and co-expression associations. In addition, the walk can also jump to a network containing different sets of edges and nodes, such as phenotype similarities between diseases.\\n\\nWe devised a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to evaluate the algorithms abilities to predict disease-associated genes. We demonstrate the increased performances of the multiplex-heterogeneous random walk with restart as compared to several random walks on monoplex or heterogeneous networks.

Particularly interesting is the duplication that took place in the common ancestor of the Drosophila subgenus and led to the subfunctionalization and high divergence of the Cid1 and Cid5 paralogs. Here, we describe another independent Cid duplication (Cid1 leading to Cid6) in the buzzatii cluster (repleta group) of the Drosophila subgenus. Moreover, we found that, in addition to the Cid1/Cid5 duplication, Cenp-C was also duplicated (Cenp-C1, Cenp-C2) in the common ancestor of the Drosophila subgenus. Analyses of expression and tests for positive selection indicate that both Cid5 and Cenp-C2 are male germline-biased and evolved adaptively, indicating subfunctionalization of the Cid and Cenp-C paralogs. Our findings further highlight the strong interdependence between CenH3 and Cenp-C, paving the way to new perspectives by which centromere function and evolution can be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) is a multisystem developmental disorder frequently associated with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of Nipped-B-like (NIPBL), the human homolog of Drosophila Nipped-B. NIPBL loads cohesin onto chromatin. Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion important for mitosis, but is also increasingly recognized as a regulator of gene expression. In CdLS patient cells and animal models, the presence of multiple gene expression changes with little or no sister chromatid cohesion defect suggests that disruption of gene regulation underlies this disorder. However, the effect of NIPBL haploinsufficiency on cohesin binding, and how this relates to the clinical presentation of CdLS, has not been fully investigated. Nipbl haploinsufficiency causes CdLS-like phenotype in mice. We examined genome-wide cohesin binding and its relationship to gene expression using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Nipbl +/- mice that recapitulate the CdLS phenotype. We found a global decrease in cohesin binding, including at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites and repeat regions. Cohesin-bound genes were found to be enriched for histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at their promoters; were disproportionately downregulated in Nipbl mutant MEFs; and displayed evidence of reduced promoter-enhancer interaction. The results suggest that gene activation is the primary cohesin function sensitive to Nipbl reduction. Over 50% of significantly dysregulated transcripts in mutant MEFs come from cohesin target genes, including genes involved in adipogenesis that have been implicated in contributing to the CdLS phenotype. Thus, decreased cohesin binding at the gene regions directly contributes to disease-specific expression changes. Taken together, our Nipbl haploinsufficiency model allows us to analyze the dosage effect of cohesin loading on CdLS development.",

As a result, several questions arise such as what is the functional form of and how variable is the topology of time-specific versus time-aggregated ecological networks? Furthermore, it is yet unknown to what extent the structure of time-aggregated networks is representative of the dynamics of the community. Here, we compared the topology of time-specific and time-aggregated networks by analyzing a set of intertidal networks containing more than 1,000 interactions, and assessed the spatiotemporal dynamics of their degree distributions. By fitting different distribution models, we found that the out-degree distributions of seasonal and time-aggregated networks were best described by an exponential model while the in-degree distributions were best described by a discrete generalized beta model. The degree distributions of the seasonal networks were highly temporally variable and are significantly different from those of time-aggregated networks. We observed that seasonal degree distributions converged toward time-aggregated network distributions after 1.5 years of sampling. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of ecological networks, which can show topological characteristics significantly different from those of time-aggregated networks.",

However, the neuronal phenotypes and circuits controlled by these neurons are unknown. We investigated the cellular identity of this CeA neuronal ensemble and found that most neurons expressed corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Using Crh-Cre transgenic rats combined with in vivo optogenetics, we tested the role of CeA CRF neurons and their projections in excessive alcohol self-administration during withdrawal. Rats were injected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP or AAV-DIO-eYFP and implanted with optical fibers over the CeA. Animals were then exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor to induce alcohol dependence. Inactivation of CeA CRF neurons decreased alcohol drinking in dependent rats to non-dependent levels and completely suppressed activation of the CeA neuronal ensemble (Fos+ neurons) during withdrawal. No effects were observed on water or saccharin self-administration. In a second experiment, CeA CRF neurons were infected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP and optical fibers were implanted into downstream projection regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral hypothalamus (LH), parasubthalamic nucleus (pSTN), substantia innominata (SI), and parabrachial nuclei (PBN). Optogenetic inactivation of CRF terminals in the BNST reduced alcohol drinking and withdrawal signs, whereas inactivation of all other projections had no effect. These results demonstrate that CeA CRF neurons and their projections to the BNST drive excessive alcohol drinking and withdrawal in dependent rats.",

Yet, how the UPR achieves and evaluates ER homeostatic readjustment is poorly understood. In a HeLa cell model we show that, upon a severe proteostatic insult that eclipses the ER chaperone BiP, the UPR transitions from acute full-gear activation to chronic submaximal activation, when BiP is in excess again. As such, the UPR-driven ER expansion is pro-survival, primarily via the UPR transducer ATF6. Simultaneous abrogation of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) leads to chronic full-gear UPR activation and further ER expansion, but the UPR transducers IRE1 and PERK turn pro-apoptotic. Pro-survival XBP1 mRNA processing by IRE1 is then trumped since unspliced XBP1 mRNA is depleted and IRE1s endonuclease activity is unleashed against other RNAs. Thus, the IRE1/XBP1 relay serves as a capacitor of ER expansion that heralds cell death if the expansion is deemed excessive.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are critical to anti-cancer immune responses, but their diverse phenotypes and functions remain poorly understood and challenging to study. We therefore developed a single-cell barcoding technology for deep characterization of TILs without the need for cell-sorting or culture. Our emulsion-based method captures full-length, natively paired B-cell and T-cell receptor (BCR and TCR) sequences from lymphocytes among millions of input cells. We validated the method with 3 million B-cells from healthy human blood and 350,000 B-cells from an HIV elite controller, before processing 400,000 cells from an unsorted dissociated ovarian adenocarcinoma and recovering paired BCRs and TCRs from over 11,000 TILs. We then extended the barcoding method to detect DNA-labeled antibodies, allowing ultra-high throughput, simultaneous protein detection and RNA sequencing from single cells.",
