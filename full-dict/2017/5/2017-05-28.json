    "abstract": "Continuing efforts from large international consortia have made genome-wide epigenomic and transcriptomic annotation data publicly available for a variety of cell and tissue types. However, synthesis of these datasets into effective summary metrics to characterize the functional non-coding genome remains a challenge. Here, we present GenoSkyline-Plus, an extension of our previous work through integration of an expanded set of epigenomic and transcriptomic annotations to produce high-resolution, single tissue annotations. After validating our annotations with a catalog of tissue-specific non-coding elements previously identified in the literature, we apply our method using data from 127 different cell and tissue types to present an atlas of heritability enrichment across 45 different GWAS traits. We show that broader organ system categories (e.g. immune system) increase statistical power in identifying biologically relevant tissue types for complex diseases while annotations of individual cell types (e.g. monocytes or B-cells) provide deeper insights into disease etiology. Additionally, we use our GenoSkyline-Plus annotations in an in-depth case study of late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD). Our analyses suggest a strong connection between LOAD heritability and genetic variants contained in regions of the genome functional in monocytes. Furthermore, we show that LOAD shares a similar localization of SNPs to monocyte-functional regions with Parkinsons disease. Overall, we demonstrate that integrated genome annotations at the single tissue level provide a valuable tool for understanding the etiology of complex human diseases. Our GenoSkyline-Plus annotations are freely available at http://genocanyon.med.yale.edu/GenoSkyline.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAfter years of community efforts, many experimental and computational approaches have been developed and applied for functional annotation of the human genome, yet proper annotation still remains challenging, especially in non-coding regions. As complex disease research rapidly advances, increasing evidence suggests that non-coding regulatory DNA elements may be the primary regions harboring risk variants in human complex diseases. In this paper, we introduce GenoSkyline-Plus, a principled annotation framework to identify tissue and cell type-specific functional regions in the human genome through integration of diverse high-throughput epigenomic and transcriptomic data. Through validation of known non-coding tissue-specific regulatory regions, enrichment analyses on 45 complex traits, and an in-depth case study of neurodegenerative diseases, we demonstrate the ability of GenoSkyline-Plus to accurately identify tissue-specific functionality in the human genome and provide unbiased, genome-wide insights into the genetic basis of human complex diseases.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) is vital in plant defense and development. Although biosynthesis of JA and activation of JA-responsive gene expression by the bioactive form JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile) have been well-studied, knowledge on JA metabolism is incomplete. In particular, the enzyme that hydroxylates JA to 12-OH-JA, an inactive form of JA that accumulates after wounding and pathogen attack, is unknown. Here, we report the identification of four paralogous 2-oxoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases in Arabidopsis thaliana as JA hydroxylases and show that they down-regulate JA-dependent responses. As they are induced by JA we named them JASMONATE-INDUCED OXYGENASEs (JOXs). Concurrent mutation of the four genes in a quadruple Arabidopsis mutant resulted in increased defense gene expression and increased resistance to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea and the caterpillar Mamestra brassicae. In addition, root and shoot growth of the plants was inhibited. Metabolite analysis of leaves showed that loss of function of the four JOX enzymes resulted in over-accumulation of JA and in reduced turnover of JA into 12-OH-JA. Transformation of the quadruple mutant with each JOX gene strongly reduced JA levels, demonstrating that all four JOXs inactivate JA in plants. The in vitro catalysis of 12-OH-JA from JA by recombinant enzyme could be confirmed for three JOXs. The identification of the enzymes responsible for hydroxylation of JA reveals a missing step in JA metabolism, which is important for the inactivation of the hormone and subsequent down-regulation of JA-dependent defenses.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn plants, the hormone jasmonic acid (JA) is synthesized in response to attack by pathogens and herbivores, leading to activation of defense responses. Rapidly following JA accumulation, the hormone is metabolized, presumably to prevent inhibitive effects of high JA levels on growth and development. The enzymes that directly inactivate JA were so far unknown. Here, we identify four jasmonate-induced oxygenases (JOXs) in Arabidopsis that hydroxylate jasmonic acid to form inactive 12-OH-JA. A mutant that no longer produces the four enzymes hyperaccumulates JA, exhibits reduced growth, and is highly resistant to attackers that are sensitive to JA-dependent defense. The JOX enzymes thus play an important role in determining the amplitude and duration of JA responses to balance the growth-defense tradeoff.",

    "abstract": "External male reproductive structures have received considerable attention as an early-acting cause of reproductive isolation (RI), because the morphology of these structures often evolves rapidly between populations. This presents the potential for mechanical incompatibilities with heterospecific female structures during mating and could thus prevent interbreeding between nascent species. Although such mechanical incompatibilities have received little empirical support as a common cause of RI, the potential for mismatch of reproductive structures to cause RI due to incompatible species-specific tactile cues has not been tested. We tested the importance of mechanical and tactile incompatibilities in RI between Enallagma anna and E. carunculatum, two damselfly species that diverged within the past ~250,000 years and currently hybridize in a sympatric region. We quantified 19 prezygotic and postzygotic RI barriers using both naturally occurring and lab-reared damselflies. We found incomplete mechanical isolation between the two pure species and between hybrid males and pure species females. Interestingly, where mechanical isolation was incomplete, females showed greater resistance and refusal to mate with hybrid or heterospecific males compared to conspecific males, which suggests that tactile incompatibilities involving male reproductive structures can influence female mating decisions and form a strong barrier to gene flow in early stages of speciation.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning, which describes a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data rich, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems--patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients--and discuss whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem. Furthermore, the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning powering changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Much of contemporary systems biology owes its success to the abstraction of a network, the idea that diverse kinds of molecular, cellular, and organismal species and interactions can be modeled as relational nodes and edges in a graph of dependencies. Since the advent of high-throughput data acquisition technologies in fields such as genomics, metabolomics, and neuroscience, the automated inference and reconstruction of such interaction networks directly from large sets of activation data, commonly known as reverse-engineering, has become a routine procedure. Whereas early attempts at network reverse-engineering focused predominantly on producing maps of system architectures with minimal predictive modeling, reconstructions now play instrumental roles in answering questions about the statistics and dynamics of the underlying systems they represent. Many of these predictions have clinical relevance, suggesting novel paradigms for drug discovery and disease treatment. While other reviews focus predominantly on the details and effectiveness of individual network inference algorithms, here we examine the emerging field as a whole. We first summarize several key application areas in which inferred networks have made successful predictions. We then outline the two major classes of reverse-engineering methodologies, emphasizing that the type of prediction that one aims to make dictates the algorithms one should employ. We conclude by discussing whether recent breakthroughs justify the computational costs of large-scale reverse-engineering sufficiently to admit it as a mainstay in the quantitative analysis of living systems.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes display monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted genes have been identified from several plant species. Here we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted candidates from rice. Imprinted genes of rice showed limited association to the transposable elements, which is contrast to the findings in Arabidopsis. Generally, imprinting of rice is conserved within species, but intraspecific variations were confirmed here. Imprinting between cultivated rice and wild rice are likely similar. The imprinted genes of rice do not show significant selective signatures overall, which suggests that domestication imposes limited evolutionary effects on genomic imprinting of rice. Though the conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, here we prove that some loci tend to be imprinted in different species. In addition, our results suggest that differential epigenetic regulation between parental alleles can be established either prior to or post-fertilization. The imprinted 24-nt small RNAs, but not the 21-nt ones, likely involve the regulation of imprinting in an opposite parental-allele targeting manner. Together, our findings suggest that regulation of imprinting can be very diverse, and genomic imprinting as well as imprinted genes have essential evolutionary and biological significance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is becoming increasingly common, the amount of publicly available data grows rapidly, generating a useful resource for computational method development and extension of published results. Although processed data matrices are typically made available in public repositories, the procedure to obtain these varies widely between data sets, which may complicate reuse and cross-data set comparison. Moreover, while many statistical methods for performing differential expression analysis of scRNA-seq data are becoming available, their relative merits and the performance compared to methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data are not sufficiently well understood.\\n\\nResultsWe present conquer, a collection of consistently processed, analysis-ready public single-cell RNA-seq data sets. Each data set has count and transcripts per million (TPM) estimates for genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports. We use a subset of the data sets available in conquer to perform an extensive evaluation of the performance and characteristics of statistical methods for differential gene expression analysis, evaluating a total of 30 statistical approaches on both experimental and simulated scRNA-seq data.\\n\\nConclusionsConsiderable differences are found between the methods in terms of the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Pre-filtering of lowly expressed genes can have important effects on the results, particularly for some of the methods originally developed for analysis of bulk RNA-seq data.

    "abstract": "The myeloma bone marrow microenvironment promotes proliferation of malignant plasma cells and resistance to therapy. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and downstream JAK/STAT signaling are thought to be central components of these microenvironment-induced phenotypes. In a prior drug repurposing screen, we identified tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor FDA-approved for rheumatoid arthritis, as an agent that may reverse the tumor-stimulating effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells. Here, we validated both in vitro, in stromal-responsive human myeloma cell lines, and in vivo, in orthotopic disseminated murine xenograft models of myeloma, that tofacitinib showed both single-agent and combination therapeutic efficacy in myeloma models. Surprisingly, we found that ruxolitinib, an FDA-approved agent targeting JAK1 and JAK2, did not lead to the same anti-myeloma effects. Combination with a novel irreversible JAK3-selective inhibitor also did not enhance ruxolitinib effects. RNA-seq and unbiased phosphoproteomics revealed that marrow stromal cells stimulate a JAK/STAT-mediated proliferative program in myeloma plasma cells, and tofacitinib reversed the large majority of these pro-growth signals. Taken together, our results suggest that tofacitinib specifically reverses the growth-promoting effects of the tumor microenvironment through blocking an IL-6-mediated signaling axis. As tofacitinib is already FDA-approved, these results can be rapidly translated into potential clinical benefits for myeloma patients.",

The approximate locations of these variants can be mapped as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs); however a major limitation of eQTLs is their low resolution, which precludes investigation of the causal variants and their molecular mechanisms. Here we report RNA-seq and full genome sequences for 85 diverse isolates of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae--including wild, domesticated, and human clinical strains--which allowed us to perform eQTL mapping with 50-fold higher resolution than previously possible. In addition to variants in promoters, we uncovered an important role for variants in 3 untranslated regions, especially those affecting binding of the PUF family of RNA-binding proteins. The eQTLs are predominantly under purifying selection, particularly those affecting essential genes and conserved genes. However, applying the sign test for lineage-specific selection revealed the polygenic up-regulation of dozens of biofilm suppressor genes in strains isolated from human patients, consistent with the key role of biofilms in fungal pathogenicity. In addition, a single variant in the promoter of a biofilm suppressor, NIT3, showed the strongest genome-wide association with clinical origin. Altogether our results demonstrate the power of high-resolution eQTL mapping in understanding the molecular mechanisms of regulatory variation, as well as the natural selection acting on this variation that drives adaptation to environments ranging from laboratories to vineyards to the human body.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we examine a new source of evidence that draws on data from archaic human genomes to support the hypothesis that vocal learning in Homo preceded the emergence of Anatomically Modern Humans. We build our claim on the evolutionary history of the SLITROBO GTPase 2 gene (SRGAP2). The SLIT-ROBO molecular pathway has been shown to have an important role in the context of vocal learning. Though the relevance of the SRGAP2 gene duplication in the emergence of some aspect of language has not gone completely unnoticed, recent results now allow us to articulate a mechanistic hypothesis of its role in the context of axon guidance. Specifically, SRGAP2C, a duplication of SRGAP2 crucially also found in Neanderthals and Denisovans, but not in extant mammals, inhibits the ancestral SRGAP2A, which in turn modulates the axon guidance function of the SLIT-ROBO molecular pathway. This, we claim, could have contributed to the establishment of the critical cortico-laryngeal connection of the vocal learning circuit. Our conclusions support the idea that complex vocal learning could already have been part of the arsenal of some of our extinct ancestors.",

    "abstract": "Semantic memory encompasses knowledge about both the properties that typify concepts (e.g. robins, like all birds, have wings) as well as the properties that individuate conceptually related items (e.g. robins, in particular, have red breasts). We investigate the impact of sleep on new semantic learning using a property inference task in which both kinds of information are initially acquired equally well. Participants learned about three categories of novel objects possessing some properties that were shared among category exemplars and others that were unique to an exemplar, with exposure frequency varying across categories. In Experiment 1, memory for shared properties improved and memory for unique properties was preserved across a night of sleep, while memory for both feature types declined over a day awake. In Experiment 2, memory for shared properties improved across a nap, but only for the lower-frequency category, suggesting a prioritization of weakly learned information early in a sleep period. The increase was significantly correlated with amount of REM, but was also observed in participants who did not enter REM, suggesting involvement of both sleep stages. The results provide the first evidence that sleep improves memory for the shared structure of object categories, while simultaneously preserving object-unique information.",

    "abstract": "Technological advances have enabled low-input RNA-sequencing, paving the way for assaying transcriptome variation in spatial contexts, including in tissues. While the generation of spatially resolved transcriptome maps is increasingly feasible, computational methods for analysing the resulting data are not established. Existing analysis strategies either ignore the spatial component of gene expression variation, or require discretization of the cells into coarse grained groups.\\n\\nTo address this, we have developed SpatialDE, a computational framework for identifying and characterizing spatially variable genes. Our method generalizes variable gene selection, as used in population-and single-cell studies, to spatial expression profiles. To illustrate the broad utility of our approach, we apply SpatialDE to spatial transcriptomics data, and to data from single cell methods based on multiplexed in situ hybridisation (SeqFISH and MERFISH). SpatialDE enables the statistically robust identification of spatially variable genes, thereby identifying genes with known disease implications, several of which are missed by conventional variable gene selection. Additionally, to enable gene-expressed based histology, SpatialDE implements a spatial gene clustering model which we call \\\"automatic expression histology,\\\" allowing to classify genes into groups with distinct spatial patterns.",

    "abstract": "A theory of action control (General Tau Theory) is applied to analyzing normal and abnormal movements in PD; and to designing and testing the efficacy of a sonic aid for PD. A central aspect of the theory, which is supported by experimental evidence across a variety of actions and species, is that the trajectories of competent skilled actions follow a particular temporal pattern, which is described by the mathematical function, tauG. Since tauG-control of actions can be largely deficient in PD, we designed a device that generates whoop-like sounds, where the fundamental frequency of the sound follows the tauG pattern. Our hypothesis was that by listening to these sounds the nervous system of someone with PD might be helped subsequently to self-generate tauG patterns in their nervous system, which might facilitate movement control in different situations. Five adults with PD, and five age-matched controls, took part in the study. They each listened to the sounds under two conditions: (a) experimental - turning a handle for 5 minutes while the sounds were played (b) control - turning the handle without the sounds. Before and after each condition, the tauG-control of lateral body sway while standing was measured (without the sounds playing), using force-plates, on two tasks: (i) keeping the feet down, (ii) lifting the trailing foot. The number of participants out of five, who showed greater ratio improvement following practice with whoop sounds compared to without sounds, was, on each task, high for the PDs compared with the age-matched controls (4 vs 2 or 3). Thus, for the PDs, listening to the tauG whoop-like sounds while performing one action (handle turning) improved subsequent tauG-control on a different task (body-swaying).",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a substantial proportion of primate genomes. The regulatory potential of TEs can result in deleterious effects, especially during development. It has been suggested that, in pluripotent stem cells, TEs are targeted for silencing by KRAB-ZNF proteins, which recruit the TRIM28-SETDB1 complex, to deposit the repressive histone modification H3K9me3. TEs, in turn, can acquire mutations that allow them to evade detection by the host, and hence KRAB-ZNF proteins need to rapidly evolve to counteract them. To investigate the short-term evolution of TE silencing, we profiled the genome-wide distribution of H3K9me3 in induced pluripotent stem cells from ten human and seven chimpanzee individuals. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K9me3, as well as total RNA sequencing. We focused specifically on cross-species H3K9me3 ChIP-seq data that mapped to four million orthologous TEs. We found that, depending on the TE class, 10-60% of elements are marked by H3K9me3, with SVA, LTR and LINE elements marked most frequently. We found little evidence of inter-species differences in TE silencing, with as many as 80% of orthologous, putatively silenced, TEs marked at similar levels in humans and chimpanzees. Our data suggest limited species-specificity of TE silencing across six million years of primate evolution. Interestingly, the minority of TEs enriched for H3K9me3 in one species are not more likely to be associated with gene expression divergence of nearby orthologous genes. We conclude that orthologous TEs may not play a major role in driving gene regulatory divergence between humans and chimpanzees.",
