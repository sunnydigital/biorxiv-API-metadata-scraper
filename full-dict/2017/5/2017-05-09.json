    "abstract": "One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across all animal groups and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome usage and composition, taking into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, essentially all animals have comparable amounts of introns and intergenic sequence, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more dependent on genome size than previously thought.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryWithin our anthropocentric genomic framework, many analyses tends to try to define humans, mammals, or vertebrates relative to the so-called \\\"lower\\\" animals. This implicitly posits that vertebrates are complex organisms with large genomes and invertebrates are simple organisms with small genomes. This has the problem that genome size is therefore presumed to correlate with complexity and ignores any unknown complexity of vast numbers of invertebrate groups, many with large genomes. Animals vary widely in genome size, by almost three orders of magnitude, but when sequencing new animal genomes preference is given to those with smaller genomes for reasons of cost. In trying to understand how genomes are used in general, there is an added layer of complication from quality of the assembly and annotation. We have examined genome usage across a wide range of animals and have described ways to account for errors of low-quality annotations. We also show that the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates are not so different, and that when large-genome invertebrates are added, genome size alone appears to be defining the fraction of the genome that is genes.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer treatment is predicting the clinical response to anti-cancer drugs for each individual patient. For complex diseases such as cancer, characterized by high inter-patient variance, the implementation of precision medicine approaches is dependent upon understanding the pathological processes at the molecular level. While the \\\"omics\\\" era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to utilize it in targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the \\\"omics\\\" data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNNs), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses in cancer treatment. We present the application of Association Rule Mining combined with DLNNs for the analysis of high-throughput molecular profiles of 1001 cancer cell lines, in order to extract cancer-specific signatures in the form of easily interpretable rules and use these rules as input to predict pharmacological responses to a large number of anti-cancer drugs. The proposed algorithm outperformed Random Forests (RF) and Bayesian Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning (BMMKL) classification which currently represent the state-of-the-art in drug-response prediction. Moreover, the in silico pipeline presented, introduces a novel strategy for identifying potential therapeutic targets, as well as possible drug combinations with high therapeutic potential. For the first time, we demonstrate that DLNNs trained on a large pharmacogenomics data-set can effectively predict the therapeutic response of specific drugs in different cancer types. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the application of DLNNs to predict therapeutic responsiveness, a milestone in precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Estrogens act by binding to estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ER, ER{beta}), ligand-dependent transcription factors that play crucial roles in sex differentiation, tumor growth and cardiovascular physiology. Estrogens also activate the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), however the function of GPER in vivo is less well understood. Here we find that GPER is required to maintain normal heart rate in zebrafish embryos. Acute exposure to estrogens increased heart rate in wildtype and in ER and ER{beta} mutant embryos but not in GPER mutants. Nuclear estrogen receptor signaling remained normal in GPER mutant embryos, however GPER mutant embryos exhibited reduced basal heart rate while heart rate was normal in ER and ER{beta} mutants. We detected GPER transcript in discrete regions of the brain but not in the heart. In the brain, we observed gper expression in cells lacking nuclear estrogen receptor activity, suggesting that GPER acts in the brain to regulate heart rate independently of nuclear estrogen receptor signaling. Our results demonstrate that estradiol plays a previously unappreciated role in the acute modulation of heart rate during zebrafish embryonic development and that GPER functions as an autonomous estrogen receptor in vivo to regulate basal heart rate.",

These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates, and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple \"shared/condition-specific\" assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally-acting variants associated with gene expression (\"cis eQTLs\") in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that while genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (e.g., brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (e.g., testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions, and available online.",

    "abstract": "Genomic loci with regulatory potential can be identified and annotated with various properties. For example, genomic sites may be annotated as being bound by a given transcription factor (TF) in one or more cell types. The same sites may be further labeled as being proximal or distal to known promoters. Given such a collection of labeled sites, it is natural to ask what sequence features are associated with each annotation label. However, discovering such label-specific sequence features is often confounded by overlaps between annotation labels; e.g. if regulatory sites specific to a given cell type are also more likely to be promoter-proximal, it is difficult to assess whether motifs identified in that set of sites are associated with the cell type or associated with promoters. In order to meet this challenge, we developed SeqUnwinder, a principled approach to deconvolving interpretable discriminative sequence features associated with overlapping annotation labels. We demonstrate the novel analysis abilities of SeqUnwinder using three examples. Firstly, we show SeqUnwinders ability to unravel sequence features associated with the dynamic binding behavior of TFs during motor neuron programming from features associated with chromatin state in the initial embryonic stem cells. Secondly, we characterize distinct sequence properties of multi-condition and cell-specific TF binding sites after controlling for uneven associations with promoter proximity. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of SeqUnwinder to discover cell-specific sequence features from over one hundred thousand genomic loci that display DNase I hypersensitivity in one or more ENCODE cell lines.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/seqcode/sequnwinder",

We study a novel control task in which participants must steer a boat on a grid, aiming to follow a path of high reward whilst learning how their actions affect the boats position.

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing importance of non-targeted metabolomics to answer various life science questions, extracting biochemically relevant information from metabolomics spectral data is still an incompletely solved problem. Most computational tools to identify tandem mass spectra focus on a limited set of molecules of interest. However, such tools are typically constrained by the availability of reference spectra or molecular databases, limiting their applicability to identify unknown metabolites. In contrast, recent advances in the field illustrate the possibility to expose the underlying biochemistry without relying on metabolite identification, in particular via substructure prediction. We describe an automated method for substructure recommendation motivated by association rule mining. Our framework captures potential relationships between spectral features and substructures learned from public spectral libraries. These associations are used to recommend substructures for any unknown mass spectrum. Our method does not require any predefined metabolite candidates, and therefore it can be used for the partial identification of unknown unknowns. The method is called MESSAR (MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender) and is implemented in a free online web service available at messar.biodatamining.be.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMass spectrometry is one of most used techniques to detect and identify metabolites. However, learning metabolite structures directly from mass spectrometry data has always been a challenging task. Thousands of mass spectra from various biological systems still remain unanalyzed simply because no current bioinformatic tools are able to generate structural hypotheses. By manually studying mass spectra of standard compounds, chemists discovered that metabolites that share common substructures can also share spectral features. As data scientists, we believe that such relationships can be unraveled from massive structure and spectra data by machine learning. In this study, we adapted \\\"association rule mining\\\", traditionally used in market basket analysis, to structural and spectral data, allowing us to investigate all spectral features - metabolite substructures relationships. We further collected all statistically sound relationships into a database and used them to assign substructral hypotheses to unexplored spectra. We named our approach MESSAR, MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender, available to the metabolomics and mass spectrometry community as a free and open web service.",

For schizophrenia (SCZ), however, while sets of genes have been implicated through study of rare variation, only two risk genes have been identified.\\n\\nMethodsWe used hierarchical Bayesian modeling of rare variant genetic architecture to estimate mean effect sizes and risk-gene proportions, analyzing the largest available collection of whole exome sequence (WES) data for schizophrenia (1,077 trios, 6,699 cases and 13,028 controls), and data for four NDDs (ASD, ID, DD, and EPI; total 10,792 trios, and 4,058 cases and controls).\\n\\nResultsFor SCZ, we estimate 1,551 risk genes, more risk genes and weaker effects than for NDDs. We provide power analyses to predict the number of risk gene discoveries as more data become available, demonstrating greater value of case-control over trio samples. We confirm and augment prior risk gene and gene set enrichment results for SCZ and NDDs. In particular, we detected 98 new DD risk genes at FDR < 0.05. Correlations of risk-gene posterior probabilities are high across four NDDs ({rho} > 0.55), but low between SCZ and the NDDs ({rho} < 0.3). In depth analysis of 288 NDD genes shows highly significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and functionally distinct PPI subnetworks based on pathway enrichments, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) cell types and multi-region developmental brain RNA-seq.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have extended a pipeline used in ASD studies and applied it to infer rare genetic parameters for SCZ and four NDDs. We find many new DD risk genes, supported by gene set enrichment and PPI network connectivity analyses. We find greater similarity among NDDs than between NDDs and SCZ. NDD gene subnetworks are implicated in postnatally expressed presynaptic and postsynaptic genes, and for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in prenatal neural progenitor and stem cells.",

Our comparison of a NUMT sequence shared by humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas with their mtDNAs implies that, around the time of divergence between humans and chimpanzees, our evolutionary history involved the interbreeding of individuals whose mtDNA had diverged as much as ~4.5 Myr prior. This large divergence suggests a distant interspecies hybridization. Additionally, analysis of two other NUMTs suggests that such events occurred repeatedly.

    "abstract": "It is well-known that breast tumors exhibit different expression patterns that can be used to assign intrinsic subtypes - the PAM50 assay, for example, categorizes tumors into: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and Basal-like - yet tumors are often more complex than categorization can describe. We used 911 sporadic breast tumors to reparameterize expression from the PAM50 genes to five orthogonal tumor dimensions using principal components (PC). Three dimensions captured intrinsic subtype, two dimensions were novel, and all replicated in 945 TCGA tumors. By definition dimensions are independent, an important attribute for inclusion in downstream studies exploring effects of tumor diversity. One application where tumor subtyping has failed to provide impact is susceptibility genetics. Germline genetic heterogeneity reduces power for gene-finding. The identification of heritable tumor characteristics has potential to increase homogeneity. We compared 238 breast tumors from high-risk pedigrees not attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 to 911 sporadic breast tumors. Two PC dimensions were significantly enriched in the pedigrees (intrinsic subtypes were not). We performed proof-of-concept gene-mapping in one enriched pedigree and identified a 0.5 Mb genomewide significant region at 12q15 that segregated to the 8 breast cancer cases with the most extreme PC tumors through 32 meioses (p=2.6x10-8). In conclusion, our study: suggests a new approach to describe tumor diversity; supports the hypothesis that tumor characteristics are heritable providing new avenues for germline studies; and proposes a new breast cancer locus. Reparameterization of expression patterns may similarly inform other studies attempting to model the effects of tumor heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "There is substantial interest in the evolutionary forces that shaped the regulatory framework that is established in early human development. Progress in this area has been slow because it is difficult to obtain relevant biological samples. Inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide the ability to establish in vitro models of early human and non-human primate developmental stages. Using matched iPSC panels from humans and chimpanzees, we comparatively characterized gene regulatory changes through a four-day timecourse differentiation of iPSCs (day 0) into primary streak (day 1), endoderm progenitors (day 2), and definitive endoderm (day 3). As might be expected, we found that differentiation stage is the major driver of variation in gene expression levels, followed by species. We identified thousands of differentially expressed genes between humans and chimpanzees in each differentiation stage. Yet, when we considered gene-specific dynamic regulatory trajectories throughout the timecourse, we found that 75.. of genes, including nearly all known endoderm developmental markers, have similar trajectories in the two species. Interestingly, we observed a marked reduction of both intra-and inter-species variation in gene expression levels in primitive streak samples compared to the iPSCs, with a recovery of regulatory variation in endoderm progenitors. The reduction of variation in gene expression levels at a specific developmental stage, paired with overall high degree of conservation of temporal gene regulation, is consistent with the dynamics of developmental canalization. Overall, we conclude that endoderm development in iPSC-based models are highly conserved and canalized between humans and our closest evolutionary relative.",

    "abstract": "Poliovirus (PV) infection induces membranes with elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and invaginated, tubular structures that appear as vesicular clusters in cross section. Here, we characterize PV mutants, termed EG and GG, which exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor that can delay the onset of genome replication and/or impair virus assembly. For WT PV, changes to the PI4P pool were observed as early as 30 min post-infection. PI4P remodeling occurred even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor. Vesicular clusters were not apparent until 3 h post-infection, a time too slow for these structures to be responsible for genome replication. Delays in the onset of genome replication observed for EG and GG PVs were explained completely by the reduced kinetics of virus-induced remodeling of PI4P pools, consistent with PI4P serving as a marker of the genome-replication organelle. Infectious virus produced by GG PV is known to be reduced nearly 5 logs. We show that GG PV was unable to make virus-induced vesicular clusters. Instead, GG PV-infected cells accumulated elongated tubules. Our results are consistent with the existence of distinct organelles for genome-replication and virus assembly. We suggest that the pace of formation and spatiotemporal dynamics of PV induced organelles may be set by the rate of P3 precursor processing to form 3AB and/or 3CD proteins.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAll positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in association with host cell membranes. PV does not just remodel existing membranes, but induces membranes with unique structure and lipid composition. There has been some suggestion that the functions of the PV induced structures observed during infection may not be those that perform genome-replication. This study uses kinetic analysis of virus-induced membrane formation and PI4P induction by two PV mutants to provide evidence for the existence of a virus-induced genome-replication organelle distinct from a second organelle, the absence of which impairs virus assembly. In addition, our studies suggest that formation of both organelles may require participation of viral proteins, 3AB and/or 3CD. Therefore, this study provides a new perspective on the cell biology of PV infection and should inspire a fresh look at picornavirus-induced organelles, their functions and the role of P3 proteins in their formation.",

Transcriptomic profiling has led to significant advances in our understanding of microglia in several disease states, but tissue dissociation and purification of microglia is known to lead to cellular activation.

Microglial RiboTag RNAseq profiling after peripheral immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide demonstrates unique transcriptional targets that are not evident using cell sorting methodology. Finally, we applied our technique to reveal novel shared and distinct pathways when comparing microglial transcriptomes after peripheral challenge with bacterial or viral mimetics.

    "abstract": "In plants and parenchymatous brown algae the body arises through the activity of an apical meristem (a niche of cells or a single cell). The meristem produces lateral organs in specific patterns, referred to as phyllotaxis. In plants, two different control mechanisms have been proposed - one is position-dependent and relies on morphogen accumulation at future organ sites whereas the other is a lineage-based system which links phyllotaxis to the apical cell division pattern. Here we examine the apical patterning of the brown alga, Sargassum muticum, which exhibits spiral phyllotaxis (137.5{degrees} angle) and an unlinked apical cell division pattern. The Sargassum apex presents characteristics of a self-organising system, similar to plant meristems. We were unable to correlate the plant morphogen auxin with bud positioning in Sargassum, nor could we predict cell wall softening at new bud sites. Our data suggests that in Sargassum muticum there is no connection between phyllotaxis and the apical cell division pattern indicating a position-dependent patterning mechanism may be in place. The underlying mechanisms behind the phyllotactic patterning appear to be distinct from those seen in plants.\\n\\nSummaryThe brown alga Sargassum muticum displays spiral phyllotaxis developed from a position-dependent self-organising mechanism, different from that understood in plants.",

    "abstract": "The synthetic 17-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is an estrogenic compound of oral contraceptives and therefore a common pollutant that has been suspected to affect the demography of river-dwelling salmonids. We study a population of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) that suffers from sex ratio distortions. Here we test how ecologically relevant concentrations of EE2 affect sex-specific gene expression around early stages of sex differentiation. We collected gametes from F1s of wild spawners, used them for in vitro fertilizations, and raised the resulting embryos singly under experimentally controlled conditions. Embryos were either exposed to 1ng/L EE2 or sham-exposed. RNA was collected from samples taken 10 days before hatching, at the day of hatching, and towards the end of the yolk-sac stage, to study gene expression and relate it to genetic sex (sdY genotype). We found that EE2 affects gene expression of a very large number of genes especially at the day of hatching. The effects of EE2 on gene expression is strongly sex-specific. At the day of hatching, EE2 affected about twice as many genes in females than in males, and towards the end of the yolk-sac larval stage, EE2 effects were nearly exclusively observed in females. Among the many effects was, for example, a surprising EE2-induced molecular masculinization in the females heads. Histological examination of gonadal development of EE2-treated or sham-exposed juveniles during the first 4.5 months after hatching revealed a delaying effect of EE2 on sex differentiation. Because grayling sex determination goes through an all-male stage (a rare case of undifferentiated gonochorism), the rate of EE2-induced sex reversal could not be unequivocally determined during the observational period. However, two EE2-treated genetic males had ovarian tissues at the end of the study. We conclude that common levels of EE2 pollution affect grayling from very early stages on by interfering with male and female gene expression around the onset of sex differentiation, by delaying sex differentiation, and by feminizing some males.\\n\\nAuthor contributionMRR and CW initiated the project. OS, DM, LW, LMC, and CW sampled the adult fish, did the experimental in vitro fertilizations, and prepared the embryos for experimental rearing in the laboratory. All further manipulations on the embryos and the larvae were done by OS, DM, LW, and LMC. The RNA-seq data were analyzed by OS, JR, and MRR, the histological analyses were done by DM, supervised by SK, the molecular genetic sexing was performed by OS and DM, and EV supervised the EE2 analytics.

    "abstract": "Although the presence of vast amounts of plastic in the open ocean has generated great concern due to its potential ecological consequences, recent studies reveal that its measured abundance is much smaller than expected. Regional and global studies indicate that the difference between expected and actual estimates is enormous, suggesting that a large part of the plastic has been degraded by either physical and biotic processes. A paradoxical observation is the lack of a trend in plastic accumulation found in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, despite the rapid increase in plastic production and disposal. In this paper we show, using mathematical and computer models, that this observation could be explained by the nonlinear coupling between plastic (as a resource) and an evolved set of organisms (the consumers) capable of degrading it. The result is derived using two different resource-consumer mathematical approaches as well as a spatially-dependent plastic-microbial model incorporating a minimal hydrodynamical coupling with a two-dimensional fluid. The potential consequences of the evolution of marine plastic garbage and its removal are outlined.",

With growing numbers of sequenced genomes, increasing numbers of duplicate genes are uncovered with unknown functions. Here we examine malvolio, a gene involved in heavy metal transport but that also affects behavior in honey bees and Drosophila. There is only one copy of malvolio in honey bees and Drosophila despite its different roles. A phylogenetic analysis in insects suggests that malvolio has duplicated multiple times in different orders. To test if the two copies might have different functions, we examined expression levels of malvolio in brain, fat bodies, Malpighian tubules, midgut, ovaries, testes and thoracic musculature in the beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that mvl1 was expressed in all tissues, with highest expression in fat bodies and relatively lower expression in testes, Malpighian tubules, and brain, and ovaries. Expression of mvl2 differed, with significant expression only seen in brain and midgut. Because malvolio has been implicated in behavior, and these beetles have highly developed parenting behavior, we next examined expression during different behavioral states including virgin, mating, preparing resources for offspring, feeding offspring and post care. We found differing expression patterns for the two copies, with mvl1 increasing in expression during resource preparation and feeding offspring, and mvl2 decreasing in these same states. Given these patterns of expression, we suggest that malvolio in N. vespilloides has experienced sub/neofunctionalization following its duplication, and is evolving differing and tissue-specific roles in behavior and physiology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn self-organized systems, the concept of flow hierarchy is a useful way to characterize the movement of information throughout a network. Hierarchical network organizations are shown to arise when there is a cost of maintaining links in the network. A similar constraint exists in metabolic networks, where costs come from reduced efficiency of nonspecific enzymes or from producing unnecessary enzymes. Previous analyses of bacterial metabolic networks have been used to predict the minimal nutrients that a bacterium needs to grow, its mutualistic relationships with other bacteria, and its major ecological niche. Using flow hierarchy, we can also infer the tradeoffs between growth rate and metabolic efficiency that bacteria make given their environmental constraints.\\n\\nResultsUsing a comparative approach on 2,935 bacterial metabolic networks, we show that flow hierarchy in bacterial metabolic networks tracks a fundamental tradeoff between growth rate and biomass production, and reflects a bacteriums realized ecological strategy. Additionally, by inferring the ancestral metabolic networks, we find that hierarchy decreases with distance from the root of the tree, suggesting the important pressure of increased growth rate relative to efficiency in the face of competition.\\n\\nConclusionsJust as hierarchical character is an important structural property in efficiently engineered systems, it also evolves in self-organized bacterial metabolic networks, reflects the life-history strategies of those bacteria, and plays an important role in network organization and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We mined 10,274 datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for tRNA fragments (tRFs) that overlap nuclear and mitochondrial (MT) mature tRNAs. Across 32 cancer types, we identified 20,722 distinct tRFs, a third of which arise from MT tRNAs. Most of the fragments belong to the novel category of i-tRFs, i.e. they are wholly internal to the mature tRNAs. The abundances and cleavage patterns of the identified tRFs depend strongly on cancer type. Of note, in all 32 cancer types, we find that tRNAHisGTG produces multiple and abundant 5{acute}-tRFs with a uracil at the -1 position, instead of the expected post-transcriptionally-added guanosine. Strikingly, these -1U His 5{acute}tRFs are produced in ratios that remain constant across all analyzed normal and cancer samples, a property that makes tRNAHisGTG unique among all tRNAs. We also found numerous tRFs to be negatively correlated with many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that belong primarily to four universal biological processes: transcription, cell adhesion, chromatin organization and development/morphogenesis. However, the identities of the mRNAs that belong to these processes and are negatively correlated with tRFs differ from cancer to cancer. Notably, the protein products of these mRNAs localize to specific cellular compartments, and do so in a cancer-dependent manner. Moreover, the genomic span of mRNAs that are negatively correlated with tRFs are enriched in multiple categories of repeat elements. Conversely, the genomic span of mRNAs that are positively correlated with tRFs are depleted in repeat elements. These findings suggest novel and far-reaching roles for tRFs and indicate their involvement in system-wide interconnections in the cell.

Here we report that debilitating CtIP, which is thought to function in NHEJ, enhances precise DNA fragment deletion. By analyzing the inserted nucleotides at the junctions of DNA fragment inversions, deletions, and duplications, we find that Cas9 cleaves the noncomplementary strand with a flexible profile upstream of the PAM site and rationally-designed Cas9 nucleases have distinct cleavage profiles. Finally, Cas9-mediated nucleotide insertions of DFE are nonrandom and are equal to the combined sequences upstream of both PAM sites with predicted frequencies. Thus, precise and predictable DFEs could be achieved by perturbing DNA repair genes and using appropriate PAM configurations. These findings have important applications regarding 3D chromatin folding and enhancer insulation during gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major public health concern, being responsible for more than 1.5 million deaths annually through pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia. In spite of vaccination efforts, pneumococcal carriage and disease remain high, since available vaccines target only a subset of serotypes and vaccination is often accompanied by a rise in non-vaccine serotypes. Epidemiological studies suggest that such a change in serotype frequencies is often coupled with an increase of antibiotic resistance among non-vaccine serotypes. Building on previous multi-locus models for bacterial pathogen population structure, we have developed a theoretical framework incorporating variation in serotype and antibiotic resistance to examine how their associations may be affected by vaccination. Using this framework, we find that vaccination can result in rapid increase in frequency of pre-existing resistant variants of non-vaccine serotypes due to the removal of competition from vaccine serotypes.",

We used Mendelian randomization (MR), a method of causal inference that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables, to infer the direction of association between DNA methylation and asthma.\\n\\nWe identified 302 CpGs associated with current asthma status (FDR-adjusted P-value <0.05) and 445 with current wheeze status at 7.5 years, with substantial overlap between the two. Genes annotated to the 302 associated CpGs were enriched for pathways related to movement of cellular/subcellular components, locomotion, interleukin-4 production and eosinophil migration. All associations attenuated when adjusted for eosinophil and neutrophil cell count estimates. At 16.5 years, two sites were associated with current asthma after adjustment for cell counts. The CpGs mapped to the AP2A2 and IL5RA genes, with a -2.32 [95% CI -1.47,-3.18] and -2.49 [95% CI -1.56,-3.43] change in percentage methylation in asthma cases respectively. Two-sample bi-directional MR indicated a causal effect of asthma on DNA methylation at several CpG sites at 7.5 years. However, associations did not persist after adjustment for multiple testing. There was no evidence of a causal effect of asthma on DNA methylation at either of the two CpG sites at 16.5 years.\\n\\nThe majority of observed associations are driven by higher eosinophil cell counts in asthma cases, acting as an intermediate phenotype, with important implications for future studies of DNA methylation in atopic diseases.",

The Meloidogyne incognita group (MIG) of species, most of which are obligatory apomicts (mitotic parthenogens), are extremely polyphagous and important problems for global agriculture. While understanding the genomic basis for their variable success on different crops could benefit future agriculture, analyses of their genomes pose challenges due to complex evolutionary histories that may incorporate hybridization, ploidy changes, and chromosomal fragmentation. Here we sequence 19 genomes, representing five species of key RKN collected from different geographic origins. We show that a hybrid origin that predated speciation within the MIG has resulted in each species possessing two divergent genomic copies. Additionally, the MIG apomicts are hypotriploids, with a proportion of one genome present in a second copy, and this proportion varies among species. The evolutionary history of the MIG genomes is revealed to be very dynamic, with non-crossover recombination both homogenising the genomic copies, and acting as a mechanism for generating divergence between species. Interestingly, the automictic MIG species M. floridensis differs from the apomict species in that it has become homozygous throughout much of its genome.",

    "abstract": "Progress in gene discovery for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been rapid over the past decade, with major successes in validation of risk of predominantly rare, penetrant, de novo and inherited mutations in over 100 genes (de Rubies et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2015). However, the majority of individuals with ASD diagnoses do not carry a rare, penetrant genetic risk factor. In fact, recent estimates suggest that most of the genetic liability of ASD is due to as yet undiscovered common, less penetrant inherited variation (Gaugler et al., 2014) which is much more difficult to detect. The study of extended, high-risk families adds significant information in our search for these common inherited risk factors. Here, we present results of a new, powerful pedigree analysis method (Shared Genomic Segments--SGS) on three large families from the Utah Autism Research Program. The method improves upon previous methods by allowing for within-family heterogeneity, and identifying exact region boundaries and subsets of cases who share for targeted follow-up analyses. Our SGS analyses identified one genome-wide significant shared segment on chromosome 17 (q21.32, p=1.47x10-8). Additional regions with suggestive evidence were identified on chromosomes 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 18. Several of these segments showed evidence of sharing across families. Genes of interest in these regions include ATP8A1, DOCK3, CACNA2D2, ITGB3, AMBRA1, FOLH1, DGKZ, MTHFS, ARNT2, BTN2A2, BTN3A1, BTN3A3, BTN2A1, and BTN1A1.

    "abstract": "Compelling genetic evidence links the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Alzheimers disease (AD), and several theories have been advanced to explain the involvement of APP in AD. A leading hypothesis proposes that a small amphipathic fragment of APP, the amyloid {beta}-protein (A{beta}), self-associates to form soluble aggregates which impair synaptic and network activity. Here, we report on the plasticity-disrupting effects of A{beta} isolated from AD brain and the requirement of APP for these effects. We show that A{beta}-containing AD brain extracts block hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), augment glutamate release probability and disrupt the excitation/inhibition balance. Notably, these effects are associated with A{beta} localizing to synapses, and genetic ablation of APP prevents both A{beta} binding and A{beta}-mediated synaptic dysfunctions. These findings indicate a role for APP in AD pathogenesis beyond the generation of A{beta} and suggest modulation of APP expression as a therapy for AD.\\n\\nAcknowledgmentsWe thank Dr. Tiernan T.

    "abstract": "Female Dengue and Zika vector mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) generally mate once, with sperm from this male fertilizing all eggs produced in her lifetime. Here we implicate HP-I, an Aedes- and male-specific neuropeptide transferred to females, and its cognate receptor in the female, NPYLR1, in rapid enforcement of paternity. HP-I mutant males were ineffective in enforcing paternity when a second male was given access to the female within 1 hour. NPYLR1 mutant females produced mixed paternity offspring at high frequency. Synthetic HP-I injected into wild-type virgins reduced successful matings, but had no effect on NPYLR1 mutant females. Asian tiger mosquito (Ae. albopictus) HP-I potently activated Ae. aegypti NPYLR1. Invasive Ae. albopictus males are known to copulate with and sterilize Ae. aegypti females, and cross-species transfer of HP-I may contribute to this phenomenon. This neuropeptide system promotes rapid paternity enforcement within Ae. aegypti, but may promote local extinction in areas where they compete with Ae. albopictus.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryAedes-specific peptide rapidly enforces paternity\\n\\nTextAe. aegypti females typically mate only once with one male in their lifetime, a behavior known as \\\"monandry\\\" (1). This single mating event provisions the female with sufficient sperm to fertilize the >500 eggs she will produce during her [~]4-6 week lifespan in the laboratory (2). Successful mating is capable of inducing lifetime refractoriness to subsequent insemination by other males, enforcing the paternity of the first male (3-5). In other species, males use diverse strategies to assure the paternity of their offspring, for instance physical barriers such as mating plugs found in mice (6) and Anopheline mosquitoes (7), and anti-aphrodisiac pheromones used by Drosophila melanogaster males to tag female flies as non-virgin (8). Another widely used strategy in insects is the transfer of biologically active male seminal proteins, produced by the male accessory gland and secreted into the ejaculatory duct along with sperm during insemination, to affect the sexual receptivity of the female (3, 9-13). Perhaps the best-characterized male seminal fluid protein in insects is the Drosophila fly sex peptide (11), which acts on the sex peptide receptor in the female to suppress receptivity and trigger egg production (12). Drosophila sex peptide receptor mutant females will readily remate with multiple males, and wild-type females that mate with sex peptide mutant males remain sexually receptive.",

    "abstract": "Cancer can be viewed as a set of different diseases with distinctions based on tissue origin, driver mutations, and genetic signatures. Accordingly, each of these distinctions have been used to classify cancer subtypes and to reveal common features. Here, we present a different analysis of cancer based on amino acid mutation signatures. Non-negative Matrix Factorization and principal component analysis of 29 cancers revealed six amino acid mutation signatures, including four signatures that were dominated by either arginine to histidine (Arg>His) or glutamate to lysine (Glu>Lys) mutations. Sample-level analyses reveal that while some cancers are heterogeneous, others are largely dominated by one type of mutation. Using a non-overlapping set of samples from the COSMIC somatic mutation database, we validate five of six mutation signatures, including signatures with prominent arginine to histidine (Arg>His) or glutamate to lysine (Glu>Lys) mutations. This suggests that our classification of cancers based on amino acid mutation patterns may provide avenues of inquiry pertaining to specific protein mutations that may generate novel insights into cancer biology.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing creates targeted double strand breaks (DSBs) in eukaryotic cells that are processed by cellular DNA repair pathways. Co-administration of single stranded oligonucleotide donor DNA (ssODN) during editing can result in high-efficiency (>20%) incorporation of ssODN sequences into the break site. This process is commonly referred to as homology directed repair (HDR) and here referred to as single stranded template repair (SSTR) to distinguish it from repair using a double stranded DNA donor (dsDonor). The high efficacy of SSTR makes it a promising avenue for the treatment of genetic diseases1,2, but the genetic basis of SSTR editing is still unclear, leaving its use a mostly empiric process. To determine the pathways underlying SSTR in human cells, we developed a coupled knockdown-editing screening system capable of interrogating multiple editing outcomes in the context of thousands of individual gene knockdowns. Unexpectedly, we found that SSTR requires multiple components of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) repair pathway, but does not require Rad51-mediated homologous recombination, distinguishing SSTR from repair using dsDonors. Knockdown of FA genes impacts SSTR without altering break repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in multiple human cell lines and in neonatal dermal fibroblasts. Our results establish an unanticipated and central role for the FA pathway in templated repair from single stranded DNA by human cells. Therapeutic genome editing has been proposed to treat genetic disorders caused by deficiencies in DNA repair, including Fanconi Anemia. Our data imply that patient genotype and/or transcriptome profoundly impact the effectiveness of gene editing treatments and that adjuvant treatments to bias cells towards FA repair pathways could have considerable therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "Inbreeding depression is widely hypothesised to drive adaptive evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance, which in turn are hypothesised to affect evolution of polyandry (i.e., female multiple mating). However, surprisingly little theory or modelling critically examines selection for pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, or both strategies, given evolutionary constraints and direct costs, or examines how evolution of inbreeding avoidance strategies might feed back to affect evolution of polyandry. Selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, but not for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, requires polyandry, while interactions between pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might cause functional redundancy (i.e.,  degeneracy) potentially generating complex evolutionary dynamics among inbreeding strategies and polyandry. We used individual-based modelling to quantify evolution of interacting pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry given strong inbreeding depression and different evolutionary constraints and direct costs. We found that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance increased selection for initially rare polyandry, and that evolution of a costly inbreeding avoidance strategy became negligible over time given a lower cost alternative strategy. Further, fixed pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance often completely precluded evolution of polyandry and hence post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, but fixed post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance did not preclude evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. Evolution of inbreeding avoidance phenotypes and associated polyandry are therefore affected by evolutionary feedbacks and degeneracy. All else being equal, evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and resulting low polyandry is more likely when post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is precluded or costly, and evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance greatly facilitates evolution of costly polyandry.",

    "abstract": "Innovative tools are needed to alleviate the burden of mosquito-borne diseases, and strategies that target the pathogen instead of the mosquito are being considered. A possible tactic is the use of Wolbachia, a maternally inherited, endosymbiotic bacterium that can suppress diverse pathogens when introduced to naive mosquito species. We investigated effects of somatic Wolbachia (strain wAlbB) infection on Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in Culex tarsalis mosquitoes. When compared to Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes, there was no significant effect of Wolbachia infection on RVFV infection, dissemination, or transmission frequencies, nor on viral body or saliva titers. Within Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, there was a modest negative correlation between RVFV body titers and Wolbachia density, suggesting that Wolbachia may suppress RVFV in a density-dependent manner in this mosquito species. These results are contrary to previous work in the same mosquito species, showing Wolbachia-induced enhancement of West Nile virus infection rates. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of exploring the breadth of phenotypes induced by Wolbachia.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAn integrated vector management program utilizes several practices, including pesticide application and source reduction, to reduce mosquito populations. However, mosquitoes are developing resistance to some of these methods and new control approaches are needed. A novel technique involves the bacterium Wolbachia that lives naturally in many insects. Wolbachia can be transferred to uninfected mosquitoes and can block pathogen transmission to humans. Additionally, Wolbachia is maternally inherited, allowing it to spread quickly through uninfected field populations of mosquitoes. We studied the impacts of Wolbachia on Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the naturally uninfected mosquito, Culex tarsalis. Wolbachia had no effects on the ability of Culex tarsalis to become infected with or transmit RVFV. High densities of Wolbachia were associated with no virus infection or low levels of virus, suggesting that Wolbachia might suppress RVFV at high densities. These results contrast with our previous study that showed Wolbachia enhances West Nile virus infection in Culex tarsalis. Together, these studies highlight the importance of studying Wolbachia effects on a variety of pathogens so that control methods are not impeded.",

    "abstract": "How do new promoters evolve? To follow evolution of de novo promoters, we put various random sequences upstream to the lac operon in Escherichia coli and evolved the cells in the presence of lactose. We found that a typical random sequence of ~100 bases requires only one mutation in order to enable growth on lactose by increasing resemblance to the canonical promoter motifs. We further found that ~10% of random sequences could serve as active promoters even without any period of evolutionary adaptation. Such a short mutational distance from a random sequence to an active promoter may improve evolvability yet may also lead to undesirable accidental expression. We found that across the E. coli genome accidental expression is minimized by avoiding codon combinations that resemble promoter motifs. Our results suggest that the promoter recognition machinery has been tuned to allow high accessibility to new promoters, and similar findings might also be observed in higher organisms or in other motif recognition machineries, like transcription factor binding sites or protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Fully characterizing age differences in the brain is a key task for combatting ageing-related cognitive decline. Using propensity score matching on two independent, narrow-age cohorts, we used data on childhood cognitive ability, socioeconomic background, and intracranial volume to match participants at mean age 92 years (n = 42) to very similar participants at mean age 73 (n = 126). Examining a variety of global and regional structural neuroimaging variables, there were large differences in grey and white matter volumes, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensity volume and spatial extent. In a mediation analysis, the total volume of white matter hyperintensities and total cortical surface area jointly mediated 24.9% of the relation between age and general cognitive ability (tissue volumes and cortical thickness were not significant mediators in this analysis). These findings provide an unusual and valuable perspective on neurostructural ageing, in which brains from the eighth and tenth decades of life differ widely despite the same cognitive, socio-economic, and brain-volumetric starting points.",

    "abstract": "The quantitative characterization of bacterial growth has attracted substantial research attention since Monods pioneering study. Theoretical and experimental work have uncovered several laws for describing the exponential growth phase, in which the number of cells grows exponentially. However, microorganism growth also exhibits lag, stationary, and death phases under starvation conditions, in which cell growth is highly suppressed, for which quantitative laws or theories are markedly underdeveloped. In fact, the models commonly adopted for the exponential phase that consist of autocatalytic chemical components, including ribosomes, can only show exponential growth or decay in a population, and thus phases that halt growth are not realized. Here, we propose a simple, coarse-grained cell model that includes an extra class of macromolecular components in addition to the autocatalytic active components that facilitate cellular growth. These extra components form a complex with the active components to inhibit the catalytic process. Depending on the nutrient condition, the model exhibits the typical transitions among the lag, exponential, stationary, and death phases. Furthermore, the lag time needed for growth recovery after starvation follows the square root of the starvation time and is inversely related to the maximal growth rate. This is in agreement with experimental observations, in which the length of time of cell starvation is memorized in the slow accumulation of molecules. Moreover, the lag time distributed among cells is skewed with a long time tail. If the starvation time is longer, an exponential tail appears, which is also consistent with experimental data. Our theory further predicts a strong dependence of lag time on the speed of substrate depletion, which can be tested experimentally. The present model and theoretical analysis provide universal growth laws beyond the exponential phase, offering insight into how cells halt growth without entering the death phase.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity is a powerful tool for studying human functional brain networks. Temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity, i.e., dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), are thought to reflect dynamic changes in brain organization and non-stationary switching of discrete brain states. However, recent studies have suggested that dFC might be attributed to sampling variability of static FC. Despite this controversy, a detailed exposition of stationarity and statistical testing of dFC is lacking in the literature. This article seeks an in-depth exploration of these statistical issues at a level appealing to both neuroscientists and statisticians.\\n\\nWe first review the statistical notion of stationarity, emphasizing its reliance on ensemble statistics. In contrast, all FC measures depend on sample statistics. An important consequence is that the space of stationary signals is much broader than expected, e.g., encompassing hidden markov models (HMM) widely used to extract discrete brain states. In other words, stationarity does not imply the absence of brain states. We then expound the assumptions underlying the statistical testing of dFC. It turns out that the two popular frameworks - phase randomization (PR) and autoregressive randomization (ARR) - generate stationary, linear, Gaussian null data. Therefore, statistical rejection can be due to non-stationarity, nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity. For example, the null hypothesis can be rejected for the stationary HMM due to nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show that a common form of ARR (bivariate ARR) is susceptible to false positives compared with PR and an adapted version of ARR (multivariate ARR).\\n\\nApplication of PR and multivariate ARR to Human Connectome Project data suggests that the stationary, linear, Gaussian null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most participants. However, failure to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that static FC can fully explain dFC. We find that first order AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than static FC models. Since first order AR models encode both static FC and one-lag FC, this suggests the presence of dynamical information beyond static FC. Furthermore, even in subjects where the null hypothesis was rejected, AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than a popular HMM, suggesting the lack of discrete states (as measured by resting-state fMRI). Overall, our results suggest that AR models are not only useful as a means for generating null data, but may be a powerful tool for exploring the dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI. Finally, we discuss how apparent contradictions in the growing dFC literature might be reconciled.",

    "abstract": "The brain creates internal representations of the external world in the form of neural activity, which is structured to support adaptive behavior. In many cortical regions, individual neurons respond to specific features that are matched to the function of each region and statistics of the world. In frontal cortex, however, neurons display baffling complexity, responding to a mixture of sensory, motor and other variables. Here we use an integrated new approach to understanding the architecture of higher-order cortical representations, and use this approach to show that discrete groups of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neurons encode distinct decision variables. Using rats engaged in a complex task combining perceptual and value guided decisions, we found that OFC neurons can be grouped into distinct, categorical response types. These categorical representations map directly onto decision-variables of a choice model explaining our behavioral data, such as reward size, decision confidence and integrated value. We propose that, like sensory neurons, frontal neurons form a sparse and over complete population representation aligned to the natural statistics of the world - in this case spanning the space of decision-variables required for optimal behavior.",

While this study compared the effect of noise on human and insect motion perception, it used different ways of quantifying masking in two species. This was because the human studies measured contrast thresholds, which were too time-consuming to acquire in the insect given the large number of stimulus parameters examined. Here, we run longer experiments in which we obtained contrast thresholds at just two signal and two noise frequencies. We examine the increase in threshold produced by noise at either the same frequency as the signal, or a different frequency. We do this in both humans and praying mantises (Sphodromantis lineola), enabling us to compare these species directly in the same paradigm. Our results confirm our earlier finding: whereas in humans, visual noise masks much more effectively when presented at the signal spatial frequency, in insects, noise is roughly equivalently effective whether presented at the same frequency or a lower frequency. In both species, visual noise presented at a higher spatial frequency is a less effective mask.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe here show that despite having similar motion detection systems, insects and humans differ in the effect of low and high spatial frequency noise on their contrast thresholds.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide molecular gene expression studies generally compare expression values for each gene across multiple conditions followed by cluster and gene set enrichment analysis to determine whether differentially expressed genes are enriched in specific biochemical pathways, cellular components, biological processes, and/or molecular functions, etc. This approach to analyzing differences in gene expression enables discovery of gene function, but is not useful to determine whether pre-defined groups of genes share or diverge in their expression patterns in response to treatments nor to assess the correctness of pre-defined gene set groupings. Here we present a simple method that changes the dimension of comparison by treating genes as variable traits to directly assess significance of differences in expression levels among pre-defined gene groups. Because expression distributions are typically skewed (thus unfit for direct assessment using Gaussian statistical methods) our method involves transforming expression data to approximate a normal distribution followed by dividing the genes into groups, then applying Gaussian parametric methods to assess significance of observed differences. This method enables the assessment of differences in gene expression distributions within and across samples, enabling hypothesis-based comparison among groups of genes. We demonstrate this method by assessing the significance of specific gene groups differential response to heat stress conditions in maize.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The binding of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA controls most aspects of cellular function, making the understanding of their binding kinetics imperative. The standard description of bimolecular interactions posits TF off-rates are independent of TF concentration in solution. However, recent observations have revealed that proteins in solution can accelerate the dissociation of DNA-bound proteins. To study the molecular basis of facilitated dissociation (FD), we have used single-molecule imaging to measure dissociation kinetics of Fis, a key E. coli TF and major bacterial nucleoid protein, from single dsDNA binding sites. We observe a strong FD effect characterized by an exchange rate {bsim}1 x 104 M-1s-1, establishing that FD of Fis occurs at the single-binding-site level, and we find that the off-rate saturates at large Fis concentrations in solution. While spontaneous (i.e., competitor-free) dissociation shows a strong salt dependence, we find that facilitated dissociation depends only weakly on salt. These results are quantitatively explained by a model in which partially dissociated bound proteins are susceptible to invasion by competitor proteins in solution. We also report FD of NHP6A, a yeast TF whose structure differs significantly from Fis. We further perform molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that FD can occur for molecules that interact far more weakly than those we have studied. Taken together, our results indicate that FD is a general mechanism assisting in the local removal of TFs from their binding sites and does not necessarily require cooperativity, clustering, or binding site overlap.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTranscription factors (TFs) control biological processes by binding and unbinding to DNA. Therefore it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that affect TF binding kinetics. Recent studies challenge the standard picture of TF binding kinetics by demonstrating cases of proteins in solution accelerating TF dissociation rates through a facilitated dissociation (FD) process. Our study shows that FD can occur at the level of single binding sites, without the action of large protein clusters or long DNA segments. Our results quantitatively support a model of FD in which competitor proteins invade partially dissociated states of DNA-bound TFs. FD is expected to be a general mechanism for modulating gene expression by altering the occupancy of TFs on the genome.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsRamsey I.

In this work, we combine multi-millisecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with Markov state models (MSMs) to report on the thermodynamics, kinetics, and accessible states of BTKs kinase domain. Our conformational landscape links the active state to several inactive states, connected via a structurally diverse intermediate. Our calculations predict a kinome-wide conformational plasticity, and indicate the presence of several new potentially druggable BTK states.

The most upregulated candidate in our signature, miR-451a inhibits tumor cell proliferation and attenuated surviving fraction in longer-term cultures. Conversely, inhibition of miR-451a increased proliferation, tumorsphere formation and surviving fraction of tumor cells. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified four genes-CAB39, EMSY, MEX3C and EREG as targets of miR-451a. Transfection of miR-451a decreased both mRNA and protein levels of these targets. Importantly, we found miR-451a expression was decreased with tumor stage in a small subset of CRC patients. Finally, analysis of a TCGA colorectal cancer dataset reveals that the CAB39 and EMSY are upregulated at the protein level in a significant number of CRC patients and correlates with poorer overall survival. Taken together, our data indicates miR-451a influences the radiation sensitivity of colorectal carcinomas.",

    "abstract": "Conjugation of single-stranded DNA drives horizontal gene transfer between bacteria and was widely studied in conjugative plasmids. The organization and function of integrative and conjugative elements (ICE), even if they are more abundant, was only studied in a few model systems. Comparative genomics of ICE has been precluded by the difficulty in finding and delimiting these elements. Here, we present the results of a method that circumvents these problems by requiring only the identification of the conjugation genes and the species pan-genome. We delimited 200 ICEs and this allowed the first large-scale characterization of these elements. We quantified the presence in ICEs of a wide set of functions associated with the biology of mobile genetic elements, including some that are typically associated with plasmids, such as partition and replication. Protein sequence similarity networks and phylogenetic analyses show that ICEs are modular and that their gene repertoires can be grouped in function of their conjugation types, even if integrases were shown to be paraphyletic relative to the latter. We show that there are general trends in the functional organization of genes within ICEs and of ICEs within the bacterial chromosome paving the way for future functional and evolutionary analyses.",

    "abstract": "Bell Beaker pottery spread across western and central Europe beginning around 2750 BCE before disappearing between 2200-1800 BCE. The mechanism of its expansion is a topic of long-standing debate, with support for both cultural diffusion and human migration. We present new genome-wide ancient DNA data from 170 Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age Europeans, including 100 Beaker-associated individuals. In contrast to the Corded Ware Complex, which has previously been identified as arriving in central Europe following migration from the east, we observe limited genetic affinity between Iberian and central European Beaker Complex-associated individuals, and thus exclude migration as a significant mechanism of spread between these two regions. However, human migration did have an important role in the further dissemination of the Beaker Complex, which we document most clearly in Britain using data from 80 newly reported individuals dating to 3900-1200 BCE. British Neolithic farmers were genetically similar to contemporary populations in continental Europe and in particular to Neolithic Iberians, suggesting that a portion of the farmer ancestry in Britain came from the Mediterranean rather than the Danubian route of farming expansion. Beginning with the Beaker period, and continuing through the Bronze Age, all British individuals harboured high proportions of Steppe ancestry and were genetically closely related to Beaker-associated individuals from the Lower Rhine area. We use these observations to show that the spread of the Beaker Complex to Britain was mediated by migration from the continent that replaced >90% of Britains Neolithic gene pool within a few hundred years, continuing the process that brought Steppe ancestry into central and northern Europe 400 years earlier.",

Successive cycles of dental plaque growth and calcification make it an unusually well-preserved, long-term record of host-microbial interaction in the archaeological record. Recent studies have confirmed the survival of authentic ancient DNA and proteins within historic and prehistoric dental calculus, making it a promising substrate for investigating oral microbiome evolution via direct measurement and comparison of modern and ancient specimens.\\n\\nObjectiveWe present the first comprehensive characterization of the human dental calculus metabolome using a multi-platform approach.\\n\\nMethodsUltra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) quantified 285 metabolites in modern and historic (200 years old) dental calculus, including metabolites of drug and dietary origin. A subset of historic samples was additionally analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography-MS (GC-MS) and UPLC- MS/MS for further characterization of polar metabolites and lipids, respectively. Metabolite profiles of modern and historic calculus were compared to identify patterns of persistence and loss.\\n\\nResultsDipeptides, free amino acids, free nucleotides, and carbohydrates substantially decrease in abundance and ubiquity in archaeological samples, with some exceptions. Lipids generally persist, and saturated and mono-unsaturated medium and long chain fatty acids appear to be well-preserved, while metabolic derivatives related to oxidation and chemical degradation are found at higher levels in archaeological dental calculus than fresh samples.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results of this study indicate that certain metabolite classes have higher potential for recovery over long time scales and may serve as appropriate targets for oral microbiome evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Tomato leaf mould disease is caused by the biotrophic fungus Cladosporium fulvum. During infection, C. fulvum produces extracellular small secreted protein (SSP) effectors that function to promote colonization of the leaf apoplast. Resistance to the disease is governed by Cf immune receptor genes that encode receptor-like proteins (RLPs). These RLPs recognize specific SSP effectors to initiate a hypersensitive response (HR) that renders the pathogen avirulent. C. fulvum strains capable of overcoming one or more of all cloned Cf genes have now emerged. To combat these strains, new Cf genes are required. An effectoromics approach was employed to identify wild tomato accessions carrying new Cf genes. Proteomics and transcriptome sequencing were first used to identify 70 apoplastic in planta-induced C. fulvum SSPs. Based on sequence homology, 61 of these SSPs were novel or lacked known functional domains. Seven, however, had predicted structural homology to antimicrobial proteins, suggesting a possible role in mediating antagonistic microbe-microbe interactions in planta. Wild tomato accessions were then screened for HR-associated recognition of 41 SSPs using the Potato virus X-based transient expression system. Nine SSPs were recognized by one or more accessions, suggesting that these plants carry new Cf genes available for incorporation into cultivated tomato.",

    "abstract": "Links between epilepsy and Alzheimers disease (AD) are seen in both human patients and mouse models. Human patients with AD may commonly have subclinical epileptiform spikes (EP spikes)1, and overt epilepsy is associated with more rapid cognitive decline2. Mechanistic studies in mouse models of Alzheimers disease (AD) have shown that altered network activity and epileptiform spikes stem from dysfunctional inhibitory interneurons3, which are key elements of cortical circuits underlying cognition4. Treatments that reduce epileptiform spikes improve cognition in these models5,6. Thus, targeting subclinical epileptiform activity may be a promising new therapeutic approach to AD7. Ketogenic diet (KD) has long been used to treat forms of epilepsy8, including Dravet syndrome, a childhood epilepsy caused by mutations in a gene that is critical for inhibitory interneuron function in mouse AD models5,9. However, the concurrent effects of a ketogenic diet on brain electrical activity, cognitive decline, and survival have not been tested, and the translational rationale and feasibility of such an intervention remain uncertain. Here we show that a ketogenic diet reduces epileptiform spikes in the hAPPJ20 mouse model of AD. Similar reduction of EP spikes is observed using a {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ester in both AD and Dravet mice. A ketogenic diet improves context-dependent and visuo-spatial learning in hAPPJ20 mice. It also reduces the high seizure-related mortality observed in male mice of this model. Therapies derived from {beta}-hydroxybutyrate may have potential application in ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in AD through reducing subclinical epileptiform activity.",

Our model produces results in good agreement with available experimental data, and predicts a catenation-dependent effective twist modulus distinct from what is observed for twisted individual double-helix DNAs. We find that buckling occurs near to the point where experiments have observed a kink in the extension versus linking number, and that the subsequent \\\"supercoiled braid\\\" state corresponds to a proliferation of multiple small plectoneme structures. We predict a discontinuity in extension at the buckling transition corresponding to nucleation of the first plectoneme domain. We also find that buckling occurs for lower linking number at lower salt; the opposite trend is observed for supercoiled single DNAs.",

    "abstract": "The spreading and regulation of epigenetic marks on chromosomes is crucial to establish and maintain cellular identity. Nonetheless, the dynamical mechanism leading to the establishment and maintenance of a given, cell-line specific, epigenetic pattern is still poorly understood. In this work we propose, and investigate in silico, a possible experimental strategy to illuminate the interplay between 3D chromatin structure and epigenetic dynamics. We consider a set-up where a reconstituted chromatin fibre is stretched at its two ends (e.g., by laser tweezers), while epigenetic enzymes (writers) and chromatin-binding proteins (readers) are flooded into the system. We show that, by tuning the stretching force and the binding affinity of the readers for chromatin, the fibre undergoes a sharp transition between a stretched, epigenetically disordered, state and a crumpled, epigenetically coherent, one. We further investigate the case in which a knot is tied along the chromatin fibre, and find that the knotted segment enhances local epigenetic order, giving rise to \\\"epigenetic solitons\\\" which travel and diffuse along chromatin. Our results point to an intriguing coupling between 3D chromatin topology and epigenetic dynamics, which may be investigated via single molecule experiments.",

Because the axial positions of the single emitters are encoded in the shape of each single-molecule image rather than in the position or thickness of the light sheet, the light sheet need not be extremely thin. TILT3D is built upon a standard inverted microscope and has minimal custom parts. The result is simple and flexible 3D super-resolution imaging with tens of nm localization precision throughout thick mammalian cells. We validated TILT3D for 3D super-resolution imaging in mammalian cells by imaging mitochondria and the full nuclear lamina using the double-helix PSF for single-molecule detection and the recently developed Tetrapod PSFs for fiducial bead tracking and live axial drift correction.",

    "abstract": "Farming was first introduced to southeastern Europe in the mid-7th millennium BCE - brought by migrants from Anatolia who settled in the region before spreading throughout Europe. To clarify the dynamics of the interaction between the first farmers and indigenous hunter-gatherers where they first met, we analyze genome-wide ancient DNA data from 223 individuals who lived in southeastern Europe and surrounding regions between 12,000 and 500 BCE. We document previously uncharacterized genetic structure, showing a West-East cline of ancestry in hunter-gatherers, and show that some Aegean farmers had ancestry from a different lineage than the northwestern Anatolian lineage that formed the overwhelming ancestry of other European farmers. We show that the first farmers of northern and western Europe passed through southeastern Europe with limited admixture with local hunter-gatherers, but that some groups mixed extensively, with relatively sex-balanced admixture compared to the male-biased hunter-gatherer admixture that prevailed later in the North and West. Southeastern Europe continued to be a nexus between East and West after farming arrived, with intermittent genetic contact from the Steppe up to 2,000 years before the migration that replaced much of northern Europes population.",

    "abstract": "Macroscopic cortical networks are important for cognitive function, but it remains challenging to construct anatomically plausible individual structural connectomes from human neuroimaging. We introduce a new technique for cortical network mapping, based on inter-regional similarity of multiple morphometric parameters measured using multimodal MRI. In three cohorts (two human, one macaque), we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) have a complex topological organisation comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions, and greater inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger inter-regional co-expression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing macaque MSNs to tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was related to axonal connectivity. Finally, variation in the degree of human MSN nodes accounted for about 40% of between-subject variability in IQ. Morphometric similarity mapping provides a novel, robust and biologically plausible approach to understanding how human cortical networks underpin individual differences in psychological functions.",

However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial: one theory proposes that metacognition coincides the decision-making process; and another addresses that it entails an independent neural system in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here we devised a novel paradigm of \\\"decision-redecision\\\" to investigate the metacognition process in redecision, in comparison with the decision process. We here found that the anterior PFC, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were exclusively activated after the initial decisions. dACC was involved in decision uncertainty monitoring, whereas lFPC was involved in decision adjustment controlling, subject to control demands of the tasks. Our findings support that the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further suggest that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.",

Elevating cytosolic Ca2+ levels in NPC cells has been shown to reduce lysosomal lipid storage. Treating Npc1-/- mice with the Ca2+ modulator curcumin led to reduced lipid storage, improved life expectancy and function. These studies led to reported utilisation of curcumin supplements by NPC disease families despite there being no clinical evidence of benefit and a report indicating no benefit of nanoformulated curcumin in Npc1-/- mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether various commercially available curcumin nanoformulations were capable of reproducing the findings obtained with unformulated pharmaceutical grade curcumin. We compared seven curcumin nanoformulations in Npc1-/- mouse astrocytes. All the nanoformulations elevate cytosolic Ca2+ levels but only two lowered lysosomal lipid storage. Importantly, some caused elevations in NPC lysosomal storage and/or decreased cellular viability. Although this is an in vitro study, our findings suggest that care should be taken when contemplating the use of curcumin supplements for NPC disease.",

    "abstract": "The ability of powered flight in insects facilitated their great evolutionary success allowing them to occupy various ecological niches. Beyond this primary task, wings are often involved in various premating behaviors, such as the generation of courtship songs and the initiation of mating in flight. These specific functions imply special adaptations of wing morphology, as well as sex-specific wing morphologies. Although wing morphology has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, a comprehensive understa nding of sexual wing shape dimorphisms and developmental plasticity is missing for other Diptera. Therefore, we raised flies of the three Diptera species Drosophila melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata and Musca domestica at different environmental conditions and applied geometric morphometrics to analyze wing shape. Our data showed extensive interspecific differences in wing shape, as well as a clear sexual wing shape dimorphism in all three species. We revealed an impact of different rearing temperatures wing shape in all three species, which was mostly explained by plasticity in wing size in D. melanogaster. Rearing densities had significant effects on allometric wing shape in D. melanogaster, while no obvious effects were observed for the other two species. Additionally, we do not find evidence for sex-specific response to different rearing conditions in all three species. We determined species-specific and common trends in shape alterations, and we hypothesize developmental and functional implications of our data.\n\nContribution to the Field StatementThe size and shape of organisms and organs must be tightly controlled during development to ensure proper functionality. However, morphological traits vary considerably in nature contributing to phenotypic diversity. Such variation can be the result of evolutionary adaptations as well as plasticity for example as reaction to changing environmental conditions during development. It is therefore a major aim in Biology to unravel the processes that control differences in adult morphology. Insect wings are excellent models to study how organ size and shape evolves because they facilitate basic tasks such as mating and feeding. Accordingly, a tremendous variety of wings sizes and shapes evolved in nature. Additionally, plasticity in wing morphology in response to different rearing conditions has been observed in many insects contributing to phenotypic diversity. In this work we applied Geometric Morphometrics to study wing shape in the three Diptera species: the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, the Vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster and the housefly Musca domestica. Flies were raised in different temperature and density regimes that allowed us to study the effects of these environmental factors on wing shape. Additionally, in accordance with different mating behaviors of these flies, we observed a clear sexual shape dimorphism in all three species. Since the three studied species represent serious pests and disease vectors, our findings may contribute to existing and future monitoring efforts.",

    "abstract": "Unlike synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability is assumed to be a stable property of neurons. For example, learning of somatic conductances is generally not incorporated into computational models, and the discharge pattern of neurons in response to test stimuli is frequently used as a basis for phenotypic classification. However, it is increasingly evident that signal processing properties of neurons are more generally plastic on the timescale of minutes. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic firing patterns of CA3 neurons of the rat hippocampus in vitro undergo rapid long-term plasticity in response to a few minutes of only subthreshold synaptic conditioning. This plasticity on the spike-timing could also be induced by intrasomatic injection of subthreshold depolarizing pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors, indicating that discharge dynamics are modulated locally. Cluster analysis of firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the patterns initially exhibited by the cells. We used a conductance-based model to decide appropriate pharmacological blockade, and found that the observed transitions are likely due to recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances. We conclude that CA3 neurons adapt their conductance profile to the subthreshold activity of their input, so that their intrinsic firing pattern is not a static signature, but rather a reflection of their history of subthreshold activity. In this way, recurrent output from CA3 neurons may collectively shape the temporal dynamics of their embedding circuits.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDespite being widely conserved across the animal phyla, it is still a mystery why nerve cells present diverse discharge dynamics upon somatic step currents. Adding a new timing dimension to the intrinsic plasticity literature, here we show that CA3 neurons rapidly adapt through the space of known firing patterns in response to the subthreshold signals that they receive from their embedding circuit. This result implies that CA3 neurons collectively adjust their network processing to the temporal statistics of their circuit.",
