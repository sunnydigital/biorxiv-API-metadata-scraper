    "abstract": "A detailed study of the holotype of Sphecomyrma canadensis Wilson, 1985 from Canadian amber has led to the conclusion that the specimen belongs to a new genus, here named Boltonimecia gen.n. Since the taxonomy of stem-group ants is not well understood, in order to find the taxonomic position of this genus, it is necessary to review the classification of stem-group ants in a study of their relation to crown-group ants. In the absence of data for traditional taxonomic approaches, a statistical study was done based on a morphometric analysis of antennae. Scape elongation is believed to play an important role in the evolution of eusociality in ants; however, this hypothesis has never been confirmed statistically. The statistical analysis presented herein lends support to the view that antennal morphology reliably distinguishes stem-group ants from crown-group ants to determine whether a species belongs to one or the other group. This, in turn, may indicate a relationship exists between eusociality and scape elongation. A review of Cretaceous records of ants is made and the higher classification of Formicidae with definitions of stem and crown groups is proposed. Newly obtained data are discussed focusing particularly on the origin, evolution and diversity of ants.",

    "abstract": "Task demands modulate tactile localization in sighted humans, presumably through weight adjustments in the spatial integration of anatomical, skin-based, and external, posture-based information. In contrast, previous studies have suggested that congenitally blind humans, by default, refrain from automatic spatial integration and localize touch using only skin-based information. Here, sighted and congenitally blind participants localized tactile targets on the palm or back of one hand, while ignoring simultaneous tactile distractors at congruent or incongruent locations on the other hand. We probed the interplay of anatomical and external location codes for spatial congruency effects by varying hand posture: the palms either both faced down, or one faced down and one up. In the latter posture, externally congruent target and distractor locations were anatomically incongruent and vice versa. Target locations had to be reported either anatomically (\\\"palm\\\" or \\\"back\\\" of the hand), or externally (\\\"up\\\" or \\\"down\\\" in space). Under anatomical instructions, performance was better for anatomically congruent than incongruent target-distractor pairs. In contrast, under external instructions, performance was better for externally congruent than incongruent pairs. These modulations were evident in sighted and blind individuals. Notably, distractor effects were overall far smaller in blind than in sighted participants, despite comparable target-distractor identification performance. Thus, the absence of developmental vision seems to be associated with an increased ability to focus tactile attention towards a non-spatially defined target. Nevertheless, that blind individuals exhibited effects of hand posture and task instructions in their congruency effects suggests that, like the sighted,, they automatically integrate anatomical and external information during tactile localization. Moreover, spatial integration in tactile processing is, thus, flexibly adapted by top-down information - here, task instruction - even in the absence of developmental vision.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic determinants of phenotypes that impact on disease severity is of fundamental importance for the design of new interventions against malaria. Traditionally, such discovery has relied on labor-intensive approaches that require significant investments of time and resources. By combining Linkage Group Selection (LGS), quantitative whole genome population sequencing and a novel mathematical modeling approach (qSeq-LGS), we simultaneously identified multiple genes underlying two distinct phenotypes, identifying novel alleles for growth rate and strain specific immunity (SSI), while removing the need for traditionally required steps such as cloning, individual progeny phenotyping and marker generation. The detection of novel variants, verified by experimental phenotyping methods, demonstrates the remarkable potential of this approach for the identification of genes controlling selectable phenotypes in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites for which experimental genetic crosses are amenable.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis paper describes a powerful and rapid approach to the discovery of genes underlying medically important phenotypes in malaria parasites. This is crucial for the design of new drug and vaccine interventions. The approach bypasses the most time-consuming steps required by traditional genetic linkage studies and combines Mendelian genetics, quantitative deep sequencing technologies, genome analysis and mathematical modeling. We demonstrate that the approach can simultaneously identify multigenic drivers of multiple phenotypes, thus allowing complex genotyping studies to be conducted concomitantly. This methodology will be particularly useful for discovering the genetic basis of medically important phenotypes such as drug resistance and virulence in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites, as well as potentially in any organism undergoing sexual recombination.",

    "abstract": "The factors guiding retrotransposon insertion site preference are not well understood. Different types of retrotransposons share common replication machinery and yet occupy distinct genomic domains. Autonomous long interspersed elements accumulate in gene-poor domains and their non-autonomous short interspersed elements accumulate in gene-rich domains. To determine genomic factors that contribute to this discrepancy we analysed the distribution of retrotransposons within the framework of chromosomal domains and regulatory elements. Using comparative genomics, we identified large-scale conserved patterns of retrotransposon accumulation across several mammalian genomes. Importantly, retrotransposons that were active after our sample-species diverged accumulated in orthologous regions. This suggested a similar evolutionary interaction between retrotransposon activity and conserved genome architecture across our species. In addition, we found that retrotransposons accumulated at regulatory element boundaries in open chromatin, where accumulation of particular retrotransposon types depended on insertion size and local regulatory element density. From our results, we propose a model where density and distribution of genes and regulatory elements canalise retrotransposon accumulation. Through conservation of synteny, gene regulation and nuclear organisation, mammalian genomes with dissimilar retrotransposons follow similar evolutionary trajectories.",

Although F. nucleatum abundance is increased in inflammatory bowel disease subjects and is prevalent in colorectal cancer patients, the causal role of the bacterium in gastrointestinal disorders and the mechanistic details of host cell functions subversion are not fully understood.\\n\\nWe devised a computational strategy to identify putative secreted F. nucleatum proteins (FusoSecretome) and to infer their interactions with human proteins based on the presence of host molecular mimicry elements. FusoSecretome proteins share similar features with known bacterial virulence factors thereby highlighting their pathogenic potential. We show that they interact with human proteins that participate in infection-related cellular processes and localize in established cellular districts of the host-pathogen interface. Our network-based analysis identified 31 functional modules in the human interactome preferentially targeted by 138 FusoSecretome proteins, among which we selected 26 as main candidate virulence proteins, representing both putative and known virulence proteins. Finally, 6 of the preferentially targeted functional modules are implicated in the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.\\n\\nOverall, our computational analysis identified candidate virulence proteins potentially involved in the F. nucleatum - human cross-talk in the context of gastrointestinal diseases.",

The existence of persistent genetic variation within natural populations presents an evolutionary problem as natural selection and genetic drift tend to erode genetic diversity. Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the high and sometimes extreme levels of polymorphism found in many natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection may be the most powerful selective force maintaining balanced natural polymorphisms but it is also commonly misinterpreted. The aim of this review is to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of natural polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss observational and experimental data that can aid in accurately identifying the processes that generated or are maintain diversity in nature. Finally, I consider the importance of accurately describing the processes affecting genetic diversity within populations as it relates to research progress.",

The consequences of regional heterogeneity in vaccination coverage on transmission and prevalence of HPV-16 are unclear.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a deterministic, population-based model that describes HPV-16 transmission among young adults within and between the 26 cantons of Switzerland. We parameterized the model using sexual behavior data from Switzerland and data from the Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey. First, we investigated the general consequences of heterogeneity in vaccination uptake between two sub-populations. We then compared the predicted prevalence of HPV-16 after the introduction of heterogeneous HPV vaccination uptake in all of Switzerland with homogeneous vaccination at an uptake that is identical to the national average (52%).\\n\\nResultsHPV-16 prevalence in women is 3.34% when vaccination is introduced and begins to diverge across cantons, ranging from 0.14 to 1.09% after 15 years of vaccination. After the same time period, overall prevalence of HPV-16 in Switzerland is only marginally higher (0.55 %) with heterogeneous vaccination uptake than with homogeneous uptake (0.49%). Assuming inter-cantonal sexual mixing, cantons with low vaccination uptake benefit from a reduction in prevalence at the expense of cantons with high vaccination uptake.\\n\\nConclusionsRegional variations in uptake diminish the overall effect of vaccination on HPV-16 prevalence in Switzerland, although the effect size is small. Cantonal efforts towards HPV-prevalence reduction by increasing vaccination uptake are impaired by cantons with low vaccination uptake. Harmonization of cantonal vaccination programs would reduce inter-cantonal differences in HPV-16 prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Depression and anxiety disorders are the first and sixth leading cause of disability worldwide according to latest reports from the World Health Organization. Despite their high prevalence and the significant disability resulted, there are limited advances in new drug development. On the other hand, the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has greatly improved our understanding of the genetic basis underlying psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nIn this work we employed gene-set analyses of GWAS summary statistics for drug repositioning. We explored five related GWAS datasets, including two on major depressive disorder (MDD-PGC and MDD-CONVERGE, with the latter focusing on severe melancholic depression), one on anxiety disorders, and two on depressive symptoms and neuroticism in the population. We extracted gene-sets associated with each drug from DSigDB and examined their association with each GWAS phenotype. We also performed repositioning analyses on meta-analyzed GWAS data, integrating evidence from all related phenotypes.\\n\\nImportantly, we showed that the repositioning hits are generally enriched for known psychiatric medications or those considered in clinical trials, except for MDD-PGC. Enrichment was seen for antidepressants and anxiolytics but also for antipsychotics. We also revealed new candidates or drug classes for repositioning, some of which were supported by experimental or clinical studies. For example, the top repositioning hit using meta-analyzed p-values was fendiline, which was shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in mouse models by inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase and reducing ceramide levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that human genomic data such as GWAS are useful in guiding drug discoveries for depression and anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal activates a neuronal ensemble in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) that is responsible for high levels of uncontrolled alcohol drinking. However, the neuronal phenotypes and circuits controlled by these neurons are unknown. We investigated the cellular identity of this CeA neuronal ensemble and found that most neurons expressed corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Using Crh-Cre transgenic rats combined with in vivo optogenetics, we tested the role of CeA CRF neurons and their projections in excessive alcohol self-administration during withdrawal. Rats were injected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP or AAV-DIO-eYFP and implanted with optical fibers over the CeA. Animals were then exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor to induce alcohol dependence. Inactivation of CeA CRF neurons decreased alcohol drinking in dependent rats to non-dependent levels and completely suppressed activation of the CeA neuronal ensemble (Fos+ neurons) during withdrawal. No effects were observed on water or saccharin self-administration. In a second experiment, CeA CRF neurons were infected with AAV-DIO-NpHR-eYFP and optical fibers were implanted into downstream projection regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), lateral hypothalamus (LH), parasubthalamic nucleus (pSTN), substantia innominata (SI), and parabrachial nuclei (PBN). Optogenetic inactivation of CRF terminals in the BNST reduced alcohol drinking and withdrawal signs, whereas inactivation of all other projections had no effect. These results demonstrate that CeA CRF neurons and their projections to the BNST drive excessive alcohol drinking and withdrawal in dependent rats.",

We confirm and augment prior risk gene and gene set enrichment results for SCZ and NDDs. In particular, we detected 98 new DD risk genes at FDR < 0.05. Correlations of risk-gene posterior probabilities are high across four NDDs ({rho} > 0.55), but low between SCZ and the NDDs ({rho} < 0.3). In depth analysis of 288 NDD genes shows highly significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and functionally distinct PPI subnetworks based on pathway enrichments, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) cell types and multi-region developmental brain RNA-seq.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have extended a pipeline used in ASD studies and applied it to infer rare genetic parameters for SCZ and four NDDs. We find many new DD risk genes, supported by gene set enrichment and PPI network connectivity analyses. We find greater similarity among NDDs than between NDDs and SCZ. NDD gene subnetworks are implicated in postnatally expressed presynaptic and postsynaptic genes, and for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in prenatal neural progenitor and stem cells.",

    "abstract": "The Root-Knot Nematodes (RKN; genus Meloidogyne) are important plant parasites causing substantial agricultural losses. The Meloidogyne incognita group (MIG) of species, most of which are obligatory apomicts (mitotic parthenogens), are extremely polyphagous and important problems for global agriculture. While understanding the genomic basis for their variable success on different crops could benefit future agriculture, analyses of their genomes pose challenges due to complex evolutionary histories that may incorporate hybridization, ploidy changes, and chromosomal fragmentation. Here we sequence 19 genomes, representing five species of key RKN collected from different geographic origins. We show that a hybrid origin that predated speciation within the MIG has resulted in each species possessing two divergent genomic copies. Additionally, the MIG apomicts are hypotriploids, with a proportion of one genome present in a second copy, and this proportion varies among species. The evolutionary history of the MIG genomes is revealed to be very dynamic, with non-crossover recombination both homogenising the genomic copies, and acting as a mechanism for generating divergence between species. Interestingly, the automictic MIG species M. floridensis differs from the apomict species in that it has become homozygous throughout much of its genome.",

    "abstract": "During embryogenesis, signaling molecules initiate cell diversification, sometimes via stochastic processes, other times via the formation of long range gradients of activity which pattern entire fields of cells. Such mechanisms are not insensitive to noise (Lander, 2011), yet embryogenesis is a remarkably robust process suggesting that multiple layers of regulations secure patterning during development. In the present study, we present a proof of concept according to which an asymmetric pattern of gene expression obtained from a spatially disorganised population of cells can be guided by the geometry of the environment in a reproducible and robust manner. We used ESC as a model system whithin which multiple developmental cell states coexist (MacArthur and Lemischka, 2013; Smith, 2017; Torres-Padilla and Chambers, 2014). We first present evidence that a reciprocal regulation of genes involved in the establishment of antero-posterior polarity during peri-implantation stages of mouse development is spontaneously occuring within ESC. We then show that a population of cells with primitive streak characteristics localise in regions of high curvature and low cell density. Finally, we show that this patterning did not depend on self-organised gradients of morphogen activity but instead could be attributed to positional rearrangements. Our findings unveil a novel role for tissue geometry in guiding the self-patterning of primitive streak cells and provide a framework to further refine our understanding of symmetry breaking events occuring in ESC aggregates. Finally, this work demonstrates that the self-patterning of a specific population of ESC, Brachyury positive cells in this case, can be directed by providing engineered external geometrical cues.",

Most genes involved in stress response have been identified using mutant screens or gene knockdowns. Yet, there is limited understanding of the temporal dynamics of global gene expression in stressful environments. Here, we studied global gene expression profiles during 12 hours of heat stress in the nematode C. elegans. Using a high-resolution time series of increasing stress exposures, we found a distinct shift in gene expression patterns between 3-4 hours into the stress response, separating an initially highly dynamic phase from a later relatively stagnant phase. This turning point in expression dynamics coincided with a phenotypic turning point, as shown by a strong decrease in movement, survival and, progeny count in the days following the stress. Both detectable at transcriptional and phenotypic level, this study pin-points a relatively small time frame during heat stress at which enough damage is accumulated, making it impossible to recover the next few days.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany metagenome analysis tools are presently available to classify sequences and profile environmental samples. In particular, taxonomic profiling and binning methods are commonly used for such tasks. Tools available among these two categories make use of several techniques, e.g. read mapping, k-mer alignment, and composition analysis. Variations on the construction of the corresponding reference sequence databases are also common. In addition, different tools provide good results in different datasets and configurations. All this variation creates a complicated scenario to researchers to decide which methods to use. Installation, configuration and execution can also be difficult especially when dealing with multiple datasets and tools.\\n\\nResultsWe propose MetaMeta: a pipeline to execute and integrate results from metagenome analysis tools. MetaMeta provides an easy workflow to run multiple tools with multiple samples, producing a single enhanced output profile for each sample. MetaMeta includes a database generation, pre-processing, execution, and integration steps, allowing easy execution and parallelization. The integration relies on the co-occurrence of organisms from different methods as the main feature to improve community profiling while accounting for differences in their databases.\\n\\nConclusionsIn a controlled case with simulated and real data we show that the integrated profiles of MetaMeta overcome the best single profile. Using the same input data, it provides more sensitive and reliable results with the presence of each organism being supported by several methods. MetaMeta uses Snakemake and has six pre-configured tools, all available at BioConda channel for easy installation (conda install-c bioconda metameta).

We train supervised and semi-supervised support vector machines with protein sequences, represented by their amino acid composition as well as protein family and domain information. Our results indicate, somewhat surprisingly, that quite modest amount of proteins with experimental data are required to build a state-of-the-art classifier and that additional unlabeled sequences in semi-supervised models do not bring increased predictive performance. Our experiments in cross-species prediction show that models trained for the filamentous fungus A. niger protein dataset can be generalized to predict protein producibility in T. reesei, and vice versa, without sacrificing too much accuracy, regardless of their approximately 500 millions years of divergence. However, predictors trained on E. coli and S. cerevisiae datasets gave variable performance when applied to the filamentous fungi datasets, indicating that while protein producibility prediction can be generalized accross related species, fully generic prediction tools applicable to any protein production host may not be realistic to achieve.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is, together with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the most established platform to perform metabolomics. In contrast to LC-MS however, NMR data is predominantly being processed with commercial software. This has the effect that its data processing remains tedious and dependent on user interventions. As a follow-up to speaq, a previously released workflow for NMR spectral alignment and quantitation, we present speaq 2.0. This completely revised framework to automatically analyze 1D NMR spectra uses wavelets to efficiently summarize the raw spectra with minimal information loss or user interaction. The tool offers a fast and easy workflow that starts with the common approach of peak-picking, followed by grouping. This yields a matrix consisting of features, samples and peak values that can be conveniently processed either by using included multivariate statistical functions or by using many other recently developed methods for NMR data analysis. speaq 2.0 facilitates robust and high-throughput metabolomics based on 1D NMR but is also compatible with other NMR frameworks or complementary LC-MS workflows. The methods are benchmarked using two publicly available datasets. speaq 2.0 is distributed through the existing speaq R package to provide a complete solution for NMR data processing. The package and the code for the presented case studies are freely available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=speaq) and GitHub (https://github.com/beirnaert/speaq).\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe present speaq 2.0: a user friendly workflow for processing NMR spectra quickly and easily. By limiting the need for user interaction and allowing the construction of workflows by combining R functions, metabolomics data analysis becomes fully reproducible and shareable. Such advances are critical for the future of the metabolomics field as it needs to move towards a fully open-science approach. This is no trivial goal as many researchers are still using black-box commercial software that often requires manually doing several steps, thus hampering reproducibility. To encourage the shift towards open source, we deliberately made our method usable for anyone with the most basic of R experience, something that is easily acquired. speaq 2.0 allows a stand-alone analysis from spectra to statistical analysis. In addition, the package can be combined with existing tools to improve performance, as it provides a superior peak picking method compared to the standard binning approach.",

Although the network components and their properties are known, the requirements for contractility are still poorly understood. Here, we describe a theory that predicts whether an isotropic network will contract, expand, or conserve its dimensions. This analytical theory correctly predicts the behavior of simulated networks consisting of filaments with varying combinations of connectors, and reveals conditions under which networks of rigid filaments are either contractile or expansile. Our results suggest that pulsatility is an intrinsic behavior of contractile networks if the filaments are not stable but turn over. The theory offers a unifying framework to think about mechanisms of contractions or expansion. It provides a foundation for the study of a broad range of processes involving cytoskeletal networks, and a basis for designing synthetic networks.",

    "abstract": "Large scale forest inventories are often undertaken following a stratified random or systematic design. Yet the strata rarely correspond to the reporting areas of interest (domains) over which the country wants to report specific variables. The process is exemplified by a country aiming to use national forest inventory data to obtain average biomass estimates per forest type for GHGI international reporting, where activity data (areas of land use or land use changes) and emission factors (carbon coefficients) are typically compiled from disparate sources and estimated using different sampling schemes. This study aims to provide a decision tree for the use of data obtained from forest surveys to draw conclusions about population sub-groups created after (and independently of) the sample selection. While bias can arise whenever activity data and emission factors are calculated independently, it can be eliminated in case of a simple random or simple systematic design if properly weighted estimators are provided. This manuscript describes two unbiased estimators that can be used to estimate reporting-strata means, regardless of the sampling design adopted, and extends the result to the common situation in which the reporting-strata are spatially explicit, where a nested group estimator outperforms in terms of both bias and precision other more traditional estimators. From this estimator, an optimal sample allocation scheme is also derived.",

    "abstract": "Migration is a ubiquitous life history trait with profound evolutionary and ecological consequences. Recent developments in telemetry and genomics, when combined, can bring significant insights on the migratory ecology of non-model organisms in the wild. Here, we used this integrative approach to document dispersal, gene flow and potential for local adaptation in anadromous Arctic Char from six rivers in the Canadian Arctic. Acoustic telemetry data from 124 tracked individuals indicated asymmetric dispersal, with a large proportion of fish (72%) tagged in three different rivers migrating up the same short river in the fall. Population genomics data from 6,136 SNP markers revealed weak, albeit significant, population differentiation (average pairwise FST = 0.011) and asymmetric dispersal was also revealed by population assignments. Approximate Bayesian Computation simulations suggested the presence of asymmetric gene flow, although in the opposite direction to that observed from the telemetry data, suggesting that dispersal does not necessarily lead to gene flow. These observations suggested that Arctic Char home to their natal river to spawn, but may overwinter in rivers with the shortest migratory route to minimize the costs of migration in non-breeding years. Genome scans and genetic-environment associations identified 90 outlier markers putatively under selection, 23 of which were in or near a gene. Of these, at least four were involved in muscle and cardiac function, consistent with the hypothesis that migratory harshness could drive local adaptation. Our study illustrates the power of integrating genomics and telemetry to study migrations in non-model organisms in logistically challenging environments such as the Arctic.",

    "abstract": "Geographical areas where two species come into contact and hybridize serve as natural laboratories for assessing mechanisms that limit gene flow between species. The ranges of about half of all closely related Drosophila species overlap, and the genomes of several pairs reveal signatures of past introgression. However, only two contemporary hybrid zones have been characterized in the genus, and both are recently diverged sister species (D. simulans-D. sechellia, Ks = 0.05; D. yakuba-D. santomea, Ks = 0.048). Here we present evidence of a new hybrid zone, and the ecological mechanisms that maintain it, between two highly divergent Drosophila species (Ks = 0.11). On the island of Bioko in west Africa, D. teissieri occupies mostly forests, D. yakuba occupies mostly open agricultural areas, and recently, we discovered that hybrids between these species occur near the interface of these habitats. Genome sequencing revealed that all field-sampled hybrids are F1 progeny of D. yakuba females and D. teissieri males. We found no evidence for either advanced-generation hybrids or F1 hybrids produced by D. teissieri females and D.yakuba males. The lack of advanced-generation hybrids on Bioko is consistent with mark-recapture and laboratory experiments that we conducted, which indicate hybrids have a maladaptive combination of traits. Like D. yakuba, hybrids behaviorally prefer open habitat that is relatively warm and dry, but like D. teissieri, hybrids have low desiccation tolerance, which we predict leaves them physiologically ill-equipped to cope with their preferred habitat. These observations are consistent with recent findings of limited introgression in the D. yakuba clade and identify an ecological mechanism for limiting gene flow between D. yakuba and D. teissieri; namely, selection against hybrids that we have documented, in combination with hybrid male sterility, contributes to the maintenance of this narrow (~30m), stable hybrid zone centered on the forest-open habitat ecotone. Our results show how a deleterious combination of parental traits can result in unfit or maladapted hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing of mutants is one of the most widely used techniques to identify genes that control traits of interest including human diseases. Traditionally, variants are called against reference genomes and various filtering techniques are applied to reduce the number of candidate mutations. However, if the genetic background of the mutant is different from the reference genome, the number of background variants may exceed the number of true mutations by several orders of magnitude resulting in candidate lists that cannot be effectively reduced.\\n\\nWe introduce the problem of differential variant calling in mutants from diverse genetic backgrounds. In the example of a mutant strain of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, where the genetic background is not identical to the reference genome ({approx}1% genome-wide divergence), we show that simple intersection filtering does not effectively reduce the list of candidate mutations due to the combined effect of high number of background mutations, missing coverage in the wildtype sample, and problematic regions in the genome assembly. Although restriction to sites with coverage in mutant and wildtype sample greatly reduced the number of candidate sites, we further improved this candidate set by implementing a customized variant calling procedure. This takes the mutant sample and the control sample of same genetic background as input and calls variants exhibiting strong discriminative signals across the two samples. Intersecting the candidate mutations with an interval identfied from mapping by RAD-seq revealed a likely splice-site mutation in the P. pacificus dpy-1 gene, which has been previously shown to cause the associated morphological phenotype.\\n\\nOur study shows that combined analysis of mutant and wildtype samples drastically increases the potential to find true mutations. We hope that these results may be helpful for other model systems, where the identification of candidate mutants is complicated by assembly errors, lab-derived mutations, or different genetic backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "The influenza A virus genome consists of eight segments of single-stranded RNA. These segments are replicated and transcribed by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is made up of the influenza virus proteins PB1, PB2 and PA. To copy the viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments and the complementary RNA (cRNA) segments, the replicative intermediate of viral replication, the RdRp must use two promoters and two different de novo initiation mechanisms. On the vRNA promoter, the RdRp initiates on the 3 terminus, while on the cRNA promoter the RdRp initiates internally and subsequently realigns the nascent vRNA product to ensure that the template is copied in full. In particular the latter process, which is also used by other RNA viruses, is not understood. Here we provide mechanistic insight into prime-realignment during influenza virus replication and show that it is controlled by the priming loop and a helix-loop-helix motif of the PB1 subunit of the RdRp. Overall, these observations advance our understanding of how the influenza A virus initiates viral replication and amplifies the genome correctly.\\n\\nImportanceInfluenza A viruses cause severe disease in humans and are considered a major threat to our economy and health. The viruses replicate and transcribe their genome using an enzyme called the RNA polymerases. To ensure that the genome is amplified faithfully and abundant viral mRNAs are made for viral protein synthesis, the RNA polymerase must work correctly. In this report, we provide insight into the mechanism that the RNA polymerase employs to ensure that the viral genome is copied correctly.",

    "abstract": "In vitro antibacterial susceptibility testing informs clinical decision making concerning antibacterial therapeutics. Predicting, in a timely manner, which bacterial infection will respond to treatment by a given antibacterial drug reduces morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. It also allows prudent antibacterial use, because clinicians can focus on the least broad-spectrum agent suitable for each patient. Existing susceptibly testing methodologies rely on growth of bacteria in the presence of an antibacterial drug. There is significant interest in the possibility of predicting antibacterial drug susceptibility directly though the analysis of bacterial DNA or protein, because this may lead to more rapid susceptibility testing directly from clinical samples. Here we report a robust and tractable methodology that allows measurement of the abundance of key proteins responsible for antibacterial drug resistance within samples of 1 {micro}g of total bacterial protein. The method allowed correct prediction of {beta}-lactam susceptibility in clinical isolates from four key bacterial species and added considerable value over and above the information generated by whole genome sequencing, allowing for gene expression, not just gene presence to be considered, which is key when considering the complex interplays of multiple mechanisms of resistance.",

Here we report a comprehensive analysis using transformation and in vitro mutant selection, of the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in fluoroquinolone resistance and non-susceptibility, using Klebsiella pneumoniae, one of the most clinically important multi-drug resistant bacterial species known, as a model system. Our improved biological understanding was then used to generate rules that could be predict fluoroquinolone susceptibility in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. Key to the success of this predictive process was the use of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to measure the abundance of proteins in extracts of cultured bacteria, identifying which sequence variants seen in the whole genome sequence data were functionally important in the context of fluoroquinolone susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process whereby cells undergo reversible phenotypic change, losing epithelial characteristics and acquiring mesenchymal attributes. While EMT underlies normal, physiological programs in embryonic tissue development and adult wound healing, it also contributes to cancer progression by facilitating metastasis and altering drug sensitivity. Using a cell model of EMT (human mammary epithelial (HMLE) cells), we show that miRNAs act as an additional regulatory layer over and above the activity of the transcription factors with which they are closely associated. In this context, miRNAs serve to both enhance expression changes for genes with EMT function, whilst simultaneously reducing transcriptional noise in non-EMT genes. We find that members of the polycistronic miR-200c~141 and miR-183~182 clusters (which are decreased during HMLE cell EMT and are associated with epithelial gene expression in breast cancer patients) co-regulate common targets and pathways to enforce an epithelial phenotype. We demonstrate their combinatorial effects are apparent much closer to endogenous expression levels (and orders of magnitude lower than used in most studies). Importantly, the low levels of combinatorial miRNAs that are required to exert biological function ameliorate the \\\"off-target\\\" effects on gene expression that are a characteristic of supra-physiologic miRNA manipulation. We argue that high levels of over-expression characteristic of many miRNA functional studies have led to an over-estimation of the effect of many miRNAs in EMT regulation, with over 130 individual miRNAs directly implicated as drivers of EMT. We propose that the functional effects of co-regulated miRNAs that we demonstrate here more-accurately reflects the endogenous post-transcriptional regulation of pathways, networks and processes, and illustrates that the post-transcriptional miRNA regulatory network is fundamentally cooperative.",

Using this illuminator, we have shown that Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) concentrations as low as 250 nM can be used to detect induced Ca2+ events in tsA-201 cells and while utilizing the 150 s switching speeds available, it was possible to image spontaneous Ca2+ transients in hippocampal neurons at a rate of 24.39 Hz that were blunted or absent at typical 0.5 Hz acquisition rates.

We simulate N400 amplitudes as the change induced by an incoming stimulus in an implicit and probabilistic representation of meaning captured by the hidden unit activation pattern in a neural network model of sentence comprehension, and we propose that the process underlying the N400 also drives implicit learning in the network.

This can lead to the emergence of unwanted coupling between the expression of different genes, complicating circuit design and potentially leading to circuit failure. Here we demonstrate the ability of orthogonal ribosomes to alleviate the effects of this resource competition. We partition the ribosome pool by expressing an engineered 16S RNA with altered specificity, and use this division of specificity to build simple resource allocators which reduce the level of ribosome-mediated gene coupling. We then design and implement a dynamic resource allocation controller, which acts to increase orthogonal ribosome production as the demand for translational resources by a synthetic circuit increases. Our results highlight the potential of dynamic translational resource allocation as a means of minimising the impact of cellular limitations on the function of synthetic circuitry.",

We developed this technology for dynamical systems, identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base pairing interactions alone suffice for arbitrarily complex dynamics.

    "abstract": "Daily alignment of the microscope is a prerequisite to reaching optimal illumination lens and imaging lens conditions for high resolution imaging in cryo-EM. In contrast to the dramatic progress in automated image acquisition and post-image processing techniques, less attention has been paid to the improvement of microscope alignment before data collection. In this study, we have employed our recently published tool, s2stigmator, to study how image astigmatism varies with the imaging conditions (e.g. defocus, magnification). We have found that the large change of defocus/magnification between visual correction of astigmatism and subsequent data collection tasks, or even during data collection will inevitably result in undesirable residual astigmatism in the final images. Furthermore, the dependence of astigmatism on the imaging conditions varies significantly from time to time, so that it cannot be reliably compensated by pre-calibration of the microscope. These findings have essentially invalidated a basic assumption of current cryo-EM imaging strategies that assumes invariant astigmatism for different defocuses/magnifications used in the microscope alignment stage and the final data acquisition stage. Based on these findings, we recommend the same magnification and the median defocus of the intended defocus range for final data collection are used in the objective lens astigmatism correction task during microscope alignment and in the focus mode of the iterative low-dose imaging. It is also desirable to develop a fast, accurate method that can perform dynamic correction of the astigmatism for different intended defocuses during automated imaging.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of stage-structured populations facing variability in resource availability and/or demographic factors like unequal sex-ratios, remains poorly understood. We addressed these issues using a stage-structured individual-based model that incorporates life-history parameters common to many holometabolous insects. The model was calibrated using time series data from a 49-generation experiment on laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster, subjected to four different combinations of larval and adult nutritional levels. The model was able to capture multiple qualitative and quantitative aspects of the empirical time series across three independent studies. We then simulated the model to explore the interaction of various life-history parameters and nutritional levels in determining population stability. In all nutritional regimes, stability of the populations was reduced upon increasing egg-hatchability, critical mass and proportion of body resource allocated to female fecundity. However, the stability-effects of increasing sensitivity of female-fecundity to adult density varied across nutrition regimes. The effects of unequal sex-ratio and sex-specific culling were greatly influenced by fecundity but not by levels of juvenile nutrition. Finally, we investigated the implications of some of these insights on the efficiency of the widely-used pest control method, Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We show that increasing the amount of juvenile food had no effects on SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is low, but reduces SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is high.",

We report four new comammox Nitrospira genomes, constituting two novel species, and the first comparative genomic analysis on comammox Nitrospira.\\n\\nComammox Nitrospira has lost the potential to use external nitrite as energy and nitrogen source: compared to strictly nitrite oxidizing Nitrospira; they lack genes for assimilative nitrite reduction and reverse electron transport from nitrite. By contrast, compared to other Nitrospira, their ammonium oxidizer physiology is exemplified by genes for ammonium and urea transporters and copper homeostasis and the lack of cyanate hydratase genes. Two comammox clades are different in their ammonium uptake systems. Contrary to {beta}-AOB, comammox Nitrospira genomes have single copies of the two central ammonium oxidation pathway genes, lack genes involved in nitric oxide reduction, and encode genes that would allow efficient growth at low oxygen concentrations. Hence, comammox Nitrospira seems attuned to oligotrophy and hypoxia compared to {beta}-AOB.\\n\\n{beta}-AOBs are the clear origin of the ammonium oxidation pathway in comammox Nitrospira: reconciliation analysis indicates two separate early amoA gene transfer events from {beta}-AOB to an ancestor of comammox Nitrospira, followed by clade specific losses. For haoA, one early transfer from {beta}-AOB to comammox Nitrospira is predicted - followed by intra-clade transfers. We postulate that the absence of comammox genes in most Nitrospira genomes is the result of subsequent loss.\\n\\nSignificanceThe recent discovery of comammox bacteria - members of the Nitrospira genus able to fully oxidize ammonia to nitrate - upset the long-held conviction that nitrification is a two-step process. It also opened key questions on the ecological and evolutionary relations of these bacteria with other nitrifying prokaryotes. Here, we report the first comparative genomic analysis of comammox Nitrospira and related nitrifiers. Ammonium oxidation genes in comammox Nitrospira had a surprisingly complex evolution, originating from ancient transfer from the phylogenetically distantly related ammonia-oxidizing betaproteobacteria, followed by within-lineage transfers and losses. The resulting comammox genomes are uniquely adapted to ammonia oxidation in nutrient-limited and low-oxygen environments and appear to have lost the genetic potential to grow by nitrite oxidation alone.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease, the most common age-related movement disorder, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with unclear etiology. Key neuropathological hallmarks are Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are neuronal inclusions that are immunopositive for the protein -synuclein. In-depth ultrastructural analysis of this Lewy pathology is crucial to understanding pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Using correlative light and electron microscopy/tomography on brain tissue from five Parkinsons disease brain donors, we identified -synuclein immunopositive Lewy pathology and could show that the majority of these features including Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites primarily consists of a crowded membranous medley of vesicular structures and dysmorphic organelles. Only a small fraction of observed Lewy bodies contained predominant proteinaceous filaments, as previously described. The crowding of organellar components was confirmed by STED- based super-resolution microscopy, and high lipid content within the -synuclein immunopositive inclusions was corroborated by confocal imaging, CARS/FTIR imaging and lipidomics. Applying this correlative high-resolution imaging and biophysical approach, we discovered in the postmortem brain of Parkinsons patients a subcellular protein-lipid compartmentalization not previously described in Lewy pathology.",

    "abstract": "The malaria-causing blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum requires extracellular pantothenate for proliferation. The parasite converts pantothenate into coenzyme A (CoA) via five enzymes, the first being a pantothenate kinase (PfPanK). Multiple antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, including pantothenol and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA biosynthesis/utilisation. Their mechanism of action, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that parasites pressured with pantothenol or CJ-15,801 become resistant to these analogues. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one of two putative PanK genes (Pfpank1) in each resistant line. These mutations significantly alter PfPanK activity, with two conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pfpank1 coding for a functional PanK that is essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibit a different sensitivity profile to recently-described, potent, antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. We provide evidence consistent with different pantothenate analogue classes having different mechanisms of action: some inhibit CoA biosynthesis while others inhibit CoA-utilising enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirotris) is considered a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (PVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). In this study, we identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures in all three PVs. G-quadruplex structures (G4) are guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences capable of forming secondary structures in DNA and RNA. In humans, G4 are known to regulate molecular processes such as transcription and translation. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, no attempt has been made to identify G4 in animal PVs. We found that sequences capable of forming G4 were present on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all PVs. The vast majority of the identified sequences would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. The formation of one such structure was supported through biophysical analysis. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region on all manatee PVs and on the forward strand in the E2/E4 region on one genital PV. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all PVs, G4 sequences were located near putative E2 binding sites in the non-coding region. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are likely regulatory elements in manatee PVs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryG-quadruplex structures (G4) are found in the DNA and RNA of many species and are known to regulate the expression of genes and the synthesis of proteins, among other important molecular processes. Recently, these structures have been identified in several viruses, including the human papillomavirus (PV). As regulatory structures, G4 are of great interest to researchers as drug targets for viral control. In this paper, we identify the first G4 sequences in three PVs infecting a non-human animal, the Florida manatee. Through computational and biophysical analysis, we find that a greater variety of sequence patterns may underlie the formation of these structures than previously identified. The sequences are found in all protein coding regions of the virus and near sites for viral replication in non-coding regions. Furthermore, the distribution of these sequences across the PV genomes supports the notion that sequences are conserved across PV types, suggesting they are under selective pressure. This paper extends previous research on G4 in human PVs with additional evidence for their role as regulators. The G4 sequences we identified also provide potential regulatory targets for researchers interested in controlling this virus in the Florida manatee, a threatened aquatic mammal.",

    "abstract": "Ecologists are increasingly involved in the pandemic prediction process. In the course of the Zika outbreak in the Americas, several ecological models were developed to forecast the potential global distribution of the disease. Conflicting results produced by alternative methods are unresolved, hindering the development of appropriate public health forecasts. We compare ecological niche models and experimentally-driven mechanistic forecasts for Zika transmission in the continental United States, a region of high model conflict. We use generic and uninformed stochastic county-level simulations to demonstrate the downstream epidemiological consequences of conflict among ecological models, and show how assumptions and parameterization in the ecological and epidemiological models propagate uncertainty and produce downstream model conflict. We conclude by proposing a basic consensus method that could resolve conflicting models of potential outbreak geography and seasonality. Our results illustrate the unacceptable and often undocumented margin of uncertainty that could emerge from using any one of these predictions without reservation or qualification. In the short term, ecologists face the task of developing better post hoc consensus that accurately forecasts spatial patterns of Zika virus outbreaks. Ultimately, methods are needed that bridge the gap between ecological and epidemiological approaches to predicting transmission and realistically capture both outbreak size and geography.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful technology that has enabled genome editing in a wide range of species. However, the currently developed Cas9 homologs all originate from mesophilic bacteria, making them susceptible to proteolytic degradation and unsuitable for applications requiring function at elevated temperatures. Here, we show that the Cas9 protein from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GeoCas9) catalyzes RNA-guided DNA cleavage over a wide temperature range and has an enhanced protein lifetime in human plasma. GeoCas9 is active at temperatures up to 70{degrees}C, compared to 45{degrees}C for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9), which greatly expands the temperature range for CRISPR-Cas9 applications. By comparing features of two closely related Geobacillus homologs, we created a variant of GeoCas9 that doubles the DNA target sequences that can be recognized by this system. We also found that GeoCas9 is an effective tool for editing mammalian genomes when delivered as a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Together with an increased lifetime in human plasma, the thermostable GeoCas9 provides the foundation for improved RNP delivery in vivo and expands the temperature range of CRISPR-Cas9.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression patterns during development are orchestrated in part by thousands of distant-acting transcriptional enhancers. However, identifying enhancers that are essential for expression of their target genes has proven challenging. Genetic perturbation of individual enhancers in some cases results in profound molecular and developmental phenotypes, but in mild or no phenotypes in others. Topological maps of long-range regulatory interactions may provide the means to identify enhancers critical for developmental gene expression. Here, we leveraged chromatin topology to characterize and disrupt the major promoter-enhancer interaction for Pitx1, which is essential for hindlimb development. We found that Pitx1 primarily interacts with a single distal enhancer in the hindlimb. Using genome editing, we deleted this enhancer in the mouse. Although loss of the enhancer completely disrupts the predominant topological interaction in the Pitx1 locus, Pitx1 expression in the hindlimb is only reduced by ~14%, with no apparent changes in spatial distribution or evidence of regulatory compensation. Pitx1 enhancer null mice did not exhibit any of the characteristic morphological defects of the Pitx1-/- mutant. Our results indicate that Pitx1 expression is robust to the loss of its primary enhancer interaction, suggesting disruptions of regulatory topology at essential developmental genes may have mild phenotypic effects.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of gene expression is crucial for cellular adaptation to environmental challenges. mRNA secondary structure is known to be associated with mRNA and protein abundance, but little is known about how mRNA secondary structure affects gene expression dynamics. We report a genome-wide computational analysis of mRNA secondary structure, codon usage, and gene expression in budding yeast. We show that mRNA secondary structure combined with codon optimality regulates gene expression in multiple ways, from transcription to mRNA stability to translation. Moreover, we find that the effect of mRNA secondary structure on mRNA abundance is primarily mediated by transcription, not mRNA stability. Notably, genes with low mRNA secondary structure were substantially enriched for functions relevant to stress response, acting in the mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosome. On the other hand, genes with high mRNA secondary structure were enriched for functions relevant to cellular maintenance, including macromolecular metabolism and biosynthesis. Our results suggest that mRNA secondary structure affects gene expression through coordination of multiple stages in protein biogenesis, with important consequences for stress response. The coupling of transcription to mRNA stability to translation makes concerted changes in mRNA and protein abundance possible and may amplify the effect of regulation to make quick responses to environmental variations.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in massively parallel single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is paving the way for high-resolution single cell profiling of biological samples. In most scRNA-seq studies, only a small fraction of the transcripts present in each cell are sequenced. The efficiency, that is, the proportion of transcripts in the cell that are sequenced, can be especially low in highly parallelized experiments where the number of reads allocated for each cell is small. This leads to unreliable quantification of lowly and moderately expressed genes, resulting in extremely sparse data and hindering downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce SAVER (Single-cell Analysis Via Expression Recovery), an expression recovery method for scRNA-seq that borrows information across genes and cells to impute the zeros as well as to improve the expression estimates for all genes. We show, by comparison to RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and by data down-sampling experiments, that SAVER reliably recovers cell-specific gene expression concentrations, cross-cell gene expression distributions, and gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell correlations. This improves the power and accuracy of any downstream analysis involving genes with low to moderate expression.",

    "abstract": "Background Who is doing what is the ultimate open question in microbiome study. Shotgun metagenomics is often applied to gain knowledge of functional roles for bacteria in microbial communities, where the data can be used to predict protein encoding genes and enzymatic pathways present in the community, sometimes leading to testable hypotheses for microbial function. We describe a method and basic analysis for a metagenomic adaptation of the double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) protocol for reduced representation metagenome profiling. This technique takes advantage of the sequence specificity of restriction endonucleases to construct an Illumina-compatible sequencing library containing DNA fragments that are between a pair of restriction sites located within close proximity. This results in a reduced sequencing library with coverage breadth that can be tuned by size selection.\\n\\nResultsWe assessed the performance of the metagenomic ddRADseq approach by applying the method to human stool samples and generating sequence data. We evaluate the extent to which ddRADseq data provides an unbiased reduced representation for microbiome profiling.\\n\\nConclusionAlthough ddRADseq does introduce some bias in taxonomic representation, the bias is likely to be small relative to DNA extraction bias. ddRADseq appears feasible and could have value as a tool for metagenome-wide association studies.",

Here we show that Cela1 is exclusively responsible for stretch-inducible lung elastase activity, reduces postnatal lung elastance, and is required for emphysema in an antisense oligo model of AAT deficiency. Cela1 mRNA is present in the human lung, and in the placental mammal lineage, Cela1 is more conserved than Cela2 or Cela3 with unique promoter and protein elements indicating a unique role for Cela1 in this lineage.

The majority of genes in Arabidopsis endosperm are expressed in a 2:1 maternal:paternal ratio, reflecting endosperm genomic DNA content.

We describe an inverse relationship between the parent-of-origin of small RNAs and mRNAs in endosperm on a genome-wide scale. Disruption of the Pol IV small RNA pathway causes the entire transcriptome to become more maternally biased. Furthermore, paternal inheritance of a RNA Pol IV mutation is sufficient to rescue seed abortion caused by excess paternal genome dosage. These results indicate that maintenance of the maternal:paternal transcriptome ratio in endosperm is an active process and reveal a function for RNA Pol IV in mediating the global transcriptional balance between maternally and paternally inherited genomes in endosperm.",
