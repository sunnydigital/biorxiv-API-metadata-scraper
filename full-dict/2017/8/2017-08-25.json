    "abstract": "The architecture of the mammalian brain has been characterized through decades of innovation in the field of network neuroscience. However, the assembly of the brain from progenitor cells is an immensely complex process, and a quantitative understanding of how neural progenitor cells (NPCs) form neural networks has proven elusive. Here, we introduce a method that integrates graph-theory with long-term imaging of differentiating human NPCs to characterize the evolution of spatial and functional network features in NPCs during the formation of neural networks in vitro. We find that the rise and fall in spatial network efficiency is a characteristic feature of the transition from immature NPC networks to mature neural networks. Furthermore, networks at intermediate stages of differentiation that display high spatial network efficiency also show high levels of network-wide spontaneous electrical activity. These results support the view that network-wide signaling in immature progenitor cells gives way to a hierarchical form of communication in mature neural networks. We also leverage graph theory to study the spatial features of individual cell types in developing cultures, uncovering spatial features of polarized neuroepithelium. Finally, we employ our method to uncover aberrant network features in a neurodevelopmental disorder using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models. The \\\"Living Neural Networks\\\" method bridges the gap between developmental neurobiology and network neuroscience, and offers insight into the relationship between developing and mature neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The nature of capacity limits for visual working memory has been the subject of an intense debate that has relied on models that assume items are encoded independently. Here we propose that instead, similar features are jointly encoded through a \\\"chunking\\\" process to optimize performance on visual working memory tasks. We show that such chunking can: 1) facilitate performance improvements for abstract capacity-limited systems, 2) be optimized through reinforcement, 3) be implemented by center-surround dynamics, and 4) increase effective storage capacity at the expense of recall precision. Human performance on a variant of a canonical working memory task demonstrated performance advantages, precision detriments, inter-item dependencies, and trial-to-trial behavioral adjustments diagnostic of performance optimization through center-surround chunking. Models incorporating center-surround chunking provided a better quantitative description of human performance in our study as well as in a meta-analytic dataset, and apparent differences in working memory capacity across individuals were attributable to individual differences in the implementation of chunking. Our results reveal a normative rationale for center-surround connectivity in working memory circuitry, call for re-evaluation of memory performance differences that have previously been attributed to differences in capacity, and support a more nuanced view of visual working memory capacity limitations: strategic tradeoff between storage capacity and memory precision through chunking contribute to flexible capacity limitations that include both discrete and continuous aspects.",

By integrating promoter capture Hi-C data with genetic associations for five autoimmune diseases we prioritised 245 candidate genes with a median distance from peak signal to prioritised gene of 153 kb.

    "abstract": "Our behavior entails a flexible and context-sensitive interplay between brain areas to integrate information according to goal-directed requirements. How-ever, the neural mechanisms governing the entrainment of functionally specialized brain areas remain poorly understood. In particular, the question arises whether observed changes in the regional activity for different cognitive conditions are explained by modifications of the inputs to the brain or its connectivity? We observe that transitions of fMRI activity between areas convey information about the tasks performed by 19 subjects, watching a movie versus a black screen (rest). We use a model-based framework that explains this spatiotemporal functional connectivity pattern by the local variability for 66 cortical regions and the network effective connectivity between them. We find that, among the estimated model parameters, movie viewing affects to a larger extent the local activity, which we interpret as extrinsic changes related to the increased stimulus load. However, detailed changes in the effective connectivity preserve a balance in the propagating activity and select specific pathways such that high-level brain regions integrate visual and auditory information, in particular boosting the communication between the two brain hemispheres. These findings speak to a dynamic coordination underlying the functional integration in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cells and pericytes, together called mural cells, coordinate many distinct vascular functions. Smooth muscle cells are ring-shaped and cover arterioles with circumferential processes, whereas pericytes extend thin processes that run longitudinally along capillaries. In between these canonical mural cell types are cells with mixed phenotype of both smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Recent studies suggest that these transitional cells are critical for controlling blood flow to the capillary bed during health and disease, but there remains confusion on how to identify them and where they are located in the brain microvasculature. To address this issue, we measured the morphology, vascular territory, and -smooth muscle actin content of structurally diverse mural cells in adult mouse cortex. We first imaged intact 3-D vascular networks to establish the locations of major gradations in mural cell appearance as arterioles branched into capillaries. We then imaged individual mural cells occupying the regions within these gradations. This revealed two transitional cells that were often similar in appearance, but with sharply contrasting levels of -smooth muscle actin. Our findings highlight the diversity of mural cell morphologies in brain microvasculature, and provide guidance for identification and categorization of mural cell types.",

    "abstract": "Genomic prediction is emerging in a wide range of fields including animal and plant breeding, risk prediction in human precision medicine and forensic. It is desirable to establish a theoretical framework for genomic prediction accuracy when the reference data consists of information sources with varying degrees of relationship to the target individuals. A reference set can contain both close and distant relatives as well as  unrelated individuals from the wider population in the genomic prediction. The various sources of information were modeled as different populations with different effective population sizes (Ne). Both the effective number of chromosome segments (Me) and Ne are considered to be a function of the data used for prediction. We validate our theory with analyses of simulated as well as real data, and illustrate that the variation in genomic relationships with the target is a predictor of the information content of the reference set. With a similar amount of data available for each source, we show that close relatives can have a substantially larger effect on genomic prediction accuracy than lesser related individuals. We also illustrate that when prediction relies on closer relatives, there is less improvement in prediction accuracy with an increase in training data or marker panel density. We release software that can estimate the expected prediction accuracy and power when combining different reference sources with various degrees of relationship to the target, which is useful when planning genomic prediction (before or after collecting data) in animal, plant and human genetics.",

    "abstract": "Concerns regarding reproducibility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) findings have been raised. Little is known about how to operationally define R-fMRI reproducibility and to what extent it is affected by multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size. We comprehensively assessed two aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, on widely used R-fMRI metrics in both between-subject contrasts of sex differences and within-subject comparisons of eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) conditions. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between family-wise error rate (under 5%) and test-retest reliability / replicability (e.g., 0.68 for test-retest reliability and 0.25 for replicability of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for between-subject sex differences, 0.49 for replicability of ALFF for within-subject EOEC differences). Although R-fMRI indices attained moderate reliabilities, they replicated poorly in distinct datasets (replicability < 0.3 for between-subject sex differences, < 0.5 for within-subject EOEC differences). By randomly drawing different sample sizes from a single site, we found reliability, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) rose as sample size increased. Small sample sizes (e.g., < 80 (40 per group)) not only minimized power (sensitivity < 2%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect \\\"true\\\" effects (PPV < 0.26) in sex differences. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the importance of sufficiently large sample sizes in R-fMRI studies to enhance reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntegrating rare variation from trio family and case/control studies has successfully implicated specific genes contributing to risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental disorders (DD), and epilepsy (EPI). For schizophrenia (SCZ), however, while sets of genes have been implicated through study of rare variation, only two risk genes have been identified.\\n\\nMethodsWe used hierarchical Bayesian modeling of rare variant genetic architecture to estimate mean effect sizes and risk-gene proportions, analyzing the largest available collection of whole exome sequence (WES) data for schizophrenia (1,077 trios, 6,699 cases and 13,028 controls), and data for four NDDs (ASD, ID, DD, and EPI; total 10,792 trios, and 4,058 cases and controls).\\n\\nResultsFor SCZ, we estimate 1,551 risk genes, more risk genes and weaker effects than for NDDs. We provide power analyses to predict the number of risk gene discoveries as more data become available, demonstrating greater value of case-control over trio samples. We confirm and augment prior risk gene and gene set enrichment results for SCZ and NDDs. In particular, we detected 98 new DD risk genes at FDR < 0.05. Correlations of risk-gene posterior probabilities are high across four NDDs ({rho} > 0.55), but low between SCZ and the NDDs ({rho} < 0.3). In depth analysis of 288 NDD genes shows highly significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and functionally distinct PPI subnetworks based on pathway enrichments, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) cell types and multi-region developmental brain RNA-seq.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have extended a pipeline used in ASD studies and applied it to infer rare genetic parameters for SCZ and four NDDs. We find many new DD risk genes, supported by gene set enrichment and PPI network connectivity analyses. We find greater similarity among NDDs than between NDDs and SCZ. NDD gene subnetworks are implicated in postnatally expressed presynaptic and postsynaptic genes, and for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in prenatal neural progenitor and stem cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundColorectal cancer is a worldwide health problem. Despite growing evidence that members of the gut microbiota can drive tumorigenesis, little is known about what happens to it after treatment for an adenoma or carcinoma. This study tested the hypothesis that treatment for adenoma or carcinoma alters the abundance of bacterial populations associated with disease to those associated with a normal colon. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the feces of 67 individuals before and after treatment for adenoma (N = 22), advanced adenoma (N = 19), and carcinoma (N = 26).\\n\\nResultsThere were small changes to the bacterial community associated with adenoma or advanced adenoma and large changes associated with carcinoma. The communities from patients with carcinomas changed significantly more than those with adenoma following treatment (P-value < 0.001). Although treatment was associated with intrapersonal changes, the change in the abundance of individual OTUs in response to treatment was not consistent within diagnosis groups (P-value > 0.05). Because the distribution of OTUs across patients and diagnosis groups was irregular, we used the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to identify groups of OTUs that could be used to classify pre and post-treatment samples for each of the diagnosis groups. Although the three models could differentiate between the pre and post-treatment samples, there was little overlap between the OTUs that were indicative of each treatment. To determine whether individuals who underwent treatment were more likely to have OTUs associated with normal colons we used a larger cohort that contained individuals with normal colons and those with adenomas, advanced adenomas, and carcinomas. We again built Random Forest models and measured the change in the positive probability of having one of the three diagnoses to assess whether the post-treatment samples received the same classification as the pre-treatment samples. Samples from patients who had carcinomas changed towards a microbial milieu that resembles the normal colon after treatment (P-value < 0.05). Finally, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the microbiota of individuals treated with surgery alone and those treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy and radiation (P-value > 0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsBy better understanding the response of the microbiota to treatment for adenomas and carcinomas, it is likely that biomarkers will eventually be validated that can be used to quantify the risk of recurrence and the likelihood of survival. Although it was difficult to identify significant differences between pre and post-treatment samples from patients with adenoma and advanced adenoma, this was not the case for carcinomas. Not only were there large changes in pre versus post-treatment samples for those with carcinoma, but these changes were towards a more normal microbiota.",

HIV-infected cocultures exhibited sustained viral replication for 5 weeks, as well as reduced CD4+ T-cell growth at weeks 3-5. We further revealed that CD34+CD7+CXCR4+ cells can be quickly depleted as early as in 1 week after infection of the subset, and this was accompanied by the emergence of CD34+CD7+CD4+ cells.

Wild-type Canton-S adult flies walked in one direction, counter-clockwise or clockwise, for minutes, whereas white-eyed mutant w1118 changed directions frequently. Locomotion in the circular arena could be classified into four components: counter-clockwise walking, clockwise walking, nondirectional walking and pausing. Genetic analysis revealed that while wild-type genetic background was associated with reduced directional change and reduced numbers of one-way (including counterclockwise and clockwise) and nondirectional walks, the white (w+) locus promoted persistent oneway walking by increasing the maximal duration of one-way episodes. The promoting effect of w+ was further supported by the observations that (1) w+ duplicated to the Y chromosome, (2) four genomic copies of mini-white inserted on the autosomes, and (3) pan-neuronal overexpression of the White protein increased the maximal duration of one-way episodes, and that RNAi knockdown of w+ in the neurons decreased the maximal duration of one-way episodes. These results suggested a pleiotropic function of w+ in promoting persistent one-way walking in the circular arena.",

    "abstract": "Within reflex circuits, specific anatomical projections allow central neurons to relay sensations to effectors that generate movements. A major challenge is to relate anatomical features of central neural populations -- such as asymmetric connectivity -- to the computations the populations perform. To address this problem, we mapped the anatomy, modeled the function, and discovered a new behavioral role for a genetically-defined population of central vestibular neurons in rhombomeres 5-7 of larval zebrafish. First, we found that neurons within this central population project preferentially to motoneurons that move the eyes downward. Concor-dantly, when the entire population of asymmetrically-projecting neurons was stimulated collectively, only downward eye rotations were observed, demonstrating a functional correlate of the anatomical bias. When these neurons are ablated, fish failed to rotate their eyes following either nose-up or nose-down body tilts. This asymmetrically-projecting central population thus participates in both up and downward gaze stabilization. In addition to projecting to motoneurons, central vestibular neurons also receive direct sensory input from peripheral afferents. To infer whether asymmetric projections can facilitate sensory encoding or motor output, we modeled differentially-projecting sets of central vestibular neurons. Whereas motor command strength was independent of projection allocation, asymmetric projections enabled more accurate representation of nose-up stimuli. The model shows how asymmetric connectivity could enhance the representation of imbalance during nose-up postures while preserving gaze-stabilization performance. Finally, we found that central vestibular neurons were necessary for a vital behavior requiring maintenance of a nose-up posture: swim bladder inflation. These observations suggest that asymmetric connectivity in the vestibular system facilitates representation of ethologically-relevant stimuli without compromising reflexive behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementInterneuron populations use specific anatomical projections to transform sensations into reflexive actions. Here we examined how the anatomical composition of a genetically-defined population of balance interneurons in the larval zebrafish relates to the computations it performs. First, we found that the population of interneurons that stabilize gaze preferentially project to motoneurons that move the eyes downward. Next, we discovered through modeling that such projection patterns can enhance the encoding of nose-up sensations without compromising gaze stabilization. Finally we found that loss of these interneurons impairs a vital behavior, swim bladder inflation, that relies on maintaining a nose-up posture. These observations suggest that anatomical specialization permits neural circuits to represent relevant features of the environment without compromising behavior.",

    "abstract": "Beta-hairpins are a substructure found in proteins that can lend insight into more complex systems. Furthermore, the folding of beta-hairpins is a valuable test case for benchmarking experimental and theoretical methods. Here, we simulate the folding of CLN025, a miniprotein with a beta-hairpin structure, at its experimental melting temperature using a range of state-of-the-art protein force fields. We construct Markov state models in order to examine the thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanism, and rate-determining step of folding. Mechanistically, we find the folding process is rate-limited by the formation of the turn region hydrogen bonds, which occurs following the downhill hydrophobic collapse of the extended denatured protein. These results are presented in the context of established and contradictory theories of the beta-hairpin folding process. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AMBER-FB15 force field, at this temperature, best describes the characteristics of the full experimental CLN025 conformational ensemble, while the AMBER ff99SB-ILDN and CHARMM22* force fields display a tendency to overstabilize the native state.",

    "abstract": "Many neuroimaging studies collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a longitudinal manner. However, the current network modeling literature lacks a general framework for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) networks in fMRI data obtained from a longitudinal study. In this work, we build a novel longitudinal FC network model using a variance components approach. First, for all subjects visits, we account for the autocorrelation inherent in the fMRI time series data using a non-parametric technique. Second, we use a generalized least squares approach to estimate 1) the within-subject variance component shared across the population, 2) the FC network, and 3) the FC networks longitudinal trend. Our novel method for longitudinal FC networks seeks to account for the within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the subjects being sampled from a population, and the autocorrelation present in fMRI data, while restricting the number of parameters in order to make the method computationally feasible and stable. We develop a permutation testing procedure to draw valid inference on group differences in baseline FC and change in FC over time between a set of patients and a comparable set of controls. To examine performance, we run a series of simulations and apply the model to longitudinal fMRI data collected from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database.",

To facilitate further discovery, we have created the \\\"Cancer LncRNA Census\\\" (CLC), a manually-curated and strictly-defined compilation of lncRNAs with causative roles in cancer. CLC has two principle applications: first, as a resource for training and benchmarking de novo identification methods; and second, as a dataset for studying the fundamental properties of these genes.\\n\\nCLC Version 1 comprises 122 lncRNAs implicated in 29 distinct cancers. LncRNAs are included based on functional or genetic evidence for causative roles in cancer progression. All belong to the GENCODE reference annotation, to enable integration across projects and datasets. For each entry, the evidence type, biological activity (oncogene or tumour suppressor), source reference and cancer type are recorded. Supporting its usefulness, CLC genes are significantly enriched amongst de novo predicted driver genes from PCAWG. CLC genes are distinguished from other lncRNAs by a series of features consistent with biological function, including gene length, high expression and sequence conservation of both exons and promoters. We identify a trend for CLC genes to be co-localised with known protein-coding cancer genes along the human genome. Finally, by integrating data from transposon-mutagenesis functional screens, we show that mouse orthologues of CLC genes tend also to be cancer genes.\\n\\nThus CLC represents a valuable resource for research into long non-coding RNAs in cancer. Their evolutionary and genomic properties have implications for understanding disease mechanisms and point to conserved functions across ~80 million years of evolution.",

    "abstract": "Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that catalyzes the synthesis of telomeres at the ends of linear human chromosomes and contributes to proper telomere-loop (T-loop) formation. Formation of the T-loop, an obligate step before cell division can proceed, requires the generation of a 3-overhang on the G-rich strand of telomeric DNA via telomerase or C-strand specific nucleases. Here, we discover telomerase activity is critical for efficient cell cycle progression using transient chemical inhibition by the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat. Telomerase inhibition caused changes in cell cycle kinetics and increased the proportion of cells in G2 phase, suggesting delayed clearance through this checkpoint. Investigating the possible contribution of unstructured telomere ends to these cell cycle distribution changes, we observed that imetelstat treatment induced {gamma}H2AX DNA damage foci in a subset of telomerase-positive cells but not telomerase-negative primary human fibroblasts. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation with {gamma}H2AX antibodies demonstrated imetelstat treatment-dependent enrichment of this DNA damage marker at telomeres. Notably, the effects of telomerase inhibition on cell cycle profile alterations were abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of the DNA-damage-repair transducer ATM.\\n\\nAdditionally, imetelstat potentiation of etoposide, a DNA-damaging drug that acts preferentially during S/G2 phases of the cell cycle, also depended on functional ATM signaling. Our results suggest that telomerase inhibition delays the removal of ATM-dependent DNA damage signals from telomeres in telomerase-positive cancer cells. This demonstrates for the first time that telomerase activity directly facilitates the progression of the cell cycle through modulation of transient telomere dysfunction signals.",

Here, we report glycan evolution follows a clock-like rhythm, pacing the timeline, trajectory, and replacement of HA. Following pandemic introduction, glycans are added to HA at 4- to 6-year intervals, until a functional glycan limit is reached, after which, at 9- to 12-year intervals, glycans are either swapped between different sites, or the HA is replaced by a novel pandemic virus. Using this, we predicted the appearance of the newest glycan on pH1N1 HA. Phylogeographic reconstruction suggests these highly fit strains originated in the Middle East, before rapidly replacing all strains globally. Going forward, we can use this simple algorithm to forecast future glycan evolution and identify seasons with higher pandemic potential.",

While monitoring PSelL expression on activated CD8+ T cells (Tact) in adoptive transfer models, we observed two distinct PSelL on responding donor cells, the canonical cell-intrinsic PSelL PSGL1 and a second undocumented PSelL provisionally named PSL2. PSL2 is unusual among selectin ligands in that it is cell-extrinsic, loaded onto L-selectin (LSel) expressed by Tact but not LSel on resting naive CD8+ T cells. PSL2 expression is highest on Tact responding in peripheral lymph nodes and low on Tact responding in spleen suggesting that the original source of PSL2 is high endothelial venules, cells known to produce LSelL. When both PSGL1 and PSL2 were absent from the surface of Tact, no significant residual PSelL activity was detected. PSL2 is a ligand for both PSel and LSel and can physically bridge the two selectins. The LSel/PSL2 complex can mediate PSel-dependent adherence of Tact to immobilized PSel-hIgG or to activated platelets, either independently or cooperatively with PSGL1. PSel engagement of PSGL1 and LSel/PSL2 would likely deliver distinct signals known to be relevant in leukocyte recruitment.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryMurine primary in-vivo activated CD8+ T cells express two ligands for P-selectin, canonical PSGL-1 and a cell-extrinsic ligand docked on L-selectin.",

    "abstract": "Older adults often experience difficulties in understanding speech, partly because of age-related hearing loss. In young adults, activity of the left articulatory motor cortex is enhanced and it interacts with the auditory cortex via the left-hemispheric dorsal stream during speech processing. Little is known about the effect of ageing and age-related hearing loss on this auditory-motor interaction and speech processing in the articulatory motor cortex. It has been proposed that up-regulation of the motor system during speech processing could compensate for hearing loss and auditory processing deficits in older adults. Alternatively, age-related auditory deficits could reduce and distort the input from the auditory cortex to the articulatory motor cortex, suppressing recruitment of the motor system during listening to speech. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ageing and age-related hearing loss on the excitability of the tongue motor cortex during listening to spoken sentences using transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography. Our results show that the excitability of the tongue motor cortex was facilitated during listening to speech in young and older adults with normal hearing. This facilitation was significantly reduced in older adults with hearing loss. These findings suggest a decline of auditory-motor processing of speech in adults with age-related hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Selection and mutation shape genetic variation underlying human traits, but the specific evolutionary mechanisms driving complex trait variation are largely unknown. We developed a statistical method that uses polarized GWAS summary statistics from a single population to detect signals of mutational bias and selection. We found evidence for non-neutral signals on variation underlying several traits (BMI, schizophrenia, Crohns disease, educational attainment, and height). We then used simulations that incorporate simultaneous negative and positive selection to show that these signals are consistent with mutational bias and shifts in the fitness-phenotype relationship, but not stabilizing selection or mutational bias alone. We additionally replicate two of our top three signals (BMI and educational attainment) in an external cohort, and show that population stratification may have confounded GWAS summary statistics for height in the GIANT cohort. Our results provide a flexible and powerful framework for evolutionary analysis of complex phenotypes in humans and other species, and offer insights into the evolutionary mechanisms driving variation in human polygenic traits.\\n\\nImpact summaryMany traits are variable within human populations and are likely to have a substantial and complex genetic component. This implies that mutations that have a functional impact on complex human traits have arisen throughout our species evolutionary history. However, it remains unclear how processes such as natural selection may have acted to shape trait variation at the genetic and phenotypic level. Better understanding of the mechanisms driving trait variation could provide insights into our evolutionary past and help clarify why it has been so difficult to map the preponderance of causal variation for common heritable diseases.\\n\\nIn this study, we developed and applied methods for detecting signatures of mutation bias (i.e., the propensity of a new variant to be either trait-increasing or trait-decreasing) and natural selection acting on trait variation. We applied our approach to several heritable traits, and found evidence for both natural selection and mutation bias, including selection for decreased BMI and decreased risk for Crohns disease and schizophrenia.\\n\\nWhile our results are consistent with plausible evolutionary scenarios shaping a range of traits, it should be noted that the field of polygenic selection detection is still new, and current methods (including ours) rely on data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The data produced by these studies may be vulnerable to certain cryptic biases, especially population stratification, which could induce false selection signals. We therefore repeated our analyses for the top three hits in a cohort that should be less susceptible to this problem - we found that two of our top three signals replicated (BMI and educational attainment), while height did not. Our results highlight both the promise and pitfalls of polygenic selection detection approaches, and suggest a need for further work disentangling stratification from selection.",

    "abstract": "Robustness in development allows for the accumulation of neutral genetically based variation in expression, and here will be termed  genetic stochasticity . This largely neutral variation is potentially important for both evolution and complex disease phenotypes. However, it has generally only been investigated as variation exhibited in the response to large genetic perturbations. In addition, work on variation in gene expression has similarly generally been limited to being spatial, or quantitative, but because of technical restrictions not both. Here we bridge these gaps by investigating replicated quantitative spatial gene expression using rigorous statistical models, in different genotypes, sexes, and species (Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans). Using this type of quantitative approach with developmental data allows for effective comparison among conditions, including health versus disease. We apply this approach to the morphogenetic furrow, a wave of differentiation that sweeps across the developing eye disc. Within the morphogenetic furrow, we focus on four conserved morphogens, hairy, atonal, hedgehog, and Delta. Hybridization chain reaction quantitatively measures spatial gene expression, co-staining for all four genes simultaneously and with minimal effort. We find considerable variation in the spatial expression pattern of these genes in the eye between species, genotypes, and sexes. We also find that there has been evolution of the regulatory relationship between these genes. Lastly, we show that the spatial interrelationships of these genes evolved between species in the morphogenetic furrow. This is essentially the first  population genetics of development as we are able to evaluate wild type differences in spatial and quantitative gene expression at the level of genotype, species and sex.",

    "abstract": "The efficient coding hypothesis, which proposes that neurons are optimized to maximize information about the environment, has provided a guiding theoretical framework for sensory and systems neuroscience. More recently, a theory known as the Bayesian Brain hypothesis has focused on the brains ability to integrate sensory and prior sources of information in order to perform Bayesian inference. However, there is as yet no comprehensive theory connecting these two theoretical frameworks. We bridge this gap by formalizing a Bayesian theory of efficient coding. We define Bayesian efficient codes in terms of four basic ingredients: (1) a stimulus prior distribution; (2) an encoding model; (3) a capacity constraint, specifying a neural resource limit; and (4) a loss function, quantifying the desirability or undesirability of various posterior distributions. Classic efficient codes can be seen as a special case in which the loss function is the posterior entropy, leading to a code that maximizes mutual information, but alternate loss functions give solutions that differ dramatically from information-maximizing codes. In particular, we show that decorrelation of sensory inputs, which is optimal under classic efficient codes in low-noise settings, can be disadvantageous for loss functions that penalize large errors. Bayesian efficient coding therefore enlarges the family of normatively optimal codes and provides a more general framework for understanding the design principles of sensory systems. We examine Bayesian efficient codes for linear receptive fields and nonlinear input-output functions, and show that our theory invites reinterpretation of Laughlins seminal analysis of efficient coding in the blowfly visual system.\n\nOne of the primary goals of theoretical neuroscience is to understand the functional organization of neurons in the early sensory pathways and the principles governing them. Why do sensory neurons amplify some signals and filter out others? What can explain the particular configurations and types of neurons found in early sensory system? What general principles can explain the solutions evolution has selected for extracting signals from the sensory environment?\n\nTwo of the most influential theories for addressing these questions are the \"efficient coding\" hypothesis and the \"Bayesian brain\" hypothesis. The efficient coding hypothesis, introduced by Attneave and Barlow more than fifty years ago, uses the ideas from Shannons information theory to formulate a theory normatively optimal neural coding [1, 2]. The Bayesian brain hypothesis, on the other hand, focuses on the brains ability to perform Bayesian inference, and can be traced back to ideas from Helmholtz about optimal perceptual inference [3-7].\n\nA substantial literature has sought to alter or expand the original efficient coding hypothesis [5, 8-18], and a large number of papers have considered optimal codes in the context of Bayesian inference [19-26], However, the two theories have never been formally connected within a single, comprehensive theoretical framework. Here we propose to fill this gap by formulating a general Bayesian theory of efficient coding that unites the two hypotheses. We begin by reviewing the key elements of each theory and then describe a framework for unifying them. Our approach involves combining a prior and model-based likelihood function with a neural resource constraint and a loss functional that quantifies what makes for a \"good\" posterior distribution. We show that classic efficient codes arise when we use information-theoretic quantities for these ingredients, but that a much larger family of Bayesian efficient codes can be constructed by allowing these ingredients to vary. We explore Bayesian efficient codes for several important cases of interest, namely linear receptive fields and nonlinear response functions. The latter case was examined in an influential paper by Laughlin that examined contrast coding in the blowfly large monopolar cells (LMCs) [27]; we reanalyze data from this paper and argue that LMC responses are in fact better described as minimizing the average square-root error than as maximizing mutual information.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional mechanisms play a predominant role in the control of microRNA (miRNA) production. Recognition of the terminal loop of precursor miRNAs by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) influences their processing; however, the mechanistic and structural basis for how levels of individual or subsets of miRNAs are regulated is mostly unexplored. We previously described a role for hnRNP A1, an RBP implicated in many aspects of RNA processing, as an auxiliary factor that promotes the Microprocessor-mediated processing of pri-mir-18a. Here, we reveal the mechanistic basis for this stimulatory role of hnRNP A1 by combining integrative structural biology with biochemical and functional assays. We demonstrate that hnRNP A1 forms a 1:1 complex with pri-mir-18a that involves binding of both RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) to cognate RNA sequence motifs in the conserved terminal loop of pri-mir-18a. Terminal loop binding induces an allosteric destabilization of base-pairing in the pri-mir-18a stem that promotes its down-stream processing. Our results highlight terminal loop RNA recognition by RNA-binding proteins as a general principle of miRNA biogenesis and regulation.",

    "abstract": "The Escherichia coli SMC complex, MukBEF, acts in chromosome segregation. MukBEF shares the distinctive architecture of other SMC complexes, with one prominent difference; unlike other kleisins, MukF forms dimers through its N-terminal domain. We show that a 4-helix bundle adjacent to the MukF dimerization domain interacts functionally with the MukB coiled-coiled  neck adjacent to the ATPase head, forming an asymmetric tripartite complex, as in other SMC complexes. Since MukF dimerization is preserved during this interaction, MukF directs the formation of dimer of dimers MukBEF complexes, observed previously in vivo. The MukF N- and C-terminal domains stimulate ATPase independently and additively, consistent with them each targeting only one of the two MukB ATPase active sites in the asymmetric complex. We demonstrate that MukF interaction with the MukB neck turns over during cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis in vivo and that impairment of this interaction leads to MukBEF release from chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndependent Component Analysis (ICA) is a method that models gene expression data as an action of a set of statistically independent hidden factors. The output of ICA depends on a fundamental parameter: the number of components (factors) to compute. The optimal choice of this parameter, related to determining the effective data dimension, remains an open question in the application of blind source separation techniques to transcriptomic data.\\n\\nResultsHere we address the question of optimizing the number of statistically independent components in the analysis of transcriptomic data for reproducibility of the components in multiple runs of ICA (within the same or within varying effective dimensions) and in multiple independent datasets. To this end, we introduce ranking of independent components based on their stability in multiple ICA computation runs and define a distinguished number of components (Most Stable Transcriptome Dimension, MSTD) corresponding to the point of the qualitative change of the stability profile. Based on a large body of data, we demonstrate that a sufficient number of dimensions is required for biological interpretability of the ICA decomposition and that the most stable components with ranks below MSTD have more chances to be reproduced in independent studies compared to the less stable ones. At the same time, we show that a transcriptomics dataset can be reduced to a relatively high number of dimensions without losing the interpretability of ICA, even though higher dimensions give rise to components driven by small gene sets.\\n\\nConclusionsWe suggest a protocol of ICA application to transcriptomics data with a possibility of prioritizing components with respect to their reproducibility that strengthens the biological interpretation. Computing too few components (much less than MSTD) is not optimal for interpretability of the results. The components ranked within MSTD range have more chances to be reproduced in independent studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation patterns store epigenetic information in the vast majority of eukaryotic species. The relatively high costs and technical challenges associated with the detection of DNA methylation however have created a bias in the number of methylation studies towards model organisms. Consequently, it remains challenging to infer kingdom-wide general rules about the functions and evolutionary conservation of DNA methylation. Methylated cytosine is often found in specific CpN dinucleotides, and the frequency distributions of, for instance, CpG observed/expected (CpG o/e) ratios have been used to infer DNA methylation types based on higher mutability of methylated CpG.\\n\\nResultsPredominantly model-based approaches essentially founded on mixtures of Gaussian distributions are currently used to investigate questions related to the number and position of modes of CpG o/e ratios. These approaches require the selection of an appropriate criterion for determining the best model and will fail if empirical distributions are complex or even merely moderately skewed. We use a kernel density estimation (KDE) based technique for robust and precise characterization of complex CpN o/e distributions without a priori assumptions about the underlying distributions.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that KDE delivers robust descriptions of CpN o/e distributions. For straightforward processing, we have developed a Galaxy tool, called Notos and available at the ToolShed, that calculates these ratios of input FASTA files and fits a density to their empirical distribution. Based on the estimated density the number and shape of modes of the distribution is determined, providing a rational for the prediction of the number and the types of different methylation classes.

An automated data processing pipeline, including neuron detection, segmentation, tracking and annotation, will significantly improve the efficiency of analyzing whole-brain C. elegans imaging. The resulting large data sets may motivate new scientific discovery by exploiting many promising analysis tools for big data. In this study, we focus on the development of an automated annotation procedure. With only around 180 neurons in the central nervous system of a C. elegans, the annotation of each individual neuron still remains a major challenge because of the high density in space, similarity in neuron shape, unpredictable distortion of the worms head during motion, intrinsic variations during worm development, etc. We use an ensemble learning approach to achieve around 25% error for a test based on real experimental data. Also, we demonstrate the importance of exploring extra source of information for annotation other than the neuron positions.",

In the analysis of BS-seq data, this can present an important performance bottleneck that can potentially be addressed by appropriate software-engineering and algorithmic improvements. One strategy is to integrate this additional programming logic into the read-alignment implementation in a way that the software becomes amenable to optimizations that lead to both higher speed and greater sensitivity than can be achieved without this integration.\\n\\nWe have evaluated this approach using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate computationally-expensive programming logic. We integrated the BS-seq computational logic into both GPU and CPU code throughout the Arioc implementation. We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's reported alignments with the alignments reported by the most widely used BS-seq read aligners. With simulated reads, Arioc's accuracy is equal to or better than the other read aligners we evaluated. With human sequencing reads, Arioc's throughput is at least 10 times faster than existing BS-seq aligners across a wide range of sensitivity settings.\\n\\nThe Arioc software is available at https://github.com/RWilton/Arioc.

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that detect mechanical and chemical stimuli. Although cilia house a number of oncogenic molecules (including Smoothened, KRAS, EGFR, and PDGFR), their precise role in cancer remains unclear. We have interrogated the role of cilia in acquired and de novo resistance to a variety of kinase inhibitors, and found that in several examples, resistant cells are distinctly characterized by an increase in the number and/or length of cilia with altered structural features. Changes in cilia length seem to be linked to the lack of recruitment of Kif7 and IFT81 to cilia tips, and result in enhanced hedgehog pathway activation. Notably, Kif7 knockdown is sufficient to confer drug resistance in drug sensitive cells. Conversely, targeting of cilia length or integrity through genetic and pharmacological approaches overcomes kinase inhibitor resistance. The identification of a broad mechanism of pathway-unbiased drug resistance, represents a major advancement in oncology, and helps define a specific and important role for cilia in human cancer.",

    "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) has specific barriers that protect the brain from potential threats and tightly regulate molecular transport. Despite the critical functions of the CNS barriers, the mechanisms underlying their development and function are not well understood, and there are very limited experimental models for their study. Claudin 5 is a tight junction protein required for blood brain barrier (BBB) and choroid plexus (CP) barrier structure and function in humans. Here, we show that the gene claudin 5a is the zebrafish orthologue with high fidelity expression, in the BBB and CP barriers, that demonstrates the conservation of the BBB and CP between humans and zebrafish. Expression of claudin 5a correlates with developmental tightening of the BBB and is restricted to a subset of the brain vasculature clearly delineating the BBB. We show that claudin 5a expressing cells of the CP are ciliated ependymal cells that drive fluid flow in the brain ventricles. Finally, we find that CP development precedes BBB development and that claudin 5a expression occurs simultaneously with angiogenesis. Thus, our novel transgenic zebrafish represents an ideal model to study CNS barrier development and function, critical in understanding the mechanisms underlying CNS barrier function in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman African trypanosomiasis (HAT) manifests as an acute form caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr) and a chronic form caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (Tbg). Previous studies have suggested a host genetic role in infection outcomes, particularly for APOL1. We have undertaken a candidate gene association studies (CGAS) in a Ugandan Tbr and a Tbg HAT endemic area, to determine whether polymorphisms in IL10, IL8, IL4, HLAG, TNFA, TNX4LB, IL6, IFNG, MIF, APOL1, HLAA, IL1B, IL4R, IL12B, IL12R, HP, HPR, and CFH have a role in HAT.\\n\\nMethodology and resultsWe included 238 and 202 participants from the Busoga Tbr and Northwest Uganda Tbg endemic areas respectively. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotype data were analysed in the CGAS. The study was powered to find odds ratios > 2 but association testing of the SNPs with HAT yielded no positive associations i.e. none significant after correction for multiple testing. However there was strong evidence for no association with Tbr HAT and APOL1 G2 of the size previously reported in the Kabermaido district.\\n\\nConclusions/significanceA recent study in the Soroti and Kaberamaido focus in Central Uganda found that the APOL1 G2 allele was strongly associated with protection against Tbr HAT (odds ratio = 0.2). However, in our study no effect of G2 on Tbr HAT was found, despite being well powered to find a similar sized effect. It is possible that the G2 allele is protective from Tbr in the Soroti/Kabermaido focus but not in the Iganga district of Busoga, which differ in ethnicity and infection history. Mechanisms underlying HAT infection outcome and virulence are complex and might differ between populations, and likely involve several host, parasite or even environmental factors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) occurs in two distinct disease forms; the acute form and the chronic form which are caused by microscopically indistinguishable hemo-parasites, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense respectively. Uganda is the only country where both forms of the disease are found, though in geographically distinct areas. Recent studies have shown that host genetic factors play a role in HAT resistance and/or susceptibility, particularly by genes involved in the immune response. In this study, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected genes involved in immune responses and carried out a case-control candidate gene association study in Ugandan participants from the two endemic areas. We were unable to detect any polymorphisms that were robustly associated with either Tbr or Tbg HAT. However, our findings differ from recent studies carried out in the Tbr HAT another endemic area of Uganda that showed the APOL1 (Apolipoprotein 1) G2 allele to be protective against the disease which merits further investigation. Larger studies such as genome wide association studies (GWAS) by the TrypanoGEN network that has >3000 cases and controls covering seven countries (Cameroon, Cote dIvoire, DRC, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia) using the H3Africa customized chip reflective of African genetic diversity will present novel association targets.",

DSP is a reversible cross-linker of free amine groups that has previously been shown to preserve tissue integrity for histology while maintaining RNA integrity and yield in bulk RNA extractions. Although RNA-seq data from DSP-fixed single cells appears to be prone to characteristic artefacts, such as slightly reduced yield of cDNA and a detectable 3 bias in comparison with fresh cells, cell preservation using DSP does not appear to substantially reduce RNA complexity at the gene level. In addition, there is evidence that instantaneous fixation of cells can reduce inter-cell technical variability. The ability of DSP-fixed cells to retain commonly used dyes, such as propidium iodide, enables the tracking of experimental sub-populations and the recording of cell viability at the point of fixation. Preserving cells using DSP will remove several barriers in the staging of single-cell experiments, including the transport of samples and the scheduling of shared equipment for downstream single-cell isolation and processing.",

    "abstract": "Oat crown rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca), is a devastating disease that impacts worldwide oat production. For much of its life cycle, Pca is dikaryotic, with two separate haploid nuclei that may vary in virulence genotype, highlighting the importance of understanding haplotype diversity in this species. We generated highly contiguous de novo genome assemblies of two Pca isolates, 12SD80 and 12NC29, from long-read sequences. In total, we assembled 603 primary contigs for a total assembly length of 99.16 Mbp for 12SD80 and 777 primary contigs with a total length of 105.25 Mbp for 12NC29, and approximately 52% of each genome was assembled into alternate haplotypes. This revealed structural variation between haplotypes in each isolate equivalent to more than 2% of the genome size, in addition to about 260,000 and 380,000 heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 12SD80 and 12NC29, respectively. Transcript-based annotation identified 26,796 and 28,801 coding sequences for isolates 12SD80 and 12NC29, respectively, including about 7,000 allele pairs in haplotype-phased regions. Furthermore, expression profiling revealed clusters of co-expressed secreted effector candidates, and the majority of orthologous effectors between isolates showed conservation of expression patterns. However, a small subset of orthologs showed divergence in expression, which may contribute to differences in virulence between 12SD80 and 12NC29. This study provides the first haplotype-phased reference genome for a dikaryotic rust fungus as a foundation for future studies into virulence mechanisms in Pca.\\n\\nImportanceDisease management strategies for oat crown rust are challenged by the rapid evolution of Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae (Pca), which renders resistance genes in oat varieties ineffective. Despite the economic importance of understanding Pca, resources to study the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathogenicity and emergence of new virulence traits are lacking. Such limitations are partly due to the obligate biotrophic lifestyle of Pca as well as the dikaryotic nature of the genome, features that are also shared with other important rust pathogens. This study reports the first release of a haplotype-phased genome assembly for a dikaryotic fungal species and demonstrates the amenability of using emerging technologies to investigate genetic diversity in populations of Pca.",

    "abstract": "Many motor tasks involve transitions from posture to movement such as shifting from holding an object to setting it on a surface. Although many movements are voluntary processes, they are facilitated through motor pathways that span the continuum between reflexive and voluntary control. The mechanisms driving the long-latency stretch reflex (LLSR) have remained hotly contested. Recently, startReact has been shown to influence the fast muscular response to perturbations (Ravichandran et. al. 2013). The objective of this study was to evaluate how the LLSR and startReact impact the muscular response during the transition from posture to movement. We hypothesized that both the LLSR and startReact would be involved throughout the transition from posture to movement; however there would be a clear transition from LLSR dominance during posture to startReact dominance near/during movement. We tested this hypothesis using perturbations of elbow posture at various times before a fast ballistic extension movement. We found clear evidence that both the LLSR and startReact components were influenced changes in the late long-latency time window. The results provide insights on how the nervous system regulates involuntary responses to perturbations during the transition from maintenance of arm posture to movement.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyWe recently demonstrated that the startReact effect, the startled release of a planned movement, can influence the muscular response during the LLSR. Here we observe how the influence of startReact can change from the transition from posture (no/little influence) to movement (strong influence). While not all paradigms trigger a startReact effect, this work demonstrates that when present startRect can have a profound effect on the overall muscle activity - even obscuring the traditional LLSR response.",

Little is known, however, about the contributions of specific hippocampal sub-regions in this process, a critical issue given the functional and anatomical heterogeneity of this structure. Using a non-spatial cue-based paradigm in rats, we found that transient pharmacological inactivation of ventral CA1 produced an avoidance of a conflict cue imbued with both learned positive and negative outcomes, whereas inactivation of the ventral CA3 resulted in the opposite pattern of behavior, with significant preference for the conflict cue. In contrast, dorsal CA1- and CA3-inactivated rats showed no change in conflict behavior. Our findings provide important insight into the functions and circuitry of the ventral hippocampus by demonstrating that the ventral CA1 and CA3 subserve distinct and opposing roles in approach-avoidance conflict processing.",

    "abstract": "When navigating the real-world, the spatiotemporal sequencing of events is intrinsically bound to ones physical trajectory; when recollecting the past or imagining the future, the temporal and spatial dimension of events can be independently manipulated. Yet, the rules enabling the flexible use of spatial and temporal cognitive maps likely differ in one major way as time is directional (oriented from past-to-future) whereas space is not. Using combined magneto- and electroencephalography, we sought to capture such differences by characterizing time-resolved brain activity while participants mentally ordered memories from different mental perspectives in time (past/future) or space (west/east). We report two major neural dissociations underlying the mental ordering of events in time and in space: first, brain responses evoked by the temporal order and the temporal distance of events-to-self dissociated at early and late latencies, respectively whereas spatial order and distance of events-to-self elicited late brain responses simultaneously. Second, brain responses distinguishing self-position in time and the temporal order of events involved sources in the hippocampal formation; spatial perspective, order and distance did not. These results suggest that the neural dynamics evoked by the temporal ordering of a series of events retrieved from long-term memory, i.e. the psychological time arrow, entails dedicated cognitive processes in the hippocampal formation that are fundamentally distinct from the mapping of spatial location.",

The flys circuit assigns similar neural activity patterns to similar input stimuli (odors), so that behav-iors learned from one odor can be applied when a similar odor is experienced. The flys algorithm, however, uses three new computational ingredients that depart from traditional approaches. We show that these ingredients can be translated to improve the performance of similarity search compared to tra-ditional algorithms when evaluated on several benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Quasiperiodic patterns (QPPs) as reported by Majeed et al., 2011 are prominent features of the brains intrinsic activity that involve important large-scale networks (default mode, DMN; task positive, TPN) and are likely to be major contributors to widely used measures of functional connectivity. We examined the variability of these patterns in 470 individuals from the Human Connectome Project resting state functional MRI dataset. The QPPs from individuals can be coarsely categorized into two types: one where strong anti-correlation between the DMN and TPN is present, and another where most areas are strongly correlated. QPP type could be predicted by an individuals global signal, with lower global signal corresponding to QPPs with strong anti-correlation. After regression of global signal, all QPPs showed strong anti-correlation between DMN and TPN. QPP occurrence and type was similar between a subgroup of individuals with extremely low motion (or even high motion) and the rest of the sample, which shows that motion is not a major contributor to the QPPs. After regression of estimates of slow respiratory and cardiac induced signal fluctuations, more QPPs showed strong anti-correlation between DMN and TPN, an indication that while physiological noise influences the QPP type, it is not the primary source of the QPP itself. QPPs were more similar for the same subjects scanned on different days than for different subjects. These results provide the first assessment of the variability in individual QPPs and their relationship to physiological parameters.",

Our study defines local angiotensin signaling via activation of the Angiotensin II (Ang II) type-2 receptor (AT2R) on macrophages as the critical trigger of neuropathic pain. An AT2R-selective antagonist attenuates neuropathic, but not inflammatory pain hypersensitivity in mice, and requires the cell damage-sensing ion channel transient receptor potential family-A member-1 (TRPA1). Mechanical and cold pain hypersensitivity that are characteristic of neuropathic conditions can be attenuated by chemogenetic depletion of peripheral macrophages and AT2R-null hematopoietic cell transplantation. Our findings show no AT2R expression in mouse or human sensory neurons, rather AT2R expression and activation in macrophages triggers production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which trans-activate TRPA1 on sensory neurons. Our study defines the precise neuro-immune crosstalk underlying nociceptor sensitization at the site of nerve injury. This form of cell-to-cell signaling represents a critical peripheral mechanism for chronic neuropathic pain, and therefore identifies multiple analgesic targets.",

It is unclear whether neurons in the posterior tail of the dorsal striatum (which receive direct input from the auditory system) mediate action selection, as other striatal circuits do. Here, we examined the role of posterior striatal neurons in auditory decisions in mice. We found that, in contrast to the anterior dorsal striatum, activation of the posterior striatum did not elicit systematic movement. However, activation of posterior striatal neurons during sound presentation in an auditory discrimination task biased the animals choices, and transient inactivation of these neurons largely impaired sound discrimination. Moreover, the activity of these neurons reliably encoded stimulus features, but was only minimally influenced by the animals choices. Our results suggest that posterior striatal neurons play an essential role in auditory decisions, yet these neurons provide sensory information downstream rather than motor commands during well-learned sound-driven tasks.",

Genomic studies have identified orthologs for ABA-related genes throughout the Viridiplantae, including in unicellular algae; however, the role of ABA in algal physiology has not been characterized, and the existence of such a role has been a matter of dispute. In this study, we demonstrate that ABA is involved in regulating algal stress responses. Chlorella sorokiniana strain UTEX 1230 contains genes orthologous to those of higher plants which are essential for ABA biosynthesis, sensing, and degradation. RNAseq-based transcriptomic studies reveal that treatment with ABA induces dramatic changes in gene expression profiles, including the induction of a subset of genes involved in DNA replication and repair, a phenomenon which has been demonstrated in higher plants. Pretreatment of C. sorokiniana cultures with ABA exerts a protective effect on cell viability in response to ultraviolet radiation. Additionally, C. sorokiniana produces and secretes biologically relevant amounts of both ABA and the oxylipin 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) into the growth medium in response to abiotic stressors. Taken together, these phenomena suggest that ABA signaling evolved as an intercellular stress response signaling molecule in eukaryotic microalgae prior to the evolution of multicellularity and colonization of land.",

    "abstract": "Foliar uptake of water from the surface of leaves is common when rainfall is scarce and non-meteoric water such as dew or fog is more abundant. However, many species in more mesic environments have hydrophobic leaves that do not allow the plant to uptake water. Unlike foliar uptake, all species can benefit from dew- or fog-induced transpiration suppression, but despite its ubiquity, transpiration suppression has so far never been quantified. Here, we investigate the effect of dew-induced transpiration suppression on the water balance and the isotope composition of leaves via a series of experiments. Characteristically hydrophobic leaves of a tropical plant, Colocasia esculenta, are misted with isotopically enriched water to reproduce dew deposition. This species does not uptake water from the surface of its leaves. We measure leaf water isotopes and water potential and find that misted leaves exhibit a higher water potential (p < 0.05) and a more depleted water isotope composition than dry leaves (p < 0.001), suggesting a ~30% decrease in transpiration rate (p < 0.001) compared to control leaves. We propose three possible mechanisms governing the interaction of water droplets with leaf energy balance: increase in albedo from the presence of dew droplets, decrease in leaf temperature from the evaporation of dew, and local decrease in vapor pressure deficit. Comparing previous studies on foliar uptake to our results, we conclude that transpiration suppression has an effect of similar amplitude, yet opposite sign to foliar uptake on leaf water isotopes.",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in their adaptation to different environmental salinity have remained largely unknown. In the present study, we reared kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus at 1.7 %, 3.4 % and 4.0 % salinity. After rearing for 6, 12, 24 and 72 h, we determined free amino acid concentrations in their abdominal muscle, and performed RNA-seq analysis on this muscle. The concentrations of free amino acids were clearly altered depending on salinity after rearing for 24 h. Glutamine and alanine concentrations were markedly increased following the increase of salinity. In association with such changes, many genes related to amino acid metabolism changed their expression levels. Notably, the increased glutamine content at high salinity appeared to be relevant to the increase of the expression level of the gene encoding glutamate-ammonia ligase which functions in the glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, the alanine content increased at high salinity was likely to be associated with the decrease in the expression levels of the alanine-glyoxylate transaminase gene. Thus, the changes in the concentration of free amino acids for osmoregulation in kuruma shrimp are considered to be regulated by the changes in the expression levels of genes related to amino acid metabolism.\\n\\nSummary statesmentKuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus changes free amino acid contents and associated gene expression levels in their muscle to adjust effectively to different salinity.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin-based cargo transport in cells frequently involves the coordinated activity of multiple motors, including kinesins from different families that move at different speeds. However, compared to the progress at the single-molecule level, mechanisms by which multiple kinesins coordinate their activity during cargo transport are poorly understood. To understand these multi-motor coordination mechanisms, defined pairs of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motors were assembled on DNA scaffolds and their motility examined in vitro. Although less processive than kinesin-1 at the single-molecule level, addition of kinesin-2 motors more effectively amplified cargo run lengths. By applying the law of total expectation to cargo binding durations in ADP, the kinesin-2 microtubule reattachment rate was shown to be 4-fold faster than that of kinesin-1. This difference in microtubule binding rates was also observed in solution by stopped-flow. High-resolution tracking of gold-nanoparticle-labeled cargo with 1 ms and 2 nm precision revealed that kinesin-2 motors detach and rebind to the microtubule much more frequently than do kinesin-1. Finally, cargo transported by kinesin-2 motors more effectively navigated roadblocks on the microtubule track. These results highlight the importance of motor reattachment kinetics during multi-motor transport and suggest a coordinated transport model in which kinesin-1 motors step effectively against loads while kinesin-2 motors rapidly unbind and rebind to the microtubule. This dynamic tethering by kinesin-2 maintains the cargo near the microtubule and enables effective navigation along crowded microtubules.",

Many target gene markers have been developed in plants, sharks, frogs, reptiles and others, but few have been reported in the ray-finned fishes. Here, we identified a suite of \\\"single-copy\\\" protein coding sequence (CDS) markers through comparing eight fish genomes, and tested them empirically in 83 species (33 families and 11 orders) of ray-finned fishes. Sorting through the markers according to their completeness and phylogenetic decisiveness in taxa tested resulted in a selection of 4,434 markers, which were proven to be useful in reconstructing phylogenies of the ray-finned fishes at different taxonomic level. We also proposed a strategy of refining baits (probes) design a posteriori based on empirical data.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlants demonstrate dynamic growth phenotypes that are determined by genetic and environmental factors. Phenotypic analysis of growth features over time is a key approach to understand how plants interact with environmental change as well as respond to different treatments. Although the importance of measuring dynamic growth traits is widely recognised, available open software tools are limited in terms of batch processing of image datasets, multiple trait analysis, software usability and cross-referencing results between experiments, making automated phenotypic analysis problematic.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present Leaf-GP (Growth Phenotypes), an easy-to-use and open software application that can be executed on different platforms. To facilitate diverse scientific user communities, we provide three versions of the software, including a graphic user interface (GUI) for personal computer (PC) users, a command-line interface for high-performance computer (HPC) users, and an interactive Jupyter Notebook (also known as the iPython Notebook) for computational biologists and computer scientists. The software is capable of extracting multiple growth traits automatically from large image datasets. We have utilised it in Arabidopsis thaliana and wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth studies at the Norwich Research Park (NRP, UK). By quantifying growth phenotypes over time, we are able to identify diverse plant growth patterns based on a variety of key growth-related phenotypes under varied experimental conditions.\\n\\nAs Leaf-GP has been evaluated with noisy image series acquired by different imaging devices and still produced reliable biologically relevant outputs, we believe that our automated analysis workflow and customised computer vision based feature extraction algorithms can facilitate a broader plant research community for their growth and development studies. Furthermore, because we implemented Leaf-GP based on open Python-based computer vision, image analysis and machine learning libraries, our software can not only contribute to biological research, but also exhibit how to utilise existing open numeric and scientific libraries (including Scikit-image, OpenCV, SciPy and Scikit-learn) to build sound plant phenomics analytic solutions, efficiently and effectively.\\n\\nConclusionsLeaf-GP is a comprehensive software application that provides three approaches to quantify multiple growth phenotypes from large image series. We demonstrate its usefulness and high accuracy based on two biological applications: (1) the quantification of growth traits for Arabidopsis genotypes under two temperature conditions; and (2) measuring wheat growth in the glasshouse over time. The software is easy-to-use and cross-platform, which can be executed on Mac OS, Windows and high-performance computing clusters (HPC), with open Python-based scientific libraries preinstalled. We share our modulated source code and executables (.exe for Windows; .app for Mac) together with this paper to serve the plant research community.

Testing of asymptomatic populations has been proposed, but prevalence rates in asymptomatic populations are not well established. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of M. genitalium in adults in the general population, in clinic-based samples, pregnant women, men who have sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSW).\\n\\nMethodsWe searched Embase, Medline, IndMED, AIM and LILACS from 1 January 1991 to 12 July 2016 without language restrictions. We included studies with 500 participants or more. We screened and selected studies and extracted data in duplicate. We examined eligible studies in forest plots and conducted random effects meta-analysis to estimate prevalence, if appropriate. Between study heterogeneity was examined using the I2 statistic and meta-regression.\\n\\nResultsOf 3,316 screened records, 63 were included. In randomly selected samples from the general population, the summary prevalence estimate was 1.3% (95% confidence intervals, CI 1.0 to 1.8%, I2 41.5%, 3 studies) in countries with higher levels of development and 3.9% (95% CI 2.2 to 6.7, I2 89.2%, 3 studies) in countries with lower levels. Prevalence estimates were similar in women and men (p=0.47). In clinic-based samples prevalence estimates were higher, except in asymptomatic patients (0.8%, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.4, I2 0.0%, 3 studies). Summary prevalence estimates were: pregnant women 0.9% (95% CI 0.6 to 1.4%, I2 0%, 4 studies); MSM in the community 3.2% (95% CI 2.1 to 5.1, I2 78.3%, 5 studies); FSW in the community 15.9% (95% CI 13.5 to 18.9, I2 =79.9%, 4 studies).\\n\\nDiscussionThis systematic review can inform testing guidelines for M. genitalium infection. The low estimated prevalence of M. genitalium in the general population, pregnant women and asymptomatic attenders at clinics does not support expansion of testing to asymptomatic people in these groups.\\n\\nRegistration Numbers\\n\\nPROSPERO: CRD42015020420",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma exhibits profound intratumoral heterogeneity in blood perfusion, which may cause inconsistent therapy response. Particularly, low perfusion may create hypoxic microenvironment and induce resistant clones. Thus, developing validated imaging approaches that define low perfusion compartments is crucial for clinical management.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 112 newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma patients were prospectively recruited for maximal safe resection. Preoperative MRI included anatomical, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated from DTI and DSC respectively. Using thresholding methods, two low perfusion compartments (ADCH-rCBVL and ADCL-rCBVL) were identified. Volumetric analysis was performed. Lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels were determined from multivoxel spectroscopy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.\\n\\nResultsTwo compartments displayed higher lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels than normal controls (each P < 0.001), suggesting hypoxic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The proportional volume of ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a larger infiltration area (P < 0.001, rho = 0.42). Lower lactate in this compartment was associated with a less invasive phenotype visualized on DTI. Multivariate Cox regression showed higher lactate level in the ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a worse survival (PFS: HR 2.995, P = 0.047; OS: HR 4.974, P = 0.005).\\n\\nConclusionsThe ADCL-rCBVL compartment represent a treatment resistant sub-region associated with glioblastoma invasiveness. This approach was based on clinically available imaging modalities and could thus provide crucial pretreatment information for clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense efforts, the cure rates of childhood and adult solid tumors are not satisfactory. Resistance to intensive chemotherapy is common, and targets for molecular therapies are largely undefined. We have now found that the majority of childhood solid tumors, including rhabdoid tumors, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma and Ewing sarcoma, express an active DNA transposase PGBD5 that can promote site-specific genomic rearrangements in human cells. Using functional genetic approaches, we found that mouse and human cells deficient in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair cannot tolerate the expression of PGBD5. In a chemical screen of DNA damage signaling inhibitors, we identified AZD6738 as a specific sensitizer of PGBD5-dependent DNA damage and apoptosis. We found that expression of PGBD5, but not its nuclease activity-deficient mutant, was sufficient to induce hypersensitivity to AZD6738. Depletion of endogenous PGBD5 conferred resistance to AZD6738 in human tumor cells. PGBD5-expressing tumor cells accumulated unrepaired DNA damage in response to AZD6738 treatment, and underwent apoptosis in both dividing and G1 phase cells in the absence of immediate DNA replication stress. Accordingly, AZD6738 exhibited nanomolar potency against the majority of neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, Ewing sarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cells tested, while sparing non-transformed human and mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. Finally, treatment with AZD6738 induced apoptosis and regression of human neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma tumors engrafted in immunodeficient mice in vivo. This effect was potentiated by combined treatment with cisplatin, including significant anti-tumor activity against patient-derived primary neuroblastoma xenografts. These findings delineate a therapeutically actionable synthetic dependency induced in PGBD5-expressing solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "Tissue culture medium routinely contains fetal bovine serum (FBS). Here we show that culturing human hepatoma cells in their native, adult serum (human serum, HS) results in the restoration of key morphological and metabolic features of normal liver cells. When moved to HS, these cells show differential transcription of 22-32% of the genes, stop proliferating, and assume a hepatocyte-like morphology. Metabolic analysis shows that the Warburg-like metabolic profile, typical for FBS-cultured cells, is replaced by a diverse metabolic profile consistent with in vivo hepatocytes. We demonstrate the formation of large lipid and glycogen stores, increased glycogenesis, increased {beta}-oxidation, increased ketogenesis, and decreased glycolysis. Finally, organ-specific functions are restored, including xenobiotics degradation and secretion of bile, very low density lipoprotein, and albumin. Thus, organ-specific functions are not necessarily lost in cell cultures, but might be merely suppressed in FBS. Together, we showed that cells that are representative of normal physiology can be produced from cancer cells simply by replacing FBS by HS in culture media. The effect of serum is often overseen in cell culture and we provide a detailed study in the changes that occur, provide insight in some of the serum components that may play a role in the establishment of the different phenotypes, and discuss how these finding might be beneficial to a variety of research fields.",

Genetic interactions are defined by linear forms with integer coefficients in the fitness variables assigned to genotypes. These forms generalize several popular approaches to study interactions, including Fourier-Walsh coefficients, interaction coordinates, and circuits. We assume that fitness measurements come with high uncertainty or are even unavailable, as is the case for many empirical studies, and derive interactions only from comparisons of genotypes with respect to their fitness, i.e. from partial fitness orders. We present a characterization of the class of partial fitness orders that imply interactions, using a graph-theoretic approach. Our characterization then yields an efficient algorithm for testing the condition when certain genetic interactions, such as sign epistasis, are implied. This provides an exponential improvement of the best previously known method. We also present a geometric interpretation of our characterization, which provides the basis for statistical analysis of partial fitness orders and genetic interactions.",

This trend has introduced at least two novel problems: an elevated risk of somatic disorders, such as cancer, and declining evolvability due to reduced population size, lower reproduction rate and extended generation time. Low population size is widely recognized to explain the high mutation rates in animals by limiting the presumed universally negative selection acting on mutation rates. Here, we present evidence from stochastic modeling that the direction and strength of selection acting on mutation rates is highly dependent on the evolution of somatic maintenance, and thus longevity, which modulates the cost of somatic mutations. We argue that this mechanism may have been critical in facilitating animal evolution.",

    "abstract": "By tethering their circular genomes (episomes) to host chromatin, DNA tumor viruses ensure retention and segregation of their genetic material during cell divisions. Despite functional genetic and crystallographic studies, there is little information addressing the three-dimensional structure of these tethers in cells, issues critical for understanding persistent infection by these viruses. Here, we have applied direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to establish the nanoarchitecture of tethers within cells latently infected with the oncogenic human pathogen, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Each KSHV tether comprises a series of homodimers of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) that bind with their C-termini to the tandem array of episomal terminal repeats (TRs) and with their N-termini to host chromatin. Super-resolution imaging revealed that individual KSHV tethers possess similar overall dimensions and, in aggregate, fold to occupy the volume of a prolate ellipsoid. Using plasmids with increasing numbers of TRs, we found that tethers display polymer power-law scaling behavior with a scaling exponent characteristic of active chromatin. For plasmids containing a two-TR tether, we determined the size, separation, and relative orientation of two distinct clusters of bound LANA, each corresponding to a single TR. From these data, we have generated a three-dimensional model of the episomal half of the tether that integrates and extends previously established findings from epi-fluorescent, crystallographic, and epigenetic approaches. Our findings also validate the use of dSTORM in establishing novel structural insights into the physical basis of molecular connections linking host and pathogen genomes.",

We investigated the effect of eye-movements in predictive feedback using functional brain imaging and eye-tracking whilst presenting an apparent motion illusion. Apparent motion induces an internal model of motion, during which sensory predictions of the illusory motion feed back to V1.

Here, with a high-fidelity database of natural stereo-images with groundtruth surface orientation at each pixel, we find dramatic differences in human tilt estimation with natural and artificial stimuli. With artificial stimuli, estimates are precise and unbiased. With natural stimuli, estimates are imprecise and strongly biased. An image-computable normative model grounded in natural scene statistics predicts human bias, precision, and trial-by-trial errors without fitting parameters to the human data. These similarities suggest that the complex human performance patterns with natural stimuli are lawful, and that human visual systems have internalized local image and scene statistics to optimally infer the three-dimensional structure of the environment.

    "abstract": "Isolated nuclei provide access to early steps in gene regulation involving chromatin as well as transcript production and processing. Here we describe transfer of the Isolation of Nuclei from TAgged specific Cell Types (INTACT) to the monocot rice (Oryza sativa L.).

This modified NTF was combined with codon optimized E. coli BirA in a single T-DNA construct. We also developed inexpensive methods for INTACT, T-DNA insertion mapping and profiling of the complete nuclear transcriptome, including a rRNA degradation procedure that minimizes pre-rRNA transcripts. A high-resolution comparison of nuclear and steady-state poly (A)+ transcript populations of seedling root tips confirmed the capture of pre-mRNA and exposed distinctions in diversity and abundance of the nuclear and total transcriptomes. This retooled INTACT can enable high-resolution monitoring of the nuclear transcriptome and chromatin in specific cell-types of rice and other species.\\n\\nSummaryImproved technology and methodology for affinity purification of nuclei and analysis of nuclear transcriptomes, chromatin and other nuclear components.",

    "abstract": "First paragraphDodders (Cuscuta spp.) are obligate parasitic plants that obtain water and nutrients from the stems of host plants via specialized feeding structures called haustoria. Dodder haustoria facilitate bi-directional movement of viruses, proteins, and mRNAs between host and parasite1, but the functional effects of these movements are not clear. Here we show that C. campestris haustoria accumulate high levels of many novel microRNAs (miRNAs) while parasitizing Arabidopsis thaliana hosts. Many of these miRNAs are 22 nts long, a usually rare size of plant miRNA associated with amplification of target silencing through secondary small interfering RNA (siRNA) production2. Several A. thaliana mRNAs are targeted by C. campestris 22 nt miRNAs during parasitism, resulting in mRNA cleavage, secondary siRNA production, and decreased mRNA accumulation levels. Hosts with mutations in two of the targets supported significantly higher growth of C. campestris. Homologs of target mRNAs from diverse plants also have predicted target sites to induced C. campestris miRNAs, and the same miRNAs are expressed and active against host targets when C. campestris parasitizes a different host, Nicotiana benthamiana. These data show that C. campestris miRNAs act as trans-species regulators of host gene expression, and suggest that they may act as virulence factors during parasitism.",

    "abstract": "Genetic elements compete for transmission through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their transmission through meiotic drive, in violation of Mendels Law of Segregation. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle, which implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we show that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulates microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry, and non-Mendelian segregation depends on this asymmetry. These signals depend on cortical polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their transmission.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial recombination and clonality underly the evolution and epidemiology of pathogenic lineages as well as their cosmopolitan spread. While the spread of stable clonal bacterial pathotypes drives disease epidemics, recombination leads to the evolution of new bacterial lineages. Recombinant lineages of plant bacterial pathogens are typically associated with colonization of novel hosts and emergence of new diseases. Here, we show that recombination between evolutionarily and phenotypically distinct plant pathogenic lineages has generated new recombinant lineages with unique combinations of pathogenicity and virulence factors. X. euvesicatoria (Xe) and X. perforans (Xp) are two closely related monophyletic species causing bacterial spot disease on tomato and pepper worldwide. We sequenced the genomes of strains representing populations on tomato in Nigeria and found shuffling of secretion systems and effectors such that these strains contain genes from both Xe and Xp. Multiple strains, from populations in Nigeria, Italy, and Florida, USA, exhibited extensive genomewide homologous recombination and both species exhibited dynamic open pangenomes. Our results show that recombination is generating new lineages of bacterial spot pathogens on tomato with consequences for disease management strategies.\\n\\nImportanceThe Xanthomonas pathogens that cause bacterial spot of tomato and pepper have been model systems for plant-microbe interactions. Two of these pathogens, X. euvesicatoria and X. perforans, are very closely related. Genome sequences of bacterial spot field strains from Nigeria, Italy, and the United States showed varying levels of homologous recombination that changed the amino sequence of effectors, secretion systems, and other proteins. This shuffling of genome content occurred between X. euvesicatoria and X. perforans, while a Nigerian lineage also contained the lipopolysaccharide cluster of a distantly related Xanthomonas species. Gene content varied among strains and the affected genes are important in the establishment of disease, therefore our findings point to global variation in the host-pathogen interaction driven by gene exchange among evolutionarily distinct lineages.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to test the within-subject repeatability of the perfusion fraction, diffusion coefficient and pseudo diffusion coefficient measurements in various fetal organs and in the placenta based on the intra-voxel incoherent motion imaging principle. In utero diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 1.5T and 3.0T clinical scanners with b-factors ranging from 0 to 900 s/mm2 in 16 steps and a tetrahedral diffusion-weighting encoding scheme. Data from 16 pregnant women (maternal age: 34 {+/-} 4.9 years, range: 24.6 -40.8) were included in this pilot study. For 15 cases, IVIM was repeated (maternal age: 33.7 {+/-} 5.2 years, range: 24.6 - 40.8). A bi-exponential model was fitted on the volume-averaged diffusion values and the perfusion fraction (f), diffusion coefficient (d) and pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*) were calculated. Within-subject repeatability was given as the test-retest variability of the IVIM parameters in the fetal frontal cortex, frontal white matter, cerebellum, lungs, kidneys, liver and in the placenta. An in-house developed image processing script was utilized to remove the image frames with excessive motion, and to perform motion correction by using non-linear freeform deformations. For the fetal lungs, liver and the placenta, within-subject variability ranged from 14.4% to 20.4% for f, 12.2% to 14.1% for d and 16.8% to 25.3% for D*. The diffusion coefficients of the investigated brain regions were moderately to highly reproducible (4.8% to 15.2%), however, f and D* showed inferior reproducibility compared to corresponding measures derived for the lungs, liver and placenta. The IVIM-based parameters of the fetal kidney were revealed to be highly variable across scans. Our results indicate that in utero intra-voxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imaging potentially provides a novel method for examining microvascular perfusion and diffusion in the developing human fetus. The reproducible quantification of the perfusion and diffusion parameters depend greatly upon data quality, fetal and maternal movements, and image post processing to detect and remove corrupted data before calculating the IVIM model.",

    "abstract": "Within cells, numerous motor and non-motor microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) simultaneously converge on the microtubule lattice. How the binding activities of non-motor MAPs are coordinated and how they contribute to the balance and distribution of microtubule motor transport is unknown. Here, we examine the relationship between MAP7 and tau due to their antagonistic effects on neuronal branch formation and kinesin motility in vivo1-8. We find that MAP7 and tau compete for binding to microtubules, and determine a mechanism by which MAP7 displaces tau from the lattice. In striking contrast to the inhibitory effect of tau, MAP7 promotes kinesin-based transport in vivo and strongly enhances kinesin-1 binding to the microtubule in vitro, providing evidence for direct enhancement of motor motility by a MAP. In contrast, both MAP7 and tau strongly inhibit kinesin-3 and have no effect on cytoplasmic dynein, demonstrating that MAPs exhibit differential control over distinct classes of motors. Overall, these results reveal a general principle for how MAP competition dictates access to the microtubule to determine the correct distribution and balance of molecular motor activity.",

    "abstract": "Earthworms show a wide spectrum of regenerative potential with certain species like Eisenia fetida capable of regenerating more than two-thirds of their body while other closely related species, such as Paranais litoralis seem to have lost this ability. Earthworms belong to the phylum annelida, in which the genomes of the marine oligochaete Capitella telata, and the freshwater leech Helobdella robusta have been sequenced and studied. The terrestrial annelids, in spite of their ecological relevance and unique biochemical repertoire, are represented by a single rough genome draft of Eisenia fetida (North American isolate), which suggested that extensive duplications have led to a large number of HOX genes in this annelid. Herein, we report the draft genome sequence of Eisenia fetida (Indian isolate), a terrestrial redworm widely used for vermicomposting assembled using short reads and mate-pair reads. An in-depth analysis of the miRNome of the worm, showed that many miRNA gene families have also undergone extensive duplications. Genes for several important proteins such as sialidases and neurotrophins were identified by RNA sequencing of tissue samples. We also used de novo assembled RNA-Seq data to identify genes that are differentially expressed during regeneration, both in the newly regenerating cells and in the adjacent tissue. Sox4, a master regulator of TGF-beta induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition was induced in the newly regenerated tissue. The regeneration of the ventral nerve cord was also accompanied by the induction of nerve growth factor and neurofilament genes. The metagenome of the worm, characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing, revealed the identity of several bacterial species that reside in the nephridia of the worm. Comparison of the bodywall and cocoon metagenomes showed exclusion of hereditary symbionts in the regenerated tissue. In summary, we present extensive genome, transcriptome and metagenome data to establish the transcriptome and metagenome dynamics during regeneration.",

    "abstract": "In many Lactobacillales species (i.e. lactic acid bacteria), peptidoglycan is decorated by polyrhamnose polysaccharides that are critical for cell envelope integrity and cell shape and also represent key antigenic determinants. Despite the biological importance of these polysaccharides, their biosynthetic pathways have received limited attention. The important human pathogen, Streptococcus pyogenes, synthesizes a key antigenic surface polymer--the Lancefield group A carbohydrate (GAC). GAC is covalently attached to peptidoglycan and consists of a polyrhamnose polymer, with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chains, which is an essential virulence determinant. The molecular details of the mechanism of polyrhamnose modification with GlcNAc are currently unknown. In this report, using molecular genetics, analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrated that GAC biosynthesis requires two distinct undecaprenol-linked GlcNAc-lipid intermediates: GlcNAc-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-P-Und) produced by the GlcNAc-phosphate transferase GacO and GlcNAc-phosphate-undecaprenol (GlcNAc-P-Und) produced by the glycosyltransferase GacI. Further investigations revealed that the GAC polyrhamnose backbone is assembled on GlcNAc-P-P-Und. Our results also suggested that a GT-C glycosyltranferase, GacL, transfers GlcNAc from GlcNAc-P-Und to polyrhamnose. Moreover, GacJ, a small membrane-associated protein, formed a complex with GacI and significantly stimulated its catalytic activity. Of note, we observed that GacI homologs perform a similar function in Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis. In conclusion, the elucidation of GAC biosynthesis in S. pyogenes reported here enhances our understanding of how other Gram-positive bacteria produce essential components of their cell wall.",

    "abstract": "Decision making is a multifaceted process, consisting of several distinct phases that likely require different cognitive operations. Previous work showed that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a critical substrate for decision making involving risk of punishment; however, it is unclear how the BLA is recruited at different stages of the decision process. To this end, the current study used optogenetics to inhibit the BLA during specific task phases in a model of risky decision making (Risky Decision-making Task; RDT) in which rats choose between a small, \\\"safe\\\" reward and a large reward accompanied by varying probabilities of footshock punishment. Rats received intra-BLA microinjections of viral vectors carrying either halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0-mCherry) or mCherry alone (control) followed by optic fiber implants and were trained in the RDT. Laser stimulation during the task occurred during either intertrial interval, deliberation, or reward outcome phases, the latter of which was further divided into the three possible outcomes (small, safe; large, unpunished; large, punished). Inhibition of the BLA selectively during the deliberation phase decreased choice of the large, risky outcome (decreased risky choice). In contrast, BLA inhibition selectively during delivery of the large, punished outcome increased risky choice. Inhibition had no effect during the other phases, nor did it affect performance in control rats. Collectively, these data indicate that the BLA can either inhibit or promote choice of risky options, depending on the phase of the decision process in which it is active.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTo date, most behavioral neuroscience research on neural mechanisms of decision making has employed techniques that preclude assessment of distinct phases of the decision process. Here we show that optogenetic inhibition of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) has opposite effects on choice behavior in a rat model of risky decision making depending on the phase in which inhibition occurs. BLA inhibition during a period of deliberation between small, safe and large, risky outcomes decreased risky choice. In contrast, BLA inhibition during receipt of the large, punished outcome increased risky choice. These findings highlight the importance of temporally targeted approaches to understand neural substrates underlying complex cognitive processes. More importantly, they reveal novel information about dynamic BLA modulation of risky choice.",

Here, we investigate the specific roles of these brain regions in learning rules that depend critically on the formation of abstract concepts as opposed to simpler input-output associations. To this aim, we tested monkeys with bilateral removals of either LPFC or OFC on a rapidly learned task requiring the formation of the abstract concept of same vs. different. While monkeys with OFC removals were significantly slower than controls at both acquiring and reversing the concept-based rule, monkeys with LPFC removals were not impaired in acquiring the task, but were significantly slower at rule reversal. Neither group was impaired in the acquisition or reversal of a delayed visual cue-outcome association task without a concept-based rule. These results suggest that OFC is essential for the implementation of a concept-based rule, whereas LPFC seems essential for its modification once established.",

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) allow cells to rapidly and reversibly regulate molecular pathways, but it remains unclear how individual PTMs regulate fitness. Here, we studied >130 PTM sites in Escherichia coli to unravel how PTMs regulate cell metabolism and fitness in response to environmental changes, such as the glucose-acetate diauxie. Using a new metabolic modeling approach, we found a significant fraction of post-translationally modified enzymes are predicted to control shifts in pathway usage following evolutionarily-important environmental changes. Genetic screens using Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering confirmed that these PTMs impact cellular fitness, especially under dynamically changing environments. Finally, mechanisms of how individual PTMs impact protein function were detailed using molecular dynamics simulations and enzyme assays for enolase, transaldolase, and serine hydroxymethyltransferase. Thus, by integrating whole-cell data and pathway modeling with detailed biochemical analysis, we unraveled how individual PTMs regulate enzymes, pathways, and phenotypes to adapt to sudden environmental changes.",
