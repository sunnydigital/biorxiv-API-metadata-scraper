    "abstract": "To understand cellular coordination of multiple transcriptome regulation mechanisms, we simultaneously measured transcription rate (TR), mRNA abundance (RA) and translation activity (TA). This revealed multiple quantitative insights. First, the genomic profiles of the three parameters are systematically different in key statistical features. Sequentially more genes exhibit extreme low or high expression values from TR to RA, then to TA. That is, because of cellular coordination of these regulatory mechanisms, sequentially higher levels of gene expression selectivity are achieved as genetic information flow from the genome to the proteome. Second, the contribution of the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism to the cellular coordination process was assessed. The data enabled an estimation of mRNA stability, revealing a moderate but significant positive correlation between the estimated mRNA stability and translation activity. Third, the proportion of a mRNA occupied by un-translated regions (UTR) exhibits a negative relationship with the level of this correlation, and is thus a major determinant of the mode of regulation of the mRNA. High-UTR-proportion mRNAs tend to defy the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism, staying out of the polysome but remaining stable; mRNAs with little UTRs largely follow this regulation. In summary, we quantitatively delineated the relationship among multiple transcriptome regulation parameters, i.e., cellular coordination of corresponding regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe plant immune system is innate, encoded in the germline. Using it efficiently, plants are capable of recognizing a diverse range of rapidly evolving pathogens. A recently described phenomenon shows that plant immune receptors are able to recognize pathogen effectors through the acquisition of exogenous protein domains from other plant genes.\\n\\nResultsWe showed that plant immune receptors with integrated domains are distributed unevenly across their phylogeny in grasses. Using phylogenetic analysis, we uncovered a major integration clade, whose members underwent repeated independent integration events producing diverse fusions. This clade is ancestral in grasses with members often found on syntenic chromosomes. Analyses of these fusion events revealed that homologous receptors can be fused to diverse domains. Furthermore, we discovered a 43 amino acids long motif that was associated with this dominant integration clade and was located immediately upstream of the fusion site. Sequence analysis revealed that DNA transposition and/or ectopic recombination are the most likely mechanisms of NLR-ID formation.\\n\\nConclusionsThe identification of this subclass of plant immune receptors that is naturally adapted to new domain integration will inform biotechnological approaches for generating synthetic receptors with novel pathogen  baits.",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and related apicomplexan pathogens contain an essential plastid organelle, the apicoplast, which is a key anti-parasitic target. Derived from secondary endosymbiosis, the apicoplast depends on novel, but largely cryptic, mechanisms for protein/lipid import and organelle inheritance during parasite replication. These critical biogenesis pathways present untapped opportunities to discover new parasite-specific drug targets. We used an innovative screen to identify actinonin as having a novel mechanism-of-action inhibiting apicoplast biogenesis. Resistant mutation, chemical-genetic interaction, and biochemical inhibition demonstrate that the unexpected target of actinonin in P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii is FtsH1, a homolog of a bacterial membrane AAA+ metalloprotease. Pf FtsH1 is the first novel factor required for apicoplast biogenesis identified in a phenotypic screen. Our findings demonstrate that FtsH1 is a novel and, importantly, druggable antimalarial target. Development of FtsH1 inhibitors will have significant advantages with improved drug kinetics and multistage efficacy against multiple human parasites.",

Here, we use somatic mutation signatures - each representing a mutagenic process - derived from 3056 patients spanning 19 cancer types to quantify the asymmetry of mutational signatures around replication origins and between early and late replicating regions. We observe that 22 out of 29 mutational signatures are significantly impacted by DNA replication. The distinct associations of different signatures with replication timing and direction around origins shed new light on several mutagenic processes, for example suggesting that oxidative damage to the nucleotide pool substantially contributes to the mutational landscape of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

    "abstract": "Inbreeding depression is widely hypothesised to drive adaptive evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance, which in turn are hypothesised to affect evolution of polyandry (i.e., female multiple mating). However, surprisingly little theory or modelling critically examines selection for pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, or both strategies, given evolutionary constraints and direct costs, or examines how evolution of inbreeding avoidance strategies might feed back to affect evolution of polyandry. Selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, but not for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, requires polyandry, while interactions between pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might cause functional redundancy (i.e.,  degeneracy) potentially generating complex evolutionary dynamics among inbreeding strategies and polyandry. We used individual-based modelling to quantify evolution of interacting pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry given strong inbreeding depression and different evolutionary constraints and direct costs. We found that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance increased selection for initially rare polyandry, and that evolution of a costly inbreeding avoidance strategy became negligible over time given a lower cost alternative strategy. Further, fixed pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance often completely precluded evolution of polyandry and hence post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, but fixed post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance did not preclude evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. Evolution of inbreeding avoidance phenotypes and associated polyandry are therefore affected by evolutionary feedbacks and degeneracy. All else being equal, evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and resulting low polyandry is more likely when post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is precluded or costly, and evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance greatly facilitates evolution of costly polyandry.",

We have previously identified a requirement for NK cell signaling receptors associated with terminal maturation in NK cell migration. However, the relationship between NK cell migration and differentiation is still unclear. Here, we perform continuous long-term imaging and tracking of NK cell progenitors undergoing in vitro differentiation. We demonstrate that NK cell precursors can be tracked over long time periods on the order of weeks by utilizing phase-contrast microscopy, and show that these cells acquire increasing motility as they mature. Additionally, we observe that NK cells display a more heterogeneous range of migratory behaviors at later stages of development, with the acquisition of complex modes of migration that are associated with terminal maturation. Together these data demonstrate previously unknown migratory behaviors of innate lymphocytes undergoing lineage differentiation revealed by long-term imaging and analysis workflows.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDAlong with time, variation in the exposome is dependent on the location and sex of study participants. One specific factor that may influence exposure co-variations is a shared household environment.\\n\\nOBJECTIVESTo examine the influence of shared household and partners sex in relation to the variation in 128 endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposures among couples.\\n\\nMETHODSIn a cohort comprising 501 couples trying for pregnancy, we measured 128 (13 chemical classes) persistent and non-persistent EDCs and estimated 1) sex-specific differences; 2) variance explained by shared household; and 3) Spearmans rank correlation coefficients (rs) for females, males, and couples exposures.\\n\\nRESULTSSex was correlated with 8 EDCs including polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) (p < 0.05). Shared household explained 43% and 41% of the total variance for PFASs and blood metals, respectively, but less than 20% for the remaining 11 EDC classes. Co-exposure patterns of the exposome were similar between females and males, with within-class rs higher for persistent and lower for non-persistent chemicals. Median rss of polybrominated compounds and urine metalloids were 0.45 and 0.09, respectively, for females (0.41 and 0.08 for males), whereas lower rss for these 2 classes were found for couples (0.21 and 0.04).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOverall, sex did not significantly affect EDC levels in couples. Individual, rather than shared environment, could be a major factor influencing the co-variation of 128 markers of the exposome. Correlations between exposures are lower in couples than in individual partners and have important analytical and sampling implications for epidemiological study.",

Here, we report the results of the spikefinder challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity.

When introduced into mice, a family of short, triphosphorylated Stem Loop RNAs (SLRs) induces a potent interferon response and the activation of specific genes essential for antiviral defense. Using RNAseq, we provide the first in-vivo genome-wide view of the expression networks that are initiated upon RIG-I activation. We observe that SLRs specifically induce type I interferons, subsets of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and cellular remodeling factors. By contrast, poly(I:C), which binds and activates multiple RNA sensors, induces type III interferons and several unique ISGs. The short length (10-14 base pairs) and robust function of SLRs in mice demonstrate that RIG-I forms active signaling complexes without oligomerizing on RNA. These findings demonstrate that SLRs are potent therapeutic and investigative tools for targeted modulation of the innate immune system.",

However, it remains challenging to characterize low-abundance, slow-growing microorganisms that play key roles in biogeochemical cycling. With the goal of isolating transcriptionally active cells of these microorganisms from environmental samples, we developed fluorescent in situ hybridization of transcript-annealing molecular beacons (FISH-TAMB) to label living prokaryotic cells. FISH-TAMB utilizes polyarginine cell-penetrating peptides to deliver molecular beacons across cell walls and membranes. Target cells are fluorescently labeled via hybridization between molecular beacons and messenger RNA of targeted functional genes. FISH-TAMBs target specificity and deliverance into both bacterial and archaeal cells were demonstrated by labeling intracellular methyl-coenzyme M reductase A (mcrA) transcripts expressed by Escherichia coli mcrA+, Methanosarcina barkeri, and a methanogenic enrichment of deep continental fracture fluid. Growth curve analysis supported sustained cellular viability following FISH-TAMB treatment. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy detected labeled single cells and single cells in aggregates with unlabeled cells. As FISH-TAMB is amenable to target any functional gene of interest, when coupled with cell sorting, imaging, and sequencing techniques, FISH-TAMB will enable characterization of key uncharacterized rare biosphere microorganisms and of the syntrophically activated metabolic pathways between physically associated microorganisms.",

At the molecular level, cell identity is determined by the coordinated activation and repression of defined sets of genes. Defects in the maintenance of the genetic programs required for identity can have dire consequences such as organ malformation and cancer. The tumor suppressor L(3)mbt was shown to secure cellular identity in Drosophila larval brains by repressing germline-specific genes. Here we interrogate the temporal and spatial requirements for L(3)mbt in the Drosophila ovary, and show that it safeguards the integrity of both somatic and germline tissues. L(3)mbt mutant ovaries exhibit multiple developmental defects, which we find to be largely caused by the inappropriate expression of a single gene, nanos, a key regulator of germline fate, in the somatic cells of the ovary. In the female germline, we find that L(3)mbt represses testis-specific and neuronal genes. Molecularly, we show that L(3)mbt function in the ovary is mediated through its cofactor Lint1 but independent of the dREAM complex. Together, our work uncovers a more complex role for L(3)mbt than previously understood and demonstrates that L(3)mbt secures tissue identity by preventing the simultaneous expression of original identity markers and tissue-specific misexpression signatures.",

Although the role of Shh in providing positional information in the neural tube has been experimentally proven, the exact underlying mechanism still remains unclear. In this study, we report that overexpression of Shh affects motor neuron positioning in the spinal cord during chicken embryo development by inducing abnormalities in the structure of the motor column and motor neuron integration. In addition, Shh overexpression inhibits the expression of dorsal transcription factors and commissural axon projections. Our results indicate that correct location of Shh expression is the key to the formation of the motor column. In conclusion, the overexpression of Shh in the spinal cord not only affects the positioning of motor neurons, but also induces abnormalities in the structure of the motor column.",

However, motor function relies on a network of interconnected brain regions and the link between the structural properties characterizing these distributed brain networks and motor function remains poorly understood. Here, we examined whether distributed patterns of brain structure, extending beyond the primary motor cortex can help classify two forms of motor function: corticospinal excitability and intracortical inhibition. To this effect, we recorded high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scans in 25 healthy volunteers. To measure corticospinal excitability and inhibition in the same volunteers we recorded motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in a separate session. Support vector machine (SVM) pattern classification was used to identify distributed multivoxel gray matter areas, which distinguished subjects who had lower and higher MEPs and SICIs. We found that MEP and SICI classification could be predicted based on a widely distributed, largely non-overlapping pattern of voxels in the frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital and cerebellar regions. Thus, structural properties distributed over the brain beyond the primary motor cortex relate to motor function.",

Here, we present local changes in K-Ras structure, conformation and dynamics upon G12D mutation, from long-timescale Molecular Dynamics simulations of active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) forms of wild-type and mutant K-Ras, with an integrated investigation of atomistic-level changes, local conformational shifts and correlated residue motions. Our results reveal that the local changes in K-Ras are specific to bound nucleotide (GTP or GDP), and we provide a structural basis for this. Specifically, we show that G12D mutation causes a shift in the population of local conformational states of K-Ras, especially in Switch-II (SII) and 3-helix regions, in favor of a conformation that is associated with a catalytically impaired state through structural changes; it also causes SII motions to anti-correlate with other regions. This detailed picture of G12D mutation effects on the local dynamic characteristics of both active and inactive protein helps enhance our understanding of local K-Ras dynamics, and can inform studies on the development of direct inhibitors towards the treatment of K-RasG12D-driven cancers.",

    "abstract": "Unlike mammalian aging associated with many hallmarks, E. coli aging is only significantly characterized by protein aggregation, thus offering an excellent model for addressing the relationship between protein aggregation and aging. Here we characterized conformations, unfolding and dynamics of ribosomal protein S1 and its D3/D5 domains using NMR, CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. S1 is a 557-residue modular protein containing six S1 motifs. Paradoxically, while S1 is well-folded and very soluble in vitro, it was found in various lists of aggregated E. coli proteins. Our results decipher: 1) S1 has dynamic inter-domain interactions. Strikingly, S1 and its D3/D5 domains have significantly exposed hydrophobic patches characterized by irreversible unfolding. 2) Although D5 has significantly restricted backbone motion on ps-ns time scale, it has global s-ms conformational dynamics and particularly high \\\"global breathing\\\" motions. 3) D5 assumes the conserved {beta}-barrel fold but contains large hydrophobic patches at least dynamically accessible. Taken together, our study reveals that S1 could be prone to aggregation due to significant dynamics at two levels: inter-domain interactions and individual domains, which may even render buried hydrophobic patches/cores accessible for driving aggregation. This mechanism is most likely to operate in many proteins of E. coli and other organisms including human.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between proliferation and tissue topology in an epithelial tissue undergoing elongation. We found that cell division is not required for elongation of the early Drosophila follicular epithelium, but does drive the tissue towards optimal geometric packing. To increase tissue regularity, cell divisions are oriented in the planar axis, along the direction of tissue expansion. Planar division orientation is governed by apico-cortical tension, which aligns with tissue expansion but not with interphase cell shape elongation. Hertwigs Rule, which holds that cell elongation determines division orientation, is therefore broken in this tissue. We tested whether this observation could be explained by anisotropic activity of the conserved Pins/Mud spindle-orienting machinery, which controls division orientation in the apical-basal axis. We found that Pins/Mud does not participate in planar division orientation. Rather, tension translates into planar division orientation in a manner dependent on Canoe/Afadin, which links actomyosin to adherens junctions. These findings demonstrate that division orientation in different axes - apical-basal and planar - is controlled by distinct, independent mechanisms in a proliferating epithelium.\\n\\nSummary StatementRegularity in a proliferating epithelium requires cells to divorce division orientation from interphase shape, which they accomplish by using distinct mechanisms to orient divisions in the apical-basal and planar axes.",
