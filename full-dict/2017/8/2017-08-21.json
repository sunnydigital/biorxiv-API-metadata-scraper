    "abstract": "Agriculture first reached the Iberian Peninsula around 5700 BCE. However, little is known about the genetic structure and changes of prehistoric populations in different geographic areas of Iberia. In our study, we focused on the maternal genetic makeup of the Neolithic ([~] 5500-3000 BCE), Chalcolithic ([~] 3000-2200 BCE) and Early Bronze Age ([~] 2200-1500 BCE). We report ancient mitochondrial DNA results of 213 individuals (151 HVS-I sequences) from the northeast, central, southeast and southwest regions and thus on the largest archaeogenetic dataset from the Peninsula to date. Similar to other parts of Europe, we observe a discontinuity between hunter-gatherers and the first farmers of the Neolithic. During the subsequent periods, we detect regional continuity of Early Neolithic lineages across Iberia, however the genetic contribution of hunter-gatherers is generally higher than in other parts of Europe and varies regionally. In contrast to ancient DNA findings from Central Europe, we do not observe a major turnover in the mtDNA record of the Iberian Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, suggesting that the population history of the Iberian Peninsula is distinct in character.",

    "abstract": "Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204 (N=32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and {Omega}nyx).\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe describe Latent change score modelling as a flexible statistical tool\\nC_LIO_LIKey developmental questions can be readily formalized using LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWe provide accessible open source code and software examples to fit LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWhite matter structural change is negatively correlated with processing speed gains\\nC_LIO_LIFrontal lobe thinning in adolescence is more variable in males than females\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts using long reads has paved the way for the discovery of thousands of novel transcripts, even in very well annotated organisms as mice and humans. Nonetheless, there is a need for studies and tools that characterize these novel isoforms. Here we present SQANTI, an automated pipeline for the classification of long-read transcripts that computes 47 descriptors that can be used to assess the quality of the data and of the preprocessing pipelines. We applied SQANTI to a neuronal mouse transcriptome using PacBio long reads and illustrate how the tool is effective in readily describing the composition of and characterizing the full-length transcriptome. We perform extensive evaluation of ToFU PacBio transcripts by PCR to reveal that an important number of the novel transcripts are technical artifacts of the sequencing approach, and that SQANTI quality descriptors can be used to engineer a filtering strategy to remove them. Most novel transcripts in this curated transcriptome are novel combinations of existing splice sites, result more frequently in novel ORFs than novel UTRs and are enriched in both general metabolic and neural specific functions. We show that these new transcripts have a major impact in the correct quantification of transcript levels by state-of-the-art short-read based quantification algorithms. By comparing our iso-transcriptome with public proteomics databases we find that alternative isoforms are elusive to proteogenomics detection and are variable in protein changes with respect to the principal isoform of their genes. SQANTI allows the user to maximize the analytical outcome of long read technologies by providing the tools to deliver quality-evaluated and curated full-length transcriptomes.

    "abstract": "Selfish genetic elements (SGEs), such as insertion sequences (ISs) and transposons are found in most genomes. Transposons are usually identifiable by their high copy number within genomes. In contrast REP associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs), a recently described class of bacterial transposase, are typically present at just one copy per genome. This suggests that RAYTs no longer copy themselves and thus they no longer function as a typical transposase. Motivated by this possibility we interrogated thousands of fully sequenced bacterial genomes in order to determine patterns of RAYT diversity, their distribution across chromosomes and accessory elements, and rate of duplication. RAYTs encompass exceptional diversity and are divisible into at least five distinct groups. They possess features more similar to housekeeping genes than insertion sequences, are predominantly vertically transmitted and have persisted through evolutionary time to the point where they are now found in 24% of all species for which at least one fully sequenced genome is available. Overall, the genomic distribution of RAYTs suggests that they have been co-opted by host genomes to perform a function that benefits the host cell.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge in enthusiasm for simultaneously inferring relationships from extinct and extant species has reinvigorated interest in statistical approaches for modelling morphological evolution. Current statistical methods use the Mk model to describe substitutions between discrete character states. Although representing a significant step forward, the Mk model presents challenges in biological interpretation, and its adequacy in modelling morphological evolution has not been well explored. Another major hurdle in morphological phylogenetics concerns the process of character coding of discrete characters. The often subjective nature of discrete character coding can generate discordant results that are rooted in individual researchers subjective interpretations. Employing continuous measurements to infer phylogenies may alleviate some of these issues. Although not widely used in the inference of topology, models describing the evolution of continuous characters have been well examined, and their statistical behaviour is well understood. Also, continuous measurements avoid the substantial ambiguity often associated with the assignment of discrete characters to states. I present a set of simulations to determine whether use of continuous characters is a feasible alternative or supplement to discrete characters for inferring phylogeny. I compare relative reconstruction accuracy by inferring phylogenies from simulated continuous and discrete characters. These tests demonstrate significant promise for continuous traits by demonstrating their higher overall accuracy as compared to reconstruction from discrete characters under Mk when simulated under unbounded Brownian motion, and equal performance when simulated under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. Continuous characters also perform reasonably well in the presence of covariance between sites. I argue that inferring phylogenies directly from continuous traits may be benefit efforts to maximise phylogenetic information in morphological datasets by preserving larger variation in state space compared to many discretisation schemes. I also suggest that the use of continuous trait models in phylogenetic reconstruction may alleviate potential concerns of discrete character model adequacy, while identifying areas that require further study in this area. This study provides an initial controlled demonstration of the efficacy of continuous characters in phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "In endothermic species, heat released as a product of metabolism ensures stable internal temperature throughout the organism, despite varying environmental conditions. Mitochondria are major actors in this thermogenic process. Part of the energy released by the oxidation of respiratory substrates drives ATP synthesis and metabolite transport, while a noticeable proportion is released as heat. Using a temperature-sensitive fluorescent probe targeted to mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial temperature in situ under different physiological conditions. At a constant external temperature of 38 {degrees}C, mitochondria were more than 10 {degrees}C warmer when the respiratory chain was fully functional, both in HEK293cells and primary skin fibroblasts. This differential was abolished in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA or by respiratory inhibitors, but preserved or enhanced by expressing thermogenic enzymes such as the alternative oxidase or the uncoupling protein 1. The activity of various RC enzymes was maximal at, or slightly above, 50 {degrees}C. Our study prompts a re-examination of the literature on mitochondria, taking account of the inferred high temperature.",

    "abstract": "Long terminal-repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are prevalent in plant genomes. Identification of LTR-RTs is critical for achieving high-quality gene annotation. Based on the well-conserved structure, multiple programs were developed for de novo identification of LTR-RTs; however, these programs are associated with low specificity and high false discovery rate (FDR). Here we report LTR_retriever, a multithreading empowered Perl program that identifies LTR-RTs and generates high-quality LTR libraries from genomic sequences. LTR_retriever demonstrated significant improvements by achieving high levels of sensitivity (91.8%), specificity (94.7%), accuracy (94.3%), and precision (90.6%) in model plants. LTR_retriever is also compatible with long sequencing reads. With 40k self-corrected PacBio reads equivalent to 4.5X genome coverage in Arabidopsis, the constructed LTR library showed excellent sensitivity and specificity. In addition to canonical LTR-RTs with 5'-TG..CA-3' termini, LTR_retriever also identifies non-canonical LTR-RTs (non-TGCA), which have been largely ignored in genome-wide studies. We identified seven types of non-canonical LTRs from 42 out of 50 plant genomes. The majority of non-canonical LTRs are Copia elements, with which the LTR is four times shorter than that of other Copia elements, which may be a result of their target specificity. Strikingly, non-TGCA Copia elements are often located in genic regions and preferentially insert nearby or within genes, indicating their impact on the evolution of genes and potential as mutagenesis tools.",

    "abstract": "The need for generating precisely designed mutations is common in genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Here, I describe a new {lambda} Red recombineering method (Direct and Inverted Repeat stimulated excision; DIRex) for fast and easy generation of single point mutations, small insertions or replacements as well as deletions of any size, in bacterial genes. The method does not leave any resistance marker or scar sequence and requires only one transformation to generate a semi-stable intermediate insertion mutant. Spontaneous excision of the intermediate efficiently and accurately generates the final mutant. In addition, the intermediate is transferable between strains by generalized transductions, enabling transfer of the mutation into multiple strains without repeating the recombineering step. Existing methods that can be used to accomplish similar results are either (i) more complicated to design, (ii) more limited in what mutation types can be made, or (iii) require expression of extrinsic factors in addition to {lambda} Red. I demonstrate the utility of the method by generating several deletions, small insertions/replacements, and single nucleotide exchanges in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, the design parameters that influence the excision frequency and the success rate of generating desired point mutations have been examined to determine design guidelines for optimal efficiency.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibiotic resistance poses a threat to public health and a burden to healthcare systems. Escherichia coli causes more bacteraemia cases in England than any other bacterial species, these infections, in part due to their high incidence, also pose a significant antibiotic resistance burden. The main aim of this study was to estimate the impact of E. coli bacteraemia on patient in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Secondarily, this study also aimed to estimate the effect of antibiotic resistance on these outcomes.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsCase patients were adult E. coli bacteraemia patients infected between July 2011 and June 2012, as reported in an English national mandatory surveillance database, with susceptibility data taken from a national laboratory surveillance database. Control patients were all non-case, adult patients with an English hospital admission record. Case and control patient characteristics and admission information were taken from NHS Digital Datasets.  Resistance was defined as non-susceptible and intermediate isolates, whilst  susceptible was defined as susceptible and non-tested isolates. Time to in-hospital mortality and discharge was investigated through Cox proportional hazards models. To acquire estimates of excess length of stay, multistate models were constructed, with a unit bed day cost applied to estimate cost burden. The total number of case and control hospital spells was 14,051 and 8,919,275 respectively. Acquisition of E. coli bacteraemia was associated with a statistically significant increased daily risk of in-hospital mortality, especially for the first eight days of someones hospital admission [Hazard Ratio = 2.77 (95% confidence interval; 2.61-2.94)]. Antibiotic resistance did not seem to significantly increase this risk further, though did significantly reduce risk of experiencing a discharge event (dead or alive). E.coli bacteraemia was estimated to cost {pound}14,340,900 over the study period (rounded to the nearest {pound}100), with resistance associated with excess costs per infection of {pound}220 - {pound}420 dependent on resistance type, for those where a significant impact was found (rounded to the nearest {pound}10).\\n\\nConclusionsE. coli bacteraemia places a significant burden on patient health and on the hospital sector in England. Resistance is an important factor on length of stay with regards to such infections.",

With several approaches, studies have proposed different hypotheses relating female dispersion and infanticide as drivers for the evolution of social monogamy. Here, we used an agent-based model, that allowed us to examine how different mating behaviors affect populations in a controlled computational environment. We found that the evolution of social monogamy does not rely on a single factor. Rather, our experimental results support an interplay of different factors in the evolution of social monogamy - female dispersion and availability and breeding season duration - and suggests that polygamy will only evolve in populations with a female-biased operational sex ratio or one where cheating is common. These results can explain why social monogamy is so uncommon in mammals and points to new lines for ethological investigation of mammalian behavior.",

It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a domain-general resource that is applied to different tasks, or whether self-evaluative processes are domain-specific. Here we directly investigated this issue by examining the neural substrates engaged when metacognitive judgments were made by human participants during perceptual and memory tasks matched for stimulus and performance characteristics. By comparing patterns of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity while subjects evaluated their performance, we revealed both domain-specific and domain-general metacognitive representations. Multi-voxel activity patterns in anterior prefrontal cortex predicted levels of confidence in a domain-specific fashion, whereas domain-general signals predicting confidence and accuracy were found in a widespread network in the frontal and posterior midline. The demonstration of domain-specific metacognitive representations suggests the presence of a content-rich mechanism available to introspection and cognitive control.\\n\\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW O_SCPLOWSTATEMENTC_SCPLOWWe use human neuroimaging to investigate processes supporting memory and perceptual metacognition.

The advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing now allows to generate knock-out alleles for any gene and entire gene families. Even in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, gene editing is welcomed as T-DNA insertion lines do not always generate null alleles. Here, we show efficient generation of heritable mutations in Arabidopsis using CRISPR/Cas9 with a workload similar to generating overexpression lines. We obtain Cas9 null-segregants with bi-allelic mutations in the T2 generation. Out of seven new mutant alleles we report here, one allele for GRXS17, the ortholog of human GRX3/PICOT, did not phenocopy previously characterized nulls. Notwithstanding, the mutation caused a frameshift and triggered nonsense-mediated decay. We demonstrate that our workflow is also compatible with a dual sgRNA approach in which a gene is targeted by two sgRNAs simultaneously. This paired nuclease method can result in a more reliable loss-of-function alleles that lack a large essential part of the gene. The ease in the CRISPR/Cas9 workflow should help in the eventual generation of true null alleles of every gene in the Arabidopsis genome, which will advance both basic and applied plant research.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryWe present a dual sgRNA approach to delete Arabidopsis gene 34 fragments in order to obtain reliable functional knock-outs.",

These results are consistent with the weight loss (5 Kg) associated with intermittent fasting and with the known features of probiotics as detoxification tools. Consistent with certain toxicants acting as endocrine disruptors, we observed an increased elimination of toxicants and a 33% decrease of serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), suggesting a trend toward normalization of thyroid function. These results support the hypothesis that a combination of intermittent fasting with the consumption of specific probiotic yogurts may lead to immune modulation, detoxification and other improvements.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Lay SummaryAn outstanding challenge for the study of colour traits is how best to use \\\"colour spaces\\\" to represent their visual perception, particularly when asking questions of colour-difference (e.g. the (dis)similarity of males and females, mimics and models, or sister species, to a given viewer). We use simulations to show that existing methods fail to statistically and biologically estimate the separation of groups in colour space, and we suggest a flexible, robust, alternative that avoids those pitfalls.\\n\\nAbstractColour in nature presents a striking dimension of variation, though understanding its function and evolution largely depends on our ability to capture the perspective of relevant viewers. This goal has been radically advanced by the development and widespread adoption of colour spaces, which allow for the viewer-subjective estimation of colour appearance. Most studies of colour in camouflage, aposematism, sexual selection, and other signalling contexts draw on these models, with the shared analytical objective of estimating how similar (or dissimilar) colour samples are to a given viewer. We summarise popular approaches for estimating the separation of samples in colour space, and use a simulation-based approach to test their efficacy with common data structures. We show that these methods largely fail to estimate the separation of colour samples by neglecting (i) the statistical distribution and within-group variation of the data, and/or (ii) the discriminability of groups relative to the observers visual capabilities. Instead, we formalize the two questions that must be answered to establish both the statistical presence and theoretical magnitude of colour differences, and propose a two-step, permutation-based approach that achieves this goal. Unlike previous methods, our suggested approach accounts for the multidimensional nature of visual model data, and is robust against common colour-data features such as heterogeneity and outliers. We demonstrate the pitfalls of current methods and the flexibility of our suggested framework using an example from the literature, with recommendations for future inquiry.",

    "abstract": "Non-additive genetic effects can be effectively exploited in control-pollinated families with the availability of genome-wide markers. We used 41,304 SNP markers and compared pedigree vs. marker-based genetic models by analysing height, diameter, basic density and pulp yield for 338 Eucalyptus urophylla x E.grandis control-pollinated families represented by 949 informative individuals. We evaluated models accounting for additive, dominance, and first-order epistatic interactions (additive by additive, dominance by dominance, and additive by dominance). We showed that the models can capture a large proportion of the genetic variance from dominance and epistasis for growth traits as those components are typically not independent. We also show that we could partition genetic variances more precisely when using relationship matrices derived from markers compared to using only pedigree information. In addition, phenotypic prediction accuracies were only slightly increased by including dominance effects for growth traits since estimates of non-additive variances yielded rather high standard errors. This novel result improves our current understanding of the architecture of quantitative traits and recommends accounting for dominance variance when developing genomic selection strategies in hybrid Eucalyptus.",

    "abstract": "Several contemporary models of associative learning anticipate that the higher responding to a compound of two cues separately trained with a common outcome than to each of the cues alone -a summation effect-is modulated by the similarity between the cues forming the compound. Here, we explored this hypothesis in a series of causal learning experiments with humans. Participants were presented with two visual cues that separately predicted a common outcome and later asked for the outcome predicted by the compound of the two cues. Importantly, the cues similarity was varied between groups through changes in shape, spatial position, color, configuration and rotation. In variance with the predictions of these models, we observed similar and strong levels of summation in both groups across all manipulations of similarity (Experiments 1-5). The summation effect was significantly reduced by manipulations intended to impact assumptions about the causal independence of the cues forming the compound, but this reduction was independent of stimulus similarity (Experiment 6). These results are problematic for similarity-based models and can be more readily explained by rational approaches to causal learning.",

    "abstract": "For central place foragers, such as bumblebees, it is essential to return reliably to their nest. Instead of just flying away to forage, bumblebees, leaving their inconspicuous nest hole for the first time, need to gather and learn sufficient information about the surroundings to allow them to return to the nest at the end of their trip. Therefore, we assume an intrinsic learning program that manifests itself in the flight structure immediately after leaving the nest for the first time.\\n\\nIn this study, we recorded and analysed the first outbound flight of individually marked naive bumblebees in an indoor environment. We found characteristic loop-like features in the flight pattern that appear to be necessary for the bees to acquire environmental information and might be relevant for finding the nest hole after a foraging trip.\\n\\nDespite common features in their spatio-temporal organisation, the first departure flights from the nest are characterised by a high level of variability in their loop-like flight structure across animals. Changes in turn direction of body orientation, for example, are distributed evenly across the entire area used for the flights without any systematic relation to the nest location. By considering the common flight motifs as well as this variability, we came to the hypothesis, that a kind of dynamic snapshot is taken during the early phase of departure flights in the close vicinity of the nest location. The quality of this snapshot is hypothesised to be   tested during the later phases of the departure flights concerning its usefulness for local homing.",

    "abstract": "Recent massive growth in the production of sequencing data necessitates matching improve-ments in bioinformatics tools to effectively utilize it. Existing tools suffer from limitations in both scalability and applicability which are inherent to their underlying algorithms and data structures. We identify the key requirements for the ideal data structure for sequence analy-ses: it should be informationally lossless, locally updatable, and memory efficient; requirements which are not met by data structures underlying the major assembly strategies Overlap Layout Consensus and De Bruijn Graphs. We therefore propose a new data structure, the LOGAN graph, which is based on a memory efficient Sparse De Bruijn Graph with routing information. Innovations in storing routing information and careful implementation allow sequence datasets for Escherichia coli (4.6Mbp, 117x coverage), Arabidopsis thaliana (135Mbp, 17.5x coverage) and Solanum pennellii (1.2Gbp, 47x coverage) to be loaded into memory on a desktop computer in seconds, minutes, and hours respectively. Memory consumption is competitive with state of the art alternatives, while losslessly representing the reads in an indexed and updatable form. Both Second and Third Generation Sequencing reads are supported. Thus, the LOGAN graph is positioned to be the backbone for major breakthroughs in sequence analysis such as integrated hybrid assembly, assembly of exceptionally large and repetitive genomes, as well as assembly and representation of pan-genomes.",

It recapitulates the biology of stromal influence in prostate cancer progression. Our data indicate that the interactions between the tumor cells and reactive stroma shape the evolutionary dynamics of PCa cells and explain overall tumor aggressiveness. We show that the degree of stromal reactivity, when coupled with the current clinical biomarkers, significantly improves PCa prognostication, both for death and recurrence, that may alter treatment decisions. We also show that stromal reactivity correlates directly with tumor growth but inversely modulates tumor evolution. This suggests that the aggressive stromal independent PCa may be an inevitable evolutionary result of poor stromal reactivity. It also suggests that purely tumor centric metrics of aggressiveness may be misleading in terms on clinical outcome.",

Previously, we reported that Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to lipid disequilibrium by upregulating several protein quality control pathways such as the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and the unfolded protein response (UPR).\\n\\nResultsSurprisingly, we observed certain ER-resident transmembrane proteins (TPs), which form part of the UPR programme, to be destabilised under lipid perturbation (LP).

Here, we present evidence that the linear and the three dimensional architectures of the genome ascribe the appropriate framework that guides the mono-allelic expression of genes. We show that: 1) mono-allelically expressed genes are assorted into genomic domains that are insulated from domains of bi-allelically expressed genes through CTCF mediated chromatin loops; 2) evolutionary and cell-type specific gain and loss of mono-allelic expression coincide respectively with the gain and loss of chromatin insulator sites; 3) dosage of mono- allelically expressed genes is more sensitive to loss of chromatin insulationn associated with CTCF depletion as compared to bi-allelically expressed genes; 4) distinct susceptibility of mono- and bi-allelically expressed genes to CTCF depletion can be attributed to distinct functional roles of CTCF around these genes. Altogether, our observations highlight a general topological framework for the mono-allelic expression of genes, wherein the alleles are insulated from the spatial interference of chromatin and transcriptional states from neighbouring bi-allelic domains via CTCF mediated chromatin loops. The study also suggests that the three-dimensional genome organization might have evolved under the constraint to mitigate the fluctuations in the dosage of mono-allelically expressed genes, which otherwise are dosage sensitive.",

A draft genome sequence of S. fradiae var. k11 was used to identify 14 gene sequences of potential lipid-degrading enzymes. The genes were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells on a pET vector and screened for activity. Four of the 14 enzymes had detectable activity, with two of the enzymes, SFK3309 and SFK3087, active against p-nitrophenyl palmitate, a representative water-insoluble substrate. A modified enzymatic assay was designed to measure activity against three model wax substrates: jojoba oil, beeswax, and cetyl-palmitate. SFK3309 was characterized to hydrolyze all three wax substrates. Kinetic experiments for SFK3309 were performed with cetyl-palmitate at 37{degrees}C, pH 8.0. The Km was determined to be 850 {micro}M and the Kcat was 11.63 s-1. Through the characterization of SFK3309 as a wax-ester hydrolase, biotechnological implications of wax ester hydrolases in the rendering of many industrial wastes can be substantiated for further studies.",

T lymphocytes play an essential role in the pathogenesis of obesity and their expansion and differentiation is a tightly controlled process. Circulating cytokines trough activation of cell death mechanisms controls the number of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and failure to activate apoptosis is considered the main cause for their uncontrolled expansion. Here, the identification an essential anti-apoptotic pathway in T lymphocytes is presented, whereby IL-15 activation of Stat/Jak signaling cascade leads to induction of the IRX3 expression. IRX3, in turn, promotes T cells survival and self-renewal, at least partially, by controlling the expression of T-bet transcription factor eomesodermin (EOMES). The Stat/Jak signaling inhibition by Jak inhibitor 1 suppresses IRX3 transcription in T lymphocytes and tumor cell lines and increases apoptosis after growth factor deprivation. Our results demonstrate that IRX3 is essential in T lymphocytes differentiation and reveal that the IL-15-dependent IRX3 pro-survival pathway provides potential therapeutic target for regulation of T cell proliferation that has implications for immune cell malignancies, obesity and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, also known as tectal horizontal cells, have been implicated in a range of behavioral responses to visual cues, including prey capture and looming-evoked escape. However, there is limited information on their tuning properties, synaptic connectivity and molecular diversity. We have begun to close this gap in our knowledge by performing functional GCaMP6 imaging and electrophysiological recordings of SIN responses to simplified stimuli. We found that a large subset of the SINs strongly responded to luminance changes, with a preference for OFF steps. Although SINs were generally tuned to any dark-light, or light-dark, transition, they were often most sensitive to a narrow range of luminance steps. Tuning properties did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of the cell neurites within the neuropil. Receptive field (RF) mapping revealed that SINs sample over large areas of the visual field (greater than 20 degrees, typically 50 degrees). RFs of individual SINs were sometimes spatially incoherent, indicating that SINs may receive sparse inputs from multiple RGCs scattered widely over the retina. Lastly, we found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, as reported before, a substantial minority express a vesicular glutamate transporter. We propose that the role of the SINs is more complex than previously reported, and provide evidence that at least one SIN subtype could function as a multi-purpose circuit element for signaling changes in ambient luminance for subsequent processing in the tectum.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas technologies have transformed our ability to manipulate genomes for research and gene-based therapy. In particular, homology-directed repair after genomic cleavage allows for precise modification of genes using exogenous donor sequences as templates. While both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) forms of donors have been used as repair templates, a systematic comparison of the performance and specificity of repair using ssDNA versus dsDNA donors is still lacking. Here, we describe an optimized method for the synthesis of long ssDNA templates and demonstrate that ssDNA donors can drive efficient integration of gene-sized reporters in human cell lines. We next define a set of rules to maximize the efficiency of ssDNA-mediated knock-in by optimizing donor design. Finally, by comparing ssDNA donors with equivalent dsDNA sequences (PCR products or plasmids), we demonstrate that ssDNA templates have a unique advantage in terms of repair specificity while dsDNA donors can lead to a high rate of off-target integration. Our results provide a framework for designing high-fidelity CRISPR-based knock-in experiments, in both research and therapeutic settings.\n\nO_TEXTBOXUpdate: November 12th, 2019\n\nDear bioRxiv community,\n\nThe conclusions of this pre-print (originally posted in August 2017) are outdated. While the experiments we present here are accurate, a recent and more systematic analysis revealed that the integration outcomes driven by different forms of HDR donors are more complex than our methods could originally identify. We initially analyzed donor integration only in FACS-selected cells, which under-estimates alleles where the mis-integration of payload leads to non-functional selection markers, and we quantified integration by ddPCR, which is an indirect read-out of sequence properties. These approaches could not capture the full details of donor integration events in our experiments. To address this, we have now developed a new framework based on long-read amplicon sequencing and an integrated computational pipeline to precisely analyze knock-in repair outcomes across a wide range of experimental parameters. Our new data uncover a complex repair landscape in which both single-stranded and double-stranded donors can lead to high rates of imprecise integration in some cell types. Please read our new bioRxiv pre-print entitled \"Deep profiling reveals substantial heterogeneity of integration outcomes in CRISPR knock-in experiments\" for further information.\n\nI hope that this example highlights one of the powers of pre-prints: the ability to update scientific discussions (and set records straight) as new results are obtained, often fueled by the availability of new technologies.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me directly for any questions or comments.\n\n- Manuel Leonetti (manuel.leonetti@czbiohub.org)\n\n\nC_TEXTBOX",

Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases, but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it \\\"crashes\\\" at extreme high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, while serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations.",

We describe here a dedicated and tractable one step, GMP-grade, transgene-free and stroma-free protocol to produce HSPCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). This procedure, applied to several sources of hiPSCs with equal efficiency, is based on a directed differentiation with morphogens and cytokines to generate a cell population close to nascent HSPCs or their immediate forerunners i.e., hemogenic endothelial cells6-9. Following engraftment into immunocompromised recipients, this cell population was proved capable of a robust myeloid, lymphoid and definitive red blood cell production in sequential recipients for at least 40 weeks. Further identification of the repopulating cells show that they express the G protein-coupled receptor APELIN (APLNR) and the homing receptor CXCR4. This demonstrates that the generation of bona fide HSPCs from hiPSCs without transgenes is possible and passes through an early endo-hematopoietic intermediate. This work opens the way to the generation of clinical grade HSPCs for the treatment of hematological diseases and holds promise for the analysis of HSPC development in the human species.",

Consequently, X and Y chromosomes initially have similar gene content, but ongoing Y degeneration leads to reduced Y gene expression and eventual Y gene loss. The resulting imbalance in gene expression between Y genes and the rest of the genome is expected to reduce male fitness, especially when protein networks have components from both autosomes and sex chromosomes. A diverse set of dosage compensating mechanisms that alleviates these negative effects has been described in animals2-4. However, the early steps in the evolution of dosage compensation remain unknown and dosage compensation is poorly understood in plants5. Here we show a novel dosage compensation mechanism in the evolutionarily young XY sex determination system of the plant Silene latifolia. Genomic imprinting results in higher expression from the maternal X chromosome in both males and females. This compensates for reduced Y expression in males but results in X overexpression in females and may be detrimental. It could represent a transient early stage in the evolution of dosage compensation. Our finding has striking resemblance to the first stage proposed by Ohno for the evolution of X inactivation in mammals.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionQuality assurance (QA) is vital for ensuring the integrity of processed neuroimaging data for use in clinical neurosciences research. Manual QA (visual inspection) of processed brains for cortical surface reconstruction errors is resource-intensive, particularly with large datasets. Several semi-automated QA tools use quantitative detection of subjects for editing based on outlier brain regions. There were two project goals: (1) evaluate the adequacy of a statistical QA method relative to visual inspection, and (2) examine whether error identification and correction significantly impacts estimation of cortical parameters and established brain-behavior relationships.\\n\\nMethodsT1 MPRAGE images (N = 530) of healthy adults were obtained from the NKI-Rockland Sample and reconstructed using Freesurfer 5.3. Visual inspection of T1 images was conducted for: (1) participants (n = 110) with outlier values (z scores {+/-} 3 SD) for subcortical and cortical segmentation volumes (outlier group), and (2) a random sample of remaining participants (n = 110) with segmentation values that did not meet the outlier criterion (non-outlier group).\\n\\nResultsThe outlier group had 21% more participants with visual inspection-identified errors than participants in the non-outlier group, with a medium effect size ({Phi} = 0.22). Nevertheless, a considerable portion of images with errors of cortical extension were found in the non-outlier group (41%). Sex significantly predicted error rate; men were 2.8 times more likely to have errors than women. Although nine brain regions significantly changed size from pre- to post-editing (with effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.59), editing did not substantially change the correlations of neurocognitive tasks and brain volumes (ps > 0.05).\\n\\nConclusionsStatistically-based QA, although less resource intensive, is not accurate enough to supplant visual inspection. We discuss practical implications of our findings to guide resource allocation decisions for image processing.",

Here, we employed deletions of kinesin-like proteins to perturb microtubule dynamics, and determined that cells with long microtubules exhibited long, but fewer mitochondria, whereas cells with short microtubules exhibited short, but several mitochondria due to reduced mitochondrial fission in the former and elevated fission in the latter. Correspondingly, upon onset of closed mitosis in fission yeast, wherein interphase microtubules assemble to form the spindle within the nucleus, we measured increased mitochondrial fission. We determined that the consequent rise in the mitochondrial copy number was necessary to reduce partitioning errors while stochastically partitioning mitochondria between daughter cells. We discovered that the association of mitochondria with microtubules physically impeded the assembly of the fission protein Dnm1 around mitochondria, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial fission. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for regulation of mitochondrial fission that is dictated by the interaction between mitochondria and the microtubule cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "For decades, the mechanism of skeletal patterning along a proximal-distal axis has been an area of intense inquiry. Here we examine the development of the ribs, simple structures that in most terrestrial vertebrates consist of two skeletal elements-- a proximal bone and a distal cartilage portion. While the ribs have been shown to arise from the somites, little is known about how the two segments are specified. During our examination of genetically modified mice, we discovered a series of progressively worsening phenotypes that could not be easily explained. Here, we combine genetic analysis of rib development with agent-based simulations to conclude that proximal-distal patterning and outgrowth could occur based on simple rules. In our model, specification occurs during somite stages due to varying Hedgehog protein levels, while later expansion refines the pattern. This framework is broadly applicable for understanding the mechanisms of skeletal patterning along a proximal-distal axis.",

    "abstract": "Caligid sea lice represent a significant threat to salmonid aquaculture worldwide. Lepeophtheirus salmonis is the predominant species that occurs in the Northern Hemisphere. Dispersal of sea lice between marine aquaculture sites and geographic regions is thought to occur rapidly via planktonic transport of larvae. Population genetic analyses have consistently shown minimal population genetic structure in North Atlantic L. salmonis, frustrating efforts to track louse populations, improve targeted control measures and understand local adaption to environmental conditions. The aim of this study was to test the power of reduced representation library sequencing (IIb-RAD sequencing) coupled with random forest machine learning algorithms to define markers for fine-scale discrimination of louse populations. We identified 1286 robustly supported SNPs among four L. salmonis populations from Ireland (N=2, 27 individuals), Scotland (N=1, 11 individuals) and North Norway (N=1, 12 individuals). Weak global structure (FSC = 0.018, p<0.0001) and only one significant pairwise FST comparison was observed (Scotland vs Kenmare Bay, (FST = 0.018, p<0.0001)) using all 1286 SNPs. The application of a random forest machine-learning algorithm identified 98 discriminatory SNPs that dramatically improved population assignment (DAPC assignment probability = 1), increased global Fsc = 0.098, (p<0.0001) and resulted in pairwise comparisons that all showed highly significant Fst-values (range = 0.081 - 0.096, p<0.0001). Out of 19 SNPs found to be under directional selection between populations, 12 corresponded to the discriminatory SNPs identified using random forest. Taken together our data suggest that L. salmonis SNP diversity exists with which it is possible to discriminate differences between nearby populations given suitable marker selection approaches, and that such differences might have an adaptive basis. We discuss these data in light of sea lice adaption to anthropogenic and environmental pressures as well as novel approaches to track and predict sea louse dispersal.",

This spatial forcing as determined by the metapopulation typology then imposes strong selection pressures on life history traits, which will in turn feedback on the ecological metapopulation dynamics. Given the relevance of metapopulation persistence for biological conservation, and the potential rescuing role of evolution, a firm understanding of the relevance of these eco-evolutionary processes is essential.\\nC_LIO_LIWe here follow a systems modelling approach to quantify the importance of spatial forcing and experimentally observed life history evolution for metapopulation demography as quantified by (meta)population size and variability. We therefore developed an individual based model matching an earlier experimental evolution with spider mites to perform virtual translocation and invasion experiments that would have been otherwise impossible to conduct.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that (1) metapopulation demography is more affected by spatial forcing than by life history evolution, but that life history evolution contributes substantially to changes in local and especially metapopulation-level population sizes, (2) extinction rates are minimised by evolution in classical metapopulations, and (3) evolution is optimising individual performance in metapopulations when considering the importance of more cryptic stress resistance evolution.\\nC_LIO_LIEcological systems modelling opens up a promising avenue to quantify the importance of eco-evolutionary feedbacks for larger-scale population dynamics.

Such adaptive life history traits often show strong local adaptation along environmental gradients but despite their importance, the genetic architecture of these traits remains poorly understood.\\n\\nResultsWe integrate whole genome re-sequencing with environmental and phenotypic data from common garden experiments to investigate the genomic basis of local adaptation across a latitudinal gradient in European aspen (Populus tremula). We discover a single genomic region containing the PtFT2 gene that mediates local adaptation in the timing of bud set and that explains 65% of the observed genetic variation in bud set. This locus is the likely target of a recent selective sweep that originated right before or during colonization of northern Scandinavia following the last glaciation. Field and greenhouse experiments confirm that variation in PtFT2 gene expression affect the phenotypic variation in bud set that we observe in wild natural populations.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results reveal a major effect locus that determine the timing of bud set and that have facilitated rapid adaptation to shorter growing seasons and colder climates in European aspen. The discovery of a single locus explaining a substantial fraction of the variation in a key life history trait is remarkable given that such traits are generally considered to be highly polygenic. These findings provide a dramatic illustration of how loci of large-effect for adaptive traits can arise and be maintained over large geographical scales in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "The accurate alignment of brains is fundamental to the statistical sensitivity and spatial localisation of group studies in brain imaging, and cortical surface-based alignment is generally accepted to be superior to volume-based approaches at aligning cortical areas. However, human subjects have considerable variation in cortical folding, and in the location of cortical areas relative to these folds, which makes aligning cortical areas based on folding alone a challenging problem. The Multimodal Surface Matching (MSM) tool is a flexible spherical registration approach that enables accurate registration of surfaces based on a variety of different features. Using MSM, we have previously shown that using areal features such as resting state-networks and myelin maps to drive cross-subject surface alignment improves group task fMRI statistics and map sharpness. However, the initial implementation of MSMs regularisation function did not penalize all forms of surface distortion evenly. In some cases, this allowed peak distortions to exceed neurobiologically plausible limits unless the regularisation strength was increased, in which case this prevented the algorithm from fully maximizing surface alignment. Here, we propose a new regularisation penalty, derived from physically relevant equations of strain (deformation) energy, and demonstrate that its use leads to improved and more robust alignment of multi-modal imaging data. In addition, since spherical warps incorporate projection distortions that are unavoidable when mapping from a convoluted cortical surface to the sphere, we also propose constraints to enforce smooth deformation of cortical anatomies. We test the impact of this approach for longitudinal modeling of cortical development for neonates (born between 32 and 45 weeks) and demonstrate that the proposed method increases the biological interpretability of the distortion fields and improves the statistical significance of population-based analysis relative to other spherical methods.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence has shown disrupted brain network architecture across the psychosis spectrum. However, whether these changes relate to the development of psychosis is unclear. Here, we used graph theoretical analysis to investigate longitudinal changes in resting-state brain networks in samples of 72 subjects at clinical high risk (including 8 cases who converted to full psychosis) and 48 healthy controls drawn from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) consortium. We observed progressive reduction in global efficiency (P = 0.006) and increase in network diversity (P = 0.001) in converters compared with non-converters and controls. More refined analysis separating nodes into nine key brain networks demonstrated that these alterations were primarily driven by progressively diminished local efficiency in the default-mode network (P = 0.004) and progressively enhanced node diversity across all networks (P < 0.05). The change rates of network efficiency and network diversity were significantly correlated (P = 0.003), suggesting these changes may reflect shared underlying neural mechanisms. In addition, change rates of global efficiency and node diversity were significantly correlated with change rate of cortical thinning in the prefrontal cortex in converters (P < 0.03) and could be predicted by visuospatial memory scores at baseline (P < 0.04). These results provide preliminary evidence for longitudinal reconfiguration of resting-state brain networks during psychosis development and suggest that decreased network efficiency, reflecting an increase in path length between nodes, and increased network diversity, reflecting a decrease in the consistency of functional network organization, are implicated in the progression to full psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Long-distance olfactory search behaviors depend on odor detection dynamics. Due to turbulence, olfactory signals travel as bursts of variable concentration and spacing and are characterized by long-tail distributions of odor/no-odor events, challenging the computing capacities of olfactory systems. How animals encode complex olfactory scenes to track the plume far from the source remains unclear. Here we focus on the coding of the plume temporal dynamics in moths. We compare responses of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) to sequences of pheromone stimuli either with white-noise patterns or with realistic turbulent temporal structures simulating a large range of distances (8 to 64 m) from the odor source. For the first time, we analyze what information is extracted by the olfactory system at large distances from the source. Neuronal responses are analyzed using linear-nonlinear models fitted with white-noise stimuli and used for predicting responses to turbulent stimuli. We found that neuronal firing rate is less correlated with the dynamic odor time course when distance to the source increases because of improper coding during long odor and no-odor events that characterize large distances. Rapid adaptation during long puffs does not preclude however the detection of puff transitions in PNs. Individual PNs but not individual ORNs encode the onset and offset of odor puffs for any temporal structure of stimuli. A higher spontaneous firing rate coupled to an inhibition phase at the end of PN responses contributes to this coding property. This allows PNs to decode the temporal structure of the odor plume at any distance to the source, an essential piece of information moths can use in their tracking behavior.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLong-distance olfactory search is a difficult task because atmospheric turbulence erases global gradients and makes the plume discontinuous. The dynamics of odor detections is the sole information about the position of the source. Male moths successfully track female pheromone plumes at large distances. Here we show that the moth olfactory system encodes olfactory scenes simulating variable distances from the odor source by characterizing puff onsets and offsets. A single projection neuron is sufficient to provide an accurate representation of the dynamic pheromone time course at any distance to the source while this information seems to be encoded at the population level in olfactory receptor neurons.",

    "abstract": "Maize is a diverse paleotetraploid species with widespread presence/absence variation and copy number variation. One mechanism through which presence/absence variation can arise is differential fractionation. Fractionation refers to the loss of duplicate gene pairs from one of the maize subgenomes during diploidization and differential fractionation refers to non-shared gene loss events between individuals. We investigated the prevalence of presence/absence variation resulting from differential fractionation in the syntenic portion of the genome using two whole genome de novo assemblies of the inbred lines B73 and PH207. Between these two genomes, syntenic genes were highly conserved with less than 1% of syntenic genes being subject to differential fractionation. The few variable syntenic genes that were identified are unlikely to contribute to functional phenotypic variation, as there is a significant depletion of these genes in annotated gene sets. In further comparisons of 60 diverse inbred lines, non-syntenic genes were six times more likely to be variable compared to syntenic genes, suggesting that comparisons among additional genome assemblies are not likely to result in the discovery of large-scale presence/absence variation among syntenic genes.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThere is a large amount of presence/absence variation for gene content in maize. One mechanism that has been hypothesized to contribute to this variation is differential fractionation between individuals following the maize whole genome duplication event. Using comparative genomics, with sorghum and rice representing the ancestral state, we observed little evidence of differential fractionation among elite inbred lines and the few differentially fractionated genes identified did not appear to confer functional significance.",

Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response, in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results reveal that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription-factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial endosymbionts and their insect hosts establish an intimate metabolic relationship. Bacteria offer a variety of essential nutrients to their hosts, whereas insect cells provide the necessary sources of matter and energy to their tiny metabolic allies. These nutritional complementations sustain themselves on a diversity of metabolite exchanges between the cell host and the reduced yet highly specialized bacterial metabolism -which, for instance, overproduces a small set of essential amino acids and vitamins. A well-known case of metabolic complementation is provided by the cedar aphid Cinara cedri that harbors two co-primary endosymbionts, Buchnera aphidicola BCc and Ca. Serratia symbiotica SCc, and in which some metabolic pathways are partitioned between different partners. Here we present a genome scale metabolic network (GEM) for the bacterial consortium from the cedar aphid iBSCc. The analysis of this GEM allows us the confirmation of cases of metabolic complementation previously described by genome analysis (i.e. tryptophan and biotin biosynthesis) and the proposal of a hitherto unnoticed event of metabolic pathway sharing between the two endosymbionts, namely the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate. In silico knock-out experiments with iBSCc showed that the consortium metabolism is a highly integrated yet fragile network. We also have explored the evolutionary pathways leading to the emergence of metabolic complementation between reduced metabolisms starting from individual, complete networks. Our results suggest that, during the establishment of metabolic complementation in endosymbionts, adaptive evolution is more significant than previously thought.",

Initial analyses relied on the identification of truncated reverse transcription reads to identify the chemically modified nucleotides, but recent studies have shown that mutational signatures can also be used. While these two methods have been employed interchangeably, here we show that they actually provide complementary information. Consequently, analyses using exclusively one of the two methodologies may disregard a significant portion of the structural information. We also show that the identity and sequence environment of the modified nucleotide greatly affect the odds of introducing a mismatch or causing reverse transcriptase drop-off. Finally, we identify specific mismatch signatures generated by dimethyl sulfate probing that can be exploited to remove false positives typically produced in RNA structurome analyses, and how these signatures vary depending on the reverse transcription enzyme used.",

Despite this increase in the number of associated SNPs per disease, their biological interpretation has in many cases remained elusive. To address this, we have combined GWAS results with an orthogonal source of evidence, namely real-world, routinely collected clinical data from more than 6 million patients in order to drive target nomination. First we show that when examined at a pathway level, analysis of all GWAS studies groups Alzheimers disease (AD) in a cluster with disorders of immunity and inflammation. Using clinical data we show that the degree of comorbidity of these diseases with AD correlates with the strength of their genetic association with molecular participants in the JAK-STAT pathway. Using four independent open-science datasets we then find evidence for altered regulation of JAK-STAT pathway genes in AD. Finally, we use both in vitro and in vivo rodent models to demonstrate that A{beta} induces gene expression of key drivers of this pathway, providing experimental evidence validating these data-driven observations.

    "abstract": "MotivationEukaryotic chromosomes adapt a complex and highly dynamic three-dimensional (3D) structure, which profoundly affects different cellular functions and outcomes including changes in epigenetic landscape and in gene expression. Making the scenario even more complex, cancer cells harbor chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., copy number variations (CNVs) and translocations) altering their genomes both at the sequence level and at the level of 3D organization. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture techniques (e.g., Hi-C), which are originally developed for decoding the 3D structure of the chromatin, provide a great opportunity to simultaneously identify the locations of genomic rearrangements and to investigate the 3D genome organization in cancer cells. Even though Hi-C data has been used for validating known rearrangements, computational methods that can distinguish rearrangement signals from the inherent biases of Hi-C data and from the actual 3D conformation of chromatin, and can precisely detect rearrangement locations de novo have been missing.\\n\\nResultsIn this work, we characterize how intra and inter-chromosomal Hi-C contacts are distributed for normal and rearranged chromosomes to devise a new set of algorithms (i) to identify genomic segments that correspond to CNV regions such as amplifications and deletions (HiCnv), (ii) to call inter-chromosomal translocations and their boundaries (HiCtrans) from Hi-C experiments, and (iii) to simulate Hi-C data from genomes with desired rearrangements and abnormalities (AveSim) in order to select optimal parameters for and to benchmark the accuracy of our methods. Our results on 10 different cancer cell lines with Hi-C data show that we identify a total number of 105 amplifications and 45 deletions together with 90 translocations, whereas we identify virtually no such events for two karyotypically normal cell lines. Our CNV predictions correlate very well with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data among chromosomes with CNV events for a breast cancer cell line (r=0.89) and capture most of the CNVs we simulate using Avesim. For HiCtrans predictions, we report evidence from the literature for 30 out of 90 translocations for eight of our cancer cell lines. Further-more, we show that our tools identify and correctly classify relatively understudied rearrangements such as double minutes (DMs) and homogeneously staining regions (HSRs).\\n\\nConclusionsConsidering the inherent limitations of existing techniques for karyotyping (i.e., missing balanced rearrangements and those near repetitive regions), the accurate identification of CNVs and translocations in a cost-effective and high-throughput setting is still a challenge. Our results show that the set of tools we develop effectively utilize moderately sequenced Hi-C libraries (100-300 million reads) to identify known and de novo chromosomal rearrangements/abnormalities in well-established cancer cell lines. With the decrease in required number of cells and the increase in attainable resolution, we believe that our framework will pave the way towards comprehensive mapping of genomic rearrangements in primary cells from cancer patients using Hi-C.\\n\\nAvailabilityO_LICNV calling: https://github.com/ay-lab/HiCnv\\nC_LIO_LITranslocation calling: https://github.com/ay-lab/HiCtrans\\nC_LIO_LIHi-C simulation: https://github.com/ay-lab/AveSim\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY STATEMENTDuring neural tube development, PI3K pathway promotes cell survival and provides the apical-basal navigation clues that define the final location of neurons in the epithelium.\\n\\nSUMMARYPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are signal transducers of many biological processes. Class 1A PI3Ks are hetero dimers formed by a regulatory and a catalytic subunit. We have used the developing chicken neural tube (NT) to study the roles played by PI3K during the process of cell proliferation and differentiation. Notably, we have observed that in addition to its well characterized anti apoptotic activity, PI3K also plays a crucial role in intra epithelial cell positioning, and unlike its role in survival that mainly depends on AKT, the activity in cell positioning is mediated by Rho GTPase family members. Additionally, we have observed that activating mutations of PI3K that are remarkably frequent in many human cancers, cause an unrestrained basal migration of the neuroepithelial cells that end up breaking through the basal membrane invading the surrounding mesenchymal tissue. The mechanism described in this work contribute not only to acquire a greater knowledge of the intraepithelial cell positioning process, but also give new clues on how activating mutations of PI3K contribute to cell invasion during the first stages of tumour dissemination.",

    "abstract": "No-till is an agricultural practice widely promoted by governments, development agencies, and agricultural organisations worldwide. However, the costs and benefits to farmers adopting no-till are hotly debated 1-4. Using a meta-analysis of unprecedented study size, Pittelkow et al.5 reported that adopting no-till results in average yield losses of -5.7%, but that these losses can be limited with the added implementation of two additional conservation agriculture practices - crop rotation and crop residue retention, and in dry environments. They claimed that, as a result, resource limited smallholder farmers, that are unable to implement the whole suite of conservation agriculture practices are likely to experience yield losses under no-till. In a re-evaluation of their analysis, we found that they overly biased their results toward showing that no-till negatively impacts yields, and overlooked the practical significance of their findings. Strikingly, we find that all of the variables they used in their analysis (e.g. crop residue management, rotation, site aridity and study duration) are not much better than random for explaining the effect of no-till on crop yields. Our results suggest that their meta-analysis cannot be used as the basis for evidence-based decision-making in the agricultural community.",

    "abstract": "Periodic food shortage is one of the biggest challenges organisms face in natural habitats. How animals cope with nutrient limited conditions is an active area of study, of particular relevance in the context of the current increasing destabilization of global climate. Caves represent an extreme setting where animals have adapted to nutrient-limited conditions, as most cave environments lack a primary energy source. Here we show that cave-adapted populations of the Mexican Tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have dysregulated blood glucose homeostasis and are insulin resistant compared to the river-adapted population. We found that multiple cave populations carry a mutation in the insulin receptor that leads to decreased insulin binding in vitro. Surface/cave hybrid fish carrying the allele weigh more than non-carriers, and zebrafish genetically engineered to carry the mutation similarly have increased body weight and insulin resistance. Higher bodyweight may be advantageous in the cave as a strategy to cope with infrequent food. In humans, the identical mutation in the insulin receptor leads to a severe form of insulin resistance and dramatically reduced life-span. However, cavefish have a similar lifespan to surface fish (of greater than fourteen years) and do not accumulate advanced glycated end products (AGEs) in the blood that are typically associated with progression of diabetes-associated pathologies. Our findings raise the intriguing hypothesis that cavefish have acquired compensatory mechanisms that allow them to circumvent the typical negative effects associated with failure to regulate blood glucose.",

    "abstract": "The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were more tolerated in open chromatin regions. GO term enrichment in human gain hotspots showed terms related to cell cycle/metabolism, human loss hotspots were enriched for terms related to gene silencing, and mouse gain hotspots were enriched for terms related to transcription regulation. Interestingly, mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes, suggesting that DNA loss in mouse is associated with phenotypic changes in mouse morphology. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or \\\"churning\\\" of regulatory regions that are then subjected to selection, resulting in the differences we now observe, both genomic and phenotypic/morphological.",

    "abstract": "An indiscriminate use of antibiotics in humans and animals has led to a widespread selection of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. A possible solution to counter this problem could be to develop alternatives that may boost the host immunity, thus reducing in the quantity and frequency of antibiotic use. In this work, for the first time, citric acid and laccase were used as extracellular inducers of melanin production in yeast cells and human cell lines. It is proposed that the formulation of laccase and citric acid together could further promote melatonin stimulated melanocyte derived melanin production. Melanization test as a probe of immunity, described in this study, is an easy and a quicker test than the other immunity tests and is statistically significant. The results showed the synergistic effect of citric acid and laccase on melanin production by the yeast cells, with significant statistical differences compared to all other tested conditions (P: 0.0005- 0.005). Laccase and citric acid together boosted melanin production after 8 days of incubation. An increase in melanin production by two colon human cells lines (Cacao-2/15 and HT-29) was observed when both laccase and citric acid were present in cell growth medium. A formulation with citric acid and laccase may prove to be an excellent alternative to reduce the antibiotic load in human and animal subjects.\\n\\nSummary statementThis study shows, for the first time, that production of melanin in yeast and human intestinal cells is induced by extracellular addition of laccase and citric acid.",

    "abstract": "During face perception, we integrate facial expression and eye gaze to take advantage of their shared signals. For example, fear with averted gaze provides a congruent avoidance cue, signaling both threat presence and its location, whereas fear with direct gaze sends an incongruent cue, leaving threat location ambiguous. It has been proposed that the processing of different combinations of threat cues is mediated by dual processing routes: reflexive processing via magnocellular (M) pathway and reflective processing via parvocellular (P) pathway. Because growing evidence has identified a variety of sex differences in emotional perception, here we also investigated how M and P processing of fear and eye gaze might be modulated by observers sex, focusing on the amygdala, a structure important to threat perception and affective appraisal. We adjusted luminance and color of face stimuli to selectively engage M or P processing and asked observers to identify emotion of the face. Female observers showed more accurate behavioral responses to faces with averted gaze and greater left amygdala reactivity both to fearful and neutral faces. Conversely, males showed greater right amygdala activation only for M-biased averted-gaze fear faces. In addition to functional reactivity differences, females had greater bilateral amygdala volumes, which positively correlated with behavioral accuracy for M-biased fear. Conversely, in males only the right amygdala volume was positively correlated with accuracy for M-biased fear faces. Our findings suggest that M and P processing of facial threat cues is modulated by functional and structural differences in the amygdalae associated with observers sex.",

We investigated this question in primary motor cortex (M1), where populations of neurons are able to generate a rich repertoire of motor behaviors. We recorded neural activity while monkeys performed a variety of wrist and reach-to-grasp motor tasks, each requiring a different pattern of neural activity. We characterized the flexibility of M1 movement control by comparing the \\\"neural modes\\\" that capture covariation across neurons, believed to arise from network connectivity. We found large similarities in the structure of the neural modes across tasks, as well as striking similarities in their temporal activation dynamics. These similarities were only apparent at the population level. Moreover, a subset of these well-preserved modes captured a task-independent mapping onto muscle commands. We hypothesize that this system of flexibly combined, stable neural modes gives M1 the flexibility to generate our wide-ranging behavioral repertoire.",
