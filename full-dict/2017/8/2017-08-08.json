    "abstract": "It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, in a range of fourth order combinations among the various factors of the Wnt pathway, it would be easy to assess the influence of the destruction complex formed by APC, AXIN, CSKI and GSK3 interaction. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. The computational ranking sheds light on unexplored combinations that can further be investigated using hypothesis testing based on wet lab experiments. Here, the basic framework and results obtained on 2nd and 3rd order interactions on a toy example data set is presented. Subsequent manuscripts will examine higher order interactions in detail. Part B of this work deals with the time series data.",

    "abstract": "Many scientific disciplines currently are experiencing a \\\"reproducibility crisis\\\" because numerous scientific findings cannot be repeated consistently. A novel but controversial hypothesis postulates that stringent levels of environmental and biotic standardization in experimental studies reduces reproducibility by amplifying impacts of lab-specific environmental factors not accounted for in study designs. A corollary to this hypothesis is that the deliberate introduction of controlled systematic variability (CSV) in experimental designs can increase reproducibility. We tested this hypothesis using a multi-laboratory microcosm study in which the same ecological experiment was repeated in 14 laboratories across Europe. Each laboratory introduced environmental and genotypic CSV within and among replicated microcosms established in either growth chambers (with stringent control of environmental conditions) or glasshouses (with more variable environmental conditions). The introduction of genotypic CSV led to lower among-laboratory variability in growth chambers, indicating increased reproducibility, but had no significant effect in glasshouses where reproducibility also was lower. Environmental CSV had little effect on reproducibility. Although there are multiple causes for the \\\"reproducibility crisis\\\", deliberately including genetic variation may be a simple solution for increasing the reproducibility of ecological studies performed in controlled environments.",

Here we show that quantitative image features, automatically extracted from histopathological imaging data, can be used for image Quantitative Trait Loci (iQTL) mapping and variant discovery. Using thyroid pathology images, clinical metadata, and genomics data from the Genotype and Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we establish and validate a quantitative imaging biomarker for immune cell infiltration. A total of 100,215 variants were selected for iQTL profiling, and tested for genotype-phenotype associations with our quantitative imaging biomarker. Significant associations were found in HDAC9 and TXNDC5.

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity is a powerful tool for studying human functional brain networks. Temporal fluctuations in functional connectivity, i.e., dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), are thought to reflect dynamic changes in brain organization and non-stationary switching of discrete brain states. However, recent studies have suggested that dFC might be attributed to sampling variability of static FC. Despite this controversy, a detailed exposition of stationarity and statistical testing of dFC is lacking in the literature. This article seeks an in-depth exploration of these statistical issues at a level appealing to both neuroscientists and statisticians.\\n\\nWe first review the statistical notion of stationarity, emphasizing its reliance on ensemble statistics. In contrast, all FC measures depend on sample statistics. An important consequence is that the space of stationary signals is much broader than expected, e.g., encompassing hidden markov models (HMM) widely used to extract discrete brain states. In other words, stationarity does not imply the absence of brain states. We then expound the assumptions underlying the statistical testing of dFC. It turns out that the two popular frameworks - phase randomization (PR) and autoregressive randomization (ARR) - generate stationary, linear, Gaussian null data. Therefore, statistical rejection can be due to non-stationarity, nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity. For example, the null hypothesis can be rejected for the stationary HMM due to nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity. Finally, we show that a common form of ARR (bivariate ARR) is susceptible to false positives compared with PR and an adapted version of ARR (multivariate ARR).\\n\\nApplication of PR and multivariate ARR to Human Connectome Project data suggests that the stationary, linear, Gaussian null hypothesis cannot be rejected for most participants. However, failure to reject the null hypothesis does not imply that static FC can fully explain dFC. We find that first order AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than static FC models. Since first order AR models encode both static FC and one-lag FC, this suggests the presence of dynamical information beyond static FC. Furthermore, even in subjects where the null hypothesis was rejected, AR models explain temporal FC fluctuations significantly better than a popular HMM, suggesting the lack of discrete states (as measured by resting-state fMRI). Overall, our results suggest that AR models are not only useful as a means for generating null data, but may be a powerful tool for exploring the dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI. Finally, we discuss how apparent contradictions in the growing dFC literature might be reconciled.",

    "abstract": "Learning, a process by which animals modify their behavior as a result of experience, allows organisms to synthesize information from their surroundings to acquire resources and predict danger. Here we show that prior encounter with the odor of pathogenic bacteria prepares Caenorhabditis elegans to survive actual exposure to the pathogen by increasing HSF-1-dependent expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones. Learning-mediated enhancement of chaperone gene expression requires serotonin. Serotonin primes HSF-1 to enhance the expression of molecular chaperone genes by promoting its localization to RNA polymerase II-enriched nuclear loci, even prior to transcription. HSF-1-dependent chaperone gene expression ensues, however, only if and when animals encounter the pathogen. Thus, learning equips C. elegans to better survive environmental dangers by pre-emptively and specifically initiating transcriptional mechanisms throughout the whole organism. These studies provide one plausible basis for the protective role of environmental enrichment in disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibiotic resistance poses a threat to public health and a burden to healthcare systems. Escherichia coli causes more bacteraemia cases in England than any other bacterial species, these infections, in part due to their high incidence, also pose a significant antibiotic resistance burden. The main aim of this study was to estimate the impact of E. coli bacteraemia on patient in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Secondarily, this study also aimed to estimate the effect of antibiotic resistance on these outcomes.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsCase patients were adult E. coli bacteraemia patients infected between July 2011 and June 2012, as reported in an English national mandatory surveillance database, with susceptibility data taken from a national laboratory surveillance database. Control patients were all non-case, adult patients with an English hospital admission record. Case and control patient characteristics and admission information were taken from NHS Digital Datasets.  Resistance was defined as non-susceptible and intermediate isolates, whilst  susceptible was defined as susceptible and non-tested isolates. Time to in-hospital mortality and discharge was investigated through Cox proportional hazards models. To acquire estimates of excess length of stay, multistate models were constructed, with a unit bed day cost applied to estimate cost burden. The total number of case and control hospital spells was 14,051 and 8,919,275 respectively. Acquisition of E. coli bacteraemia was associated with a statistically significant increased daily risk of in-hospital mortality, especially for the first eight days of someones hospital admission [Hazard Ratio = 2.77 (95% confidence interval; 2.61-2.94)]. Antibiotic resistance did not seem to significantly increase this risk further, though did significantly reduce risk of experiencing a discharge event (dead or alive). E.coli bacteraemia was estimated to cost {pound}14,340,900 over the study period (rounded to the nearest {pound}100), with resistance associated with excess costs per infection of {pound}220 - {pound}420 dependent on resistance type, for those where a significant impact was found (rounded to the nearest {pound}10).\\n\\nConclusionsE. coli bacteraemia places a significant burden on patient health and on the hospital sector in England. Resistance is an important factor on length of stay with regards to such infections.",

In addition to innervating muscles, motoneurones project excitatory collateral connections to Renshaw cells and other motoneurones, but the latter have received little attention. We show that motoneurones receive strong synaptic input from other motoneurones throughout development and into maturity with fast type motoneurones systematically receiving greater recurrent excitation than slow type motoneurones. Optical recordings show that activation of motoneurones in one spinal segment can propagate to adjacent segments even in the presence of intact recurrent inhibition. Quite remarkably, while it is known that transmission at the neuromuscular junction is purely cholinergic and Renshaw cells are excited through both acetylcholine and glutamate receptors, here we show that neurotransmission between motoneurones is purely glutamatergic indicating that synaptic transmission systems are differentiated at different post-synaptic targets of motoneurones.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMinimising prescription costs while maintaining quality is a core element of delivering high value healthcare. There are various strategies to achieve savings, but almost no research to date on determining the most effective approach. We describe a new method of identifying potential savings due to large national variations in drug cost, including variation in generic drug cost; and compare these with potential savings from an established method (generic prescribing).\\n\\nMethodsWe used English NHS Digital prescribing data, from October 2015 to September 2016. Potential cost savings were calculated by determining the price-per-unit (e.g. pill, ml) for each drug and dose within each general practice. This was compared against the same cost for the practice at the lowest cost decile, to determine achievable savings. We compared these price-per-unit savings to the savings possible from generic switching; and determined the chemicals with the highest savings nationally. A senior pharmacist manually assessed whether a random sample of savings were practically achievable.\\n\\nResultsWe identified a theoretical maximum of {pound}410M of savings over 12 months. {pound}273M of these savings were for individual prescribing changes worth over {pound}50 per practice per month; this compares favorably with generic switching, where only {pound}35M of achievable savings were identified. The biggest savings nationally were on glucose blood testing reagents ({pound}12M), fluticasone propionate ({pound}9M) and venlafaxine ({pound}8M). Approximately half of all savings were deemed practically achievable.\\n\\nDiscussionWe have developed a new method to identify and enable large potential cost savings within NHS community prescribing. Given the current pressures on the NHS, it is vital that these potential savings are realised. Our tool enabling doctors to achieve these savings is now launched in pilot form. However savings could potentially be achieved more simply through national policy change.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

The software performs allele calling in a matter of seconds to minutes per strain in a laptop but is easily scalable for the analysis of large datasets of hundreds of thousands of strains using multiprocessing options. The chewBBACA software thus provides an efficient and freely available open source solution for gene-by-gene methods. Moreover, the ability to perform these tasks locally is desirable when the submission of raw data to a central repository or web services is hindered by data protection policies or ethical or legal concerns.",

Within echinoderms, opsins have been studied in Echinoidea and Ophiuroidea, which do not possess proper image forming eyes, but rather widely dispersed dermal photoreceptors. However, most species of Asteroidea, the starfish, possess true eyes and studying them will shed light on the diversity of opsin usage within echinoderms and help resolve the evolutionary history of opsins. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we have sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of different Acanthaster planci tissue samples: eyes, radial nerve, tube feet and a mixture of tissues from other organs. At least ten opsins were identified, and eight of them were found significantly differentially expressed in both eyes and radial nerve, providing new important insight into the involvement of opsins in visual and nonvisual photoreception. Of relevance, we found the first evidence of an r-opsin photopigment expressed in a well developed visual eye in a deuterostome animal.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease, with unknown etiopathogenesis and suboptimal therapeutic options. Due to the lack of clinical efficacy of standard immuno-suppressants in IPF, the role of the immune response in this disease remains elusive. Nevertheless, previous reports have shown that increased T cell numbers and phenotype is predictive of prognosis in IPF, suggesting that these cells might have a role in this disease. Transcriptomic analysis of CD3+ T cells isolated from IPF lungs removed prior to lung transplant (i.e. explant lung) revealed a loss of CD28 expression and both elevated checkpoint and lymphocyte activation pathways. Flow cytometric analysis of a mixture of immune and non-immune cells isolated from explanted IPF lungs showed elevated PD-1 and CTLA4 protein expression on CD4- lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression on EpCAM+ and CD45- EpCAM- cells. Lung remodeling and loss of BAL surfactant protein C were observed in NOD SCID IL-2R{gamma}-/- (NSG) mice that received an intravenous injection of a mixture of IPF cells, including purified IPF T cells. Finally, in humanized NSG mice, anti-CTLA4, but not anti-PD1, mAb treatment induced an expansion of CD3+ T cells and accelerated lung fibrosis. Together, these results demonstrate that IPF T cells are profibrotic but the immune checkpoint protein, CTLA-4, appears to limit this effect in IPF.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, functional motoneurons are defined as differentiated neurons that are connected to a central premotor network and activate peripheral muscle using acetylcholine. Generally, motoneurons and muscles develop simultaneously during embryogenesis. However, during Xenopus metamorphosis, developing limb motoneurons must reach their target muscles through the already established larval cholinergic axial neuromuscular system. Here, we demonstrate that at metamorphosis onset, spinal neurons retrogradely labeled from the emerging hindlimbs initially express neither choline acetyltransferase nor vesicular acetylcholine transporter. Nevertheless, they are positive for the motoneuronal transcription factor Islet1/2 and exhibit intrinsic and axial locomotor-driven electrophysiological activity. Moreover, the early appendicular motoneurons activate developing limb muscles via nicotinic antagonist-resistant, glutamate antagonist-sensitive, neuromuscular synapses. Coincidently, the hindlimb muscles transiently express glutamate, but not nicotinic receptors. Subsequently, both pre- and postsynaptic neuromuscular partners switch definitively to typical cholinergic transmitter signaling. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel context-dependent re-specification of neurotransmitter phenotype during neuromuscular system development.",

    "abstract": "Restricted availability of cell and animal models is a rate-limiting step for investigation of salivary gland neoplasm pathophysiology and therapeutic response. Conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) technology enables establishment of primary epithelial cell cultures from patient material. This study tested a translational workflow for acquisition, expansion and testing of CRC-derived primary cultures of salivary gland neoplasms from patients presenting to an academic surgical practice. Results showed cultured cells were sufficient for epithelial cell-specific transcriptome characterization to detect candidate therapeutic pathways and fusion genes in addition to screening for cancer-risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and driver gene mutations through exome sequencing. Focused study of primary cultures of a low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma demonstrated Amphiregulin-Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin-AKT/Protein kinase B (AKT) pathway activation, identified through bioinformatics and subsequently confirmed as present in primary tissue and preserved through different secondary 2D and 3D culture media and xenografts. Candidate therapeutic testing showed that the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK2206 reproducibly inhibited cell survival across different culture formats. In contrast, the cells appeared resistant to the adenosine triphosphate competitive AKT inhibitor GSK690693. Procedures employed here illustrate an approach for reproducibly obtaining material for pathophysiological studies of salivary gland neoplasms, and other less common epithelial cancer types, that can be executed without compromising pathological examination of patient specimens. The approach permits combined genetic and cell-based physiological and therapeutic investigations in addition to more traditional pathologic studies and can be used to build sustainable bio-banks for future inquiries.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is an evolvable property of biological systems that can arise from environment-specific regulation of gene expression. To better understand the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms that give rise to plasticity in gene expression, we quantified the effects of 235 single nucleotide mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TDH3 promoter (PTDH3) on the activity of this promoter in media containing glucose, galactose, or glycerol as a carbon source. We found that the distributions of mutational effects differed among environments because many mutations altered the plastic response exhibited by the wild type allele. Comparing the effects of these mutations to the effects of 30 PTDH3 polymorphisms on expression plasticity in the same environments provided evidence of natural selection acting to prevent the plastic response in PTDH3 activity between glucose and galactose from becoming larger. The largest changes in expression plasticity were observed between fermentable (glucose or galactose) and nonfermentable (glycerol) carbon sources and were caused by mutations located in the RAP1 and GCR1 transcription factor binding sites. Mutations altered expression plasticity most frequently between the two fermentable environments, however, with mutations causing significant changes in plasticity between glucose and galactose distributed throughout the promoter, suggesting they might affect chromatin structure. Taken together, these results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying gene-by-environment interactions affecting gene expression as well as the evolutionary dynamics affecting natural variation in plasticity of gene expression.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFrom seasonal variation in the color of butterfly wings to trees bending toward the light, organisms often change in response to their environment. These changes, known as phenotypic plasticity, can result from differences in how genes are expressed among environments. Mutations causing environment-specific changes in gene expression provide raw material for phenotypic plasticity, but their frequency, effect size and direction of effects among environments are not well understood. This study shows that mutations in the promoter of a yeast metabolic gene often display environment-dependent effects on gene expression and that these environment-dependent effects have been shaped by selection in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Multiple theoretical frameworks posit that interactions between the autonomic nervous system and higher-order neural networks are crucial for cognitive regulation. However, few studies have directly examined the relationship between measures of autonomic physiology and brain activity during cognitive tasks, and fewer studies have examined both the parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic branches when doing so. Here, 93 adults completed an event-related potential (ERP) auditory selective attention task concurrently with measures of parasympathetic activity (high-frequency heart rate variability; HF-HRV) and sympathetic activity (pre-ejection period; PEP). We replicate previous findings showing effects of selective attention on mean amplitude of the N1 ERP component (Hillyard et al., 1973; Coch et al., 2005), and extend this result to show that the effects of selective attention were associated with baseline values of HF-HRV and PEP. Individuals with higher resting HF-HRV and shorter resting PEP showed larger effects of selective attention on their ERPs. Follow-up regression models demonstrated that HF-HRV and PEP accounted for unique variance in selective attention effects on N1 mean amplitude. These results are consistent with the neurovisceral integration model, which posits that greater parasympathetic activity is a marker of increased cognitive capacity, as well as other theoretical models which emphasize the role of heightened sympathetic activity in more efficient attention-related processing. The present findings highlight the importance of autonomic physiology in the study of individual differences in neurocognitive function, and given the foundational role of selective attention across cognitive domains, suggest that both parasympathetic and sympathetic activity may be key to understanding variability in brain function across a variety of cognitive tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent interest has focused on a class of decision problems in which subjects encounter options serially and must decide when to leave an option in search of a better one, rather than directly comparing simultaneously presented options. Although such problems have a rich history in animal foraging and economics, relatively little is known about their neural substrates. Suggestively, however, a separate literature has argued that the key decision variable in these tasks - the opportunity cost of time, given by the average reward rate - may also govern behavioral vigor and may be reported by tonic dopamine (DA).\\n\\nIn this study, we test whether this putative dopaminergic opportunity cost signal plays an analogous role in serial decisions by examining the behavior of patients with Parkinsons disease (PD), on and off their DA replacement medication, in a patch-foraging task. In these tasks, subjects decisions about when to leave a depleting resource implicitly reflect their beliefs about the opportunity cost of time spent harvesting that resource. Consistent with the opportunity cost hypothesis, umedicated patients harvested longer than matched controls, and medication remediated this deficit. These effects were not explained by motor perseveration. Our results suggest a functional role for DA, and an associated cognitive deficit in PD, in a type of decision process that may be distinct from (but related to) the neuromodulators well studied roles in behavioral invigoration and learning from rewards.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis study addresses two important questions whose answers are, unexpectedly, linked. First, what is the scope of cognitive functions of the neuromodulator dopamine, whose contributions - for instance, as assessed by both the motoric and more subtle cognitive deficits of patients with PD, which depletes dopamine - range from movement to reward and decision-making? Second, what are the neural mechanisms supporting an important but understudied class of problems, in which, rather than choose among a set of alternatives (like apples and oranges), one makes serial decisions about whether to stick with an option (like a job, or a mate) or seek another? We demonstrate a novel cognitive deficit in PD that integrates this function into the web of DAs contributions.",

The spatially confined fate specification establishes a distinct distribution of cells in each germlayer during early gastrulation. The differences in the initial distribution are subsequently amplified by a unique global movement, which organizes the organ precursors along the embryonic body axis, giving rise to the blueprint of organ formation.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, it has become almost a necessity for many biologists to execute bioinformatics workflows (WFs) as part of their research. However, most WF-management software packages require for their operation at least some programming expertise. Here we describe NeatSeq-Flow, a platform that enables users with no programming knowledge to design and execute complex high throughput sequencing WFs. This is achieved by using a compendium of pre-built modules as well as a generic module, both do not require programming expertise. Nonetheless, NeatSeq-Flow retains the flexibility to generate sophisticated WF modules using templates and only basic Python programming abilities. NeatSeq-Flow is designed to enable easy sharing of WFs and modules by conceptually separating modules, WF design, sample information and execution. Moreover, NeatSeq-Flow works hand in hand with CONDA environments for easy installation of the WFs analysis programs in one go. NeatSeq-Flow enables efficient WF execution on computer clusters by parallelizing on both samples and WF steps. NeatSeq-Flow operates by shell-script generation; thus it allows full transparency of the WF process. NeatSeq-Flow offers real-time WF execution monitoring, detailed documentation and self-sustaining WF backups for reproducibility. All of these features make NeatSeq-Flow an easy-to-use WF platform while not compromising for flexibility, reproducibility, transparency and efficiency.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://neatseq-flow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nContactsklarz@bgu.ac.il",

    "abstract": "Host-plant genetic variation affects the diversity and composition of associated above and belowground communities. Most evidence supporting this view is derived from studies within a single common garden, thereby constraining the range of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions that might directly or indirectly (via phenotypic plasticity) affect communities. If natural variability in the environment renders host-plant genetic effects on associated communities unimportant, then studying the community-level consequences of genetic variation may not be warranted. We addressed this knowledge gap by planting a series of common gardens consisting of 10 different clones (genotypes) of the willow Salix hookeriana in a coastal dune ecosystem and manipulated natural variation in ant-aphid interactions (biotic) and wind exposure (abiotic) in two separate experiments. We then quantified the responses of associated species assemblages both above (foliar arthropods) and belowground (rhizosphere fungi and bacteria). In addition, we quantified plant phenotypic responses (plant growth, leaf quality, and root quality) to tease apart the effects of genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, and direct environmental effects on associated communities. In the ant-aphid experiment, we found that willow genotype explained more variation in foliar arthropod communities than aphid additions and proximity to aphid-tending ant mounds. However, aphid additions modified willow genetic effects on arthropod community composition by attracting other aphid species to certain willow genotypes. In the wind experiment, wind exposure explained more variation than willow genotype in structuring communities of foliar arthropods and rhizosphere bacteria. Still, willow genotype had strong effect sizes on several community properties of arthropods and fungi, indicating that host-plant genetic variation remains important. Across both experiments, genetic variation in plant traits was more important than phenotypic plasticity in structuring associated communities. The relative importance of genetic variation vs. direct environmental effects though depended on the type of environmental gradient (G > E-aphid, but E-wind > G). Taken together, our results suggest that host-plant genetic variation is an important driver of above and belowground biodiversity, despite natural variation in the biotic and abiotic environment.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the internal phylogeny and evolutionary history of ants (Formicidae), the worlds most species-rich clade of eusocial organisms, has dramatically improved since the advent of molecular phylogenetics. A number of relationships at the subfamily level, however, remain uncertain. Key unresolved issues include placement of the root of the ant tree of life and the relationships among the so-called poneroid subfamilies. Here we assemble a new data set to attempt a resolution of these two problems and carry out divergence dating, focusing on the age of the root node of crown Formicidae. For the phylogenetic analyses we included data from 110 ant species, including the key species Martialis heureka. We focused taxon sampling on non-formicoid lineages of ants to gain insight about deep nodes in the ant phylogeny. For divergence dating we retained a subset of 62 extant taxa and 42 fossils in order to approximate diversified sampling in the context of the fossilized birth-death process. We sequenced 11 nuclear gene fragments for a total of ~7.5 kb and investigated the DNA sequence data for the presence of among-taxon compositional heterogeneity, a property known to mislead phylogenetic inference, and for its potential to affect the rooting of the ant phylogeny. We found sequences of the Leptanillinae and several outgroup taxa to be rich in adenine and thymine (51% average AT content) compared to the remaining ants (45% average). To investigate whether this heterogeneity could bias phylogenetic inference we performed outgroup removal experiments, analysis of compositionally homogeneous sites, and a simulation study. We found that compositional heterogeneity indeed appears to affect the placement of the root of the ant tree but has limited impact on more recent nodes. We put forward a novel hypothesis regarding the rooting of the ant phylogeny, in which Martialis and the Leptanillinae together constitute a clade that is sister to all other ants. After correcting for compositional heterogeneity this emerges as the best-supported hypothesis of relationships at deep nodes in the ant tree. The results of our divergence dating under the fossilized birth-death process and diversified sampling suggest that the crown Formicidae originated during the Albian or Aptian ages of the Lower Cretaceous (103-124 Ma). In addition, we found support for monophyletic poneroids comprising the subfamilies Agroecomyrmecinae, Amblyoponinae, Apomyrminae, Paraponerinae, Ponerinae, and Proceratiinae, and well-supported relationships among these subfamilies except for the placement of Proceratiinae and (Amblyoponinae + Apomyrminae). Our phylogeny also highlights the non-monophyly of several ant genera, including Protanilla and Leptanilla in the Leptanillinae, Proceratium in the Proceratiinae, and Cryptopone, Euponera, and Mesoponera within the Ponerinae.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable disorders that share a significant proportion of common risk variation. Understanding the genetic factors underlying the specific symptoms of these disorders will be crucial for improving diagnosis, intervention and treatment. In case-control data consisting of 53,555 cases (20,129 BD, 33,426 SCZ) and 54,065 controls, we identified 114 genome-wide significant loci (GWS) when comparing all cases to controls, of which 41 represented novel findings. Two genome-wide significant loci were identified when comparing SCZ to BD and a third was found when directly incorporating functional information. Regional joint association identified a genomic region of overlapping association in BD and SCZ with disease-independent causal variants indicating a fourth region contributing to differences between these disorders. Regional SNP-heritability analyses demonstrated that the estimated heritability of BD based on the SCZ GWS regions was significantly higher than that based on the average genomic region (91 regions, p = 1.2x10-6) while the inverse was not significant (19 regions, p=0.89). Using our BD and SCZ GWAS we calculated polygenic risk scores and identified several significant correlations with: 1) SCZ subphenotypes: negative symptoms (SCZ, p=3.6x10-6) and manic symptoms (BD, p=2x10-5), 2) BD subphenotypes: psychotic features (SCZ p=1.2x10-10, BD p=5.3x10-5) and age of onset (SCZ p=7.9x10-4). Finally, we show that psychotic features in BD has significant SNP-heritability (h2 snp=0.15, SE=0.06), and a significant genetic correlation with SCZ (rg=0.34) in addition there is a significant sign test result between SCZ GWAS and a GWAS of BD cases contrasting those with and without psychotic features (p=0.0038, one-side binomial test). For the first time, we have identified specific loci pointing to a potential role of 4 genes (DARS2, ARFGEF2, DCAKD and GATAD2A) that distinguish between BD and SCZ, providing an opportunity to understand the biology contributing to clinical differences of these disorders. Our results provide the best evidence so far of genomic components distinguishing between BD and SCZ that contribute directly to specific symptom dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Determining the extent to which Symbiodinium communities in corals are inherited versus environmentally-acquired is fundamental to understanding coral resilience and to predicting coral responses to stressors like warming oceans that disrupt this critical endosymbiosis. We examined the fidelity with which Symbiodinium communities in the brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix are vertically transmitted and the extent to which communities are genetically regulated, by genotyping 60 larvae and their parents (9 maternal and 45 paternal colonies) using high throughput sequencing of the ITS-2 locus. Unexpectedly, Symbiodinium communities associated with brooded larvae were distinct from those within parent colonies, including the presence of types not detected in adults. Bayesian heritability (h2) analysis revealed that 33% of variability in larval Symbiodinium communities was genetically controlled. Results highlight flexibility in the establishment of larval communities and overturn the paradigm that symbiont transmission is exclusively vertical in brooding corals. Instead, we show that Symbiodinium transmission in S. hystrix involves a mixed-mode strategy, similar to many terrestrial invertebrate symbioses. Also, variation in the abundances of common Symbiodinium types among adult communities suggests that microhabitat differences influence the structure of in hospite Symbiodinium communities. Partial genetic regulation coupled with flexibility in the environmentally-acquired component of larval Symbiodinium communities implies that corals with vertical transmission, like S. hystrix, may be more resilient to environmental change than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses encode a mix of highly conserved and novel genes as well as genetic elements necessary for infection and pathogenesis, raising the possibility for common targets for attenuation and therapeutic design. In this study, we focus on the highly conserved nonstructural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2O MTase activity had only marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting.\\n\\nSignificanceCoronavirus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, PEDV and swine delta coronavirus in the 21st century. These studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2O methyl-transferase activity of coronaviruses for attenuation. With clear understanding of the IFN/IFIT based mechanism, NSP16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live attenuated vaccine platform as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emergent CoV strains. Importantly, other approaches targeting other conserved pan-coronavirus functions have not yet proven effective against MERS-CoV, illustrating the broad applicability of targeting viral 2O MTase function across coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Of late, there has been a growing interest in studying brain networks, particularly, for understanding spontaneous temporal changes in functional brain networks. Recently, phase synchrony based methods have been proposed to track instantaneous time-resolved functional connectivity without any need of windowing the data. This paper extends one such recently used phase synchrony measure in two steps. First, multiple temporal models are built from four-mode tensor that are further clustered to detect dynamic brain network communities. This clustering is based on spatio-temporal data and hence, is named as Spatio-Temporal Clustering (STC). Second, a method is proposed to rank all the communities allowing the proposed model to deal with multiple communities of differing time evolution. This helps in the comparison of network communities, especially, when available communities are too dense to provide relevant information for comparison. The ranking of communities allows for the dimensionality reduction of communities, while still maintaining the key brain networks. Intrinsic time-varying functional connectivity has been investigated for large scale brain networks, including default-mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), cognitive control network (CCN), auditory network (AN), etc. The proposed method provides a new complementary tool to investigate dynamic network states at a high temporal resolution and is tested on resting-state functional MRI data of 26 typically developing controls (TDC) and 35 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects. Simulation results demonstrate that ASD subjects have altered dynamic brain networks compared to TDC.",

Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the monkey exhibit a form of this environmental memory, responding when a monkey makes a saccade that brings the spatial location of a stimulus that appeared on a number of prior trials, but not on the present trial into their receptive fields. The stimulus need never have appeared in the receptive field of the neuron. This response is usually weaker with a longer latency than the neuron's visual response.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is the standard diagnosis method for a wide variety of diseases such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, encephalopathies, and coma, among others. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rs-fMRI) is currently a technique used in research in both healthy individuals as well as patients. EEG and fMRI are procedures used to obtain direct and indirect measurements of brain neural activity: EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp, and fMRI detects the changes in blood oxygenation that occur in response to neural activity. EEG has a high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution, while fMRI has high spatial resolution and low temporal resolution. Thus, the combination of EEG with rs-fMRI using different methods could be very useful for research and clinical applications. In this article, we describe and show the results of a new methodology for processing rs-fMRI using seeds positioned according to the 10-10 EEG standard. We analyze the functional connectivity and adjacency matrices obtained using 65 seeds based on 10-10 EEG scheme and 21 seeds based on 10-20 EEG. Connectivity networks are created using each 10-20 EEG seeds and are analyzed by comparisons to the seven networks that have been found in recent studies. The proposed method captures high correlation between contralateral seeds, ipsilateral and contralateral occipital seeds, and some in the frontal lobe.",

    "abstract": "The ability of a neuronal population to effectuate response decorrelation has been identified as an essential prelude to efficient neural encoding. To what extent are diverse forms of local and afferent heterogeneities essential in accomplishing such response decorrelation in the dentate gyrus (DG)? Here, we incrementally incorporated four distinct forms of biological heterogeneities into conductance-based network models of the DG and systematically delineate their relative contributions to response decorrelation. We incorporated intrinsic heterogeneities by stochastically generating several electrophysiologically-validated basket and granule cell models that exhibited significant parametric variability, and introduced synaptic heterogeneities through randomized local synaptic strengths. In including adult neurogenesis, we subjected the valid model populations to randomized structural plasticity and matched neuronal excitability to electrophysiological data. We assessed networks comprising different combinations of these three local heterogeneities with identical or heterogeneous afferent inputs from the entorhinal cortex. We found that the three forms of local heterogeneities were independently and synergistically capable of mediating significant response decorrelation when the network was driven by identical afferent inputs. Strikingly, however, when we incorporated afferent heterogeneities into the network to account for the unique divergence in DG afferent connectivity, the impact of all three forms of local heterogeneities were significantly suppressed by the dominant role of afferent heterogeneities in mediating response decorrelation. Our results unveil a unique convergence of cellular- and network-scale degeneracy in the emergence of response decorrelation in the DG, and constitute a significant departure from the literature that assigns a critical role for local network heterogeneities in input discriminability.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus (DG) networks assimilate new neurons in adult rodents, with adult neurogenesis postulated to subserve efficacious information transfer by reducing correlations in neuronal responses to afferent inputs. Heterogeneities emerging from the lateral dendro-dendritic synapses, mediated by locally-projecting neurogenic inhibitory granule cells, are known to play critical roles in channel decorrelation in the olfactory bulb. However, the contributions of different heterogeneities in mediating response decorrelation in DG, comprising neurogenic excitatory granule cells projecting beyond DG and endowed with uniquely divergent afferent inputs, have not been delineated. Here, we quantitatively demonstrate the dominance of afferent heterogeneities, over multiple local heterogeneities, in the emergence of response decorrelation in DG, together unveiling cross-region degeneracy in accomplishing response decorrelation.",

    "abstract": "How organisms maintain cell size homeostasis is a long-standing problem that remains unresolved, especially in multicellular organisms. Recent experiments in diverse animal cell types demonstrate that within a cell population the extent of growth and cellular proliferation (i.e., fitness) is low for small and large cells, but high at intermediate sizes. Here we use mathematical models to explore size-control strategies that drive such a non-monotonic fitness profile resulting in an optimal cell size. Our analysis reveals that if cell size grows exponentially or linearly over time, then fitness always varies monotonically with size irrespective of how timing of division is regulated. Furthermore, if the cell divides upon attaining a critical size (as in the Sizer or size-checkpoint model), then fitness always increases with size irrespective of how growth rate is regulated. These results show that while several size control models can maintain cell size homeostasis, they fail to predict the optimal cell size, and hence unable to explain why cells prefer a certain size. Interestingly, fitness maximization at an optimal size requires two key ingredients: 1) The growth rate decreases with increasing size for large enough cells; and 2) The cell size at the time of division is a function of the newborn size. The latter condition is consistent with the Adder paradigm for division control (division is triggered upon adding a fixed size from birth), or a Sizer-Adder combination. Consistent with theory, Jurkat T cell growth rates, as measured via oxygen consumption or mitochondrial activity, increase with size for small cells, but decrease with size for large cells. In summary, regulation of both growth and cell division timing is critical for size control in animal cells, and this joint-regulation leads to an optimal size where cellular fitness is maximized.\n\nAddress inquires to A.

Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe binary is freely available for non-commercial users at enterome.fr/site/downloads/ Contact: florian.plaza-onate@inra.fr\\n\\nSupplementary informationAvailable in the file named Supplementary Information.pdf",

    "abstract": "Organelles, proteins, and mRNA are transported bidirectionally along microtubules by plus-end directed kinesin and minus-end directed dynein motors. Microtubules are decorated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that organize the cytoskeleton, regulate microtubule dynamics and modulate the interaction between motor proteins and microtubules to direct intracellular transport. Tau is a neuronal MAP that stabilizes axonal microtubules and crosslinks them into bundles. Dysregulation of tau leads to a range of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies including Alzheimers disease (AD). Tau reduces the processivity of kinesin and dynein by acting as an obstacle on the microtubule. Single-molecule assays indicate that kinesin-1 is more strongly inhibited than kinesin-2 or dynein, suggesting tau might act to spatially modulate the activity of specific motors. To investigate the role of tau in regulating bidirectional transport, we isolated phagosomes driven by kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein and reconstituted their motility along microtubules. We find that tau biases bidirectional motility towards the microtubule minus-end in a dose-dependent manner. Optical trapping measurements show that tau increases the magnitude and frequency of forces exerted by dynein through inhibiting opposing kinesin motors. Mathematical modeling indicates that tau controls the directional bias of intracellular cargoes through differentially tuning the processivity of kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tau modulates motility in a motor-specific manner to direct intracellular transport, and suggests that dysregulation of tau might contribute to neurodegeneration by disrupting the balance of plus- and minus-end directed transport.\\n\\nSynopsis and Graphical Table of ContentsWe isolated endogenous cargoes, along with a complement of kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and dynein motors, and reconstituted their bidirectional motility in vitro. We find that tau, a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neuronal axons, directs bidirectional cargoes towards the microtubule minus end by tuning the balance of forces exerted by kinesin and dynein teams. These results suggest a general mechanism for regulating the transport of intracellular cargoes through modulating the relative activity of opposing motor teams.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/173609_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (31K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8ba4e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f5945corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1df2f47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@198f5d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The asymmetric crystal structure of trimeric AcrB suggests a functionally rotating mechanism for drug transport. Despite various supportive evidences from biochemical and simulation studies for this mechanism, the link between the functional rotation and proton translocation across the membrane remains elusive. Here, calculating the minimum free energy pathway of the functional rotation for the complete AcrB trimer, we describe the structural and energetic basis behind the coupling between the functional rotation and the proton translocation at atomic-level. Free energy calculations show that protonation of Asp408 in the transmembrane portion of the drug-bound protomer drives the functional rotation.

It is a general term used for a group of disorders in which nerve cells of the brain discharge anomalous electrical impulses from time to time, causing a temporary malfunction of the other nerve cells of the brain. EEG signal provides an important cue for diagnosis and interpretation related to prognosis of epilepsy. In this work we envisage to provide novel tool which can be used to detect the prognosis of epileptic disorder by comparing linear and nonlinear modalities of EEG analysis conventionally used Power spectral analysis and a robust non linear method, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA).

    "abstract": "Studies indicate that more than 90% of human genes are alternatively spliced, suggesting the complexity of the transcriptome assembly and analysis. The splicing process is often disrupted, resulting in both functional and non-functional end-products (Sveen et al. 2016) in many cancers. Harnessing the immune system to fight against malignant cancers carrying aberrantly mutated or spliced products is becoming a promising approach to cancer therapy. Advances in immune checkpoint blockade have elicited adaptive immune responses with promising clinical responses to treatments against human malignancies (Tumor Neoantigens in Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy 2017). Emerging data suggest that recognition of patient-specific mutation-associated cancer antigens (i.e. from alternative splicing isoforms) may allow scientists to dissect the immune response in the activity of clinical immunotherapies (Schumacher and Schreiber 2015). The advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has provided a comprehensive view of both splicing aberrations and somatic mutations across a range of human malignancies, allowing for a deeper understanding of the interplay of various disease mechanisms.\\n\\nMeanwhile, studies show that the number of transcript isoforms reported to date may be limited by the short-read sequencing due to the inherit limitation of transcriptome reconstruction algorithms, whereas long-read sequencing is able to significantly improve the detection of alternative splicing variants since there is no need to assemble full-length transcripts from short reads. The analysis of these high-throughput long-read sequencing data may permit a systematic view of tumor specific peptide epitopes (also known as neoantigens) that could serve as targets for immunotherapy (Tumor Neoantigens in Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy 2017).\\n\\nCurrently, there is no software pipeline available that can efficiently produce mutation-associated cancer antigens from raw high-throughput sequencing data on patient tumor DNA (The Problem with Neoantigen Prediction 2017). In addressing this issue, we introduce a R package that allows the discoveries of peptide epitope candidates, which are the tumor-specific peptide fragments containing potential functional neoantigens. These peptide epitopes consist of structure variants including insertion, deletions, alternative sequences, and peptides from nonsynonymous mutations. Analysis of these precursor candidates with widely used tools such as netMHC allows for the accurate in-silico prediction of neoantigens. The pipeline named neoantigeR is currently hosted in https://github.com/ICBI/neoantigeR.",

    "abstract": "Selection and mutation shape genetic variation underlying human traits, but the specific evolutionary mechanisms driving complex trait variation are largely unknown. We developed a statistical method that uses polarized GWAS summary statistics from a single population to detect signals of mutational bias and selection. We found evidence for non-neutral signals on variation underlying several traits (BMI, schizophrenia, Crohns disease, educational attainment, and height). We then used simulations that incorporate simultaneous negative and positive selection to show that these signals are consistent with mutational bias and shifts in the fitness-phenotype relationship, but not stabilizing selection or mutational bias alone. We additionally replicate two of our top three signals (BMI and educational attainment) in an external cohort, and show that population stratification may have confounded GWAS summary statistics for height in the GIANT cohort. Our results provide a flexible and powerful framework for evolutionary analysis of complex phenotypes in humans and other species, and offer insights into the evolutionary mechanisms driving variation in human polygenic traits.\\n\\nImpact summaryMany traits are variable within human populations and are likely to have a substantial and complex genetic component. This implies that mutations that have a functional impact on complex human traits have arisen throughout our species evolutionary history. However, it remains unclear how processes such as natural selection may have acted to shape trait variation at the genetic and phenotypic level. Better understanding of the mechanisms driving trait variation could provide insights into our evolutionary past and help clarify why it has been so difficult to map the preponderance of causal variation for common heritable diseases.\\n\\nIn this study, we developed and applied methods for detecting signatures of mutation bias (i.e., the propensity of a new variant to be either trait-increasing or trait-decreasing) and natural selection acting on trait variation. We applied our approach to several heritable traits, and found evidence for both natural selection and mutation bias, including selection for decreased BMI and decreased risk for Crohns disease and schizophrenia.\\n\\nWhile our results are consistent with plausible evolutionary scenarios shaping a range of traits, it should be noted that the field of polygenic selection detection is still new, and current methods (including ours) rely on data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The data produced by these studies may be vulnerable to certain cryptic biases, especially population stratification, which could induce false selection signals. We therefore repeated our analyses for the top three hits in a cohort that should be less susceptible to this problem - we found that two of our top three signals replicated (BMI and educational attainment), while height did not. Our results highlight both the promise and pitfalls of polygenic selection detection approaches, and suggest a need for further work disentangling stratification from selection.",

    "abstract": "Low-molecular weight (LMW) thiols are metabolites that mediate redox homeostasis and the detoxification of chemical stressors in cells. LMW thiols are also thought to play a central role in sulfur oxidation pathways in phototrophic bacteria, including the Chlorobiaceae. Fluorescent thiol labeling of metabolite extracts coupled with HPLC showed that Chlorobaculum tepidum contained a novel LMW thiol with a mass of 412 {+/-} 1 Da corresponding to a molecular formula of C14H24N2O10S. These data suggested the new thiol is closely related to bacillithiol (BSH), the major LMW thiol from low G+C% Gram-positive bacteria. By comparing the as-isolated bimane adduct with chemically synthesized candidate structures, the Cba. tepidum thiol structure was identified as N-methyl-bacillithiol (N-Me-BSH), methylated on the cysteine nitrogen, a rarely observed modification in metabolism. Orthologs of bacillithiol biosynthetic genes in the Cba. tepidum genome were required for the biosynthesis of N-Me-BSH. Furthermore, the CT1040 gene product was genetically identified as the BSH N-methyltransferase. N-Me-BSH was found in all Chlorobi examined as well as Polaribacter sp. strain MED152, a member of the Bacteroidetes. A comparative genomic analysis indicated that BSH/N-Me-BSH is synthesized not only by members of the Chlorobi, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, and Firmicutes, but also by Acidobacteria, Chlamydiae, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHere, N-Me-BSH is shown to be a redox-responsive LMW thiol cofactor in Cba. tepidum and the gene, nmbA, encoding the BSH N-methyltransferase responsible for its synthesis is identified. The co-occurrence of orthologs to BSH biosynthesis genes and bacillithiol N-methyltransferase was confirmed to correctly predict LMW thiol biosynthesis in phylogenetically distant genomes. The analysis indicates that BSH/N-Me-BSH are likely the most widely distributed class of LMW thiols in biology. This finding sheds light on the evolution of LMW thiol metabolism, which is central to redox homeostasis, regulation and stress resistance in all cellular life. It also sheds light on a rare chemical modification. N-Me-BSH is the fourth instance of cysteinyl nitrogen methylation in metabolism. Identification of the BSH N-methyltransferase reported here will enable detailed in vivo and in vitro dissection of the functional consequences of this modification. As a standalone N-methyltransferase, NmbA may be useful as a component of constructed biosynthetic pathways for novel product (bio)synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae modulates plant hormone signaling to promote infection and disease development. P. syringae uses several strategies to manipulate auxin physiology in Arabidopsis thaliana to promote pathogenesis, including synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the predominant form of auxin in plants, and production of virulence factors that alter auxin responses in the host; however, the role of pathogen-derived auxin in P. syringae pathogenesis is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that P. syringae strain DC3000 produces IAA via a previously uncharacterized pathway and identify a novel indole-3-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, AldA, that functions in IAA biosynthesis by catalyzing the NAD-dependent formation of IAA from indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld). Biochemical analysis and solving of the 1.9 [A] resolution x-ray crystal structure reveal key features of AldA for IAA synthesis, including the molecular basis of substrate specificity. Disruption of aldA and a close homolog, aldB, lead to reduced IAA production in culture and reduced virulence on A. thaliana. We use these mutants to explore the mechanism by which pathogen-derived auxin contributes to virulence and show that IAA produced by DC3000 suppresses salicylic acid-mediated defenses in A. thaliana. Thus, auxin is a DC3000 virulence factor that promotes pathogenicity by suppressing host defenses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPathogens have evolved multiple strategies for suppressing host defenses and modulating host physiology to promote colonization and disease development. For example, the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae uses several strategies to the manipulate hormone signaling of its hosts, including production of virulence factors that alter hormone responses in and synthesis of plant hormones or hormone mimics. Synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a common form of the plant hormone auxin, by many plant pathogens has been implicated in virulence. However, the role of pathogen-derived IAA during pathogenesis by leaf spotting pathogens such as P. syringae strain DC3000 is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that P. syringae strain DC3000 uses a previously uncharacterized biochemical pathway to synthesize IAA, catalyzed by a novel aldehyde dehydrogenase, AldA, and carry out biochemical and structural studies of the AldA protein to investigate AldA activity and substrate specificity. We also generate an aldA mutant disrupted in IAA synthesis to show that IAA is a DC3000 virulence factor that promotes pathogenesis by suppressing host defense responses.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) severity and altered in late stage disease. However, it is unclear how gut microbial communities change over the course of IBD development, especially in regards to function. To investigate microbiome mediated disease mechanisms and discover early biomarkers of IBD, we conducted a longitudinal metagenomic investigation in an established mouse model of IBD, where dampened TGF-{beta} signaling in T cells leads to peripheral immune activation, weight loss, and severe colitis. IBD development is associated with abnormal gut microbiome temporal dynamics, including dampened acquisition of functional diversity and significant differences in abundance trajectories for KEGG modules such as glycosaminoglycan degradation, cellular chemotaxis, and type III and IV secretion systems. Most differences between sick and control mice emerge when mice begin to lose weight and heightened T cell activation is detected in peripheral blood. However, lipooligosaccharide transporter abundance diverges prior to immune activation, indicating that it could be a pre-disease indicator or microbiome-mediated disease mechanism. Taxonomic structure of the gut microbiome also significantly changes in association with IBD development, and the abundance of particular taxa, including several species of Bacteroides, correlate with immune activation. These discoveries were enabled by our use of generalized linear mixed effects models to test for differences in longitudinal profiles between healthy and diseased mice while accounting for the distributions of taxon and gene counts in metagenomic data. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal metagenomics is useful for discovering potential mechanisms through which the gut microbiome becomes altered in IBD.\\n\\nImportanceIBD patients harbor distinct microbial communities with different functional capabilities compared to healthy people. But is this cause or effect? Answering this question requires data on changes in gut microbial communities leading up to disease onset. By performing weekly metagenomic sequencing and mixed effects modeling on an established mouse model of IBD, we identified several functional pathways encoded by the gut microbiome that covary with host immune status. These pathways are novel early biomarkers that may either enable microbes to live inside an inflamed gut or contribute to immune activation in IBD mice. Future work will validate the potential roles of these microbial pathways in host-microbe interactions and human disease. This study is novel in its longitudinal design and focus on microbial pathways, which provided new mechanistic insights into the role of gut microbes in IBD development.",

Here we asked whether cerebellar might be involved in the temporal coordination of the phases of neuronal oscillations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampus CA1 region (CA1). These two structures and the cerebellum are jointly involved in spatial working memory. The phases of oscillations in the mPFC and CA1 have been shown to reach a stable alignment (coherence) during the decision making process in a spatial working memory task. Here we report that PC simple spike activity in the cerebellar lobulus simplex in awake, head-fixed mice represents specific phase differences between oscillations in the mPFC and CA1. Most PCs represented phase differences in more than one the conventional frequency bands (delta, theta, beta and gamma). Between the 32 PCs analyzed here, phase differences in all frequency bands were represented. PCs representing phase differences in the theta and low gamma bands showed significant population preference for mPFC phase leading CA1 phase. These findings support the possibility of a cerebellar involvement in the temporal coordination of phase relationships between oscillations in the mPFC and CA1.",

    "abstract": "High throughput sequencing (HTS) of DNA forensic samples is expanding from the sizing of short tandem repeats (STRs) to massively parallel sequencing (MPS). HTS panels are expanding from the FBI 20 core Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) loci to include SNPs. The calculation of random man not excluded, P(RMNE), is used in DNA mixture analysis to estimate the probability that a person is present in a DNA mixture. This calculation encounters calculation artifacts with expansion to larger panel sizes. Increasing the floating-point precision of the calculations allows for increased panel sizes but with a corresponding increase in computation time. The Taylor series higher precision libraries used fail on some input data sets leading to algorithm unreliability. Herein, a new formula is introduced for calculating P(RMNE) that scales to larger SNP panel sizes while being computationally efficient (patent pending)[1].",

    "abstract": "Although extinction is ubiquitous throughout the history of life, insight into the factors that drive extinction events are often difficult to decipher. Most studies of extinction focus on inferring causal factors from past extinction events, but these studies are constrained by our inability to observe extinction events as they occur. Here, we use digital evolution to avoid these constraints and study \\\"extinction in action\\\". We focus on the role of genome size in driving population extinction, as previous work both in comparative genomics and digital evolution has shown a correlation between genome size and extinction. We find that extinctions in small populations are caused by large genome size. This relationship between genome size and extinction is due to two genetic mechanisms that increase a populations lethal mutational burden: large genome size leads to both an increased lethal mutation rate and an increased likelihood of stochastic reproduction errors and non-viability. We further show that this increased lethal mutational burden is directly due to genome expansions, as opposed to subsequent adaptation after genome expansion. These findings suggest that large genome size can enhance the extinction likelihood of small populations and may inform which natural populations are at an increased risk of extinction.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested an important role of de novo mutations (DNMs) in neuropsychiatric disorders. As DNMs are not subject to elimination due to evolutionary pressure, they are likely to have greater disruptions on biological functions. While a number of sequencing studies have been performed on neuropsychiatric disorders, the implications of DNMs for drug discovery remain to be explored.\\n\\nIn this study, we employed a gene-set analysis approach to address this issue. Four neuropsychiatric disorders were studied, including schizophrenia (SCZ), autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy. We first identified gene-sets associated with different drugs, and analyzed whether the gene-set pertaining to each drug overlaps with DNMs more than expected by chance. We also assessed which medication classes are enriched among the prioritized drugs. We discovered that neuropsychiatric drug classes were indeed significantly enriched for DNMs of all four disorders; in particular, antipsychotics and antiepileptics were the most strongly enriched drug classes for SCZ and epilepsy respectively. Interestingly, we revealed enrichment of several unexpected drug classes, such as lipid-lowering agents for SCZ and anti-neoplastic agents. By inspecting individual hits, we also uncovered other interesting drug candidates or mechanisms (e.g. histone deacetylase inhibition and retinoid signaling) that might warrant further investigations. Taken together, this study provided evidence for the usefulness of DNMs in guiding drug discovery or repositioning.",

    "abstract": "Amniocentesis is typically performed to identify large chromosomal abnormalities within the fetus. Here we demonstrate that it is feasible to generate an accurate whole genome sequence (WGS) of a fetus from an amniotic sample. DNA from cells and the amniotic fluid were isolated and sequenced from 31 amniocenteses. Concordance of variant calls between the two DNA sources and with parental libraries was high. Two fetal genomes were found to harbor potentially detrimental variants in CHD8 and LRP1, variations in these genes have been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Keratosis pilaris atrophicans, respectively. We also discovered drug sensitivities and carrier information of fetuses for a variety of diseases. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the sequencing of the whole genome of fetuses from amniotic fluid and show that much more information than large chromosomal abnormalities can be gained from an amniocentesis.",

    "abstract": "The cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway is a brain circuit that controls movement execution, habit formation and reward. Hyperactivity in the CSTC pathway is involved in obsessive compulsive disorder, a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the execution of repetitive involuntary movements. The striatum shapes the activity of the CSTC pathway through the coordinated activation of two classes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. The exact mechanisms by which balanced excitation/inhibition of these cells controls the network dynamics of the CSTC pathway remain unclear. Here we use non-linear modeling of neuronal activity and bifurcation theory to investigate how global and local changes in excitation/inhibition of MSNs regulate the activity of the CSTC pathway. Our findings indicate that a global and proportionate increase in excitation/inhibition pushes the system to states of generalized hyper-activity throughout the entire CSTC pathway. Certain disproportionate changes in global excitation/inhibition trigger network oscillations. Local changes in the excitation/inhibition of MSNs generate specific oscillatory behaviors in MSNs and in the CSTC pathway. These findings indicate that subtle changes in the relative strength of excitation/inhibition of MSNs can powerfully control the network dynamics of the CSTC pathway in ways that are not easily predicted by its synaptic connections.",
