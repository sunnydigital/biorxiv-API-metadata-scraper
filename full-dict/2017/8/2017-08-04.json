    "abstract": "Gaussian processes such as Brownian motion and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process have been popular models for the evolution of quantitative traits and are widely used in phylogenetic comparative methods. However, they have drawbacks which limit their utility. Here I describe new, non-Gaussian stochastic differential equation (diffusion) models of quantitative trait evolution. I present general methods for deriving new diffusion models, and discuss possible schemes for fitting non-Gaussian evolutionary models to trait data. The theory of stochastic processes provides a mathematical framework for understanding the properties of current, new and future phylogenetic comparative methods. Attention to the mathematical details of models of trait evolution and diversification may help avoid some pitfalls when using stochastic processes to model macroevolution.",

    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response.

    "abstract": "RNA viruses are notorious for their ability to evolve rapidly under selection in novel environments. It is known that the high mutation rate of RNA viruses can generate huge genetic diversity to facilitate viral adaptation. However, less attention has been paid to the underlying fitness landscape that represents the selection forces on viral genomes. Here we systematically quantified the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of about 1,600 single amino acid substitutions in the drug-targeted region of NS5A protein of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). We found that the majority of non-synonymous substitutions incur large fitness costs, suggesting that NS5A protein is highly optimized in natural conditions. We characterized the adaptive potential of HCV by subjecting the mutant viruses to selection by the antiviral drug Daclatasvir. Both the selection coefficient and the number of beneficial mutations are found to increase with the level of environmental stress, which is modulated by the concentration of Daclatasvir. The changes in the spectrum of beneficial mutations in NS5A protein can be explained by a pharmacodynamics model describing viral fitness as a function of drug concentration. We test theoretical predictions regarding the distribution of beneficial fitness effects of mutations. We also interpret the data in the context of Fishers Geometric Model and find an increased distance to optimum as a function of environmental stress. Finally, we show that replication fitness of viruses is correlated with the pattern of sequence conservation in nature and viral evolution is constrained by the need to maintain protein stability.",

    "abstract": "In reported microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations, fast-folding proteins CLN025 and Trp-cage autonomously folded to experimentally determined native conformations. However, the folding times of these proteins derived from the simulations were more than 4-10 times longer than their experimental values. This article reports autonomous folding of CLN025 and Trp-cage in isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics simulations with agreements within factors of 0.69-1.75 between simulated and experimental folding times at different temperatures. These results show that CLN025 and Trp-cage can now autonomously fold in silico as fast as in experiments, and suggest that the accuracy of folding simulations for fast-folding proteins begins to overlap with the accuracy of folding experiments. This opens new prospects of developing computer algorithms that can predict both ensembles of conformations and their interconversion rates for a protein from its sequence for artificial intelligence on how and when a protein acts as a receiver, switch, and relay to facilitate various subcellular-to-tissue communications. Then the genetic information that encodes proteins can be better read in the context of intricate biological functions.",

    "abstract": "The formation of mammalian chromatin domains was investigated by analyzing the domain/isochore connection. This showed that LADs correspond to GC-poor isochores and are compositionally flat, flexible chromatin structures because of the local nucleosome depletions associated with the presence of oligo-As. In contrast, TADs correspond to GC-rich isochores that consist of single or (much more frequently) multiple, GC peaks that shape the single or multiple, loops of TADs. Indeed, the increasing nucleosome depletions linked to the GC gradients of isochore peaks lead to an increasing chromatin flexibility (accompanied by an increasing accessibility and decreasing supercoiling). In conclusion, isochores not only encode but also mold chromatin architecture; while architectural proteins play a role in closing and insulating TAD loops. An extension of this model concerns the encoding of open and closed chromosome compartments by alternating GC-rich and GC-poor isochores, the interactions among compartments defining the 3-D chromosome folding.",

Little is known about the other gorilla and chimpanzee-infecting species in the same (Laverania) subgenus as P. falciparum but none of them are capable of establishing repeated infection and transmission in humans. To elucidate underlying mechanisms and the evolutionary history of this subgenus, we have generated multiple genomes from all known Laverania species. The completeness of our dataset allows us to conclude that interspecific gene transfers as well as convergent evolution were important in the evolution of these species. Striking copy number and structural variations were observed within gene families and one, stevor shows a host specific sequence pattern. The complete genome sequence of the closest ancestor of P. falciparum enables us to estimate confidently for the first time the timing of the beginning of speciation to be 40,000-60,000 years ago followed by a population bottleneck around 4,000-6,000 years ago. Our data allow us also to search in detail for the features of P. falciparum that made it the only member of the Laverania able to infect and spread in humans.",

However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure and distance dependence. We present HiCRep, a framework for assessing the reproducibility of Hi-C data that systematically accounts for these features. In particular, we introduce a novel similarity measure, the stratum adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC), for quantifying the similarity between Hi-C interaction matrices. Not only does it provide a statistically sound and reliable evaluation of reproducibility, SCC can also be used to quantify differences between Hi-C contact matrices and to determine the optimal sequencing depth for a desired resolution. The measure consistently shows higher accuracy than existing approaches in distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and depicting interrelationships of cell lineages. The proposed measure is straightforward to interpret and easy to compute, making it well-suited for providing standardized, interpretable, automatable, and scalable quality control. The freely available R package HiCRep implements our approach.",

    "abstract": "It has long been thought that sleep scoring could not be achieved with brain signals alone despite the deep neuromodulatory transformations that accompany sleep state changes. Here we demonstrate using multi-site electrophysiological LFP recordings in freely moving mice that gamma power in the olfactory bulb (OB) allows for clear classification of sleep and wake. Coupled with hippocampal theta activity, it allows the construction of a sleep scoring algorithm that relies on brain activity alone. This method reaches over 90% homology with classical methods based on muscular activity (EMG) and video tracking. Moreover, contrary to EMG, OB gamma power allows correct discrimination between sleep and immobility in ambiguous situations such as fear-related freezing. We use the instantaneous power of hippocampal theta oscillation and OB gamma oscillation to construct a 2D phase-space that is highly robust across mice and days. Dynamic analysis of trajectories within this space yields a novel characterization of sleep/wake and wake/sleep transitions as deeply divergent phenomena. Whereas waking up is a fast and direct transition, falling asleep is best described as stochastic and gradual change. Altogether this methodology opens the avenue for multi-timescale characterization of sleep states with high temporal resolution based on brain signals only.",

    "abstract": "Over the last ten years, isogenic tagging (IT) has revolutionised the study of bacterial infection dynamics in laboratory animal models. However, quantitative analysis of IT data has been hindered by the piecemeal development of relevant statistical models. The most promising approach relies on stochastic Markovian models of bacterial population dynamics within and among organs. Here we present an efficient numerical method to fit such stochastic dynamic models to in vivo experimental IT data. A common approach to statistical inference with stochastic dynamic models relies on producing large numbers of simulations, but this remains a slow and inefficient method for all but simple problems, especially when tracking bacteria in multiple locations simultaneously. Instead, we derive and solve the systems of ordinary differential equations for the two lower-order moments of the stochastic variables (mean, variance and covariance). For any given model structure, and assuming linear dynamic rates, we demonstrate how the model parameters can be efficiently and accurately estimated by divergence minimisation. We then apply our method to an experimental dataset and compare the estimates and goodness-of-fit to those obtained by maximum likelihood estimation. While both sets of parameter estimates had overlapping confidence regions, the new method produced lower values for the division and death rates of bacteria: these improved the goodness-of-fit at the second time point at the expense of that of the first time point. This flexible framework can easily be applied to a range of experimental systems. Its computational efficiency paves the way for model comparison and optimal experimental design.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecent advancements in technology have meant that microbiologists are producing vast amounts of experimental data. However, statistical methods by which we can analyse that data, draw informative inference, and test relevant hypotheses, are much needed. Here, we present a new, efficient inference tool for estimating parameters of stochastic models, with a particular focus on models of within-host bacterial dynamics. The method relies on matching the two lower-order moments of the experimental data (i.e., mean, variance and covariance), to the moments from the mathematical model. The method is verified, and particular choices justified, through a number of simulation studies. We then use this method to estimate models that have been previously estimated using a \\\"gold-standard\\\" maximum likelihood procedure.\\n\\nList of symbolsO_LIA: number of animals\\nC_LIO_LIT: number of tagged strains\\nC_LIO_LIn: number of organs\\nC_LIO_LINi: number of bacteria in organ i\\nC_LIO_LImij: migration rate from organ i to organ j\\nC_LIO_LIki: killing rate in organ i\\nC_LIO_LIri: replication rate in organ i\\nC_LIO_LI{tau}i: observation time i\\nC_LIO_LIA, B, C: matrices\\nC_LIO_LI{lambda}: vector of transition rates\\nC_LIO_LIB: Number of bootstrap samples\\nC_LIO_LI{theta}*: MDE parameter estimate\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviationsO_LIABC: approximate Bayesian computation\\nC_LIO_LIIT: isogenic tagging\\nC_LIO_LILV: live vaccine\\nC_LIO_LIMARE: mean absolute relative error\\nC_LIO_LIMDE: minimum divergence estimate\\nC_LIO_LIMLE: maximum likelihood estimate\\nC_LIO_LIqPCR: quantitative polymerase chain reaction\\nC_LIO_LIWITS: wildtype isogenic tagged strain\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune diseases are characterized by highly specific immune responses against molecules in self-tissues. Different autoimmune diseases are characterized by distinct immune responses, making autoantibodies useful for diagnosis and prediction. In many diseases, the targets of autoantibodies are incompletely defined. Although the technologies for autoantibody discovery have advanced dramatically over the past decade, each of these techniques generates hundreds of possibilities, which are onerous and expensive to validate. We set out to establish a method to greatly simplify autoantibody discovery, using a pre-filtering step to define subgroups with similar specificities based on migration of radiolabeled, immunoprecipitated proteins on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels and autoradiography [Gel Electrophoresis and band detection on Autoradiograms (GEA)]. Human recognition of patterns is not optimal when the patterns are complex or scattered across many samples. Multiple sources of errors - including irrelevant intensity differences and warping of gels - have challenged automation of pattern discovery from autoradiograms.\\n\\nIn this paper, we address these limitations using a Bayesian hierarchical model with shrinkage priors for pattern alignment and spatial dewarping. The Bayesian model combines information from multiple gel sets and corrects spatial warping for coherent estimation of autoantibody signatures defined by presence or absence of a grid of landmark proteins. We show the pre-processing creates more clearly separated clusters and improves the accuracy of autoantibody subset detection via hierarchical clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods with GEA data from scleroderma patients.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage checkpoints are cellular mechanisms that protect the integrity of the genome during cell cycle progression. In response to genotoxic stress, these checkpoints halt cell cycle progression until the damage is repaired, allowing cells enough time to recover from damage before resuming normal proliferation. Here, we investigate the temporal dynamics of DNA damage checkpoints in individual proliferating cells by observing cell cycle phase transitions following acute DNA damage. We find that in gap phases (G1 and G2), DNA damage triggers an abrupt halt to cell cycle progression in which the duration of arrest correlates with the severity of damage. However, cells that have already progressed beyond a proposed \\\"commitment point\\\" within a given cell cycle phase readily transition to the next phase, revealing a relaxation of checkpoint stringency during later stages of certain cell cycle phases. In contrast to G1 and G2, cell cycle progression in S phase is significantly less sensitive to DNA damage. Instead of exhibiting a complete halt, we find that increasing DNA damage doses leads to decreased rates of S-phase progression followed by arrest in the subsequent G2. Moreover, these phase-specific differences in DNA damage checkpoint dynamics are associated with corresponding differences in the proportions of irreversibly arrested cells. Thus, the precise timing of DNA damage determines the sensitivity, rate of cell cycle progression, and functional outcomes for damaged cells. These findings should inform our understanding of cell fate decisions after treatment with common cancer therapeutics such as genotoxins or spindle poisons, which often target cells in a specific cell cycle phase.",

    "abstract": "We report the refinement of a high-throughput, liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based screening method for the identification of covalent small-molecule binders to proteins. Using a custom library of 1600 disulfide-capped fragments targeting surface cysteine residues, we optimize sample preparation, chromatography, and ionization conditions to maximize the reliability and flexibility of the approach. Data collection at a rate of 90 seconds per sample balances speed and reliability for sustained screening over multiple, diverse projects run over a 24-month period. The method is applicable to protein targets of various classes and a range of molecular masses. Data are processed in a custom pipeline that calculates a % bound value for each compound and detects false-positives by calculating significance of detected masses ( signal significance). An example pipeline has been made available through Biovias ScienceCloud Protocol Exchange. Data collection and analysis methods for the screening of covalent adducts of intact proteins are now fast enough to screen the largest covalent compound libraries in 1-2 days.",

    "abstract": "Gram-positive bacteria utilize exported peptides to coordinate genetic and physiological processes required for biofilm formation, stress responses and ecological competitiveness. One example is activation of natural genetic competence by ComR and the comX-inducing peptide (XIP) in Streptococcus mutans. Although the competence pathway can be activated by addition of synthetic XIP in defined medium, the hypothesis that XIP is able to function as an intercellular signal molecule has not been rigorously tested. Co-culture model systems were developed that included a \\\"sender\\\" strain that overexpressed the XIP precursor (ComS) and a \\\"responder\\\" strain harboring a GFP reporter fusion to a ComR-activated gene (comX) promoter. The ability of the sender strain to provide a signal to activate GFP expression was monitored at the individual cell and population levels using i) planktonic culture systems, ii) cells suspended in an agarose matrix or iii) cells growing in biofilms. XIP was shown to be freely diffusible and XIP signaling between the S. mutans sender and responder strains did not require cell-to-cell contact. The presence of a sucrose-derived exopolysaccharide matrix diminished the efficiency of XIP signaling in biofilms, possibly by affecting spatial distribution of XIP senders and potential responders. Intercellular signaling was greatly impaired in a strain lacking the primary autolysin, AtlA, and was substantially greater when the sender strain underwent lysis. Collectively, these data provide evidence that S. mutans XIP can indeed function as a peptide signal between cells and highlight the importance of studying signaling with endogenously-produced peptide(s) in populations in various environments and physiologic states.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe comX-inducing peptide (XIP) of Streptococcus mutans is a key regulatory element in the activation of genetic competence, which allows cells to take up extracellular DNA. XIP has been found in cell culture fluids and addition of synthetic XIP to physiologically receptive cells can robustly induce competence gene expression. However, there is a lack of consensus as to whether XIP can function as an intercellular communication signal. Here, we show that XIP indeed signals between cells in S. mutans, but that cell lysis may be a critical factor, as opposed to a dedicated secretion/processing system, in allowing for release of XIP into the environment. The results have important implications in the context of the ecology, virulence and evolution of a ubiquitous human pathogen and related organisms.",

Compared to full-length MRs, some vertebrate MRs required higher steroid concentrations to activate GAL4-DBD-MR-hinge/LBD constructs. For example, 11-deoxycortisol activated all full-length vertebrate MRs, but did not activate truncated terrestrial vertebrate MRs and was an agonist for truncated zebrafish MR. Progesterone, 19-norProgesterone and spironolactone did not activate full-length and truncated human, alligator and frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs; at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, while retaining activity for truncated zebrafish MRs, evidence that regulation of progestin activation of chicken MR resides in NTD/DBD and of zebrafish MR in hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser810 in human MR, required for its antagonism by progesterone, suggesting novel regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs.

Simultaneously, new developments in targeted agents and immunotherapy, when informed by rich genomic characterization, offer potential benefit to a growing subset of patients. Multiple previous studies have commented on methods for identifying both germline and somatic variants. However, interpreting individual variants remains a significant challenge, relying in large part on the integration of observed variants with biological knowledge. A number of data and software resources have been developed to assist in interpreting observed variants, determining their potential clinical actionability, and augmenting them with ancillary information that can inform clinical decisions and even generate new hypotheses for exploration in the laboratory. Here, we review available variant catalogs, variant and functional annotation software and tools, and databases of clinically actionable variants that can be used in an ad hoc approach with research samples or incorporated into a data platform for interpreting and formally reporting clinical results.",

We identify 5775 novel lncRNAs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, nearly 4-times the previously annotated lncRNAs. Most lncRNAs become derepressed under genetic and physiological perturbations, especially during late meiosis. These lncRNAs are targeted by three RNA-processing pathways: the nuclear exosome, cytoplasmic exonuclease and RNAi, with substantial coordination and redundancy among pathways. We classify lncRNAs into cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), Xrn1-sensitive unstable transcripts (XUTs), and Dicer-sensitive unstable transcripts (DUTs). XUTs and DUTs are enriched for antisense lncRNAs, while CUTs are often bidirectional and actively translated. The cytoplasmic exonuclease and RNAi repress thousands of meiotically induced RNAs. Antisense lncRNA and sense mRNA expression often negatively correlate in the physiological, but not the genetic conditions. Intergenic and bidirectional lncRNAs emerge from nucleosome-depleted regions, upstream of positioned nucleosomes. This broad survey of the S. pombe lncRNA repertoire and characteristics provides a rich resource for functional analyses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly experience symptoms related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. One-third of ASD cases may be complicated by the presence of ADHD. Individuals with dual diagnoses face greater barriers to accessing treatment for ADHD and respond less positively to primary pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic technology-aided tools for hyperactivity and inattention in people with ASD are being developed, although research into their efficacy and safety remains limited.\\n\\nObjectiveThe objective of this preliminary study was to describe the changes in ADHD-related symptoms in children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD after use of the Empowered Brain system, a behavioral and social communication aid for ASD running on augmented reality smartglasses.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited 8 children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD (male to female ratio of 7:1, mean age 15 years, range 11.7-20.5 years) through a Web-based research signup form. The baseline score on the hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC-H), a measure of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, determined their classification into a high ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H [&ge;]13) and a low ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H <13). All participants received an intervention with Empowered Brain, where they used smartglasses-based social communication and behavioral modules while interacting with their caregiver. We then calculated caregiver-reported ABC-H scores at 24 and 48 hours after the session.\\n\\nResultsAll 8 participants were able to complete the intervention session. Postintervention ABC-H scores were lower for most participants at 24 hours (n=6, 75%) and for all participants at 48 hours (n=8, 100%). At 24 hours after the session, average participant ABC-H scores decreased by 54.9% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 20% in the low ADHD symptom group. At 48 hours after the session, ABC-H scores compared with baseline decreased by 56.4% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 66.3% in the low ADHD symptom group.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides initial evidence for the efficacy of the Empowered Brain system in reducing ADHD-related symptoms, such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, in school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD. This digital smartglasses intervention can potentially be targeted at a broader array of mental health conditions that exhibit transdiagnostic attentional and social communication deficits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Further research is required to understand the clinical importance of these observed changes and to conduct longitudinal studies on this intervention with larger sample sizes.",

Tolerability of this wearable technology in people with ASD is an important area for research, especially as these individuals may experience sensory, cognitive, and attentional challenges.\\n\\nAimsThe aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and usability of a novel smartglasses system that has been designed as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism (the Brain Power Autism System; BPAS). BPAS runs on Google Glass Explorer Edition and other smartglasses, utilizes both augmented reality and affective artificial intelligence, and helps users learn key social and emotional skills.\\n\\nMethodTwenty-one children and adults with ASD across a spectrum of severity used BPAS for a coaching session. The users tolerability to the smartglasses was determined through caregiver report, and user being able to wear the smartglasses for one-minute (initial tolerability threshold), and for the entire duration of the coaching session (whole session tolerability threshold).\\n\\nResultsNineteen out of 21 users (90.5%) demonstrated tolerability on all three measures. Caregivers reported 21 out of 21 users (100%) as tolerating the experience, while study staff found only 19 out of 21 users managed to demonstrate initial tolerability (90.5%). Of the 19 users who demonstrated initial tolerability, all 19 were able to use the smartglasses for the entire session (whole session tolerability threshold) (n = 19 of 19, 100%). Caregivers reported that 19 out of 21 users (90.5%) successfully used BPAS, and users surpassed their caregivers expectations in 15 of 21 cases (71.4%). Users who could communicate reported BPAS as being comfortable (94.4%).\\n\\nDiscussionThis preliminary report suggests that BPAS is well tolerated and usable to a diverse age- and severity-range of people with ASD. This is encouraging as these devices are being developed as assistive technologies for people with ASD. Further research should focus on improving smartglasses design and exploring their efficacy in helping with social communication in children and adults with ASD.",

Yet it remains to be investigated whether these functions are temporally segregated; occurring during different behavioural states. During a self-paced spatial task, awake hippocampal replay occurring immediately before movement towards a reward location, or just after arrival at a reward location, preferentially involved cells consistent with the current trajectory. In contrast, during periods of extended immobility, no such biases were evident. Notably, the occurrence of task-focused reactivations predicted the accuracy of subsequent spatial decisions. Additionally, during immobility but not periods preceding or succeeding movement, grid cells in deep layers of entorhinal cortex replayed coherently with the hippocampus. Thus, hippocampal reactivations dynamically and abruptly switch operational mode in response to task demands; plausibly moving from a state favouring navigational planning to one geared towards memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWHigh dimensional single-cell analyses have dramatically improved the ability to resolve complex mixtures of cells from human disease samples; however, identifying disease-associated cell types or cell states in patient samples remains challenging due to technical and inter-individual variation. Here we present Mixed effects modeling of Associations of Single Cells (MASC), a novel reverse single cell association strategy for testing whether case-control status influences the membership of single cells in any of multiple cellular subsets while accounting for technical confounds and biological variation. Applying MASC to mass cytometry analyses of CD4+ T cells from blood of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and controls revealed a significantly expanded population of CD4+ T cells, identified as CD27- HLA-DR+ effector memory cells, in RA patients (OR = 1.7; p = 1.1 x 10-3). The frequency of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells was similarly elevated in blood samples from a second RA patient cohort, and CD27- HLA-DR+ cell frequency decreased in RA patients who respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples from RA patients contained [~]5-fold higher frequencies of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells, which comprised [~]10% of synovial CD4+ T cells.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEqolisins are rare acid proteases found in archaea, bacteria and fungi. Certain fungi secrete acids as part of their lifestyle and interestingly these also have many eqolisin paralogs, up to nine paralogs have been recorded. This suggests functional redundancy and diversification, which was the subject of the research we performed and describe here.\\n\\nResultsWe identified eqolisin homologs by means of iterative HMMER analysis of the NR database. The identified sequences were scrutinized for which we defined novel hallmarks, identified by molecular dynamics simulations of mutants of highly conserved positions, using the structure of an eqolisin that was crystallized in the presence of a transition state inhibitor. Four conserved glycines were shown to be required for functionality. A substitution of W67F is shown to be accompanied by the L105W substitution. Molecular dynamics shows that the W67 binds to the substrate via a {pi}-{pi} stacking and a salt bridge, the latter being stronger in a virtual W67F/L105W double mutant of the resolved structure of Scytalido-carboxyl peptidase-B (PDB ID: 2IFW)). Additional likely fatal mutants are discussed.\\n\\nUpon sequence scrutiny we obtained a set of 233 sequences that in all likelihood lack false positives. This was used to reconstruct a Bayesian phylogenetic tree. We identified 14 putative specificity determining positions (SDPs) of which four are explained by mere structural explanations and nine seem to correspond to functional diversification related wit substrate binding ans specificity. A first sub-network of SDPs is related to substrate specificity whereas the second sub-network seems to affect the dynamics of three loops that are involved in substrate binding.\\n\\nHighlightsEqolisins are acid proteases found in prokaryotes and fungi only.\\n\\nThe recently co-evolved W67F-L105W substitutions promote substrate binding\\n\\nTwo Specificity Determining Networks, SDN1 and 2, were identified\\n\\nSDN1 has four Specificity Determining Positions involved in substrate specificity\\n\\nSDN2 has five Specificity Determining Positions involved in loop-substrate dynamics",

MRI was conducted with a 3.0 T scanner, with six spin-lock times of 0, 10, 20, 25, 35, 50msec and a single breathhold of 12 seconds. Six slices were acquired for each examination.\\n\\nResultsFemale liver T1rho value ranged between 35.07 to 51.97ms, showed an age-dependent decrease with younger women had a higher measurement. Male Liver T1rho values ranged between 34.94 to 43.39 ms, and there was no evidential age-dependence. For females, there was a trend that liver T1rho value could be 4%-5% lower during menstrual phase than nonmenstrual phase. For both females and males, no evidential association was seen between body mass index and liver T1rho.\\n\\nConclusionLiver T1rho physiological value for males have relatively narrow distribution, while physiological value for females have wider distribution, and decreases with age.\\n\\nKey points1. Liver T1rho shows an age-dependency in women, with young women showing higher measurement. This age-dependency of liver T1rho measurement is not evidential in men. Post-menopausal women have similar liver T1rho value as men.\\n\\n2. Women at menstrual phase may have slight lower liver T1rho measurement.\\n\\n3. No association was noted between body mass index and liver T1rho\\n\\n4.

Here we show that EVs released by human primary mast cells or transformed human mast cells (HMC1), carry TGF{beta}-1 on their surface. EV-associated TGF{beta}-1 enhance the migratory activity of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) compared to free TGF{beta}-1, as both knockdown of TGF{beta}, or a TGF{beta}-antibody, attenuate the effect. The MSCs respond by increasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP) activity. Further, EVs given to MSCs are retained in the endosomal compartments at a time of biological function, prolonging EV-associated TGF{beta}-1 signaling vs free TGF{beta}-1. When exposed to EVs, MSCs home more toward allergen-exposed lung in a mouse allergen model, resulting in attenuated allergic inflammation. Our results show that mast cell-EVs are decorated with TGFb-1, are retained in endosomes, which influences both MSC phenotype and function.",

    "abstract": "In cycling human endometrium, menstruation is followed by rapid estrogen-dependent growth. Upon ovulation, progesterone and rising cellular cAMP levels activate the transcription factor Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) in endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs), leading to cell cycle exit and differentiation into decidual cells that control embryo implantation. Here we show that FOXO1 also causes acute senescence of a subpopulation of decidualizing EnSCs in an IL-8 dependent manner. Selective depletion or enrichment of this subpopulation revealed that decidual senescence drives the transient inflammatory response associated with endometrial receptivity. Further, senescent cells prevent differentiation of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells in decidualizing cultures. As the cycle progresses, IL-15 activated uterine natural killer (uNK) cells selectively target and clear senescent decidual cells through granule exocytosis. Our findings reveal that acute decidual senescence governs endometrial rejuvenation and remodeling at embryo implantation, and suggest a critical role for uNK cells in maintaining homeostasis in cycling endometrium.",

    "abstract": "Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling is characterized by strict non-cell autonomy; cells expressing Shh do not respond to their ligand. Here, we identify several Shh mutations that gain the ability to activate the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in cis. This activation requires the extracellular cysteine rich domain of Smoothened, but is otherwise independent of Ptch1/2. Many of the identified mutations disrupt either a highly conserved catalytic motif found in peptidases or an a-helix domain frequently mutated in holoprosencephaly-causing SHH alleles. The expression of gain-of-function mutants often results in the accumulation of unprocessed Shh pro-peptide, a form of Shh we demonstrate is sufficient to activate the Hh response cell-autonomously. Our results demonstrate that Shh is capable of activating the Hh pathway via Smo independently of Ptch1/2, and that it harbors an intrinsic mechanism that prevents cell-autonomous activation of the pathway to favor non-cell autonomous signaling.",

Enterobacter hormaechei and other members of the Enterobacter cloacae complex are the most commonly encountered Enterobacter spp. within clinical settings, responsible for numerous outbreaks and ultimately poorer patient outcomes. Here we applied three complementary whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies to characterise a hospital cluster of blaIMP-4 carbapenemase-producing E. hormaechei.\\n\\nIn response to a suspected CRE outbreak in 2015 within an Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Burns Unit in a Brisbane tertiary referral hospital we used Illumina sequencing to determine that all outbreak isolates were sequence type (ST)90 and near-identical at the core genome level. Comparison to publicly available data unequivocally linked all 10 isolates to a 2013 isolate from the same ward, confirming the hospital environment as the most likely original source of infection in the 2015 cases. No clonal relationship was found to IMP-4-producing isolates identified from other local hospitals. However, using Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing we were able to resolve the complete context of the blaIMP-4 gene, which was found to be on a large IncHI2 plasmid carried by all IMP-4-producing isolates. Continued surveillance of the hospital environment was carried out using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing, which was able to rapidly resolve the true relationship of subsequent isolates to the initial outbreak. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of environmental samples also found evidence of ST90 E. hormaechei and the IncHI2 plasmid within the hospital plumbing.\\n\\nOverall, our strategic application of three WGS technologies provided an in-depth analysis of the outbreak, including the transmission dynamics of a carbapenemase-producing E. hormaechei cluster, identification of possible hospital reservoirs and the full context of blaIMP-4 on a multidrug resistant IncHI2 plasmid that appears to be widely distributed in Australia.",

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains driving this outbreak and the temporal accrual of drug resistance mutations have not been described. We analyzed 100 isolates using whole genome sequencing and found 95 belonged to a single modern Beijing strain cluster. Molecular dating suggested acquisition of streptomycin and isoniazid resistance in the 1960s, with virulence potentially enhanced by a mycP1 mutation. The outbreak cluster demonstrated a high degree of co-resistance between isoniazid and ethionamide (80/95; 84.2%) attributed to an inhA promoter mutation combined with inhA and ndh coding mutations. Multidrug resistance (MDR), observed in 78/95 samples, emerged with the acquisition of a typical rpoB mutation together with a compensatory rpoC mutation in the 1980s. There was independent acquisition of fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside resistance; with evidence of local transmission of extensively-drug resistant (XDR) strains from 2009. These findings underscore the importance of whole-genome sequencing in informing an effective public health response to MDR/XDR M. tuberculosis.",

It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a domain-general resource that is applied to different tasks, or whether self-evaluative processes are domain-specific. Here we directly investigated this issue by examining the neural substrates engaged when metacognitive judgments were made by human participants during perceptual and memory tasks matched for stimulus and performance characteristics. By comparing patterns of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity while subjects evaluated their performance, we revealed both domain-specific and domain-general metacognitive representations. Multi-voxel activity patterns in anterior prefrontal cortex predicted levels of confidence in a domain-specific fashion, whereas domain-general signals predicting confidence and accuracy were found in a widespread network in the frontal and posterior midline. The demonstration of domain-specific metacognitive representations suggests the presence of a content-rich mechanism available to introspection and cognitive control.\\n\\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW O_SCPLOWSTATEMENTC_SCPLOWWe use human neuroimaging to investigate processes supporting memory and perceptual metacognition.

    "abstract": "The ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I ratio) is vital for cortical circuit dynamics, computation, and behavior. This ratio may be under the dynamic control of neuromodulatory systems, which are in turn implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, the catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and noradrenergic) and cholinergic systems have highly specific effects on excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, which might translate into changes in the local net E/I ratio. Here, we assessed and compared their net effects on net E/I ratio in human cortex, through an integrated application of computational modeling, placebo-controlled pharmacological intervention, magnetoencephalographic recordings of cortical activity dynamics, and perceptual psychophysics. We found that catecholamines, but not acetylcholine, altered both the temporal structure of intrinsic activity fluctuations in visual and parietal cortex, and the volatility of perceptual inference based on ambiguous visual input. Both effects indicate that catecholamines increase the net E/I ratio in visual and parietal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods such as decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) are growing rapidly in popularity for the analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. However, little is known about the relative performance and characteristics of the specific dissimilarity measures used to describe differences between evoked activation patterns. Here we used a multisession MEG dataset to qualitatively characterize a range of dissimilarity measures and to quantitatively compare them with respect to classification accuracy (for decoding) and between-session reliability of representational dissimilarity matrices (for RSA). We tested dissimilarity measures from a range of classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis - LDA, Support Vector Machine - SVM, Weighted Robust Distance - WeiRD, Gaussian Naive Bayes - GNB) and distances (Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation). In addition, we evaluated three key processing choices: 1) preprocessing (noise normalisation, removal of the pattern mean), 2) weighting classification accuracies by decision values, and 3) computing distances in three different partitioning schemes (non-cross-validated, cross-validated, within-class-corrected). Four main conclusions emerged from our results. First, multivariate noise normalization dramatically improved classification accuracies and the reliability of dissimilarity measures. Second, LDA, SVM and WeiRD yielded high peak classification accuracies and nearly identical time courses. Third, while using classification accuracies for RSA was markedly less reliable than continuous distances, this disadvantage was ameliorated by decision-value-weighting of classification accuracies. Fourth, the cross-validated Euclidean distance provided unbiased distance estimates and highly replicable representational dissimilarity matrices. Overall, we strongly advice the use of multivariate noise normalisation as a general preprocessing step, recommend LDA, SVM and WeiRD as classifiers for decoding and highlight the cross-validated Euclidean distance as a reliable and unbiased default choice for RSA.",

    "abstract": "Translating heterologous proteins places significant burden on host cells, consuming expression resources leading to slower cell growth and productivity. Yet predicting the cost of protein production for any gene is a major challenge, as multiple processes and factors determine translation efficiency. Here, to enable prediction of the cost of gene expression in bacteria, we describe a standard cell-free lysate assay that determines the relationship between in vivo and cell-free measurements and {gamma}, a relative measure of the resource consumption when a given protein is expressed. When combined with a computational model of translation, this enables prediction of the in vivo burden placed on growing E. coli cells for a variety of proteins of different functions and lengths. Using this approach, we can predict the burden of expressing multigene operons of different designs and differentiate between the fraction of burden related to gene expression compared to action of a metabolic pathway.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=85 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/172627_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (26K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19afa63org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1acafbforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@46443borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12987e3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We developed high-confidence level tripartite networks consisting of phytochemicals - protein targets - disease association and explain the role of its phytochemicals to various chronic diseases. 7 drug-like phytochemicals in this herb were found as the potential regulators of 5 FDA approved drug targets; and 28 novel drug targets were also reported. 105 phytochemicals were linked with immunomodulatory potency by pathway level mapping in human metabolic network. A sub-network of human PPI regulated by its phytochemicals was derived and various modules in this sub-network were successfully associated with specific diseases.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/169763_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1000\\\">\\nView larger version (37K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1254f37org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@73aeb9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d416cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@246ced_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Abbreviations",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle remodeling from fast nuclear cycles to a generic cell cycle mode is a major feature of the mid-blastula transition (MBT) in Drosophila. Remodeling occurs when Twine/Cdc25 falls below a critical threshold. Timing is based on Twine destabilization induced by zygotic transcription. It is conceivable that appropriate starting levels are also important for timely reaching the threshold. Mechanisms for controlling Twine levels at the onset of MBT are unknown. Here we identify a function of the protein phosphatase V in this mechanism. Twine was increased in PpV mutants, whereas the decay rate was comparable to wildtype. PpV mutants frequently underwent an extra nuclear division. We detected PpV-dependent phosphosites in Twine. Phosphosite mutants contain higher Twine levels and frequently underwent an extra nuclear division, comparable to PpV mutants. Our data support a model that the cell cycle remodeling is controlled by induced destabilization and PpV-d ependent control of Twine levels.",

Two control goups of 8 volunteers each receiving DAV132 alone, or a non-active substitute, were added.\\n\\nResultsThe co-administration of DAV132 decreased free moxifloxacin fecal concentrations by 99%, while plasmatic levels were unaffected. Shotgun quantitative metagenomics showed that the richness and composition of the intestinal microbiota were largely preserved in subjects co-treated with DAV132 in addition to moxifloxacin. No adverse effect was observed. In addition, DAV132 efficiently adsorbed a wide range of clinically relevant antibiotics ex-vivo.\\n\\nConclusionsDAV132 was highly effective to protect the gut microbiome of moxifloxacin - treated healthy volunteers and may constitute a clinical breakthrough by preventing adverse health consequences of a wide range of antibiotic treatments.",

In defining target populations, WHO recommend that prior infection with any dengue serotype should be >70% seroprevalence. Here we address considerations for serosurvey design in the context of the newly licensed CYD-TDV vaccine.\\n\\nMethodsTo explore how the design of seroprevalence surveys (age range, survey size) would affect estimates of the force of infection, for every combination of age range, total survey size, transmission setting, and test sensitivity/specificity, 100 age-specific seroprevalence surveys were simulated using a beta-binomial distribution and a simple catalytic model. The transmission intensity was then re-estimated using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm.\\n\\nFindingsSampling from a wide age range led to more accurate estimates than having a larger sample size. This finding was consistent across all transmission settings. The optimal age range to sample from differed by transmission intensity, with younger and older ages being important in high and low transmission settings respectively. The optimum test sensitivity and specificity given an imperfect test also differed by transmission setting with high sensitivity being important in high transmission settings and high specificity important in low transmission settings.\\n\\nConclusionsWhen assessing the suitability for vaccination by seroprevalence surveys, countries should ensure that an appropriate age range is sampled, taking into account epidemiological evidence about the local burden of dengue.",

The prevalence of myopia has risen steadily over recent decades, reaching epidemic levels in Southeast Asia. Observational studies have reported associations between educational attainment and myopia. Whether education causes myopia, myopic children are more intelligent, or another factor, like higher socioeconomic status, causes both is unclear since observational studies are prone to confounding and randomised trials of education are unethical. Using bidirectional Mendelian Randomisation, a form of instrumental variable (IV) analysis free from confounding, we show that every additional year in education leads to an increase in myopic refractive error, but that myopia does not lead to higher educational attainment. Our results suggest that current educational methods contribute to the global burden of myopia, and argue that educational policies and practices should take account of this to reduce future visual disability in the population.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMinimising prescription costs while maintaining quality is a core element of delivering high value healthcare. There are various strategies to achieve savings, but almost no research to date on determining the most effective approach. We describe a new method of identifying potential savings due to large national variations in drug cost, including variation in generic drug cost; and compare these with potential savings from an established method (generic prescribing).\\n\\nMethodsWe used English NHS Digital prescribing data, from October 2015 to September 2016. Potential cost savings were calculated by determining the price-per-unit (e.g. pill, ml) for each drug and dose within each general practice. This was compared against the same cost for the practice at the lowest cost decile, to determine achievable savings. We compared these price-per-unit savings to the savings possible from generic switching; and determined the chemicals with the highest savings nationally. A senior pharmacist manually assessed whether a random sample of savings were practically achievable.\\n\\nResultsWe identified a theoretical maximum of {pound}410M of savings over 12 months. {pound}273M of these savings were for individual prescribing changes worth over {pound}50 per practice per month; this compares favorably with generic switching, where only {pound}35M of achievable savings were identified. The biggest savings nationally were on glucose blood testing reagents ({pound}12M), fluticasone propionate ({pound}9M) and venlafaxine ({pound}8M). Approximately half of all savings were deemed practically achievable.\\n\\nDiscussionWe have developed a new method to identify and enable large potential cost savings within NHS community prescribing. Given the current pressures on the NHS, it is vital that these potential savings are realised. Our tool enabling doctors to achieve these savings is now launched in pilot form.

    "abstract": "The neurobiology investigation of language seems limited by the impossibility to link directly linguistic computations with neural computations. To address this issue, we need to explore the hierarchical interconnections between the investigated fields trying to develop an inter-field theory. Considerable research has realized that event-related fluctuations in rhythmic, oscillatory EEG/MEG activity may provide a new window on the dynamics of functional neuronal networks involved in cognitive processing. Accordingly, this paper aims to outline a formal proposal on neuronal computation and representation of syntactic structures within the oscillatory neuronal dynamics. I briefly present the nature of event-related oscillations and how they work on the base of synchronization and de-synchronization processes. Then, I discuss some theoretical premises assuming that reentrant (hierarchical) properties of synchronized oscillatory rhythms constitute the biological endowment that allow the development of language in humans when exposed to appropriate inputs. The main rhythms involved in language and speech processing are examined: i.e. theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. A possible formal representation of the syntactic structures on the base of these oscillatory rhythms is discussed: in this model, the theta-gamma rhythms are cross-frequency coupled into the alpha-gamma-beta and into the gamma-beta-theta rhythms to generate the sentence along reentrant cortico-thalamic pathways through Merge, Label and Move operations. Finally, I present few conclusive remarks within an evolutionary perspective.\\n\\nO_QD\\\"...The whole burden of philosophy seems to consist in this, from the phenomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and from these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena.\\\" (Newton, 1687/1726)\\n\\nC_QD",

    "abstract": "MotivationCopy number variations (CNVs) are gains and losses of DNA segments and have been associated with disease. Many large-scale genetic association studies are performing CNV analysis using whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). In many of these studies, previous SNP-array data are available. An integrated cross-platform analysis is expected to improve resolution and accuracy, yet there is no tool for effectively combining data from sequencing and array platforms. The detection of CNVs using sequencing data alone can also be further improved by the utilization of allele-specific reads.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a statistical framework, integrated Copy Number Variation detection algorithm (iCNV), which can be applied to multiple study designs: WES only, WGS only, SNP array only, or any combination of SNP and sequencing data. iCNV applies platform specific normalization, utilizes allele specific reads from sequencing and integrates matched NGS and SNP-array data by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We compare integrated two-platform CNV detection using iCNV to naive intersection or union of platforms and show that iCNV increases sensitivity and robustness. We also assess the accuracy of iCNV on WGS data only, and show that the utilization of allele-specific reads improve CNV detection accuracy compared to existing methods.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/zhouzilu/iCNV\\n\\nContactnzh@wharton.upenn.edu, zhouzilu@mail.med.upenn.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Whole chromosome gains or losses (aneuploidy) are a hallmark of ~70% of human tumors. Modeling the consequences of aneuploidy has relied on perturbing spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) components but interpretations of these experiments are clouded by the multiple functions of these proteins. Here we used a Cre recombinase-mediated chromosome loss strategy to individually delete mouse chromosomes 9, 10, 12 or 14 in tetraploid immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts. While the aneuploid cells generally display a growth disadvantage in vitro, they grow significantly better in low adherence sphere-forming conditions and 3 of the 4 lines are transformed in vivo, forming large and invasive tumors in immunocompromised mice. The aneuploid cells display increased chromosomal instability and DNA damage, a mutator phenotype associated with tumorigenesis in vivo. Thus, these studies demonstrate a causative role for whole chromosome loss in tumorigenesis and may shed light on the early consequences of aneuploidy in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Integrator (INT) is a transcriptional regulatory complex associated with RNA polymerase II that is required for the 3-end processing of both UsnRNAs and enhancer RNAs. Integrator subunits 9 (INTS9) and INTS11 constitute the catalytic core of INT and are paralogues of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factors CPSF100 and CPSF73. While CPSF73/100 are known to associate with a third protein called Symplekin, there is no paralog of Symplekin within INT raising the question of how INTS9/11 associate with the other INT subunits. Here, we have identified that INTS4 is a specific and conserved interaction partner of INTS9/11 that does not interact with either subunit individually. Although INTS4 has no significant homology with Symplekin, it possesses N-terminal HEAT repeats similar to Symplekin but also contains a {beta}-sheet rich C-terminal region, both of which are important to bind INTS9/11. We assess three functions of INT including UsnRNA 3-end processing, maintenance of Cajal body integrity, and formation of histone locus bodies to conclude that INTS4/9/11 are the most critical of the INT subunits for UsnRNA biogenesis. Altogether, these results indicate that INTS4/9/11 compose a heterotrimeric complex that likely represents the Integrator  cleavage module responsible for its endonucleolytic activity.",

    "abstract": "Some viruses use phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) to mark membranes used for genome replication or virion assembly. PIP-binding motifs of cellular proteins do not exist in viral proteins. Molecular-docking simulations revealed a putative site of PIP binding to poliovirus (PV) 3C protein that was validated using NMR spectroscopy. The PIP-binding site was located on a highly dynamic -helix that also functions in RNA binding. Broad PIP-binding activity was observed in solution using a fluorescence polarization assay or in the context of a lipid bilayer using an on-chip, fluorescence assay. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 3C protein-membrane interface revealed PIP clustering and perhaps PIP-dependent conformations. PIP clustering was mediated by interaction with residues that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone. We conclude that 3C binding to membranes will be determined by PIP abundance. We suggest that the duality of function observed for 3C may extend to RNA-binding proteins of other viruses.",

DRP1 receptors include the paralogs Mitochondrial Dynamics 49 and 51 (MID49/MID51) and Mitochondrial Fission Factor (MFF), but the mechanisms by which these proteins recruit DRP1 and regulate its activities are unknown. Here we present a cryoEM structure of human, full-length DRP1 bound to MID49 and an analysis of structure- and disease-based mutations. We report that GTP binding allosterically induces a remarkable elongation and rotation of the G-domain, Bundle-Signaling Element (BSE) and connecting hinge loops of DRP1. In this nucleotide-bound conformation, a distributed network of multivalent interactions promotes DRP1 copolymerization into a linear filament with MID49, MID51 or both. Subsequent GTP hydrolysis and exchange within the filament leads to receptor dissociation, shortening through disassembly, and concomitant curling of DRP1 oligomers into closed rings. The dimensions of the closed DRP1 rings are consistent with DRP1-constricted mitochondrial tubules observed in human cells. These structures are the first views of full-length, receptor- and nucleotide-bound dynamin-family GTPases and--in comparison with nucleotide-free crystal structures--teach us how these molecular machines perform mechanical work through nucleotide-driven allostery.",

    "abstract": "Predators have often been shown to have nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) on prey behaviour, but the demographic consequences for prey remain poorly known. This is important to understand because demography influences the impact of a species in its community. We used an intertidal predator-prey system to investigate predator NCEs on prey recruitment, a key demographic process for population persistence. Pelagic mussel larvae are known to avoid waterborne cues from dogwhelks, which prey on intertidal mussels. Through a field experiment done in Atlantic Canada, we manipulated the presence of dogwhelks in intertidal habitats during the mussel recruitment season. We measured mussel recruitment in collectors that could be reached by waterborne dogwhelk cues but not by dogwhelks themselves. We found that the nearby presence of dogwhelks significantly decreased mussel recruit density. A previous study done in the same habitats under the same experimental conditions showed that dogwhelk cues also limit the recruitment of barnacles, another prey item for dogwhelks. However, such NCEs were four times stronger than those observed for mussel recruitment. This difference relates well to the higher ability of mussels to escape predation, as mussels can relocate while barnacles cannot. Therefore, basic features of natural history may be useful to predict predator NCEs on prey recruitment.",

These defects strongly overlap the phenotypes of known genetic syndromes; however, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying DE remain uncertain and there are no definitive tests that distinguish the diagnosis. Here, we explore the potential of DNA methylation as both a diagnostic biomarker and a means of informing disease pathogenesis in DE. Capture-based bisulfite sequencing was used to compare patterns of DNA methylation at 2,800,516 sites genome-wide in seven DE neonates and 11 healthy neonates, including five with in utero diabetes exposure. DE infants had significantly lower global DNA methylation (ANOVA, Tukey HSD p=0.045) than diabetes-unexposed, healthy controls (UH), with multiple sites showing large (mean methylation difference = 16.6%) and significant (p<0.001) differential methylation between the two groups. We found that a subset of 237 highly differentially methylated loci could accurately distinguish DE infants from both UH and diabetes-exposed healthy infants (sensitivity 80% -100%). Differentially methylated sites were enriched in intergenic (p<3.52x10-15) and intronic (p<0.001) regions found proximal to genes either associated with Mendelian syndromes that overlap the DE phenotype (e.g. TRIO, ANKRD11), or known to influence early organ development (e.g. BRAX1, RASA3). Further, by integrating information on cis-sequence variation, we found that 39.3% of loci with evidence for allele-specific methylation also showed differential methylation between DE and controls. Our study suggests a role for aberrant DNA methylation and cis-sequence variation in the pathogenesis of DE, and highlights the diagnostic potential of DNA methylation for teratogenic birth defects.",

    "abstract": "Animal genome engineering experimental procedures involve three major steps: isolation of zygotes from pregnant females; microinjection of zygotes, and; transfer of injected zygotes into recipient females, that have been practiced for over three decades. The laboratory set ups intending to performing these procedures require to have sophisticated equipment as well as highly skilled technical personnel. Because of these reasons, animal transgenesis experiments are typically performed at centralized core facilities in most research organizations. We recently showed that all three steps, of animal transgensis, can be bypassed using a method termed GONAD (Genome-editing via Oviductal Nucleic Acids Delivery), by directly electroporating genome editing components into zygotes in situ. Although our first report demonstrated the genome-editing capability, its efficiency was lower than the standard methods using microinjection. Here we investigated critical parameters of GONAD to make it suitable for creating animal models of large genomic deletions, single nucleotide corrections and long sequence insertions. The efficiency of genome editing in the improved GONAD (i-GONAD) method reached to the levels comparable to traditional microinjection methods. The streamlined parameters, and the simplified experimental steps, in the i-GONAD method makes it suitable for routine genome editing applications performed both at centralized facilities as well as at the laboratories that lack highly skilled personnel and the sophisticated equipment.",

We characterized T-cells infiltrating both breast cancer tumors and the surrounding normal breast tissue to identify T-cells specific to each, as well as their abundance in peripheral blood. Using immune profiling of the T-cell beta chain repertoire in 16 patients with early stage breast cancer, we show that the clonal structure of the tumor is significantly different from adjacent breast tissue, with the tumor containing approximately 3-fold more T-cells, but with a lower fraction of unique sequences and higher clonality compared to normal breast. The clonal structure of T-cells in blood and normal breast is more similar than between blood and tumor and can be used to distinguish tumor from normal breast tissue in 14 of 16 patients. Many T-cells overlap between tissues from the same patient, including approximately 50% of T-cells between tumor and normal breast. Both solid tissues contain high-abundance \"enriched\" sequences that are absent or of low abundance in the other tissue. Many of these T-cells are either not detected or detected with very low frequency in the blood, suggesting the existence of separate compartments of T-cells in both tumor and normal breast. Enriched T-cell sequences are typically unique to each patient, but there is a subset of sequences that are shared between many different patients.

The triheme c-type cytochrome PgcA exists in the extracellular space of G. sulfurreducens, and is one of many multiheme c-type cytochromes known to be loosely bound to the bacterial outer surface. Deletion of pgcA using a markerless method resulted in mutants unable to transfer electrons to Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides; yet the same mutants maintained the ability to respire electrode surfaces and soluble Fe(III) citrate. When expressed and purified from Shewanella oneidensis, PgcA demonstrated a primarily alpha helical structure, three bound hemes, and was processed into a shorter 41 kDa form lacking the lipodomain. Purified PgcA bound Fe(III) oxides, but not magnetite, and when PgcA was added to cell suspensions of G. sulfurreducens, PgcA accelerated Fe(III) reduction similar to addition of FMN. Addition of soluble PgcA to {triangleup}pgcA mutants also restored Fe(III) reduction. This report highlights a distinction between proteins involved in extracellular electron transfer to metal oxides and poised electrodes, and suggests a specific role for PgcA in facilitating electron transfer at mineral surfaces.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe development of CRISPR genome editing has transformed biomedical research. Most applications reported thus far rely upon the Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes SF370 (SpyCas9). With many RNA guides, wild-type SpyCas9 can induce significant levels of unintended mutations at near-cognate sites, necessitating substantial efforts toward the development of strategies to minimize off-target activity. Although the genome-editing potential of thousands of other Cas9 orthologs remains largely untapped, it is not known how many will require similarly extensive engineering to achieve single-site accuracy within large (e.g. mammalian) genomes. In addition to its off-targeting propensity, SpyCas9 is encoded by a relatively large (~4.2 kb) open reading frame, limiting its utility in applications that require size-restricted delivery strategies such as adeno-associated virus vectors. In contrast, some genome-editing-validated Cas9 orthologs (e.g. from Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Neisseria meningitidis) are considerably smaller and therefore better suited for viral delivery.\\n\\nResultsHere we show that wild-type NmeCas9, when programmed with guide sequences of natural length (24 nucleotides), exhibits a nearly complete absence of unintended editing in human cells, even when targeting sites that are prone to off-target activity with wildtype SpyCas9. We also validate at least six variant protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs), in addition to the preferred consensus PAM (5-N4GATT-3), for NmeCas9 genome editing in human cells.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results show that NmeCas9 is a naturally high-fidelity genome editing enzyme and suggest that additional Cas9 orthologs may prove to exhibit similarly high accuracy, even without extensive engineering.",

    "abstract": "2Sex differences exist in behaviours, disease and neuropsychiatric disorders. Sexual dimorphisms however, have yet to be studied across the whole brain and across a comprehensive time course of postnatal development. We used manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to longitudinally image male and female C57BL/6J mice across 9 time points, beginning at postnatal day 3. We recapitulated findings on canonically dimorphic areas, demonstrating the ability of MEMRI to study neuroanatomical sex differences. We discovered, upon whole-brain volume correction, that neuroanatomical regions larger in males develop early in life, while regions larger in females develop in peripubertal life. Furthermore, we found groups of areas with shared sexually dimorphic developmental trajectories that reflect behavioural and functional networks, and expression of genes involved with sex processes. Our results demonstrate the ability of MEMRI to reveal comprehensive developmental differences between male and female brains, which will improve our understanding of sex-specific predispositions to various neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "How mosquitoes determine which individuals to bite has important epidemiological consequences. This choice is not random; most mosquitoes specialize in one or a few vertebrate host species, and some individuals in a host population are preferred over others. Here we show that aversive olfactory learning contributes to mosquito preference both between and within host species. Combined electrophysiological and behavioural recordings from tethered flying mosquitoes demonstrated that these odours evoke changes in both behaviour and antennal lobe (AL) neuronal responses. Using electrophysiological and behavioural approaches, and CRISPR gene editing, we demonstrate that dopamine plays a critical role in aversive olfactory learning and modulating odour-evoked responses in AL neurons. Collectively, these results provide the first experimental evidence that olfactory learning in mosquitoes can play an epidemiological role.",

    "abstract": "Despite being a fundamental dimension of experience, how the human brain generates the perception of time remains unknown. Here, we provide a novel explanation for how human time perception might be accomplished, based on non-temporal perceptual clas-sification processes. To demonstrate this proposal, we built an artificial neural system centred on a feed-forward image classification network, functionally similar to human visual processing. In this system, input videos of natural scenes drive changes in network activation, and accumulation of salient changes in activation are used to estimate duration. Estimates produced by this system match human reports made about the same videos, replicating key qualitative biases, including differentiating between scenes of walking around a busy city or sitting in a cafe or office. Our approach provides a working model of duration perception from stimulus to estimation and presents a new direction for examining the foundations of this central aspect of human experience.",

    "abstract": "RationaleA reduced effect of a given dose of {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) emerges with repeated exposure to the drug. This tolerance can vary depending on THC dose, exposure chronicity and the behavioral or physiological measure of interest. A novel THC inhalation system based on e-cigarette technology has been recently shown to produce the hypothermic and antinociceptive effects of THC in rats.\\n\\nObjectiveTo determine if tolerance to these effects can be produced with repeated vapor inhalation.\\n\\nMethodsGroups of male and female Wistar rats were exposed to 30 minutes of inhalation of the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle or THC (200 mg/mL in PG) two or three times per day for four days. Rectal temperature changes and nociception were assessed after the first exposure on the first and fourth days of repeated inhalation.\\n\\nResultsFemale, but not male, rats developed tolerance to the hypothermic and antinociceptive effects of THC after four days of twice-daily THC vapor inhalation. Thrice daily inhalation for four days resulted in tolerance in both male and female rats. The plasma THC levels reached after a 30 minute inhalation session did not differ between the male and female rats.\\n\\nConclusionsRepeated daily THC inhalation induces tolerance in female and male rats, providing further validation of the vapor inhalation method for preclinical studies.\\n\\nAbbreviationsPG, propylene glycol; THC; {Delta}9tetrahydrocannabinol;",

    "abstract": "Standard human EEG systems based on spatial Nyquist estimates suggest that 20-30 mm electrode spacing suffices to capture neural signals on the scalp, but recent studies posit that increasing sensor density can provide higher resolution neural information. Here, we compared \\\"super-Nyquist\\\" density EEG (\\\"SND\\\") with Nyquist density (\\\"ND\\\") arrays for assessing the spatiotemporal aspects of early visual processing. EEG was measured from 128 electrodes arranged over occipitotemporal brain regions (14 mm spacing) while participants viewed flickering checkerboard stimuli. Analyses compared SND with ND-equivalent subsets of the same electrodes. Frequency-tagged stimuli were classified more accurately with SND than ND arrays in both the time and the frequency domains. Representational similarity analysis revealed that a computational model of V1 correlated more highly with the SND than the ND array. Overall, SND EEG captured more neural information from visual cortex, arguing for increased development of this approach in basic and translational neuroscience.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Neurons throughout the sensory pathway are tuned to specific aspects of stimuli. This selectivity is shaped by feedforward and recurrent excitatory-inhibitory interactions. In the auditory cortex (AC), two large classes of interneurons, parvalbumin- (PVs) and somatostatin- positive (SOMs) interneurons, differentially modulate frequency-dependent responses across the frequency response function of excitatory neurons. At the same time, the responsiveness of neurons in AC to sounds is dependent on the temporal context, with the majority of neurons exhibiting adaptation to repeated sounds. Here, we asked whether and how inhibitory neurons shape the frequency response function of excitatory neurons as a function of adaptation to temporal repetition of tones. The effects of suppressing both SOMs and PVs diverged for responses to preferred versus non-preferred frequencies following adaptation. Prior to adaptation, suppressing either SOM or PV inhibition drove both increases and decreases in spiking activity among cortical neurons. After adaptation, suppressing SOM activity caused predominantly disinhibitory effects, whereas suppressing PV activity still evoked bi-directional changes. SOM, but not PV-driven inhibition dynamically modulated frequency tuning as a function of adaptation. Additionally, testing across frequency tuning revealed that, unlike PVs, SOM-driven inhibition exhibited gain-like increases reflective of adaptation. Our findings suggest that distinct cortical interneurons differentially shape tuning to sensory stimuli across the neuronal receptive field, maintaining frequency selectivity of excitatory neurons during adaptation.",
