    "abstract": "Lesion and functional neuroimaging evidence suggest that local network deficits can be compensated by global network over-recruitment during a cognitive task. However, the neural mechanisms linking local and global network changes remain uncertain. To investigate this issue, we manipulated local function using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and measured structural and task-based functional network organization during memory encoding. The study yielded two main findings. First, consistent with the compensation hypothesis, 1-Hz rTMS attenuated local activity in the stimulated left prefrontal cortex (PFC) but increased the connectivity of this region with other brain areas, including contralateral PFC. Second, this 1-Hz related increase in global connectivity effects was associated with the volume of more global connections, suggesting white-matter constraints adaptive changes in functional connectivity. Taken together, these results clarify the neural mechanisms linking local and global network changes and the role of structural connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Neurons extend processes that vary in number, length, and direction of outgrowth. Extracellular cues help determine outgrowth patterns. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neurons respond to the extracellular UNC-6 (netrin) cue via UNC-40 (DCC) and UNC-5 (UNC5) receptors. Previously we presented evidence that UNC-40 asymmetric localization at the plasma membrane is self-organizing and that UNC-40 can localize and mediate outgrowth at randomly selected sites. We also postulate that the process is statistically dependent, i.e. if the probability of outgrowth at one site changes then the probability at another site(s) must also change. Over time, the direction of outgrowth activity fluctuates across the membrane. A probability distribution describes the likelihood of outgrowth in each direction. Random walk modeling predicts that the degree to which the direction of outgrowth fluctuations affects the outward displacement of the membrane. We predict that extracellular cues create patterns of outgrowth by differentially affecting the degree to which the direction of outgrowth activity fluctuates along the membrane. This produces different rates of outgrowth along the surface and creates patterns of extension. Here we present evidence that UNC-5 (UNC5) receptor activity regulates UNC-40 asymmetric localization and the patterning of outgrowth. We show that unc-5 mutations alter UNC-40 asymmetric localization and the patterns of outgrowth that neurons develop. Genetic interactions suggest UNC-5 acts through the UNC-53 (NAV2) cytoplasmic protein to regulate UNC-40 asymmetric localization in response to both the UNC-6 and EGL-20 (wnt) extracellular cues.",

    "abstract": "Whole cell responses arise from coordinated interactions between diverse human gene products functioning within various pathways underlying sub-cellular processes (SCP). Lower level SCPs interact to form higher level SCPs, often in a context specific manner to give rise to whole cell function. We sought to determine if capturing such relationships enables us to describe the emergence of whole cell functions from interacting SCPs. We developed the \\\"Molecular Biology of the Cell\\\" ontology based on standard cell biology and biochemistry textbooks and review articles. Currently, our ontology contains 5,392 genes, 753 SCPs and 19,182 expertly curated gene-SCP associations. Our algorithm to populate the SCPs with genes enables extension of the ontology on demand and the adaption of the ontology to the continuously growing cell biological knowledge. Since whole cell responses most often arise from the coordinated activity of multiple SCPs, we developed a dynamic enrichment algorithm that flexibly predicts SCP-SCP relationships beyond the current taxonomy. This algorithm enables us to identify interactions between SCPs as a basis for higher order function in a context dependent manner, allowing us to provide a detailed description of how SCPs together can give rise to whole cell functions. We conclude that this ontology can, from omics data sets, enable the development of detailed multidimensional SCP networks for predictive modeling of emergent whole cell functions.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of forensic autosomal DNA profiles was controversial, but the problems were successfully addressed, and DNA profiling has gone on to revolutionise forensic science. Y-chromosome profiles are valuable when there is a mixture of male-source and female-source DNA, and interest centres on the identity of the male source(s) of the DNA. The problem of evaluating evidential weight is even more challenging for Y profiles than for autosomal profiles. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but they fail to deal adequately with the fact that men with matching Y-profiles are re-lated in extended patrilineal clans, many of which may not be represented in available databases. This problem has been exacerbated by recent profiling kits with high mutation rates. Because the relevant population is difficult to define, yet the number of matching relatives is fixed as population size varies, it is typically infeasible to derive population-based match probabilities relevant to a specific crime. We propose a conceptually simple solution, based on a simulation model and software to approximate the distribution of the number of males with a matching Y profile. We show that this distribution is robust to different values for the variance in reproductive success and the population growth rate. We also use importance sampling reweighting to derive the distribution of the number of matching males conditional on a database frequency, finding that this conditioning typically has only a modest impact. We illustrate the use of our approach to quantify the value of Y profile evidence for a court in a way that is both scientifically valid and easily comprehensible by a judge or juror.",

    "abstract": "Lipid accumulation within the lumen of endolysosomal vesicles is observed in various pathologies including atherosclerosis, liver disease, neurological disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, and cancer. Current methods cannot measure lipid flux specifically within the lysosomal lumen of live cells. We developed an optical reporter, composed of a photoluminescent carbon nanotube of a single chirality, which responds to lipid accumulation via modulation of the nanotubes optical bandgap. The engineered nanomaterial, composed of short-single stranded DNA and a single nanotube chirality, localizes exclusively to the lumen of endolysosomal organelles without adversely affecting cell viability or proliferation, or organelle morphology, integrity, or function. The emission wavelength of the reporter can be spatially resolved from within the endolysosomal lumen to generate quantitative maps of lipid content in live cells. Endolysosomal lipid accumulation in cell lines, an example of drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL), was observed for multiple drugs in macrophages, and measurements of patient-derived Niemann-Pick type C fibroblasts identified lipid accumulation and phenotypic reversal of this lysosomal storage disease. Single-cell measurements using the reporter discerned sub-cellular differences in equilibrium lipid content, illuminating significant intracellular heterogeneity among endolysosomal organelles of differentiating bone marrow-derived monocytes. Single-cell kinetics of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol accumulation within macrophages revealed rates that differed among cells by an order of magnitude. This carbon nanotube optical reporter of endolysosomal lipid content in live cells confers new capabilities for drug development processes and the investigation of lipid-linked diseases.",

Most genes involved in stress response have been identified using mutant screens or gene knockdowns. Yet, there is limited understanding of the temporal dynamics of global gene expression in stressful environments. Here, we studied global gene expression profiles during 12 hours of heat stress in the nematode C. elegans. Using a high-resolution time series of increasing stress exposures, we found a distinct shift in gene expression patterns between 3-4 hours into the stress response, separating an initially highly dynamic phase from a later relatively stagnant phase. This turning point in expression dynamics coincided with a phenotypic turning point, as shown by a strong decrease in movement, survival and, progeny count in the days following the stress. Both detectable at transcriptional and phenotypic level, this study pin-points a relatively small time frame during heat stress at which enough damage is accumulated, making it impossible to recover the next few days.",

Much of the immense present day biological diversity of Neotropical rainforests originated from the Miocene onwards, a period of geological and ecological upheaval in South America. We assess the impact of the Andean orogeny, drainage of lake Pebas, and closure of the Panama Isthmus on two clades of trees (Cremastosperma, c. 31 spp.; and Mosannona, c. 14 spp.; both Annonaceae) found in humid forest distributed across the transition zones between the Andes and Western (lowland) Amazonia and between Central and South America. We inferred phylogenies based on c. 80% of recognised species of each clade using plastid and nuclear encoded sequence markers, revealing similar patterns of geographically restricted clades. Using molecular dating we showed that diversifications in the different areas occurred in parallel, with timing consistent with Andean vicariance and Central American geodispersal. In apparent contradiction of high dispersal abilities of rainforest trees, Cremastosperma clades within Amazonia are also geographically restricted, with a southern/montane clade that appears to have diversified along the foothills of the Andes sister to one of more northern/lowland species that diversified in a region once inundated by lake Pebas. Ecological niche modelling approaches show phylogenetically conserved niche differentiation, particularly within Cremastosperma. Niche similarity and recent common ancestry of Amazon and Guianan Mosannona species contrasts with dissimilar niches and more distant ancestry of Amazon, Venezuelan and Guianan species of Cremastosperma suggesting that this element of the similar patterns of disjunct distributions in the two genera is instead a biogeographic parallelism, with differing origins. The results provide further independent evidence for the importance of the Andean orogeny, the drainage of Lake Pebas, and the formation of links between South and Central America in the evolutionary history of Neotropical lowland rainforest trees.",

    "abstract": "Changes in spatial chromatin interactions are now emerging as a unifying mechanism or-chestrating regulation of gene expression. Evolution of chromatin conformation capture methods into Hi-C sequencing technology now allows an insight into chromatin interactions on a genome-wide scale. However, Hi-C data contains many DNA sequence- and technology-driven biases. These biases prevent effective comparison of chromatin interactions aimed at identifying genomic regions differentially interacting between, disease-normal states or different cell types. Several methods have been developed for normalizing individual Hi-C datasets. However, they fail to account for biases between two or more Hi-C datasets, hindering comparative analysis of chromatin interactions. We developed a simple and effective method HiCcompare for the joint normalization and differential analysis of multiple Hi-C datasets. The method avoids constraining Hi-C data within a rigid statistical model, allowing a data-driven normalization of biases using locally weighted linear regression (loess). The method identifies region-specific chromatin interaction changes complementary to changes due to large-scale genomic rearrangements, such as copy number variants (CNVs). HiCcompare outperforms methods for normalizing individual Hi-C datasets in detecting a priori known chromatin interaction differences in simulated and real-life settings while detecting biologically relevant changes. HiCcompare is freely available as a Bioconductor R package https://bioconductor.org/packages/HiCcompare/.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAdvances in chromosome conformation capture sequencing technologies (Hi-C) have sparked interest in studying the 3-dimensional (3D) chromatin interaction structure of the human genome. The 3D structure of the genome is now considered as a primary regulator of gene expression. Changes to the 3D chromatin interactions are now emerging as a hallmark of cancer and other complex diseases. With the growing availability of Hi-C data generated under different conditions (e.g. tumor-normal, cell-type-specific), methods are needed to compare them. However, biases in Hi-C data hinder their comparative analysis. To account for biases, several normalization techniques have been developed for removing biases in individual Hi-C datasets, but very few were designed to account for between-datasets biases. We developed a new method and R package HiCcompare for the joint normalization of multiple Hi-C datasets and differential chromatin interaction detection. Our results show the superiority of our joint normalization methods compared to methods for normalizing individual datasets in detecting true chromatin interaction changes. HiCcompare enables further research into discovering the dynamics of 3D genomic changes.",

    "abstract": "The limitation of plasticity in the adult brain impedes functional recovery later in life from brain injury or disease. This pressing clinical issue may be resolved by enhancing plasticity in the adult brain. One strategy for triggering robust plasticity in adulthood is to reproduce one of the hallmark physiological events of experience-dependent plasticity observed during the juvenile critical period - rapidly reduce the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons and disinhibit local excitatory neurons. This may be achieved through enhancement of local inhibitory inputs, particularly those of somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons. However, to date the means for manipulating SST interneurons for enhancing cortical plasticity in the adult brain are not known. We show that SST interneuron-selective overexpression of Lypd6, an endogenous nicotinic signaling modulator, enhances ocular dominance plasticity in the adult primary visual cortex (V1). Lypd6 overexpression mediates a rapid experience-dependent increase in the visually evoked activity of SST interneurons as well as a simultaneous reduction in PV interneuron activity and disinhibition of excitatory neurons. Recapitulating this transient activation of SST interneurons using chemogenetics similarly enhanced V1 plasticity. Notably, we show that SST-selective Lypd6 overexpression restores visual acuity in amblyopic mice that underwent early long-term monocular deprivation. Our data in both male and female mice reveal selective modulation of SST interneurons and a putative downstream circuit mechanism as an effective method for enhancing experience-dependent cortical plasticity as well as functional recovery in adulthood.\n\nSignificance StatementThe decline of cortical plasticity after closure of juvenile critical period consolidates neural circuits and behavior, but this limits functional recovery from brain diseases and dysfunctions in later life. Here we show that activation of cortical SST interneurons by Lypd6, an endogenous modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), enhances experience-dependent plasticity and recovery from amblyopia in adulthood. This manipulation triggers rapid reduction of PV interneuron activity and disinhibition of excitatory neurons, which are known hallmarks of cortical plasticity during juvenile critical periods. Our study demonstrates modulation of SST interneurons by Lypd6 to achieve robust levels of cortical plasticity in the adult brain and may provide promising targets for restoring brain function in the event of brain trauma or disease.",

    "abstract": "During cytokinesis, an equatorial actomyosin contractile ring constricts at a relatively constant overall rate despite its progressively decreasing size. Thus, the per-unit-length rate of ring closure increases as ring perimeter decreases. To understand this acceleration, we monitored cortical surface and ring component dynamics during the first division of the C. elegans embryo. We show that the polar cortex expands during ring constriction to provide the cortical surface area required for division. Polar expansion also allows ring myosin to compress cortical surface along the pole-to-pole axis, leading to a continuous flow of cortical surface into the ring. We propose that feedback between ring myosin and compression-driven cortical flow drives an exponential increase in the amount of ring myosin that maintains the high overall closure rate as ring perimeter decreases. We further show that an analytical mathematical formulation of the proposed feedback, called the Compression Feedback model, recapitulates the experimental observations.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTDuring cytokinesis, positive feedback between myosin motors in the contractile ring and compression-driven cortical flow along the axis perpendicular to the ring drives constriction rate acceleration to ensure timely cell separation.\\n\\nMAJOR SUBJECT AREASCell biology, Computational and Systems Biology",

    "abstract": "The non-invasive detection of cancer mutations is a breakthrough in oncology. Here, we applied whole-exome sequencing of matched germline and basal plasma cell-free DNA samples (WES-cfDNA) on a RAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patient with primary resistance to standard treatment regimens including VEGFR inhibitors. Using WES-cfDNA, we could detect 73% (54/74) of the somatic mutations uncovered by WES-tumor including a variety of mutation types: frameshift (indels), missense, noncoding (splicing), and nonsense mutations. Additionally, WES-cfDNA discovered 14 high-confidence somatic mutations not identified by WES-tumor. Importantly, in the absence of the tumor specimen, WES-cfDNA could identify 68 of the 88 (77.3%) total mutations that could be identified by both techniques. Of tumor biology relevance, we identified the novel KDR/VEGFR2 L840F somatic mutation, which we showed was a clonal mutation event in this tumor. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo functional assays confirmed that L840F causes strong resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs, whereas the KDR/VEGFR2 hot-spot mutant R1032Q confers sensitivity to cabozantinib. Moreover, we found a 1-3% of recurrent KDR somatic mutations across large and non-overlapping cancer sequencing projects, and the majority of these mutations were located in protein residues frequently mutated in other cancer-relevant kinases, such as EGFR, ABL1, and ALK, suggesting a functional role.\\n\\nIn summary, the current study highlights the capability of exomic sequencing of cfDNA from plasma of cancer patients as a powerful platform for somatic landscape analysis and discovery of resistance-associated cancer mutations. Because of its advantage to generate results highly concordant to those of tumor sequencing without the hurdle of conventional tumor biopsies, we anticipate that WES-cfDNA will become frequently used in oncology. Moreover, our study identified for the first-time KDR/VEGFR2 somatic mutations as potential genetic biomarkers of response to anti-angiogenic cancer therapies and will serve as reference for further studies on the topic.",

    "abstract": "Our purpose was to test the within-subject repeatability of the perfusion fraction, diffusion coefficient and pseudo diffusion coefficient measurements in various fetal organs and in the placenta based on the intra-voxel incoherent motion imaging principle. In utero diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 1.5T and 3.0T clinical scanners with b-factors ranging from 0 to 900 s/mm2 in 16 steps and a tetrahedral diffusion-weighting encoding scheme. Data from 16 pregnant women (maternal age: 34 {+/-} 4.9 years, range: 24.6 -40.8) were included in this pilot study. For 15 cases, IVIM was repeated (maternal age: 33.7 {+/-} 5.2 years, range: 24.6 - 40.8). A bi-exponential model was fitted on the volume-averaged diffusion values and the perfusion fraction (f), diffusion coefficient (d) and pseudo diffusion coefficient (D*) were calculated. Within-subject repeatability was given as the test-retest variability of the IVIM parameters in the fetal frontal cortex, frontal white matter, cerebellum, lungs, kidneys, liver and in the placenta. An in-house developed image processing script was utilized to remove the image frames with excessive motion, and to perform motion correction by using non-linear freeform deformations. For the fetal lungs, liver and the placenta, within-subject variability ranged from 14.4% to 20.4% for f, 12.2% to 14.1% for d and 16.8% to 25.3% for D*. The diffusion coefficients of the investigated brain regions were moderately to highly reproducible (4.8% to 15.2%), however, f and D* showed inferior reproducibility compared to corresponding measures derived for the lungs, liver and placenta. The IVIM-based parameters of the fetal kidney were revealed to be highly variable across scans. Our results indicate that in utero intra-voxel incoherent motion magnetic resonance imaging potentially provides a novel method for examining microvascular perfusion and diffusion in the developing human fetus. The reproducible quantification of the perfusion and diffusion parameters depend greatly upon data quality, fetal and maternal movements, and image post processing to detect and remove corrupted data before calculating the IVIM model.",

Here, we develop two in vitro assays for the interaction of ETS transcription factors with DNA that are amenable for high throughput screening. Using ETS1 as a model, these assays were applied to screen 110 compounds derived from a high-throughput virtual screen. We find that the use of lower affinity DNA-binding sequences, similar to those which ERG and ETV1 bind to in prostate cells, allowed for higher inhibition from many of these test compounds. Further pilot experiments demonstrated that the in vitro assays are robust for ERG, ETV1, and ETV5, three of the ETS transcription factors that are overexpressed in prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Tumor tissues are chronically exposed to hypoxia owing to aberrant vascularity. Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation is a hallmark of hypoxic cancer cells, yet how LDs form and function during hypoxia remains poorly understood. Herein, we report that in various cancer cells upon oxygen deprivation, HIF-1 activation down-modulates LD catabolism mediated by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the key enzyme for intracellular lipolysis. Proteomics and functional analyses identified hypoxia-inducible gene 2 (HIG2), a HIF-1 target, as a new inhibitor of ATGL. Knockout of HIG2 enhanced LD breakdown and fatty acid (FA) oxidation, leading to increased ROS production and apoptosis in hypoxic cancer cells as well as impaired growth of tumor xenografts. All of these effects were reversed by co-ablation of ATGL. Thus, by inhibiting ATGL, HIG2 acts downstream of HIF-1 to sequester FAs in LDs away from the mitochondrial pathways for oxidation and ROS generation, thereby sustaining cancer cell survival in hypoxia.",

Here we describe a high-throughput deep transfer learning method that first predicts MP contacts by learning from non-membrane proteins (non-MPs) and then predicting three-dimensional structure models using the predicted contacts as distance restraints. Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs, our method has contact prediction accuracy at least 0.18 better than existing methods, predicts correct folds for 218 MPs (TMscore>0.6), and generates three-dimensional models with RMSD less than 4[A] and 5[A] for 57 and 108 MPs, respectively. A rigorous blind test in the continuous automated model evaluation (CAMEO) project shows that our method predicted high-resolution three-dimensional models for two recent test MPs of 210 residues with RMSD [~]2[A]. We estimated that our method could predict correct folds for 1,345-1,871 reviewed human multi-pass MPs including a few hundred new folds, which shall facilitate the discovery of drugs targeting at membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Here we present the results of protein contact prediction achieved in CASP12 by our RaptorX-Contact server, which is an early implementation of our deep learning method for contact prediction. On a set of 38 free-modeling target domains with a median family size of around 58 effective sequences, our server obtained an average top L/5 long- and medium-range contact accuracy of 47% and 44%, respectively (L=length). A more advanced implementation has an average accuracy of 59% and 57%, respectively. Our deep learning method formulates contact prediction as an image pixel-level labeling problem and simultaneously predicts all residue pairs of a protein using a combination of two deep residual neural networks, taking as input the residue conservation information, predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility, contact potential, and co-evolution information. Our approach differs from existing methods mainly in (1) formulating contact prediction as a pixel-level image labeling problem instead of an image-level classification problem; (2) simultaneously predicting all contacts of an individual protein to make effective use of contact occurrence patterns; and (3) integrating both 1D and 2D deep convolutional neural networks to effectively learn complex sequence-structure relationship including high-order residue correlation. This paper discusses the RaptorX-Contact pipeline, both contact prediction and contact-based folding results, and finally the strength and weakness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Scientific studies report crucial impacts of biomechanical effectors to modulate wound healing either by scarring or regeneration. Further, the biological decision to predominantly favor the former is still cryptic. Real-time visualization of biomechanical manifestations in situ in scarring is hence necessary. Endorsed by nanostructural testing, synthetic phantom analysis, and computational simulations, we found strong mechanobiological correlates for Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) speckles in mice cutaneous repair (full-thickness) up to 10 months. The theoretical basis of the optomechanics to provide insights into scar form-factor and evolution is proposed. Optomechanical changes have been considered as the resultant of intrinsic (e.g. fiber elastic modulus) and gross tissue mechanics (extracellular matrix (ECM)) in maturing scars. Non-invasive optomechanics supported with microscopic findings reveal scars cross-sectional self-organizing di-fork architecture. Dual-compartment heterogeneity of di-fork exhibits stress-evading features with a dichotomy in inhabitant cellular stress-fiber distributions. This differential interactivity of scar with adjoining tissues reflects its architectural intelligence to compensate tissue loss (hypodermis/muscle) by assembling into a di-fork. Gradual establishment of baseline shifted lasting mechanobiological steady-state, later in scarring, expose scar as an alternate stable state within the skin.\n\nSignificance StatementWound repair in mammals, predominantly culminates into function compromising scar that is occasionally fatal in vital organs. How the biological system often adopts scarring over a restorative regeneration is yet a conundrum. Wound and ambient mechanics play a pivotal role in deciding the healing fate. SS-OCT is hence demonstrated here as a non-invasive window to such mechanical manifestations during skin wound healing. This exposed gradual emergence of temporally maintained and stress-resilient di-fork architecture of the scar with differential neighborhood interfaces. Accommodation of such an alternate self-organizing steady-state of scar sheds light on its sustenance and paradoxical selection.",

In a quantitative microtubule (MT) gliding assay with yeast cytoplasmic dynein, we investigate the nature of this coupling by examining the effect of MT length and motor density on transport. We find speed and velocity have a length dependence for low motor numbers, but are independent of MT length for high motor densities. The dependence of speed, velocity and degree of randomness of MT transport is best understood when evaluated in terms of the numbers of motors bound to a filament. A model of collective transport of MTs, based on stochastic stepping and asymmetric detachment rates, reproduces the experimental trends of decreasing diffusivity with increasing number of motors. Additionally, the model predicts a  switch-like increase in directionality of MT transport above a threshold number of motors. Such a rapid transition from random to directed motility with increasing numbers of yeast dyneins, could play a role in vivo during mitosis in the  search and orientation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Many human diseases have an underlying genetic component. The development and application of methods to prevent the inheritance of damaging mutations through the human germline could have significant health benefits, and currently include preimplantation genetic diagnosis and carrier screening. Ma et al. take this a step further by attempting to remove a disease mutation from the human germline through gene editing1. They assert the following advances: (i) the correction of a pathogenic gene mutation responsible for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9 and (ii) the avoidance of mosaicism in edited embryos. In the case of correction, the authors conclude that repair using the homologous chromosome was as or more frequent than mutagenic nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Their conclusion is significant, if validated, because such a \\\"self-repair\\\" mechanism would allow gene correction without the introduction of a repair template. While the authors analyses relied on the failure to detect mutant alleles, here we suggest approaches to provide direct evidence for inter-homologue recombination and discuss other events consistent with the data. We also review the biological constraints on inter-homologue recombination in the early embryo.",

    "abstract": "Pathogens are a driving force in evolution, giving rise to a diversity of host immune defenses. In order for a pathogen to spread in a population a sufficient number of its members must be susceptible to infection, as resistant individuals can prevent the spread of a pathogen among susceptible hosts in a process known as herd immunity. While herd immunity has been extensively studied in vertebrate populations, little is known about its role, if any, in the dynamics between bacteria and their phage pathogens. Here we explore the dynamics of T7 phage epidemics in structured and unstructured Escherichia coli populations consisting of differing mixtures of susceptible and resistant individuals harboring CRISPR immunity to the phage. Using both experiments and mathematical modelling we describe the conditions under which herd immunity arises in bacterial populations. Notably, the effects of herd immunity depend strongly on the presence of spatial structure in the population, the bacterial growth rate, and phage replication rate. The results of our model can apply to other host-pathogen systems to determine the herd immunity threshold from the relative speed of an epidemic wave in partially resistant populations. In addition, our findings suggest that herd immunity plays an important role in bacterial communities, as seen in other host-pathogen systems, allowing for stable coexistence of bacteria and their phages and the maintenance of polymorphism in bacterial immunity.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent staining is a common tool for both quantitative and qualitative assessment of pro- and eukaryotic cells sub-population fractions by using microscopy and flow cytometry. However, direct cell counting by flow cytometry is often limited, for example when working with cells rigidly adhered either to each other or to external surfaces like bacterial biofilms or adherent cell lines and tissue samples. An alternative approach is provided by using fluorescent microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which enables the evaluation of fractions of cells subpopulations in a given sample. For the quantitative assessment of cell fractions in microphotographs, we suggest a simple two-step algorithm that combines single cells selection and the statistical analysis. To facilitate the first step, we suggest a simple procedure that supports finding the balance between the detection threshold and the typical size of single cells based on objective cell size distribution analysis. Based on a series of experimental measurements performed on bacterial and eukaryotic cells under various conditions, we show explicitly that the suggested approach effectively accounts for the fractions of different cell sub-populations (like the live/dead staining in our samples) in all studied cases that are in good agreement with manual cell counting on microphotographs and flow cytometry data. This algorithm is implemented as a simple software tool that includes an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for the initial adjustment of algorithm parameters to the microphotographs analysis as well as for the sequential analysis of homogeneous series of similar microscopic images without further user intervention.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls this cognitive flexibility; however, the detailed underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent developments in machine learning techniques have allowed simple recurrent neural network PFC models to perform human- or animal-like behavioral tasks. These systems allow us to acquire parameters, which we could not in biological experiments, for performing the tasks. We compared four models, in which a flexible cognition task, called context-dependent integration task, was performed; subsequently, we searched for common features. In all the models, we observed that high plastic synapses were concentrated in the small neuronal population and the more concentrated neuronal units contributed further to the performance. However, there were no common properties in the constructed structures. These results suggest that plastic changes can be more general and important to accomplish cognitive tasks than features of the constructed structures.",

We aim to provide a systematic comparison between these two approaches, on both temporal and topological levels.\\n\\nFor this purpose, we used resting-state fMRI data from two separate cohorts with different temporal resolutions (45 healthy subjects from Human Connectome Project fMRI data with repetition time of 0.72 s and 25 healthy subjects from a separate validation fMRI dataset with a repetition time of 3 s). For time-resolved functional connectivity analysis, we calculated tapered CSWA over a wide range of different window lengths that were temporally and topologically compared to IPSA.\\n\\nWe found a strong association in connectivity dynamics between IPSA and CSWA when considering the absolute values of CSWA. This association peaked at a CSWA window length of [~]20 seconds, irrespective of the sampling rate of the underlying fMRI data. Narrow-band filtering of fMRI data (0.03-0.07 Hz) yielded a stronger relationship between IPSA and CSWA than wider-band (0.01-0.1 Hz). On a topological level, time-averaged IPSA and CSWA nodes were non-linearly correlated, mainly because nodes with strong negative correlations (CSWA) displayed high phase synchrony (IPSA).\\n\\nOur results suggest that IPSA and CSWA provide comparable characterizations of time-resolved fMRI connectivity for appropriately chosen window lengths. Although IPSA requires narrow-band fMRI filtering, we recommend the use of IPSA given that it does not mandate a (semi-)arbitrary choice of window length and window overlap. A MATLAB code for calculating IPSA is provided.",

    "abstract": "The study of fluctuations in time-resolved functional connectivity is a topic of substantial current interest. As the term \\\"dynamic functional connectivity\\\" implies, such fluctuations are believed to arise from dynamics in the neuronal systems generating these signals. While considerable activity currently attends to methodological and statistical issues regarding dynamic functional connectivity, less attention has been paid toward its candidate causes. Here, we review candidate scenarios for dynamic (functional) connectivity that arise in dynamical systems with two or more subsystems; generalized synchronization, itinerancy (a form of metastability), and multistability. Each of these scenarios arise under different configurations of local dynamics and inter-system coupling: We show how they generate time series data with nonlinear and/or non-stationary multivariate statistics. The key issue is that time series generated by coupled nonlinear systems contain a richer temporal structure than matched multivariate (linear) stochastic processes. In turn, this temporal structure yields many of the phenomena proposed as important to large-scale communication and computation in the brain, such as phase-amplitude coupling, complexity and flexibility. The code for simulating these dynamics is available in a freeware software platform, the \\\"Brain Dynamics Toolbox\\\".",

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue in evolutionary systems biology is understanding the relationship between the topological architecture of a biological network, such as a metabolic network, and the evolution of the network. The rate at which an element in a metabolic network accumulates genetic variation via new mutations depends on both the size of the mutational target it presents and its robustness to mutational perturbation. Quantifying the relationship between topological properties of network elements and the mutability of those elements will facilitate understanding the variation in and evolution of networks at the level of populations and higher taxa.\\n\\nWe report an investigation into the relationship between two topological properties of 29 metabolites in the C. elegans metabolic network and the sensitivity of those metabolites to the cumulative effects of spontaneous mutation. The relationship between several measures of network centrality and sensitivity to mutation is weak, but point estimates of the correlation between network centrality and mutational variance are positive, with only one exception. There is a marginally significant correlation between core number and mutational heritability. There is a small but significant negative correlation between the shortest path length between a pair of metabolites and the mutational correlation between those metabolites.\\n\\nPositive association between the centrality of a metabolite and its mutational heritability is consistent with centrally-positioned metabolites presenting a larger mutational target than peripheral ones, and is inconsistent with centrality conferring mutational robustness, at least in toto. The weakness of the correlation between shortest path length and the mutational correlation between pairs of metabolites suggests that network locality is an important but not overwhelming factor governing mutational pleiotropy. These findings provide necessary background against which the effects of other evolutionary forces, most importantly natural selection, can be interpreted.",

    "abstract": "Everyday existence and survival of most organisms requires coping with temperature changes, which involves gene regulatory networks both as subjects and agents of cellular protection. Yet, how temperature affects gene network function remains unclear, partly because natural gene networks are complex and incompletely characterized. Here, we study how heating and cooling affect the function of single genes and well-characterized synthetic gene circuits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found nontrivial, nonmonotone temperature-dependent gene expression trends at non-growth-optimal temperatures. In addition, heating caused unusual bimodality in the negative-feedback gene circuit expression and shifts upward the bimodal regime for the positive feedback gene circuit. Mathematical models incorporating temperature-dependent growth rates and Arrhenius scaling of reaction rates captured the effects of cooling, but not those of heating. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that heating alters the conformational dynamics and allows DNA-binding of the TetR transcriptional repressor, fully explaining the experimental results for the negative-feedback gene circuit. Overall, we uncover how temperature shifts may corrupt gene networks, which may aid future designs of temperature-robust synthetic gene circuits.",

    "abstract": "The large, plant-specific protein GIGANTEA (GI) is involved in many physiological processes, mediating rhythmic, post-translational regulation in part through circadian and light regulation of GI RNA expression. GI binds several proteins implicated in the circadian clock, the control of photoperiodic flowering, and abiotic stress responses, and has co-chaperone activity. By extension, further interaction partners might mediate the less well-understood roles of GI but the number and rhythmicity of these interactors is unknown. Here, we seek potential interactors in a time-specific manner, using quantitative proteomics from a time series study of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants constitutively expressing an epitope-tagged GI protein. Previously-identified, direct and indirect interactors of GI were detected but no further F-box proteins related to known GI partners ZTL/FKF1/LKP2. The predominantly non-rhythmic, interacting proteins were implicated in protein folding or degradation, metabolism and chromatin modification, including a small set of partners shared with other clock-related proteins. A transcription factor homologue that we name CYCLING DOF FACTOR 6 (CDF6) was shown to interact both with GI and the ZTL/FKF1/LKP2 proteins and to control photoperiodic flowering. Our results indicate the biochemical pathways, beyond circadian and flowering regulation, that might be affected by GIGANTEAs rhythmic, post-translational control.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSignificance statement of up to two sentences of no more than 75 words total;\\n\\nThe GIGANTEA protein of Arabidopsis was known for circadian and flowering functions, mediated by the FKF1/LKP2/ZTL family of GI-interacting, F-box proteins, then for a co-chaperone activity of unknown scope. We performed time-resolved, interaction proteomics, identifying CDF6 (At1g26790) as a morning-specific GI interactor that controls flowering time. Unlike FKF1 and CDF proteins, most of the 240 candidate partners were not rhythmically enriched. They link GI to proteostasis and metabolic functions that might mediate GIs physiological functions.",

Here, we sought a model to interrogate human immune behavior in vivo. We determined that primary human monocytes and macrophages survive in zebrafish for up to two weeks. Flow cytometry revealed that human monocytes cultured at the physiological temperature of the zebrafish survive and differentiate comparable to cohorts cultured at human physiological temperature. Moreover, key genes that encode for proteins that play a role in tissue remodeling were also expressed. Human cells migrated within multiple tissues at speeds comparable to zebrafish macrophages. Analysis of gene expression of in vivo educated human macrophages confirmed expression of activated macrophage phenotypes. Here, human cells adopted phenotypes relevant to cancer progression, suggesting that we can define the real time immune modulation of human tumor cells during the establishment of a metastatic lesion in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "We propose a model to explain the spontaneous collective migration of neural crest cells in the absence of an external gradient of chemoattractants. The model is based on the dynamical interaction between Rac1 and RhoA that is known to regulate the polarization, contact inhibition and co-attraction of neural crest cells. Coupling the reaction-diffusion equations for active and inactive Rac1 and RhoA on the cell membrane with a mechanical model for the overdamped motion of membrane vertices, we show that co-attraction and contact inhibition cooperate to produce persistence of polarity in a cluster of neural crest cells by suppressing the random onset of Rac1 hotspots that may mature into new protrusion fronts. This produces persistent directional migration of cell clusters in corridors. Our model confirms a prior hypothesis that co-attraction and contact inhibition are key to spontaneous collective migration, and provides an explanation of their cooperative working mechanism in terms of Rho GTPase signaling. The model shows that the spontaneous migration is more robust for larger clusters, and is most efficient in a corridor of optimal confinement.",
