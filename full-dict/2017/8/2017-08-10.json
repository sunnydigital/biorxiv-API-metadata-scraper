    "abstract": "Local adaptation is often studied via 1) multiple common garden experiments comparing performance of genotypes in different environments and 2) sequencing genotypes from multiple locations and characterizing geographic patterns in allele frequency. Both approaches aim to characterize the same pattern (local adaptation), yet the complementary information from each has not yet been coherently integrated. Here, we develop a genome-wide association model of genotype interactions with continuous environmental gradients (GxE), i.e. reaction norms. We present an approach to impute relative fitness, allowing us to coherently synthesize evidence from common garden and genome-environment associations. Our approach identifies loci exhibiting environmental clines where alleles are associated with higher fitness in home environments. Simulations show our approach can increase power to detect loci causing local adaptation. In a case study on Arabidopsis thaliana, most identified SNPs exhibited home allele advantage and fitness tradeoffs along climate gradients, suggesting selective gradients can maintain allelic clines. SNPs exhibiting GxE associations with fitness were enriched in genic regions, putative partial selective sweeps, and associations with an adaptive phenotype (flowering time plasticity). We discuss extensions for situations where only adaptive phenotypes other than fitness are available. Many types of data may point toward the loci underlying GxE and local adaptation; coherent models of diverse data provide a principled basis for synthesis.",

    "abstract": "In storing and transmitting epigenetic information, organisms must balance the need to maintain information about past conditions with the capacity to respond to information in their current and future environments. Some of this information is encoded by DNA methylation, which can be transmitted with variable fidelity from parent to daughter strand. High fidelity confers strong pattern matching between the strands of individual DNA molecules and thus pattern stability over rounds of DNA replication; lower fidelity confers reduced pattern matching, and thus greater flexibility. * Here, we present a new conceptual framework, Ratio of Concordance Preference (RCP), that uses double-stranded methylation data to quantify the flexibility and stability of the system that gave rise to a given set of patterns. * We find that differentiated mammalian cells operate with high DNA methylation stability, consistent with earlier reports. Stem cells in culture and in embryos, in contrast, operate with reduced, albeit significant, methylation stability. We conclude that preference for concordant DNA methylation is a consistent mode of information transfer, and thus provides epigenetic stability across cell divisions, even in stem cells and those undergoing developmental transitions. Broader application of our RCP framework will permit comparison of epigenetic-information systems across cells, developmental stages, and organisms whose methylation machineries differ substantially or are not yet well understood.",

    "abstract": "In reported microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations, fast-folding proteins CLN025 and Trp-cage autonomously folded to experimentally determined native conformations. However, the folding times of these proteins derived from the simulations were more than 4-10 times longer than their experimental values. This article reports autonomous folding of CLN025 and Trp-cage in isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics simulations with agreements within factors of 0.69-1.75 between simulated and experimental folding times at different temperatures. These results show that CLN025 and Trp-cage can now autonomously fold in silico as fast as in experiments, and suggest that the accuracy of folding simulations for fast-folding proteins begins to overlap with the accuracy of folding experiments. This opens new prospects of developing computer algorithms that can predict both ensembles of conformations and their interconversion rates for a protein from its sequence for artificial intelligence on how and when a protein acts as a receiver, switch, and relay to facilitate various subcellular-to-tissue communications. Then the genetic information that encodes proteins can be better read in the context of intricate biological functions.",

Deregulation of innate fear processing is thought to underlie pathological phenotypes including, phobias and panic disorders. Although central processing of conditioned fear has been extensively studied, the circuitry and regulatory mechanisms subserving innate fear remain relatively poorly defined.\\n\\nIn this study, we identify cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) neuropeptide signalling in the central amygdala (CeA) - ventral bed nucleus of stria terminalis (vBNST) axis as a key modulator of innate fear expression. TMT, a component of fox faeces, induces a freezing response whose intensity is regulated by the extent of CART-signalling in the CeA neurons. Abrogation of CART activity in the CeA attenuates the freezing response and reduces activation of vBNST neurons. Conversely, ectopically elevated CART signalling in the CeA potentiates the fear response concomitant with enhanced vBNST activation. We show that local levels of CART signaling modulate the activation of CeA neurons by NMDA receptor mediated glutamatergic inputs, in turn, regulating activity in the vBNST.\\n\\nThis study identifies the extended amygdalar CeA-vBNST circuit as a CART modulated axis encoding innate fear.

    "abstract": "Research has not yet reached a consensus on why humans match probabilities instead of maximise in a probability learning task. The most influential explanation is that they search for patterns in the random sequence of outcomes. Other explanations, such as expectation matching, are plausible, but do not consider how reinforcement learning shapes peoples choices.\\n\\nWe aimed to quantify how human performance in a probability learning task is affected by pattern search and reinforcement learning. We collected behavioural data from 84 young adult participants who performed a probability learning task wherein the majority outcome was rewarded with 0.7 probability, and analysed the data using a reinforcement learning model that searches for patterns. Model simulations indicated that pattern search, exploration, recency (discounting early experiences), and forgetting may impair performance.\\n\\nOur analysis estimated that 85% (95% HDI [76, 94]) of participants searched for patterns and believed that each trial outcome depended on one or two previous ones. The estimated impact of pattern search on performance was, however, only 6%, while those of exploration and recency were 19% and 13% respectively. This suggests that probability matching is caused by uncertainty about how outcomes are generated, which leads to pattern search, exploration, and recency.",

Whilst bioinformatics analyses, studies of cells, animal models and applied genetic epidemiology have provided some understanding of genetic associations or causal pathways, there is a need for new genetic studies that elucidate causal relationships and mechanisms in a cost-effective, precise and statistically efficient fashion. We discuss the motivation for and the characteristics of the Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) study design, an approach that enables genotype-directed deep-phenotyping and improvement in drawing causal inferences. Specifically, we present RbG designs using single and multiple variants and discuss the inferential properties, analytical approaches and applications of both. We consider the efficiency of the RbG approach, the likely value of RbG studies for the causal investigation of disease aetiology and the practicalities of incorporating genotypic data into population studies in the context of the RbG study design. Finally, we provide a catalogue of the UK-based resources for such studies, an online tool to aid the design of new RbG studies and discuss future developments of this approach.",

    "abstract": "A gene drive biases inheritance of a gene so that it increases in frequency within a population even when the gene confers no fitness benefit. There has been renewed interest in environmental releases of engineered gene drives due to recent proof of principle experiments with the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a drive mechanism. Release of modified organisms, however, is controversial, especially when the drive mechanism could theoretically alter all individuals of a species. Thus, it is desirable to have countermeasures to reverse a drive if a problem arises. Several genetic mechanisms for limiting or eliminating gene drives have been proposed and/or developed, including synthetic resistance, reversal drives, and immunizing reversal drives. While predictions about efficacy of these mechanisms have been optimistic, we lack detailed analyses of their expected dynamics. We develop a discrete time model for population genetics of a drive and proposed genetic countermeasures. Efficacy of drive reversal varies between countermeasures. For some parameter values, the model predicts unexpected behavior including polymorphic equilibria and oscillatory dynamics. The timing and number of released individuals containing a genetic countermeasure can substantially impact outcomes. The choice among countermeasures by researchers and regulators will depend on specific goals and population parameters of target populations.",

    "abstract": "Thermal breadth, the range of body temperatures over which organisms perform well, and thermal acclimation, the ability to alter optimal performance temperature and critical thermal maximum or minimum with changing temperatures, reflect the capacity of organisms to respond to temperature variability and are thus crucial traits for coping with climate change. Although there are theoretical frameworks for predicting thermal breadths and acclimation, the predictions of these models have not been tested across taxa, latitudes, body sizes, traits, habitats, and methodological factors. Here, we address this knowledge gap using simulation modeling and empirical analyses of >2,000 acclimation strengths from >500 species using four datasets of ectotherms. After accounting for important statistical interactions, covariates, and experimental artifacts, we reveal that i) acclimation rate scales positively with body size contributing to a negative association between body size and thermal breadth across species and ii) acclimation capacity increases with body size, seasonality, and latitude (to mid-latitudinal regions) and is regularly underestimated for most organisms. Contrary to suggestions that plasticity theory and empirical work on thermal acclimation are incongruent, these findings are consistent with theory on phenotypic plasticity. We further validated our framework by demonstrating that it could predict global extinction risk to amphibian biodiversity from climate change.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) severity and altered in late stage disease. However, it is unclear how gut microbial communities change over the course of IBD development, especially in regards to function. To investigate microbiome mediated disease mechanisms and discover early biomarkers of IBD, we conducted a longitudinal metagenomic investigation in an established mouse model of IBD, where dampened TGF-{beta} signaling in T cells leads to peripheral immune activation, weight loss, and severe colitis. IBD development is associated with abnormal gut microbiome temporal dynamics, including dampened acquisition of functional diversity and significant differences in abundance trajectories for KEGG modules such as glycosaminoglycan degradation, cellular chemotaxis, and type III and IV secretion systems. Most differences between sick and control mice emerge when mice begin to lose weight and heightened T cell activation is detected in peripheral blood. However, lipooligosaccharide transporter abundance diverges prior to immune activation, indicating that it could be a pre-disease indicator or microbiome-mediated disease mechanism. Taxonomic structure of the gut microbiome also significantly changes in association with IBD development, and the abundance of particular taxa, including several species of Bacteroides, correlate with immune activation. These discoveries were enabled by our use of generalized linear mixed effects models to test for differences in longitudinal profiles between healthy and diseased mice while accounting for the distributions of taxon and gene counts in metagenomic data. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal metagenomics is useful for discovering potential mechanisms through which the gut microbiome becomes altered in IBD.\\n\\nImportanceIBD patients harbor distinct microbial communities with different functional capabilities compared to healthy people. But is this cause or effect? Answering this question requires data on changes in gut microbial communities leading up to disease onset. By performing weekly metagenomic sequencing and mixed effects modeling on an established mouse model of IBD, we identified several functional pathways encoded by the gut microbiome that covary with host immune status. These pathways are novel early biomarkers that may either enable microbes to live inside an inflamed gut or contribute to immune activation in IBD mice. Future work will validate the potential roles of these microbial pathways in host-microbe interactions and human disease. This study is novel in its longitudinal design and focus on microbial pathways, which provided new mechanistic insights into the role of gut microbes in IBD development.",

Here, we examine how conflict deriving from objective and subjective value characteristics of stocks, as well as the behavioural and phenomenological correlates of decision conflict, are accompanied by variation in a thus far understudied ERP component, the conflict negativity (CN). In a novel EEG paradigm (N = 53), we simulated a financial decision situation in which participants made incentivized choices between different, sometimes conflicting, stock options. Our results indicate that participants become slower, more undecided, and less pleased, when choosing between similar options compared to choices in which one option clearly outweighs the other. This effect even held when participants chose between two objectively good alternatives. We further provide preliminary evidence that the CN, a negative-going ERP recorded over the medial prefrontal cortex, is not only sensitive to decision conflict, but also predicts behavioural indecision. What is more, subjective value characteristics of stocks, impressions based on brand perception of the stock options, modestly influenced affective and behavioural reactions over and above objective stock characteristics. While our results are at odds with assumptions made by classic economic theory, they may serve as one out of several indicators as to why private investors seem to avoid financial decisions.",

This set was used to train, develop, and evaluate a non-neural classifier, support vector machine (SVM), in comparisons to two neural network models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and neural attention model (NAM) Inter-rater agreement was computed using kappa statistics. Accuracy, receiver operated curves, and area under the curve were calculated and tabulated. P-values < 0.05 was significant and 95% confidence intervals were computed.\\n\\nResultsRadiologist agreement was 86-94% and Cohens kappa was 0.667-0.762 (substantial agreement). Accuracies of the CNN and NAM (range 0.90-0.94) were higher than SVM (range 0.88-0.92). NAM showed relatively equal accuracy with CNN for three classes, severity, mass effect, and hydrocephalus, higher accuracy for the acute bleed class, and lower accuracy for the acute stroke class.

    "abstract": "The core promoter recognition TFIID complex acts as a central regulator for eukaryotic gene expression. To direct transcription initiation, TFIID binds the core promoter DNA and aids recruitment of the transcription machinery (e.g., RNA polymerase II) to the transcription start site. Many transcription factors target TFIID to control vital cellular processes. Current studies on finding TFIID interactors have predominantly focused on transcription factors. Yet, a comprehensive interactome of mammalian TFIID has not been established. Therefore, this study sought to reveal potential TFIID-nucleated networks by identifying likely co-regulatory factors that bind TFIID. By using intact native human TFIID complexes, we have exploited three independent approaches including a high-throughput Next Generation DNA sequencing coupled with proteomic analysis. Among these methods, we found some overlapping and new candidates in which we further assessed three putative interactors (i.e., Sox2, H2A and EMSY) by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Notably, in addition to known TFIID interactors, we identified a number of novel factors that participate either in co-regulatory pathways or non-transcription related functions of TFIID. Overal, these results indicate that, in addition to transcription initiation, mammalian TFIID may be involved in broader regulatory pathways than previous studies suggested.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional bursting involves genes rapidly switching between active and inactive states. Chromatin remodelers actively target arrays of acetylated nucleosomes at select enhancers and promoters to facilitate or shut down the repeated recruitment of RNA Pol II during transcriptional bursting. It is unknown how acetylated chromatin is dynamically targeted and regulated by chromatin remodelers such as PBAF. Thus, we sought to understand how PBAF targets acetylated chromatin using live-cell single molecule fluorescence microscopy. Our work reveals chromatin hubs throughout the nucleus where PBAF rapidly cycles on and off the genome. Deletion of PBAFs bromodomains impairs targeting, stable engagement and persistent binding on chromatin in hubs. Interestingly, PBAF has a higher probability to stably engage chromatin inside hubs indicating that hubs contain a unique nucleosomal scaffold compared to global chromatin. Dual color imaging of PBAF in hubs near H3.3 or HP1 reveals that PBAF targets both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions with distinct genome binding kinetics that mimic chromatin stability. Removal of PBAFs bromodomains stabilizes H3.3 and HP1 binding within chromatin indicating that bromodomains may play a direct role in remodeling of the nucleosome. Our data, suggests that PBAF differentially and dynamically engages a variety of chromatin structures involved in both activation and repression of transcription via bromodomains. Furthermore, PBAFs binding stability on chromatin may reflect the chromatin remodeling potential of different bound chromatin states.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTranscriptional bursting involves a gene rapidly switching between transcriptionally active and inactive states. To regulate transcriptional bursting, chromatin must interchange between euchromatin and heterochromatin to permit or restrict access of transcription factors including RNA Polymerase II to enhancer and gene promoters. However, little is known regarding how chromatin remodelers dynamically read a rapidly changing 4D epigenome. We used live-cell single molecule imaging to characterize the spatiotemporal chromatin binding dynamics of PBAF, a chromatin remodeler that accesses both euchromatin and heterochromatin to regulate transcription. PBAF cycles on and off chromatin hubs in select nuclear regions where it distinctly engages euchromatin and heterochromatin via bromodomains in its BAF180 subunit. Our study provides the framework to understand how the 4D epigenome is regulated.",

    "abstract": "The loading of small RNA (sRNA) into Argonaute (AGO) complexes is a crucial step in all regulatory pathways identified so far in plants that depend on such non-coding sequences. Important transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms can be activated depending on the specific AGO protein to which sRNA bind. It is known that sRNA-AGO associations are at least partly encoded in the sRNA primary structure, but the sequence features that drive this association have not been fully explored. Here we train support vector machines (SVM) on sRNA sequencing data obtained from AGO-immunoprecipitation experiments to identify features that determine sRNA affinity to specific AGOs. Our SVM reveal that AGO affinity is strongly determined by complex k-mers in the 5 and 3 ends of sRNA, in addition to well-known features such as sRNA length and the base composition of the first nucleotide. Moreover, we find that these k-mers tend to overlap known transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, thus highlighting a close interplay between TF and sRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation. We embedded the learned SVM in a computational pipeline that can be used for de novo functional classification of sRNA sequences.

    "abstract": "With the emergence of zebrafish as an important model organism, a concerted effort has been made to study its transcriptome. This effort is limited, however, by gaps in zebrafish annotation, which are especially pronounced concerning transcripts dynamically expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). To date, short read sequencing has been the principal technology for zebrafish transcriptome annotation. In part because these sequence reads are too short for assembly methods to resolve the full complexity of the transcriptome, the current annotation is rudimentary. By providing direct observation of full-length transcripts, recently refined long-read sequencing platforms can dramatically improve annotation coverage and accuracy. Here, we leveraged the SMRT platform to study transcriptome of zebrafish embryos before and after ZGA. Our analysis revealed additional novelty and complexity in the zebrafish transcriptome, identifying 2748 high confidence novel transcripts that originated from previously unannotated loci and 1835 high confidence new isoforms in previously annotated genes. We validated these findings using a suite of computational approaches including structural prediction, sequence homology and functional conservation analyses, as well as by confirmatory transcript quantification with short-read sequencing data. Our analyses provided insight into new homologs and paralogs of functionally important proteins and non-coding RNAs, isoform switching occurrences and different classes of novel splicing events. Several novel isoforms representing distinct splicing events were validated through PCR experiments, including the discovery and validation of a novel 8 kb transcript spanning multiple miR-430 elements, an important driver of early development. Our study provides a significantly improved zebrafish transcriptome annotation resource.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of DNA samples is an important tool in forensics, and the speed of analysis can impact investigations. Comparison of DNA sequences is based on the analysis of short tandem repeats (STRs), which are short DNA sequences of 2-5 base pairs. Current forensics approaches use 20 STR loci for analysis. The use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has utility for analysis of complex DNA mixtures. The use of tens of thousands of SNPs loci for analysis poses significant computational challenges because the forensic analysis scales by the product of the loci count and number of DNA samples to be analyzed. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a DNA sequence comparison algorithm by re-casting the algorithm in terms of linear algebra primitives. By developing an overloaded matrix multiplication approach to DNA comparisons, we can leverage advances in GPU hardware and algoithms for dense matrix multiplication (DGEMM) to speed up DNA sample comparisons. We show that it is possible to compare 2048 unknown DNA samples with 20 million known samples in under 6 seconds using a NVIDIA K80 GPU.",

    "abstract": "Many diseases whose frequency increases with advancing age are caused by aging (senescence), but the mechanisms of senescence remain poorly understood. According to G.C. Williams and M.V. Blagosklonny, a major etiological determinant of senescence is late-life, wild-type gene action and non-adaptive execution of biological programs (or quasi-programs). These generate a wide range of senescent pathologies causing illness and death. Here we investigate the etiology of a prominent senescent pathology in the nematode C. elegans, uterine tumors, in the light of the Williams Blagosklonny theory. Uterine tumors develop from unfertilized, immature oocytes which execute incomplete embryogenetic programs. This includes extensive endomitosis, leading to formation of chromatin masses and cellular hypertrophy. The starting point of pathogenesis is exhaustion of sperm stocks. The timing of this transition between program and quasi-program can be altered by blocking sperm production (causing earlier tumors) or supplying additional sperm by mating (delaying tumor onset). Other pathophysiological determinants are yolk consumption by tumors, and bacterial proliferation within tumors. Uterine tumors resemble mammalian ovarian teratomas (tera, Greek: monster) in that both develop from oocytes that fail to mature after meiosis I, and both are the result of quasi-programs. Moreover, older but not younger uterine tumors show expression of markers of later embryogenesis, i.e. are teratoma-like. These results show how uterine tumors in C. elegans form as the result of run-on of embryogenetic quasi-programs. They also suggest fundamental etiological equivalence between teratoma and some forms of senescent pathology, insofar as both are caused by quasi-programs.",

We introduce the General Heterogeneous evolution On a Single Topology (GHOST) model of sequence evolution, implemented under a maximum-likelihood framework in the phylogenetic program IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org). Simulations show that using the GHOST model, IQ-TREE can accurately recover the tree topology, branch lengths and substitution model parameters from heterotachously-evolved sequences. We develop a model selection algorithm based on simulation results, and investigate the performance of the GHOST model on empirical data by sampling phylogenomic alignments of varying lengths from a plastome alignment. We then carry out inference under the GHOST model on a phylogenomic dataset composed of 248 genes from 16 taxa, where we find the GHOST model concurs with the currently accepted view, placing turtles as a sister lineage of archosaurs, in contrast to results obtained using traditional variable rates-across-sites models. Finally, we apply the model to a dataset composed of a sodium channel gene of 11 fish taxa, finding that the GHOST model is able to infer a subtle component of the historical signal, linked to the previously established convergent evolution of the electric organ in two geographically distinct lineages of electric fish. We compare inference under the GHOST model to partitioning by codon position and show that, owing to the minimization of model constraints, the GHOST model is able to offer unique biological insights when applied to empirical data.",

    "abstract": "During primary infection, neurotropic alphaherpesviruses (HVs) gain access to neurons in sensory and cranial ganglia establishing lifelong latent infection from which they can later reactivate to cause debilitating disease1. For most HVs, including the best-studied herpes simplex type 1 ( HSV-1), viral latency is characterized by expression of a single or restricted set of transcripts that map antisense to the open reading frame (ORF) homologous to the major HSV immediate early viral transactivator, ICP02. These latency transcripts, either directly or through encoded miRNAs or proteins, repress expression of the ICP0 orthologues3-5. The exception is varicella-zoster virus (VZV), an HV which infects over 90% of adults and for which neither a canonical latency transcript1,6-8 nor a putative mechanism for repressing lytic transcription during latency have been identified. Here, we describe the discovery and functional characterization of a VZV latency transcript (VLT), that maps antisense to VZV ORF 61 (the VZV ICP0 homologue9,10), and which is consistently expressed in neurons of latently infected human trigeminal ganglia (TG). VLT encodes a protein with late kinetics during lytic VZV infection in vitro and in zoster skin lesions. Whereas multiple alternatively spliced VLT isoforms are expressed during lytic VZV infection, a single unique VLT isoform that specifically suppresses ORF61 gene expression predominates in latently VZV-infected human TG. The discovery of VLT directly unifies the latent VZV transcription program with those of better-characterized HVs, removing longstanding barriers to understanding VZV latency and paving the way for research into the development of vaccines that do not establish latency or reactivate, and drugs that eradicate latent VZV.",

Here we demonstrate that the knockdown of endogenous CBF-1 in latently infected primary CD4+ T cells, using specific small hairpin RNAs (shRNA), resulted in the reactivation of latent HIV proviruses. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using latently infected primary T cells and Jurkat T-cell lines demonstrated that CBF-1 induces the establishment and maintenance of HIV latency by recruiting Polycomb Group (PcG/PRC) corepressor complexes or Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). Knockdown of CBF-1 resulted in the dissociation of PRCs corepressor complexes enhancing the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) at HIV LTR. Knockdown of certain components of PRC1 and PRC2 also led to the reactivation of latent proviruses. Similarly, treatment of latently infected primary CD4+ T cells with the EZH2 inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), led to their reactivation.",

Here we show that the rate of mutations introduced by POLD1* is elevated by 50%, while the rate of POLE*-induced mutations is decreased twofold, within one kilobase from replication origins. These results support a model in which POLD1 replicates both the leading and the lagging strands within a kilobase from an origin. The magnitude of the mutational bias suggests that the probability of an individual origin to initiate replication exceeds 50%, which is much higher than previous estimates. Using additional data from nascent DNA sequencing and Okazaki fragments sequencing (OK-seq) experiments, we showed that a majority of origins are firing at each replication round, but the initiated replication fork does not propagate further than 1Kb in both directions. Analyses based on mutational data and on OK-seq data concordantly suggest that only approximately a quarter of fired origins result in a processive replication fork. Taken together, our results provide a new model of replication initiation.",

    "abstract": "Locusts are defined by their capacity to transform between two very distinct integrated phenotypes or  phases in response to changes in population density: a solitarious phase, which occurs when densities are low, and a gregarious phase, which arises as a consequence of crowding and can form very large and economically damaging swarms. The two phases differ fundamentally in their behaviour, physiology and morphology. A large body of work on the mechanistic basis of behavioural phase transitions has relied on multivariate logistic regression (LR) models to estimate the probability of behavioural gregariousness from multiple behavioural variables. Martin-Blazquez and Bakkali (2017, Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 163, 9-25) have recently proposed standardised LR models for estimating an overall  gregariousness level from a combination of behavioural and, unusually, morphometric variables. Here I develop a detailed argument to demonstrate that the premise of such an overall  gregariousness level is fundamentally flawed. Since locust phase transformations intrinsically entail a decoupling of behaviour and morphology, phase state cannot meaningfully be conflated onto a single axis. LR models that do so are therefore of very limited value for any analysis of phase transitions. I furthermore show why behavioural predictor variables should not be adjusted by measures of body size that themselves differ between phases. I discuss the models fitted by Martin-Blazquez and Bakkali (2017) to highlight potential pitfalls in statistical methodology that must be avoided when applying LR to the analysis of behavioural phase state. Finally, I reject the idea that  standardised models provide a valid shortcut to estimating phase state across different developmental stages, strains or species. The points addressed here are pertinent to any research on transitions between complex phenotypes and behavioural syndromes.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of catalysis in a non-catalytic protein scaffold is a rare, unexplored event. Chalcone isomerase (CHI), a key enzyme in plant flavonoid biosynthesis, is presumed to have evolved from a non-enzymatic ancestor related to the widely-distributed fatty-acid binding proteins (FAPs) and a plant protein family with no isomerase activity (CHILs for \\\"CHI-like\\\"). Ancestral inference confirmed that CHI evolved from a protein lacking isomerase activity. We also identified four alternative founder mutations, i.e. mutations that individually instated activity, including a mutation that is not phylogenetically traceable. Despite strong epistasis in other cases of protein evolution, CHIs laboratory reconstructed mutational trajectory shows weak epistasis. Thus, enantioselective CHI activity can readily emerge despite a catalytically inactive starting point. X-ray crystallography, NMR, and MD simulations reveal reshaping of the active site toward a productive substrate-binding mode and repositioning of the catalytic arginine that was inherited from the ancestral fatty-acid binding proteins.",

According to the presented theory, the basal ganglia evaluate the utility of considered actions by combining the positive consequences (e.g. nutrition) scaled by the motivational state (e.g. hunger) with the negative consequences (e.g. effort). The theory suggests how the basal ganglia compute utility by combining the positive and negative consequences encoded in the synaptic weights of striatal Go and No-Go neurons, and the motivational state carried by neuromodulators including dopamine. Furthermore, the theory suggests how the striatal neurons to learn separately about consequences of actions, and how the dopaminergic neurons themselves learn what level of activity they need to produce to optimize behaviour. The theory accounts for the effects of dopaminergic modulation on behaviour, patterns of synaptic plasticity in striatum, and responses of dopaminergic neurons in diverse situations.",

    "abstract": "Collective migration dominates many phenomena, from cell movement in living systems to abiotic self-propelling particles. Focusing on the early stages of tumor evolution, we enunciate the principles involved in cell dynamics and highlight their implications in understanding similar behavior in seemingly unrelated soft glassy materials and possibly chemokine-induced migration of CD8+ T cells. We performed simulations of tumor invasion using a minimal three dimensional model, accounting for cell elasticity and adhesive cell-cell interactions as well as cell birth and death to establish that cell growth rate-dependent tumor expansion results in the emergence of distinct topological niches. Cells at the periphery move with higher velocity perpendicular to the tumor boundary, while motion of interior cells is slower and isotropic. The mean square displacement, {Delta}(t), of cells exhibits glassy behavior at times comparable to the cell cycle time, while exhibiting super-diffusive behavior, {Delta}(t) {approx} t ( > 1), at longer times. We derive the value of  {approx} 1.33 using a field theoretic approach based on stochastic quantization. In the process we establish the universality of super-diffusion in a class of seemingly unrelated non-equilibrium systems. Super diffusion at long times arises only if there is an imbalance between cell birth and death rates. Our findings for the collective migration, which also suggests that tumor evolution occurs in a polarized manner, are in quantitative agreement with in vitro experiments. Although set in the context of tumor invasion the findings should also hold in describing collective motion in growing cells and in active systems where creation and annihilation of particles play a role.",

Although hydrogen sulfide is often toxic, exposure to low levels of hydrogen sulfide improves outcome in a variety of mammalian models of ischemia-reperfusion injury. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the initial transcriptional response to hydrogen sulfide depends on the hif-1 transcription factor, and hif-1 mutant animals die when exposed to hydrogen sulfide. In this study, we use rescue experiments to identify tissues in which hif-1 is required to survive exposure to hydrogen sulfide. We find that expression of hif-1 from the unc-14 promoter is sufficient to survive hydrogen sulfide. Although unc-14 is generally considered to be a pan-neuronal promoter, we show that it is active in many non-neuronal cells as well. Using other promoters, we show that pan-neuronal expression of hif-1 is not sufficient to survive exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Our data suggest that hif-1 is required in many different tissues to direct the essential response to hydrogen sulfide.",

Here we enforced HOXB4 expression in purified precursor stages, and compared responses of early stages expressing the endogenous genes with later stages that did not. Contrary to the prevalent view that transduced Hox genes enhance the self-renewal of hemopoietic stem cells, stem cells or their multipotent progeny expressing the endogenous genes showed little response. Instead, immortalization, extensive self-renewal and acquired reconstituting potential occurred in committed erythroid and myeloid progenitors where the endogenous genes were shutting down. The results change our understanding of the stages affected by exogenous HOX proteins and point to shutdown of the endogenous genes as a principal determinant of the shortened clonal lifespans of committed progenitor cells.",

    "abstract": "During the Cretaceous (145-66 Ma), early angiosperms rapidly diversified, eventually outcompeting the ferns and gymnosperms previously dominating most ecosystems. Heightened competitive abilities of angiosperms are often attributed to higher rates of transpiration facilitating faster growth. This hypothesis does not explain how angiosperms were able to develop leaves with smaller, but densely packed stomata and highly branched venation networks needed to support increased gas exchange rates. Although genome duplication and reorganization have likely facilitated angiosperm diversification, here we show that genome downsizing facilitated reductions in cell size necessary to construct leaves with a high density stomata and veins. Rapid genome downsizing during the early Cretaceous allowed angiosperms to push the frontiers of anatomical trait space. In contrast, during the same time period ferns and gymnosperms exhibited no such changes in genome size, stomatal size, or vein density. Further reinforcing the effect of genome downsizing on increased gas exchange rates, we found that species employing water-loss limiting crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis, have significantly larger genomes than C3 and C4 species. By directly affecting cell size and gas exchange capacity, genome downsizing brought actual primary productivity closer to its maximum potential. These results suggest species with small genomes, exhibiting a larger range of final cell size, can more finely tune their leaf physiology to environmental conditions and inhabit a broader range of habitats.",

Hundreds of aberrant pre-mRNA splicing events are reproducibly associated with Alzheimers Disease (AD). We also generate a catalog of splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) effects in the human cortex: splicing of 3,198 genes is influenced by genetic variation. sQTLs are enriched among those variants influencing DNA methylation and histone acetylation. In assessing known AD loci, we report that altered splicing is the mechanism for the effects of the PICALM, CLU, and PTK2B susceptibility alleles. Further, we leverage our sQTL catalog to identify genes whose aberrant splicing is associated with AD and mediated by genetics. This transcriptome-wide association study identified 21 genes with significant associations, many of which are found in AD GWAS loci, but 8 are in novel AD loci, including FUS, which is a known amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) gene. This highlights an intriguing shared genetic architecture that is further elaborated by the convergence of old and new AD genes in autophagy-lysosomal-related pathways already implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, this study of the aging brains transcriptome provides evidence that dysregulation of mRNA splicing is a feature of AD and is, in some genetically-driven cases, causal.",

    "abstract": "Proper chromosome segregation is essential in all living organisms. In Caulobacter crescentus, the ParA-ParB-parS system is required for proper chromosome segregation and cell viability. The bacterial centromere-like parS DNA locus is the first to be segregated following chromosome replication. parS is bound by ParB protein, which in turn interacts with ParA to partition the ParB-parS nucleoprotein complex to each daughter cell. Here, we investigated the genome-wide distribution of ParB on the Caulobacter chromosome using a combination of in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and in vitro DNA affinity purification with deep sequencing (IDAP-seq). We confirmed two previously identified parS sites and discovered at least three more sites that cluster ~8 kb from the origin of replication. We showed that Caulobacter ParB nucleates at parS sites and associates non-specifically with ~10 kb flanking DNA to form a high-order nucleoprotein complex on the left chromosomal arm. Lastly, using transposon mutagenesis coupled with deep sequencing (Tn-seq), we identified a ~500 kb region surrounding the native parS cluster that is tolerable to the insertion of a second parS cluster without severely affecting cell viability. Our results demonstrate that the genomic distribution of parS sites is highly restricted and is crucial for chromosome segregation in Caulobacter.",

    "abstract": "Codon usage bias is the preferential use of the subset of synonymous codons during translation. In this paper, the comparisons of normalized entropy and GC content between the sequence of coding regions of Escherichia coli k12 and noncoding regions (ncRNA, rRNA) of various organisms were done to shed light on the origin of the codon usage bias.The normalized entropy of the coding regions was found significantly higher than the noncoding regions, suggesting the role of the translation process in shaping codon usage bias. Further, when the position specific GC content of both coding and noncoding regions was analyzed, the GC2 content in coding regions was lower than GC1 and GC2 while in noncoding regions, the GC1, GC2, GC3 contents were approximately equal. This discrepancy is explained by the biased mutation coupled with the presence and absence of selection pressure. The accumulation of CG content occurs in the sequences due to mutation bias in DNA repair and recombination process. In noncoding regions, the mutation is harmful and thus, selected against while due to the degeneracy of codons in coding regions, a mutation in GC3 is neutral and hence, not selected. Thus, the accumulation of GC content occurs in coding regions, and thus codon usage bias occurs.",

    "abstract": "Despite the use of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the presence of latent or transcriptionally silent proviruses prevents cure and eradication of HIV infection. These transcriptionally silent proviruses are well protected from both the immune system and HAART regimens. Thus, in order to tackle the problem of latent HIV reservoirs, it is a prerequisite to define all the pathways that regulate HIV transcription. We have previously reported that DNA-PK facilitates HIV transcription by interacting with the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) complex recruited at HIV LTR. To extend those studies further, here we demonstrate that DNA-PK promotes HIV transcription by supporting it at several stages, including initiation, pause-release and elongation. We discovered that DNA-PK increases phosphorylation of RNAP II C-terminal domain (CTD) at serine 5 (Ser5) and serine 2 (Ser2) by both directly catalyzing and by augmenting the recruitment of P-TEFb at HIV LTR. We found that DNA-PK facilitates the establishment of euchromatin structure at HIV LTR, which further supports HIV gene expression. DNA-PK inhibition or knockdown leads to the severe impairment of HIV gene expression and conversion of euchromatin to heterochromatin at HIV LTR. It also profoundly restricts HIV replication and reactivation of latent provirus. DNA-PK promotes the recruitment of TRIM28 at LTR and facilitates the release of paused RNAP II through TRIM28 phosphorylation. The results were reproduced in cell lines belonging to both lymphoid and myeloid lineages and were confirmed in primary CD4+ T cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-infected patients.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEOur results reveal the important role of DNA-PK in supporting HIV transcription, replication and latent proviral reactivation. Intriguingly, this study sheds light on an important pathway that affects HIV gene expression. These findings provide strong rationale for developing and using transcriptional inhibitors, such as DNA-PK inhibitors, as supplement to HAART regimens in order to further enhance their effectiveness and to suppress toxicity due to HIV proteins.",

We hypothesized that these effects are partly driven by border cell inputs which reset the spatial phase of grid cells, maintaining learned relationships between grid phase and environmental boundaries without altering inherent grid scale. A computational model of this mechanism reproduced diverse distortions during deformations, including scale-dependent and local distortions of grid fields, and stretched, duplicated, and fractured place fields. This model predicted a striking new effect: dynamic, history-dependent, boundary-tethered  shifts in grid phase during deformations. We reanalyzed two rodent grid cell rescaling datasets and found direct evidence of these shifts, which have not been previously reported and contribute to the appearance of rescaling. These results demonstrate that the grid representation of geometrically deformed environments is not fixed, but rather dynamically changes with the specific experience of the navigator.",

Utilizing a well-known visual motion paradigm that evokes behavioral suppression and facilitation, and combining 5 different methodologies (behavioral psychophysics, computational modeling, functional MRI, pharmacology, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy), we provide evidence that challenges commonly held assumptions about the neural processes underlying suppression and facilitation. We show that: 1) both suppression and facilitation can emerge from a single, computational principle - divisive normalization; there is no need to invoke separate neural mechanisms, 2) neural suppression and facilitation in the motion-selective area MT mirror perception, but strong suppression also occurs in earlier visual areas, and 3) suppression is not driven by GABA-mediated inhibition.

With tools for measuring activity in cell-type specific populations in the mouse during visual behavior gaining traction, it is important to define the extent of luminance and hue information that is behaviorally-accessible to the mouse. A non-uniform distribution of cone opsins in the mouse potentially complicates both luminance and hue sensitivity: opposing gradients of short (UV-shifted) and middle (blue/green) cone opsins suggest that hue discrimination and wavelength-specific luminance contrast sensitivity may differ depending on retinotopic location. Here we ask if, and how well, mice can discriminate color and wavelength-specific luminance across visuotopic space. We found that mice were able to discriminate hue, and were able to do so more broadly across visuotopic space than expected from the cone-opsin distribution. We also found wavelength-band specific differences in luminance sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Fat represents a calorically potent food source that yields approximately twice the amount of energy as carbohydrates or proteins per unit of mass. The highly palatable taste of FAs promotes food consumption, activates reward circuitry, and is thought to contribute to hedonic feeding underlying many metabolism-related disorders. Despite a role in the etiology of metabolic diseases, little is known about how dietary fats are detected by the gustatory system to promote feeding. Previously, we showed that a broad population of sugar-sensitive taste neurons expressing Gustatory Receptor 64f (Gr64f), is required for reflexive feeding responses to both FAs and sugars. Here, we report a genetic silencing screen to identify specific populations of taste neurons that mediate fatty acid taste. We find neurons identified by expression of Ionotropic Receptor 56d (IR56d) are necessary and sufficient for reflexive feeding response to FAs. Functional imaging reveals that IR56d-expressing neurons are responsive to short- and medium-chain FAs. Silencing IR56d neurons selectively abolishes fatty acid taste, while their activation is sufficient to drive feeding responses. Analysis of co-expression with Gr64f identifies two subpopulations of IR56d-expressing neurons. While physiological imaging reveals that both populations are responsive to FAs, IR56d/Gr64f neurons are activated by medium-chain FAs and are sufficient for reflexive feeding responses to FA. Moreover, flies can discriminate between sugar and FAs in an aversive taste memory assay, indicating that FA taste is a unique modality in Drosophila. Taken together, these findings localize fatty acid taste within the Drosophila gustatory center and provide an opportunity to investigate discrimination between different categories of appetitive tastants.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryFat represents a calorically potent food source that yields approximately twice the amount of energy as carbohydrates or proteins per unit of mass. Dietary lipids are comprised of both triacylglycerides and FAs, and growing evidence suggests that it is the free FAs that are detected by the gustatory system. The highly palatable taste of FAs promotes food consumption, activates reward centers in mammals, and is thought to contribute to hedonic feeding that underlies many metabolism-related disorders. Despite a role in the etiology of metabolic diseases, little is known about how dietary fats are detected by the gustatory system to promote feeding. We have identified a subset of sugar-sensing neurons in the fly that also respond to medium-chain FAs and are necessary and sufficient for behavioral responses to FAs. Further, we find that despite being sensed by shared neuron populations, flies can differentiate between the taste of sugar and FAs, fortifying the notion that FAs and sugar represent distinct taste modalities in flies.",

The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels.

    "abstract": "A major application for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been the emerging field of causal inference using Mendelian randomization (MR), where the causal effect between a pair of traits can be estimated using only summary level data. MR depends on SNPs exhibiting vertical pleiotropy, where the SNP influences an outcome phenotype only through an exposure phenotype. Issues arise when this assumption is violated due to SNPs exhibiting horizontal pleiotropy. We demonstrate that across a range of pleiotropy models, instrument selection will be increasingly liable to selecting invalid instruments as GWAS sample sizes continue to grow. Methods have been developed in an attempt to protect MR from different patterns of horizontal pleiotropy, and here we have designed a mixture-of-experts machine learning framework (MR-MoE 1.0) that predicts the most appropriate model to use for any specific causal analysis, improving on both power and false discovery rates. Using the approach, we systematically estimated the causal effects amongst 2407 phenotypes. Almost 90% of causal estimates indicated some level of horizontal pleiotropy. The causal estimates are organised into a publicly available graph database (http://eve.mrbase.org), and we use it here to highlight the numerous challenges that remain in automated causal inference.",

    "abstract": "The insect repellent N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), is a multimodal compound that acts as a spatial repellent as well as an irritant (contact repellent), thus being perceived by the insects olfactory and gustatory systems as an odorant and a tastant, respectively. Soon after DEET was developed, almost 6 decades ago, it was reported that it reduced mosquito feeding on blood mixed with this repellent. It is now known that the mosquito proboscis senses contact repellents with the tips (labella) of the labium, which remain in direct contact with the outer layers of the skin, while the stylets, including the feeding deterrent sensor (labrum), penetrate the skin. We designed a behavioral assay that allowed us to tease apart contact repellency from feeding deterrence. First, we demonstrate here that when DEET was mixed with blood and covered by Parafilm(R) layers, it did not leak to the outer surface. In our assays, the mean number of landings and duration of contacts with surfaces covering blood mixed with DEET or blood plus solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide) did not differ significantly. The feeding times, however, were significantly different. When blood was mixed either with 0.1 or 1% DEET, female southern house mosquitoes spent significantly less time feeding than the time spent feeding on blood mixed only with the solvent. By contrast, there were no significant differences in the mean times of feeding on blood containing 1% picaridin and blood plus solvent. Like DEET, the contact repellent and insecticide, permethrin, caused a significant reduction in feeding time. We, therefore, concluded, that in this context, DEET and permethrin act as feeding deterrents.",

The PGV pipeline is modular and consists of many independently usable tools and software libraries. We draw attention to three particular tools which may be useful to other groups working on neoantigen vaccination. (1) Epidisco is a workflow which orchestrates the parallel execution of the PGV pipeline, including both common steps such as alignment as well as tools which have been developed specifically for the PGV-001 trial. (2) Vaxrank uses somatic variants and tumor RNA reads to select peptides for inclusion in a patients vaccine. (3) Isovar is a library used by Vaxrank to determine the mutated protein sequence associated with a genomic variant from supporting tumor RNA reads. We hope that the functionality of these tools may extend beyond the specifics of the PGV-001 trial and enable other research groups in their own neoantigen investigations.",

Yet scans for positive selection rely on codon models which incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we perform a large-scale comparison of approaches which incorporate codon substitution rate variation and propose our own simple yet effective modification of existing models. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. More than 70% of the genes detected by the classical branch-site model are presumably false positives caused by the incorrect assumption of uniform synonymous substitution rate. We propose a new model which is strongly favored by the data while remaining computationally tractable. With the new model we can capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we propose that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. While we detect fewer genes under positive selection in Drosophila than without rate variation, the genes which we detect contain a stronger signal of adaptation of dynein, which could be associated with Wolbachia infection. We provide software to perform positive selection analysis using the new model.",

    "abstract": "Few ecotoxicological studies exist for rare earth elements (REEs), particularly field-based studies on their bioaccumulation and food web dynamics. REE mining has led to significant environment impacts in several countries (China, Brazil, U.S.), yet little is known about the fate and transport of these contaminants of emerging concern. To understand how REEs behave in pristine northern food webs, we measured REE concentrations and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios ({partial}15N, {partial}13C) in biota from marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems of the eastern Canadian Arctic (N=339). Northern ecosystems are potentially vulnerable to REE enrichment from prospective mining projects at high latitudes. Wildlife harvesting and tissue sampling was partly conducted by local hunters through a community-based monitoring project. Results show that REE generally follow a coherent bioaccumulation pattern for sample tissues, with some anomalies for redox-sensitive elements (Ce, Eu). Highest REE concentrations were found at low trophic levels, especially in vegetation and aquatic invertebrates. Terrestrial herbivores, ringed seal, and fish had low REE levels in muscle tissue (<0.1 nmolg-1), yet accumulation was an order of magnitude higher in all liver tissues. Age- and length-dependent REE accumulation also suggest that REE uptake is faster than elimination for some species. Overall, REE bioaccumulation patterns appear to be species- and tissue-species, with limited potential for biomagnification. This study provides novel ecotoxicological data on the behaviour of REE in ecosystems and will be useful for environmental impact assessment of REE enrichment in northern regions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe metabolic conversion of dietary omega-3 and omega-6 18 carbon (18C) to long chain (> 20 carbon) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) is vital for human life. Fatty acid desaturase (FADS) 1 and 2 catalyze the rate-limiting steps in the biosynthesis of LC-PUFAs. The FADS region contains two haplotypes; ancestral and derived, where the derived haplotypes are associated with more efficient LC-PUFA biosynthesis and is nearly fixed in Africa. In addition, Native American populations appear to be nearly fixed for the lesser efficient ancestral haplotype, which could be a public health problem due to associated low LC-PUFA levels, while Eurasia is polymorphic. This haplotype frequency distribution is suggestive of archaic re-introduction of the ancestral haplotype to non-African populations or ancient polymorphism with differential selection patterns across the globe. Therefore, we tested the FADS region for archaic introgression or ancient polymorphism. We specifically addressed the genetic architecture of the FADS region in Native American populations to better understand this potential public health impact.\\n\\nResultsWe confirmed Native American ancestry is nearly fixed for the ancestral haplotype and is under positive selection. The ancestral haplotype frequency is also correlated to Siberian populations geographic location further suggesting the ancestral haplotype s role in cold weather adaptation and leading to the high haplotype frequency within Native American populations. We also find that the Neanderthal is more closely related to the derived haplotypes while the Denisovan clusters closer to the ancestral haplotypes. In addition, the derived haplotypes have a time to the most recent common ancestor of 688,474 years ago which is within the range of the modern-archaic hominin divergence.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results support an ancient polymorphism forming in the FADS gene region with differential selection pressures acting on the derived and ancestral haplotypes due to the old age of the derived haplotypes and the ancestral haplotype being under positive selection in Native American ancestry populations. Further, the near fixation of the less efficient ancestral haplotype in Native American ancestry suggests the need for future studies to explore the potential health risk of associated low LC-PUFA levels in Native American ancestry populations.",

Although eRNAs have been suggested as predictors of enhancer activities and possibly key components facilitating transcription, there is little genetic evidence to support this. We address the biology of eRNAs in vivo and investigate eRNA patterns, expression levels and possible functions within a mammary-specific super-enhancer that is composed of three units with distinct transcriptional capacities. We show that eRNA levels do not correspond with the activities of their respective enhancer units. However, changes in eRNA expression upon deletion of individual enhancer units reflect the change in overall super-enhancer activity. These data provide genetic evidence that eRNA levels are not a reliable readout of individual enhancers, but they predict super-enhancer activity in the absence of constituent elements.",

Here, we devised a highthroughput assay to quantify the activity of [~]15,000 fully designed core promoters that we integrated and expressed from a fixed location within the human genome. We find that core promoters drive transcription unidirectionally, and that sequences originating from promoters exhibit stronger activity than sequences originating from enhancers. Testing multiple combinations and distances of core promoter elements, we observe a positive effect of TATA and Initiator, a negative effect of BREu and BREd, and a 10bp periodicity in the optimal distance between the TATA and the Initiator. By comprehensively screening TF binding-sites, we show that site orientation has little effect, that the effect of binding site number on expression is factor-specific, and that there is a striking agreement between the effect of binding site multiplicity in our assay and the tendency of the TF to appear in homotypic clusters throughout the genome. Overall, our results systematically assay the elements that drive expression in core- and proximal-promoter regions and shed light on organization principles of regulatory regions in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis, chromosomes fold into compacted rod shaped structures. We combined imaging and Hi-C of synchronous DT40 cell cultures with polymer simulations to determine how interphase chromosomes are converted into compressed arrays of loops characteristic of mitotic chromosomes. We found that the interphase organization is disassembled within minutes of prophase entry and by late prophase chromosomes are already folded as arrays of consecutive loops. During prometaphase, this array reorganizes to form a helical arrangement of nested loops. Polymer simulations reveal that Hi-C data are inconsistent with solenoidal coiling of the entire chromatid, but instead suggest a centrally located helically twisted axis from which consecutive loops emanate as in a spiral staircase. Chromosomes subsequently shorten through progressive helical winding, with the numbers of loops per turn increasing so that the size of a helical turn grows from around 3 Mb (~40 loops) to ~12 Mb (~150 loops) in fully condensed metaphase chromosomes. Condensin is essential to disassemble the interphase chromatin conformation. Analysis of mutants revealed differing roles for condensin I and II during these processes. Either condensin can mediate formation of loop arrays. However, condensin II was required for helical winding during prometaphase, whereas condensin I modulated the size and arrangement of loops inside the helical turns. These observations identify a mitotic chromosome morphogenesis pathway in which folding of linear loop arrays produces long thin chromosomes during prophase that then shorten by progressive growth of loops and helical winding during prometaphase.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMitotic chromosome morphogenesis occurs through condensin-mediated disassembly of the interphase conformation and formation of extended prophase loop arrays that then shorten by loop growth and condensin-dependent helical winding.",

Uncertainty arises not only from the properties of sensory input but also from cognitive sources, such as different levels of attention. However, it is unknown whether humans appropriately adjust for such cognitive sources of uncertainty during perceptual decision making. Here we show that human categorization and confidence decisions take into account uncertainty related to attention. We manipulated uncertainty in an orientation categorization task from trial to trial using only an attentional cue. The categorization task was designed to disambiguate decision rules that did or did not depend on attention. Using formal model comparison to evaluate decision behavior, we found that category and confidence decision boundaries shifted as a function of attention in an approximately Bayesian fashion. This means that the observers attentional state on each trial contributed probabilistically to the decision computation. This responsiveness of an observers decisions to attention-dependent uncertainty should improve perceptual decisions in natural vision, in which attention is unevenly distributed across a scene.",

Neural entrainment is deemed particularly relevant for speech analysis, as it would contribute to the extraction of discrete linguistic elements from continuous acoustic signals. Yet, its causal influence in speech perception has been difficult to establish. Here, we provide evidence that oscillations build temporal predictions about the duration of speech tokens that directly influence perception. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we studied neural dynamics during listening to sentences that changed in speech rate. We observed neural entrainment to preceding speech rhythms persisting for several cycles after the change in rate. The sustained entrainment was associated with changes in the perceived duration of the last words vowel, resulting in the perception of words with radically different meanings. These findings support oscillatory models of speech processing, suggesting that neural oscillations actively shape speech perception.",

    "abstract": "Spatial navigation is considered fundamental for animals and is attributed primarily to place and grid cells in the rodent brain. Commonly believed to either perform path integration or localization, the true objective of grid cells, their hexagonal grid fields, and especially their discrete scales remain puzzling. Here it is proposed that grid cells efficiently encode transitions in sequences. A biologically plausible model for dendritic computation in grid cells is presented. A network of competitive cells shows positive gridness scores early in simulations and realigns the orientation of all cells over time. Then, a scale-space model of grid cells is introduced. It improves behaviorally questionable run-times of a single scale significantly by look-ahead in multiple scales, and it is shown that the optimal scale-increment between consecutive scales is{surd} 2. Finally, a formal theory for sequences and transitions is stated. It is demonstrated that hexagonal transition encoders are optimal to encode transitions in Euclidean space and emerge due to the sampling theorem. The paper concludes with a discussion about the suggested purpose, makes testable predictions, and highlights relevant connections to computational neuroscience as well as computer science and robotics.",

    "abstract": "We study translational regulation by a 5 UTR sequence encoding the binding site of an RNA-binding protein (RBP) in bacteria, using a reporter assay and Selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq). We tested constructs containing a single hairpin, based on the binding sites of the coat RBPs of bacteriophages GA, MS2, PP7, and Q{beta}, positioned in the 5 UTR of a reporter gene. With specifically-bound RBP present, either weak repression or up-regulation is observed, depending on the binding site and its flanking sequence. SHAPE-Seq data for a representative construct exhibiting up-regulation, indicates a partially-folded hairpin and non-reactive upstream and downstream flanking region, which we attribute to intermediate structures that apparently blocks translation. RBP binding stabilizes the fully-folded hairpin state and thus facilitates translation, suggesting that the up-regulating constructs are RBP-sensing riboswitches. This finding is further supported by lengthening the binding-site stem, which in turn destabilizes the translationally-inactive state, and abolishes the up-regulating behavior. Finally, we found that the combination of two binding sites, positioned in the 5 UTR and gene-header of the same transcript, can yield a cooperative regulatory response. Together, we show that the interaction of an RBP with its RNA target facilitates structural changes in the RNA, which is reflected by a controllable range of binding affinities and dose response behaviors. Thus, demonstrating that RNA-RBP interactions can provide a platform for constructing gene regulatory networks that are based on translational, rather than transcriptional, regulation.",

Both cis- and trans-acting changes could accumulate and participate in complex interactions, so to isolate the cis-regulatory component of patterning evolution, we measured allele-specific spatial gene expression patterns in D. melanogaster x D. simulans hybrid embryos. RNA-seq of cryosectioned slices revealed 55 genes with strong spatially varying allele-specific expression, and several hundred more with weaker but significant spatial divergence. For example, we found that hunchback (hb), a major regulator of developmental patterning, had reduced expression specifically in the anterior tip of D. simulans embryos. Mathematical modeling of hb cis-regulation suggested that a mutation in a Bicoid binding site was responsible, which we verified using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. In sum, even comparing morphologically near-identical species we identified a substantial amount of spatial variation in gene expression, suggesting that development is robust to many such changes, but also that natural selection may have ample raw material for evolving new body plans via cis-regulatory divergence.",

    "abstract": "Rhamnose is required in Arabidopsis thaliana for synthesizing pectic polysaccharides and glycosylating flavonols. RHAMNOSE BIOSYNTHESIS1 (RHM1) encodes a UDP-L-rhamnose synthase, and rhm1 mutants exhibit many developmental defects, including short root hairs, hyponastic cotyledons, and left-handed helically twisted petals and roots. It has been proposed that the hyponastic cotyledons observed in rhm1 mutants are a consequence of abnormal flavonol glycosylation, while the root hair defect is flavonol-independent. We have recently shown that the helical twisting of rhm1 petals results from decreased levels of rhamnose-containing cell wall polymers. In this work, we find that flavonols indirectly modify the rhm1 helical petal phenotype by altering rhamnose flux to the cell wall. Given this finding, we further investigated the relationship between flavonols and the cell wall in rhm1 cotyledons. We show that decreased flavonol rhamnosylation is not responsible for the cotyledon phenotype of rhm1 mutants. Instead, flavonols provide a large reservoir of rhamnose, and blocking flavonol synthesis or rhamnosylation can suppress rhm1 defects by diverting rhamnose to the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides. Therefore, rhamnose is required in the cell wall for normal expansion of cotyledon epidermal cells. Our findings suggest a broad role for rhamnose-containing cell wall polysaccharides in the morphogenesis of epidermal cells.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation plays critical roles in maintaining genome stability, genomic imprinting, transposon silencing, and development. In Arabidopsis genomic imprinting is established in the central cell by DEMETER (DME)-mediated active DNA demethylation, and is essential for seed viability. DME is a large polypeptide with multiple poorly characterized conserved domains. Here we show that the C-terminal enzymatic core of DME is sufficient to complement dme associated developmental defects. When targeted by a native DME promoter, nuclear-localized DME C-terminal region rescues dme seed abortion and pollen germination defects, and ameliorates CG hypermethylation phenotype in dme-2 endosperm. Furthermore, targeted expression of the DME N-terminal region in wild-type central cell induces dme-like seed abortion phenotype. Our results support a bipartite organization for DME protein, and suggest that the N-terminal region might have regulatory function such as assisting in DNA binding and enhancing the processivity of active DNA demethylation in heterochromatin targets.",
