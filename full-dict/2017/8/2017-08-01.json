    "abstract": "BackgroundSpatial scale is important when studying ecological processes. The Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a large sexually dimorphic tetraonid that is endemic to the sagebrush biome of western North America. The impacts of oil and gas development at individual leks has been well-documented. However, no previous studies have quantified the population-level response.\\n\\nMethodsHierarchical models were used to estimate the effects of the areal disturbance due to well pads as well as climatic variation on individual lek counts and Greater sage-grouse populations (management units) over 32 years. The lek counts were analyzed using General Linear Mixed Models while the management units were analyzed using Gompertz Population Dynamic Models. The models were fitted using frequentist and Bayesian methods. An information-theoretic approach was used to identify the most important spatial scale and time lags. The relative importance of oil and gas and climate at the local and population-level scales was assessed using information-theoretic (Akaikes weights) and estimation (effect size) statistics.\\n\\nResultsAt the local scale, oil and gas was an important negative predictor of the lek count. At the population scale, there was only weak support for oil and gas as a predictor of density changes but the estimated impacts on the long-term carrying capacity were consistent with summation of the local impacts. Regional climatic variation, as indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, was an important positive predictor of density changes at both the local and population-level (particularly in the most recent part of the time series).\\n\\nConclusionsAdditional studies to reduce the uncertainty in the range of possible effects of oil and gas at the population scale are required. Wildlife agencies need to account for the effects of regional climatic variation when managing sage-grouse populations.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing changes are frequently observed in cancer and are starting to be recognized as important signatures for tumor progression and therapy. However, their functional impact and relevance to tumorigenesis remains mostly unknown. We carried out a systematic analysis to characterize the potential functional consequences of alternative splicing changes in thousands of tumor samples. This analysis revealed that a subset of alternative splicing changes affect protein domain families that are frequently mutated in tumors and potentially disrupt protein protein interactions in cancer-related pathways. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the number of these alternative splicing changes in a sample and the number of somatic mutations in drivers. We propose that a subset of the alternative splicing changes observed in tumors may represent independent oncogenic processes that could be relevant to explain the functional transformations in cancer and some of them could potentially be considered alternative splicing drivers (AS-drivers).",

    "abstract": "Knowing where north is provides a navigator with invaluable information for learning and recalling a space, particularly in places with limited navigational cues, like complex indoor environments. Although north is effectively used by orienteers, pilots, and military personnel, very little is known about whether non-expert populations can or will use north to create an accurate representation of an indoor space. In the current study, we taught people two non-overlapping routes through a complex indoor environment, with which they were not familiar - a university hospital with few windows and several turns. Along one route, they wore a vibrotactile compass on their arm, which vibrated continuously indicating the direction of north. Along the other route, they were only told where north was at the start of the route. At the beginning, the end, and back at the beginning of each route, participants pointed to well-known landmarks in the surrounding city and campus (external landmarks), and newly-learned landmarks in the hospital (internal landmarks). We found improved performance with the compass only for external landmarks, driven by peoples use of the availability of north to orient these judgments. No such improved orientation occurred for the internal landmarks. These findings reveal the utility of vibrotactile compasses for learning new indoor spaces. We speculate that such cues help users map new spaces onto familiar spaces or to familiar reference frames.Keywords: Spatial navigation; vibrotactile compass; reference frames; spatial memory; pointing; real world navigation.\\n\\nGetting lost in complex indoor spaces, like hospitals, airports, or subways, can be dangerous, distressing, and costly. Unlike outdoor spaces, which typically offer long sightlines and distal landmarks, indoor spaces are often confined, undifferentiated, and labyrinthine. Individual building layouts can be hard to learn if knowledge about direction with respect to the larger world is not easily attained. Confusing layouts, signs, and an inability to see outdoor landmarks compound these problems. Even in places with adequate signs or sight of outdoor landmarks, successful navigation by blind people and people with visual impairments is a substantial problem (Schinazi, 2008; Schinazi, Thrash, & Chebat, 2016). In the current study, we investigate whether providing non-visual directional information aids sighted people in learning an unfamiliar, complex indoor space. Specifically, we tested how people use a commercially-available vibrotactile compass, which vibrates in the direction of north. Unlike visual compasses, people with visual impairments can use vibrotactile compasses. A non-visual aid might also limit divided attention, which complicates the use of visual aids (Gardony, Brunye, & Taylor, 2015).\\n\\nWe tested two competing hypotheses in the current study. These hypotheses stem from a multifarious theoretical framework of navigational ability (Wolbers & Hegarty, 2010). 1. General: People would have access to more spatial information, and thus improve generally. In this case, providing a specific spatial cue decreases the error in the sensory signals, increasing the fidelity of the resulting spatial representations. We would expect improved performance across all aspects of navigation behavior. 2. Specific: People would have access to a specific spatial cue, and thus improve on tasks for which that cue is immediately helpful. In this case, providing a specific spatial cue only improves access to specific information, but in a way that does not create a more accurate general spatial representation. We would expect improved performance only on aspects of navigation behavior that knowledge of the cue is directly relevant. Addressing these questions offers insights into how spatial information is acquired in general, and provides insight into how vibrotactile compasses might aid blind or visually impaired navigators.\\n\\nWhy might people get lost in complex indoor spaces? One reason is that place-based strategies used by humans to navigate are thwarted by indoor spaces. Research on humans and rats reveals two neural systems, which undergird two navigational strategies (Hartley, Maguire,Spiers, & Burgess, 2003; Marchette, Bakker, & Shelton, 2011; McDonald & White, 1994;Morris, Garrud, Rawlins, & OKeefe, 1982; Munn, 1950; Packard & McGaugh, 1996; Restle, 1957; Tolman, Ritchie, & Kalish, 1946). First, a place-based strategy, implemented by the hippocampus, represents space as a cognitive map. A cognitive map is a flexible spatial representation, which affords the opportunity to infer novel shortcuts. Second, a response strategy, implemented by the caudate nucleus, applies a stimulus-response approach to navigation whereby choice points are identified, and responses are recalled (e.g., turn left at the bank, then right at the big tree). The response strategy is relatively inflexible, and generates associations between scenes and actions. In indoor environments, cues that support a place strategy, like distal landmarks and visual discriminability (Restle, 1957) are absent. Instead, place strategies rely on a process of path integration - tracking ones movement away from a starting location by attending to translations and rotations. Unfortunately, unlike rodents, people are poor path integrators (Foo, Duchon, Warren, & Tarr, 2007; Loomis et al., 1993). Thus, in indoor spaces, if people are more likely to adhere to response-based strategies, they are likely to gain less spatial knowledge about the overall environment.\\n\\nA second reason people easily get lost in complex indoor spaces arises from research on reference frames. A large body of evidence (Diwadkar & McNamara, 1997; McNamara, Rump, & Werner, 2003; Meilinger, Riecke, & Bulthoff, 2014; Meilinger, Frankenstein, Watanabe, Bulthoff, & Holscher, 2015; Mou & McNamara, 2002; Mou, McNamara, & Zhang, 2013; Mou & Wang, 2015; Roskos-Ewoldsen, McNamara, Shelton, & Carr, 1998; Shelton & McNamara,2004) supports the idea that spatial knowledge is stored in a preferred reference frame. A reference frame is a spatial representation in which objects or other representations of space are contained, or with respect to which they are ordered, oriented, located, or thought to move; a preferred reference frame is an orientation in which a spatial layout is most easily recalled. A reference frame is considered global if it is common across multiple areas of space (e.g., global north). In familiar, large-scale (i.e., city-sized) spaces, reference frames can be aligned with north (Frankenstein, Mohler, Bulthoff, & Meilinger, 2011), or a salient organizing feature (like a street through a campus; Marchette, Yerramsetti, Burns, & Shelton, 2011; Yerramsetti, Marchette, & Shelton, 2013). Indoor environments, however, provide less access to global reference frames. In the absence of global cues (like distal landmarks), people are likely to organize space into several local reference frames, instead of one global reference frame (Meilinger et al., 2014). In the extreme, using local reference frames means each segment of a route is disconnected from the last, and results in a 1-dimensional representation of space (i.e., an ordered sequence of places, with no 2-dimensional spatial relations specified; Ishikawa & Montello, 2006). Being able to integrate across areas of a learned route to take novel shortcuts, for example, requires some spatial knowledge about how to join local reference frames to each other to form a global reference frame - a difficult and demanding cognitive process (Weisberg & Newcombe, 2016; Weisberg, Schinazi, Newcombe, Shipley, & Epstein, 2014).\\n\\nIf people have direct sensory access to a global spatial direction, like a cardinal direction, they might map an unfamiliar indoor space onto the larger external environment, and construct a more accurate spatial representation of this indoor space. In this way, place-based strategies and global reference frames become more useful in an unfamiliar indoor space. Recent work has begun to characterize the use of vibrotactile compasses in particular. Konig and colleagues (Karcher, Fenzlaff, Hartmann, Nagel, & Konig, 2012; Kaspar, Konig, Schwandt, & Konig, 2014; Konig et al., 2016) developed a feelSpace belt, which provides tactile information about magnetic north. Their work illustrates that, with extensive training (seven weeks), the vibrotactile compass can improve basic homing tasks in sighted individuals (Konig et al., 2016).However, it is unknown how such directional information is incorporated into spatial representations, particularly in complex indoor spaces. Moreover, we were interested in whether this directional information could be incorporated and used to learn a new environment with only rudimentary training in the use of the device.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTargeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of proteins that are encoded by genes critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSGenes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings provide a relevant towards better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.",

    "abstract": "LRRK2 mutations are a major cause of Parkinsons disease. Pathogenicity of LRRK2 loss-of-function is controversial, as knockout in rodents reportedly induces no brain-specific effects and knockdown studies in zebrafish are conflicting. Here we show that CRISPR/Cas9-engineered deletion of the ~60-kbp-long zebrafish lrrk2 locus elicits a pleomorphic, albeit transient brain phenotype in maternal-zygotic mutants (mzLrrk2). Intriguingly, 11-month-old mzLrrk2 adults display increased dopamine and serotonin catabolism. Additionally, we find decreased mitosis in the larval brain and reduced stab injury-induced neuronal regeneration in the adult telencephalon. Finally, hypokinesia associates with loss of lrrk2 in larvae. Our results demonstrate that lrrk2 knockout has an early neurodevelopmental effect, and leads to perturbed dopamine and serotonin catabolism in a LRRK2 knockout. We propose mzLrrk2 zebrafish as a valuable tool to study LRRK2 loss-of-function in vivo, and provide a link between LRRK2 and the control of basal cell proliferation in the brain that may become potentially critical upon challenges like brain injury.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological interventions that target human ageing would extend individual healthspan and result in dramatic economic benefits to rapidly ageing societies worldwide. For such interventions to be contemplated they need to comprise drugs that are efficacious when given to adults and for which extensive human safety data are available. Here we show that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved in C.elegans by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved ageing pathways using drugs that are already in human use. By targeting multiple synergistic ageing pathways, we are able to slow ageing rate, double lifespan and improves healthspan while minimize developmental and fitness trade-offs. Moreover, we established that there is no synergistic benefit in a daf-2 or daf-7 background, implying the involvement of the TGF{beta} and IGF pathways in this synergy. Employing lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis we found lipid metabolism to be affected resulting in increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and decrease membrane peroxidation index. Our best drug combination showed a conserved lifespan extension in fruit flies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest lifespan effect ever reported for any adult-onset drug treatment in C. elegans. This drug-repurposing approach, using drugs already approved for humans to target multiple conserved aging pathways simultaneously, could lead to interventions that prevent age-related diseases and overall frailty in a rapidly ageing population.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsCystic fibrosis (CF) patients and CF mouse models have increased risk for gastrointestinal tumors. CF mice exhibit augmented intestinal proliferation of unknown etiology and an altered intestinal environment. We examined the role of Cftr in Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, stem cell proliferation and its functional expression in the active intestinal stem cell (ISC) population. Dysregulation of intracellular pH (pHi) in CF ISCs was investigated for facilitation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling.\\n\\nMethodsCrypt epithelia from wild-type (WT) and CF mice were compared ex vivo and in intestinal organoids (enteroids) for proliferation and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling by standard assays. Cftr in ISCs was assessed by immunoblot of sorted Sox9EGFP intestinal epithelia and pHi regulation by confocal microfluorimetry of Lgr5+-EGFP ISCs. Plasma membrane association of the Wnt transducer Disheveled 2 (Dvl2) was assessed by fluorescence imaging of live enteroids from WT and CF mice crossed with Dvl2-EGFP/RosamT/mG mice.\\n\\nResultsRelative to WT, CF intestinal crypts showed a ~30% increase in epithelial and Lgr5+ ISC proliferation and increased Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Cftr was expressed in Sox9EGFPLo ISCs and loss of Cftr induced an alkaline pHi in Lgr5+-EGFP ISCs. CF crypt-base columnar cells (CBCs) demonstrated a generalized increase in plasma membrane Dvl2-EGFP association as compared to WT. Dvl2-EGFP membrane association was charge- and pH-dependent and increased in WT CBCs by Cftr inhibition.\\n\\nConclusionsCF intestine exhibits increased ISC proliferation and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Loss of Cftr increases pHi in ISCs which stabilizes the plasma membrane association of the Wnt transducer Dvl, likely facilitating Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Absence of Cftr-dependent suppression of ISC proliferation in the CF intestine may contribute to increased risk for intestinal tumors.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/156562_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (27K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf807forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd24baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176497dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2b265_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Depression is a polygenic trait that causes extensive periods of disability and increases the risk of suicide, a leading cause of death in young people. Previous genetic studies have identified a number of common risk variants which have increased in number in line with increasing sample sizes. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the largest single population-based cohort to date, UK Biobank. This allowed us to estimate the effects of {approx} 8 million genetic variants in 320,000 people for three depression phenotypes: broad depression, probable major depressive disorder (MDD), and International Classification of Diseases (ICD, version 9 or 10)-coded MDD. Each phenotype was found to be significantly genetically correlated with the results from a previous independent study of clinically defined MDD. We identified 14 independent loci that were significantly associated (P < 5 x 10-8) with broad depression, two independent variants for probable MDD, and one independent variant for ICD-coded MDD. Gene-based analysis of our GWAS results with MAGMA revealed 46 regions significantly associated (P < 2.77 x 10-6) with broad depression, two significant regions for probable MDD and one significant region for ICD-coded MDD. Gene region-based analysis of our GWAS results with MAGMA revealed 59 regions significantly associated (P < 6.02 x 10-6) with broad depression, of which 27 were also detected by gene-based analysis. Variants for broad depression were enriched in pathways for excitatory neurotransmission, mechanosensory behavior, postsynapse, neuron spine and dendrite. This study provides a number of novel genetic risk variants that can be leveraged to elucidate the mechanisms of MDD and low mood.",

Using TRiP we show that a memory-inducing experience creates a distinct translational state in mouse CA1 pyramidal cells. The experience-dependent translation state is characterized by enhanced translation of protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs) including numerous components of the actin cytoskeleton and calcium/calmodulin binding proteins, and by decreased translation of a defined subset of genes containing upstream ORFs (uORFs). Using animals heterozygous for an unphosphorylatable allele of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), we show that dephosphorylation of eIF2 contributes significantly to the experience-dependent translation state.

    "abstract": "Gut microbiome composition and function are symbiotically linked with host health, and altered in metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Three recognized mechanisms exist by which the microbiome influences the gut-brain axis: modification of autonomic/sensorimotor connections, immune activation, and neuroendocrine pathway regulation. We hypothesized interactions between circulating gut-derived microbial metabolites and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also contribute to the gut-brain axis. Propionate, produced from dietary substrates by colonic bacteria, stimulates intestinal gluconeogenesis and is associated with reduced stress behaviours, but its potential endocrine role has not been addressed. After demonstrating expression of the propionate receptor FFAR3 on human brain endothelium, we examined the impact of a physiologically relevant propionate concentration (1 M) on BBB properties in vitro. Propionate inhibited pathways associated with non-specific microbial infections via a CD14-dependent mechanism, suppressed expression of LRP-1 and protected the BBB from oxidative stress via NRF2 (NFE2L2) signaling. Together, these results suggest gut-derived microbial metabolites interact with the BBB, representing a fourth facet of the gut-brain axis that warrants further attention.",

    "abstract": "Deciding where to eat and raise offspring carries important fitness consequences for all animals, especially if foraging, feeding and reproduction increase the risk of exposure to pathogens. In insects with complete metamorphosis, foraging occurs mainly during the larval stage, while oviposition decisions are taken by adult-stage females. Selection for infection avoidance behaviours may therefore be developmentally uncoupled. Using a combination of experimental infections and behavioural choice assays, here we tested if Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies avoid potentially infectious environments at distinct developmental stages. When given conspecific fly carcasses as a food source, larval-stage flies did not discriminate between carcasses that were clean or infected with the pathogenic Drosophila C Virus (DCV), even though scavenging was a viable route of DCV transmission. Adult females however, discriminated between different oviposition sites, laying more eggs near a clean rather than an infectious carcass if they were healthy; DCV-infected females did not discriminate between the two environments. While potentially risky, laying eggs near potentially infectious carcasses was always preferred to sites containing only fly medium. Our findings suggest that infection avoidance can play an important role in how mothers provision their offspring, and underline the need to consider infection avoidance behaviours at multiple life-stages.",

At the same time, extant approaches to computational RNA structure prediction have limited applicability and reliability. In this paper we provide a method to solve a simpler yet still biologically relevant problem: prediction of secondary RNA structure using structure of different molecules as a template.\\n\\nOur method identifies conserved and unconserved subsequences within an RNA molecule. For conserved subsequences, the template structure is directly transferred into the generated structure and combined with de-novo predicted structure for the unconserved subsequences with low evolutionary conservation. The method also determines, when the generated structure is unreliable.\\n\\nThe method is validated using experimentally identified structures. The accuracy of the method exceeds that of classical prediction algorithms and constrained prediction methods. This is demonstrated by comparison using large number of heterogeneous RNAs. The presented method is fast and robust, and useful for various applications requiring knowledge of secondary structures of individual RNA sequences.",

    "abstract": "RioK1 has recently been shown to play important roles in cancers, but its posttranslational regulation is largely unknown. Here we report that RioK1 is methylated at K411 by SETD7 methyltransferase, and that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) reverses its methylation. The mutated RioK1 (K411R) that cannot be methylated exhibits a longer half-life than does the methylated RioK1. FBXO6 specifically interacts with K411-methylated RioK1 through its FBA domain to induce RioK1 ubiquitination. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates RioK1 at T410, which stabilizes RioK1 by antagonizing K411 methylation and impeding the recruitment of FBXO6 to RioK1. Functional experiments demonstrate the RioK1 methylation reduces the tumor growth and metastasis in CRC and GC. Importantly, the protein levels of CK2 and LSD1 show an inverse correlation with FBXO6 and SETD7 expression in human CRC tissues. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of a RioK1 methylation-phosphorylation switch in determining CRC and GC development.",

    "abstract": "Unequal cell division (UCD) is a fundamental process responsible for creating sibling cell size asymmetry; however, how microtubules are specifically depolymerized on one aster of the mitotic spindle creating a smaller sibling cell during UCD has remained elusive. Using invertebrate chordate embryos (ascidian) that possess a large cortical structure (CAB) that causes UCD, we identified a microtubule depolymerase (Kif2) involved in creating cell size asymmetry. Kif2 localizes to the cortical subdomain of endoplasmic reticulum in the CAB. During three successive UCDs, Kif2 protein accumulates at the CAB during interphase and is delocalized from the CAB in mid mitosis. Rapid imaging of microtubule dynamics at the cortex revealed that microtubules do not penetrate the CAB during interphase. Inhibition of Kif2 function prevents the development of mitotic aster asymmetry and centrosome movement towards the CAB thereby blocking UCD, whereas locally increasing microtubule depolymerization causes exaggerated asymmetric spindle positioning. This study provides insights into the fundamental process of UCD and for the first time shows that a microtubule depolymerase is localized to a cortical site controlling UCD.",

    "abstract": "Human-generated ruderal habitats are abundant, but challenging for plants. Some ruderal habitats, however, provide networked corridors (e.g. roadsides and railways) that can facilitate rapid long-distance spread of successfully adapted variants. Here we use transcriptomic and genomic analyses, coupled with genetic mapping and transgenics to understand adaptation to railways in Arabidopsis arenosa. We show normally perennial A. arenosa switched to rapid cycling, a common adaptation for ruderal plants, at least twice upon railway colonization. We further show substantial gene flow from a widely distributed railway colonist likely contributed to secondary colonization by a non-ruderal type, highlighting how connectivity can affect adaptability. We find loss of expression of the reproductive repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is likely primarily responsible for rapid cycling in the widely distributed railway variant. However, a second railway colonist in the Alps also cycles rapidly, but retains high FLC. Some alleles in this population encode non-functional proteins, suggesting FLC has started to decay, but most are functional. Instead, this population likely circumvents FLC via a derived allele of CONSTANS (CO), which shows strong evidence of selection in this population. Importantly, we find this CO allele arrived via gene flow from the widespread ruderal, where it was also previously under selection. This suggests ruderal adaptation may have been progressive, perhaps in both cases, with FLC-circumvention arising first, and FLC loss arising later but ultimately obscuring its earlier circumvention. These snapshots of railway adaptation highlight that gene flow from widespread ruderals can provide opportunities for subsequent adaptation by local genotypes.",

Double strand breaks are the substrate of several bacterial DNA repair pathways, paving the way for interactions between them and CRISPR-Cas systems. Here, we hypothesized that non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) interferes with type II CRISPR-Cas systems. We tested this idea by studying the patterns of co-occurrence of the two systems in bacterial genomes. We found that NHEJ and type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems only co-occur once among 5563 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. We investigated experimentally the possible molecular interactions causing this negative association using the NHEJ pathway from Bacillus subtilis and the type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems from Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Our results suggest that the NHEJ system has no effect on type II-A CRISPR-Cas interference and adaptation. On the other hand, we provide evidence for the inhibition of NHEJ repair by the Csn2 protein from type II-A CRISPR-Cas system. Our findings give insights on the complex interactions between CRISPR- Cas systems and repair mechanisms in bacteria and contribute to explain the scattered distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems in bacterial genomes.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the history of ancestor divergence can yield critical insight into protein function. However, reconstruction of this evolutionary history is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, as selection and alignment of extant descendants to represent each ancestor dramatically affects phylogenetic inference of all ancestral nodes. Although historically problematic and somewhat ignored, here we capitalize on that variability by subsampling descendants of each ancestor, generating an ensemble of reconstructions, and integrating over the resulting topological diversity to improve the accuracy of ancestor divergence reconstruction, above the level of subsampling. First, we demonstrate that reproducibility of an all-sequence, single-alignment reconstruction, measured by comparing topologies inferred from 90% subsamples, can be used to assess the likely accuracy of single-alignment reconstructions. We believe this relationship results from modulation of the likelihood landscape around the true topology induced by alignments of resampled sequences. Second, we hypothesize that topological features observed consistently across an ensemble of subsampled reconstructions best reflect true evolutionary history, despite the inaccuracy of each individual reconstruction due to the failure by substitution models to infer the correct sequence of mutations that produced the input sequences. We present a scoring function that evaluates topologies on the basis of their consistency with features extracted from an ensemble, and a reconstruction algorithm (ASPEN) that produces and ranks topologies according to that function. We test our methodology on 600 simulated protein families and the LacI transcription factor family, and find that ASPEN topologies are significantly more accurate than single-alignment reconstructions.",

The closed-loop system is highly tunable, allowing a regulated protein of interest to be driven to a desired level and maintained there with precision. Realized using a sigma/anti-sigma protein pair, the integral controller ensures that regulation is maintained in the face of perturbations that lead to the regulated proteins degradation, thus serving as a proof-of-concept prototype of integral feedback implementation in living cells. When suitably optimized, this integral controller may be utilized as a general-purpose robust regulator for genetic circuits with unknown or partially-known topologies and parameters.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding puzzle in human genetics is what limits the clinical manifestation of hundreds of hereditary diseases to certain tissues or cell types, while their causal genes are present and expressed throughout the human body. Here we considered a possible role for paralogs of causal genes in affecting this tissue selectivity. It has been shown across organisms that paralogs can compensate for the loss of each other. We hypothesized that specifically in the disease tissue causal genes and their paralogs are imbalanced, leading to insufficient compensation and to the emergence of disease phenotypes. While demonstrated previously in the context of few specific diseases, this hypothesis was never assessed quantitatively at large-scale. For this, we analyzed functional relationships between causal genes and their paralogs associated with 112 tissue-selective hereditary diseases. To test our hypothesis we used several large-scale omics datasets, including RNA sequencing profiles of over 30 different human tissues. Indeed, the expression of causal genes and their paralogs was significantly imbalanced in their disease tissues compared to unaffected tissues. Imbalanced expression was evident across different disease tissues, and was common to causal genes with single or multiple paralogs. This imbalance was driven by significant upregulation of the causal gene in its disease tissue, often combined with significant down-regulation of a paralog. Nevertheless, in additional 20% of the causal genes, a paralog alone was significantly down-regulated in the disease tissue. Our results suggest that dosage relationships between paralogs affect the phenotypic outcome of germline aberrations, adding paralogs as important modifiers of disease manifestation.",

Initially mainly applied to reconstruct the metabolism of model organisms, the availability of increasingly sophisticated reconstruction methods and more extensive biochemical databases now make it possible to reconstruct GEMs for less characterized organisms as well, and have the potential to unravel the metabolism in pathogen-host systems. Here we present a GEM for the oomycete plant pathogen Phytophthora infestans as a first step towards an integrative model with its host. We predict the biochemical reactions in different cellular compartments and investigate the gene-protein-reaction associations in this model to get an impression of the biochemical capabilities of P. infestans. Furthermore, we generate life stage-specific models to place the transcriptomic changes of genes encoding metabolic enzymes into a functional context. In sporangia and zoospores there is an overall downregulation, most strikingly reflected in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. To investigate the robustness of the GEM, we simulate gene deletions to predict which enzymes are essential for in vitro growth. While there is room for improvement, this first model is an essential step towards an understanding of P. infestans and its interactions with plants as a system, which will help to formulate new hypotheses on infection mechanisms and disease prevention.",

Here, we show that each DNA polymerase has distinct patterns of association with active and stalled replication forks. Pol  is enriched at extending Okazaki fragments of active and stalled forks. In contrast, although Pol {delta} contacts the nascent lagging strands of active and stalled forks, it binds to only the matured (and not elongating) Okazaki fragments of stalled forks. Pol {varepsilon} has a greater contact with the nascent ssDNA of leading strand on active forks compared with stalled forks.

    "abstract": "The Kingman coalescent, widely used in genetics, is known to be a good approximation when the sample size is small relative to the population size. In this article, we investigate how large the sample size can get without violating the coalescent approximation. If the haploid population size is 2N, we prove that for samples of size N1/3-{epsilon},{epsilon} > 0, coalescence under the Wright-Fisher (WF) model converges in probability to the Kingman coalescent in the limit of large N. For samples of size N2/5-{epsilon} or smaller, the WF coalescent converges to a mixture of the Kingman coalescent and what we call the mod-2 coalescent. For samples of size N1/2 or larger, triple collisions in the WF genealogy of the sample become important. The sample size for which the probability of conformance with the Kingman coalescent is 95% is found to be 1.47 x N0.31 for N [isin] [103, 105], showing the pertinence of the asymptotic theory. The probability of no triple collisions is found to be 95% for sample sizes equal to 0.92 x N0.49, which too is in accord with the asymptotic theory.\\n\\nVarying population sizes are handled using algorithms that calculate the probability of WF coalescence agreeing with the Kingman model or taking place without triple collisions. For a sample of size 100, the probabilities of coalescence according to the Kingman model are 2%, 0%, 1%, and 0% in four models of human population with constant N, constant N except for two bottlenecks, recent exponential growth, and increasing recent exponential growth, respectively. For the same four demographic models and the same sample size, the probabilities of coalescence with no triple collision are 92%, 73%, 88%, and 87%, respectively. Visualizations of the algorithm show that even distant bottlenecks can impede agreement between the coalescent and the WF model.\\n\\nFinally, we prove that the WF sample frequency spectrum for samples of size N1/3-{epsilon} or smaller converges to the classical answer for the coalescent.",

    "abstract": "Introns can be extraordinarily large and they account for the majority of the DNA sequence in human genes. However, little is known about their population patterns of structural variation and their functional implication. By combining the most extensive maps of CNVs in human populations, we have found that intronic losses are the most frequent copy number variants (CNVs) in protein-coding genes in human, with more than 12,986 intronic deletions, affecting 4,147 genes (including 1,154 essential genes and 1,638 disease-related genes). These intronic length variation results in dozens of genes showing extreme population variability in size, with 40 genes with 10 or more different sizes and up to 150 allelic sizes. Intronic losses are frequent in evolutionarily ancient genes that are highly conserved at the protein sequence level. This result contrasts with losses overlapping exons, which are observed less often than expected by chance and almost exclusively affect primate-specific genes. An integrated analysis of CNVs and RNA-seq data showed that intronic loss can be associated with significant differences in gene expression levels in the population (CNV-eQTLs). These intronic CNV-eQTLs regions are enriched for intronic enhancers and can be associated with expression differences of other genes showing long distance intron-promoter 3D interactions. Our data suggests that intronic structural variation of protein-coding genes can exert an important role in maintaining the variability of gene expression and splicing in human populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMost human genes have introns that have to be removed after a gene is transcribed from DNA to RNA because they not encode information to translate RNA into proteins. As mutations in introns do not affect protein sequences, they are usually ignored when looking for normal or pathogenic genomic variation. However, introns comprise about half of the human non-coding genome and they can have important regulatory roles. We show that deletions of intronic regions appear more frequent than previously expected in the healthy population, with a significant proportion of genes with evolutionary ancient and essential functions carrying them. This finding was very surprising, as ancient genes tend to have high conservation of their coding sequence. However, we show that deletions of their non-coding intronic sequence can produce considerable changes in their locus length. We found that a significant number of these intronic deletions are associated with under- or over-expression of the affected genes or distant genes interacting in 3D. Our data suggests that the frequent gene length variation in protein-coding genes resulting from intronic CNVs might influence their regulation in different individuals.",

Here we study the dynamics of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis by tracking individual cells in live analysis of mouse embryos. We report that during an initial phase, FHF precursors differentiate rapidly to form a cardiac crescent, while limited morphogenesis takes place. In a second phase, no differentiation occurs while extensive morphogenesis, including splanchnic mesoderm sliding over the endoderm, results in HT formation. In a third phase, cardiac precursor differentiation resumes and contributes to SHF-derived regions and the dorsal closure of the HT. These results reveal tissue-level coordination between morphogenesis and differentiation during HT formation and provide a new framework to understand heart development.",

    "abstract": "True seals have the shortest lactation periods of any group of placental mammal. Most are capital breeders that undergo short, intense lactations, during which they fast while transferring substantial proportions of their body reserves to their pups, which they then abruptly desert. Milk was collected from Atlantic grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) periodically from birth until near desertion. Milk protein profiles matured within 24 hours or less, indicating the most rapid transition from colostrum to mature phase lactation yet observed. There was an unexpected persistence of immunoglobulin G almost until weaning, potentially indicating prolonged trans-intestinal transfer of IgG. Among components of innate immune protection were found fucosyllactose and siallylactose that are thought to impede colonisation by pathogens and encourage an appropriate gut microbiome. These oligosaccharides decreased from early lactation to almost undetectable levels by weaning. Taurine levels were initially high, then fell, possibly indicative of taurine dependency in seals, and progressive depletion of maternal reserves. Metabolites that could signal changes in the mothers metabolism of fats, such as nicotinamide and derivatives, rose from virtual absence, and acetylcarnitines fell. It is therefore possible that indicators of maternal metabolic strain exist that signal the imminence of desertion.",

    "abstract": "Social insects, particularly bees and ants, show exceptional large-scale navigational skills to find and carry back food to their nests. Honey bees further evolved a symbolic communication to direct nest mates to attractive food sources. Till now it is unclear how these capabilities evolved. Sixty years ago, Vincent Dethier demonstrated that a small-scale sugar-elicited search behavior identified in flies shows remarkable similarities with honey bee dance behavior. Those findings suggested that both behaviors are based on common mechanisms and are likely evolutionary related. We now present for the first time a detailed comparison of the sugar-elicited search behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera. In both species, intake of sugar elicits a complex of searching responses. The most obvious response was an increase in turning frequency, but more importantly we found that flies and honey bees returned to the location of the sugar drop. They even returned to the food location when we prevented them from using visual and chemosensory cues indicating that this small scale local search involves path integration mechanisms. Finally, we show that visual landmarks presented in the vicinity of the sugar drop affected the search trajectory and in honey bees the sugar intake induced learning of landmarks. Together, our experiments indicate that the sugar-elicited local search exhibits two major behavioral capabilities of large-scale navigation, path integration and landmark orientation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTo search for food social insects evolved sophisticated strategies of spatial orientation and large-scale navigation. We now show that even a small-scale local search behavior in solitary flies and social honey bees involves path integration and landmark learning two major mechanisms of large-scale navigation. We propose that in the future sugar-elicited local search can be used to identify neural circuits involved in navigation, path integration, and landmark learning.",

With several approaches, studies have proposed different hypotheses relating female dispersion and infanticide as drivers for the evolution of social monogamy. Here, we used an agent-based model, that allowed us to examine how different mating behaviors affect populations in a controlled computational environment. We found that the evolution of social monogamy does not rely on a single factor. Rather, our experimental results support an interplay of different factors in the evolution of social monogamy - female dispersion and availability and breeding season duration - and suggests that polygamy will only evolve in populations with a female-biased operational sex ratio or one where cheating is common. These results can explain why social monogamy is so uncommon in mammals and points to new lines for ethological investigation of mammalian behavior.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement can act in response to maladaptive hybridization by selecting for increased discrimination against heterospecifics mates in sympatry compared to allopatry (i.e., reproductive character displacement - RCD). Additionally, reinforcement can select for increased discrimination against heterospecifics in a fighting context in sympatry compared to allopatry (i.e., agonistic character displacement - ACD). Because it directly affects conspecific recognition traits (signals and/or preferences), reinforcement between two species in sympatry can incidentally cause behavioral isolation among populations within a species, termed cascade reinforcement. Here we demonstrate that a pattern consistent with male-driven RCD and ACD is present between two groups of darters (orangethroat darter clade Ceasia and rainbow darter Etheostoma caeruleum). Increased male discrimination against heterospecific females as mates and increased male discrimination against heterospecific males as competitors is present in sympatry. Furthermore, there is a pattern consistent with male-driven cascade RCD and cascade ACD within Ceasia. We found low levels of discrimination between two species of Ceasia that occur in allopatry from one another and in allopatry with E. caeruleum. This result contrasts that of a recent study which observed high levels of behavioral isolation between Ceasia species that occurred in sympatry with E. caeruleum. We suggest reinforcement between Ceasia and E. caeruleum in sympatry has led to the evolution of behavioral isolation between lineages within Ceasia that occur in sympatry with E. caeruleum but in allopatry with respect to one another (i.e., cascade reinforcement). This study demonstrates the ability of male behavior to simultaneously drive sympatric and allopatric speciation via reinforcement.",

    "abstract": "Heterosis, the superiority of hybrids over their parents for quantitative traits, represents a crucial issue in plant and animal breeding. Heterosis has given rise to countless genetic, genomic and molecular studies, but has rarely been investigated from the point of view of systems biology. We hypothesized that heterosis is an emergent property of living systems resulting from frequent concave relationships between genotypic variables and phenotypes, or between different phenotypic levels. We chose the enzyme-flux relationship as a model of the concave genotype-phenotype (GP) relationship, and showed that heterosis can be easily created in the laboratory. First, we reconstituted in vitro the upper part of glycolysis. We simulated genetic variability of enzyme activity by varying enzyme concentrations in test tubes. Mixing the content of \\\"parental\\\" tubes resulted in \\\"hybrids\\\", whose fluxes were compared to the parental fluxes. Frequent heterotic fluxes were observed, under conditions that were determined analytically and confirmed by computer simulation. Second, to test this model in a more realistic situation, we modeled the glycolysis/fermentation network in yeast by considering one input flux, glucose, and two output fluxes, glycerol and acetaldehyde. We simulated genetic variability by randomly drawing parental enzyme concentrations under various conditions, and computed the parental and hybrid fluxes using a system of differential equations. Again we found that a majority of hybrids exhibited positive heterosis for metabolic fluxes. Cases of negative heterosis were due to local convexity between certain enzyme concentrations and fluxes. In both approaches, heterosis was maximized when the parents were phenotypically close and when the distributions of parental enzyme concentrations were contrasted and constrained. These conclusions are not restricted to metabolic systems: they only depend on the concavity of the GP relationship, which is commonly observed at various levels of the phenotypic hierarchy, and could account for the pervasiveness of heterosis.",

Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using a variety of bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, where the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across a variety of diifferent probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian Process function learning--combined with an optimistic Upper Confidence Bound sampling strategy--provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable, and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplanktonic communities maintain a high diversity in a seemingly homogeneous environment, competing for the same set of resources. Many theories have been proposed to explain this coexistence despite likely competition, such as contrasted responses to temporal environmental variation. However, theory has developed at a faster pace than its empirical evaluation using field data, that requires to infer biotic and abiotic drivers of community dynamics from observational time series. Here, we combine autoregressive models with a data set spanning more than 20 years of biweekly plankton counts and abiotic variables, including nutrients and physical variables. By comparing models dominated by nutrients or physical variables (hydrodynamics and climate), we first explore which abiotic factors contribute more to phytoplankton growth and decline. We find that physical drivers - such as irradiance, wind, and salinity - explain some of the variability in abundances unexplained by biotic interactions. In contrast, responses to nutrients explain less of phytoplankton variability. Concerning biotic drivers of community dynamics, multivariate autoregressive models reveal that competition between different groups (at the genus level for most) has a much weaker effect on population growth rates than competition within a group. In fact, the few biotic interactions between genera that are detected are frequently positive. Hence, our system is unlikely to be best represented as a set of competitors whose differing responses to fluctuating environments allow coexistence, as in \\\"paradox of the plankton\\\" models with a storage effect or a relative nonlinearity of competition. Coexistence is more likely to result from stabilizing niche differences, manifested through high intragroup density-dependence. Competition between planktonic groups and nutrients are often invoked as drivers of phytoplankton dynamics; our findings suggest instead that more attention should be given to the physical structure of the environment and natural enemies, for coastal phytoplankton at least.",

Much of this discordance is assumed to result from biological processes. However, variation among gene trees can also be a consequence of systematic error driven by poor model fit, and the relative importance of these biological versus methodological factors in explaining gene tree variation is a major unresolved question in phylogenetics. Using mitochondrial genomes to control for biological causes of gene tree variation, we estimate the extent of gene tree discordance driven by systematic error and employ posterior prediction to highlight the role of model fit. We find that the amount of discordance among mitochondrial gene trees is similar to the amount of discordance found in other studies that assume only biological causes of variation. This similarity suggests that the role of systematic error in generating gene tree variation is underappreciated and that critical evaluation of the fit between assumed models and the data used for inference is important for the resolution of unresolved phylogenetic questions.",

    "abstract": "Microbial eukaryotes are integral components of natural microbial communities and their inclusion is critical for many ecosystem studies yet the majority of published metagenome analyses ignore eukaryotes. In order to include eukaryotes in environmental studies we propose a method to recover eukaryotic genomes from complex metagenomic samples. A key step for genome recovery is separation of eukaryotic and prokaryotic fragments. We developed a kmer-based strategy, EukRep, for eukaryotic sequence identification and applied it to environmental samples to show that it enables genome recovery, genome completeness evaluation and prediction of metabolic potential. We used this approach to test the effect of addition of organic carbon on a geyser-associated microbial community and detected a substantial change of the community metabolism, with selection against almost all candidate phyla bacteria and archaea and for eukaryotes. Near complete genomes were reconstructed for three fungi placed within the eurotiomycetes and an arthropod. While carbon fixation and sulfur oxidation were important functions in the geyser community prior to carbon addition, the organic carbon impacted community showed enrichment for secreted proteases, secreted lipases, cellulose targeting CAZymes, and methanol oxidation. We demonstrate the broader utility of EukRep by reconstructing and evaluating relatively high quality fungal, protist, and rotifer genomes from complex environmental samples. This approach opens the way for cultivation-independent analyses of whole microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial tubulin FtsZ2 polymerizes to form a discontinuous cytokinetic ring that drives bacterial cell division by directing local cell wall synthesis. FtsZ comprises a polymerizing GTPase domain, an intrinsically disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) and a C-terminal conserved -helix (CTC). FtsZ protofilaments align circumferentially in the cell, with the CTC mediating attachment to membrane-associated division proteins. The dynamic turnover and treadmilling of clusters of FtsZ protofilaments guides cell wall synthesis and constriction. The nature and regulation of the interactions that result in the assembly of protofilaments into dynamic clusters is unknown. Here, we describe a role for the CTL of Caulobacter crescentus FtsZ as an intrinsic regulator of lateral interactions between protofilaments in vitro. FtsZ lacking its CTL ({Delta}CTL) shows dramatically increased propensity to form long multifilament bundles compared to wildtype (WT). {Delta}CTL has reduced GTP hydrolysis rate compared to WT. However, reducing protofilament turnover in WT is not sufficient to induce bundling. Surprisingly, binding of the membrane-anchoring protein FzlC disrupts {Delta}CTL bundling in a CTC-dependent manner. Moreover, the CTL affects the ability of FtsZ curving protein FzlA to promote formation of helical bundles. We conclude that the CTL of FtsZ influences polymer structure and dynamics both through intrinsic effects on lateral interactions and turnover and by influencing extrinsic regulation of FtsZ by binding partners. Our characterization of CTL function provides a biochemical handle for understanding the relationship between Z-ring structure and function in bacterial cytokinesis.",

To help resolve these discrepancies, we examined developmental trajectories using three independent longitudinal samples of participants in the age-span of 8-22 years (total 216 participants and 467 scans). These datasets, including Pittsburgh (PIT; University of Pittsburgh, USA), NeuroCognitive Development (NCD; University of Oslo, Norway), and Orygen Adolescent Development Study (OADS; The University of Melbourne, Australia), span three countries and were analyzed together and in parallel using mixed-effects modeling with both generalized additive models and general linear models. For all regions and across all samples, males were found to have significantly larger volumes as compared to females, and significant sex differences were seen in age trajectories over time. However, direct comparison of sample trajectories and sex differences identified within samples were not consistent. The trajectories for the amygdala, putamen, and nucleus accumbens were most consistent between the three samples. Our results suggest that even after using similar preprocessing and analytic techniques, additional factors, such as image acquisition or sample composition may contribute to some of the discrepancies in sex specific patterns in subcortical brain changes across adolescence, and highlight region-specific variations in congruency of developmental trajectories.",

We gathered the largest known taxonomic sample of weevils representing four families and 17 subfamilies to perform a study of weevil endosymbionts. We found that the diversity of endosymbionts is exceedingly high, with as many as 44 distinct kinds of endosymbionts detected.

    "abstract": "The incredible diversity of floral color and pattern in nature is largely determined by the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin and carotenoid biosynthetic genes. While the transcriptional control of anthocyanin biosynthesis is well understood, little is known about the factors regulating the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in flowers. Here, we characterize the Reduced Carotenoid Pigmentation 2 (RCP2) locus from two monkeyflower (Mimulus) species, the bumblebee-pollinated M. lewisii and hummingbird-pollinated M. verbenaceus. We show that loss-of-function mutations of RCP2 cause drastic down-regulation of the entire carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in these species. Through bulk segregant analysis and transgenic experiments, we have identified the causal gene underlying RCP2, encoding a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein that is closely related to the Arabidopsis Reduced Chloroplast Coverage (REC) proteins. RCP2 appears to regulate carotenoid biosynthesis independently of RCP1, a previously identified R2R3-MYB master regulator of carotenoid biosynthesis. We show that RCP2 is required for chromoplast development and suggest that it most likely regulates the expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes through chromoplast-to-nucleus retrograde signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that M. verbenaceus is just as amenable to chemical mutagenesis and in planta transformation as the more extensively studied M. lewisii, making these two species an excellent platform for comparative developmental genetics studies of two closely related species with dramatic phenotypic divergence.",

In humans, the placenta forms the key interface between the maternal and fetal compartments and forms the primary barrier that restricts the hematogenous spread of microorganisms. Here, we utilized primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells isolated from full-term placentas and human mid-gestation chorionic villous explants to determine the mechanisms by which human trophoblasts restrict and respond to T. gondii infection. We show that placental syncytiotrophoblasts, multinucleated cells that are in direct contact with maternal blood, restrict T. gondii infection at distinct stages of the parasite lytic cycle--at the time of attachment and also during intracellular replication. Utilizing comparative RNAseq transcriptional profiling, we also show that human placental trophoblasts at both mid- and late-stages of gestation induce the chemokine CCL22 in response to T. gondii infection, which relies on the secretion of parasite effector(s). Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which the human placenta restricts the vertical transmission of T. gondii at early and late stages of human pregnancy, and demonstrate the existence of at least two interferon-independent pathways that restrict T. gondii access to the fetal compartment.\\n\\nSignificance statementToxoplasma gondii is a major source of congenital disease worldwide and must breach the placental barrier to be transmitted from maternal blood to the developing fetus.

    "abstract": "Data assimilation, defined as the fusion of data with preexisting knowledge, is particularly suited to elucidating underlying phenomena from noisy/insufficient observations. Although this approach has been widely used in diverse fields, only recently have efforts been directed to problems in neuroscience, using mainly intracranial data and thus limiting its applicability to invasive measurements involving electrode implants. Here we intend to apply data assimilation to non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to infer brain states and their characteristics. For this purpose, we use Kalman filtering to combine synthetic EEG data with a coupled neural-mass model together with Arys model of the head, which projects intracranial signals onto the scalp. Our results show that using several extracranial electrodes allows to successfully estimate the state and parameters of the neural masses and their interactions, whereas one single electrode provides only a very partial and insufficient view of the system. The superiority of using multiple extracranial electrodes over using only one, be it intra- or extracranial, is shown over a wide variety of dynamical behaviours. Our results show potential towards future clinical applications of the method.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo completely understand brain function, we will need to integrate experimental information into a consistent theoretical framework. Invasive techniques as EcoG recordings, together with models that describe the brain at the mesoscale, provide valuable information about the brain state and its dynamical evolution when combined with techniques coming from control theory, such as the Kalman filter. This method, which is specifically designed to deal with systems with noisy or imperfect data, combines experimental data with theoretical models assuming Bayesian inference. So far, implementations of the Kalman filter have not been suited for non-invasive measures like EEG. Here we attempt to overcome this situation by introducing a model of the head that allows to transfer the intracranial signals produced by a mesoscopic model to the scalp in the form of EEG recordings. Our results show the advantages of using multichannel EEG recordings, which are extended in space and allow to discriminate signals produced by the interaction of coupled columns. The extension of the Kalman method presented here can be expected to expand the applicability of the technique to all situations where EEG recordings are used, including the routine monitoring of illnesses or rehabilitation tasks, brain-computer interface protocols, and transcranial stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Anatomical, neuroimaging and lesion studies indicate that prefrontal cortex (PFC) can be subdivided into different subregions supporting distinct aspects of decision making. However, explanations of neuronal computations within these subregions varies widely across studies. An integrated and mechanistic account of PFC function therefore remains elusive. Resolving these debates demands a rich dataset that directly contrasts neuronal activity across multiple PFC subregions within a single paradigm, whilst experimentally controlling factors such as the order, duration and frequency in which choice options are attended and compared. Here, we contrast neuronal population responses between macaque orbitofrontal (OFC), anterior cingulate (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) during sequential value-guided information search and choice. From the first fixation of choice-related stimuli, a strong triple dissociation of information encoding emerges in parallel across these PFC subregions. As further information is gathered, population responses in OFC reflect an attention-guided value comparison process. Meanwhile, parallel signals in ACC reflect belief updating in light of new evidence, integration of that evidence to a decision bound, and an emerging action plan for which option should be chosen. Our findings demonstrate the co-existence of multiple, distributed decision-related computations across PFC subregions during value-guided choice. They provide a synthesis of several competing accounts of PFC function.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the value of using deep learning models for mapping and characterizing how the brain represents and organizes information for natural vision. However, modeling the relationship between deep learning models and the brain (or encoding models), requires measuring cortical responses to large and diverse sets of natural visual stimuli from single subjects. This requirement limits prior studies to few subjects, making it difficult to generalize findings across subjects or for a population. In this study, we developed new methods to transfer and generalize encoding models across subjects. To train encoding models specific to a subject, the models trained for other subjects were used as the prior models and were refined efficiently using Bayesian inference with a limited amount of data from the specific subject. To train encoding models for a population, the models were progressively trained and updated with incremental data from different subjects. For the proof of principle, we applied these methods to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from three subjects watching tens of hours of naturalistic videos, while deep residual neural network driven by image recognition was used to model the visual cortical processing. Results demonstrate that the methods developed herein provide an efficient and effective strategy to establish subject-specific or population-wide predictive models of cortical representations of high-dimensional and hierarchical visual features.",
