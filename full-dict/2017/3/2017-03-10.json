    "abstract": "Adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies were placed into one end of a tube near to repellents (benzaldehyde and heat) and away from the other end containing attractants (light and a favored temperature). They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped. It is proposed that the information from the different sensory receptors comes together at an intermediate, called \\\"inbetween\\\" (Inbet), that brings about a behavioral response. The Boss is defined here.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental advances are producing an avalanche of data on both neural connectivity and neural activity. To take full advantage of these two emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This problem of structure-driven activity has drawn major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons by developing a diagrammatic fluctuation expansion based on statistical field theory. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the networks' spiking activity. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how single-neuron nonlinearities--including those of different cell types--combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.",

A primary consideration was to make the mechanism accessible and affordable, and in doing so, lower the cases of Obstructive Sleep Apnea that go undiagnosed due to the cost and inconvenience associated with the traditional diagnosis method--a Polysomnogram. Bluetooth capability was an additional consideration so that the device would transmit data directly to an android smartphone, eliminating the need for an additional output mechanism. The total cost of the device, quite surprisingly, did not exceed $30, and therein rendered the device an accessible, affordable mechanism for diagnosis. Tests of the device on diagnosed patients yielded data consistent with the diagnosis, with a few false positives as a result of the excessive sensitivity of the sensors.",

    "abstract": "Cell polarization underlies many cellular and organismal functions. The GTPase Cdc42 orchestrates polarization in many contexts. In budding yeast, polarization is associated with a focus of Cdc42*GTP which is thought to self sustain by recruiting a complex containing Cla4, a Cdc42-binding effector, Bem1, a scaffold and Cdc24, a Cdc42 GEF. Using optogenetics, we probe yeast polarization and find that local recruitment of Cdc24 or Bem1 is sufficient to induce polarization by triggering self-sustaining Cdc42 activity. However, the response to these perturbations depends on the recruited molecule, the cell cycle stage, and existing polarization sites. Before cell cycle entry, recruitment of Cdc24, but not Bem1, induces a metastable pool of Cdc42 that is sustained by positive feedback. Upon Cdk1 activation, recruitment of either Cdc24 or Bem1 creates a stable site of polarization that induces budding and inhibits formation of competing sites. Local perturbations have therefore revealed unexpected features of polarity establishment.",

    "abstract": "The ability to learn is an evolutionarily conserved adaptation that remains incompletely understood. Genetically tractable model organisms facilitate mechanistic explanations of learning that span genetic, neural circuit, and behavioural levels. Many aspects of neural physiology, including processes that underlie learning (e.g. neurotransmitter release and long-lasting changes in synaptic strength), are regulated by brief and local changes in [m] levels of free intracellular Ca2+. On this scale, changes in [Ca2+] activate many Ca2+-sensors, including the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs). Here we reveal that the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of CaMK1/4, CMK-1, functions in primary sensory neurons to regulate responses to mechanical stimuli and behavioral plasticity, specifically habituation, a conserved form of non-associative learning. The habituation phenotypes of cmk-1 mutants were dependent on interstimulus interval (ISI), such that CMK-1 slows habituation at short ISIs, but promotes it at long ISIs. We predicted potential CaMK phosphorylation targets from catalytic site analysis of the human and C. elegans CaMKs and mutant analysis of these candidates implicated O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase, OGT-1, in mechanosensitivity and learning. Cell specific rescue and knockdown experiments showed that both CMK-1 and OGT-1 function cell autonomously in mechanosensory neurons to modulate learning. Interestingly, despite their similar mutant phenotypes, detailed behavioral analysis of double mutants demonstrated that CMK-1 and OGT-1 act in parallel genetic pathways. Our research identifies CMK-1 and OGT-1 as co-expressed yet independent regulators of mechanosensitivity and learning.",

    "abstract": "Rapid, accurate, and inexpensive genome sequencing promises to transform medical care. However, a critical hurdle to enabling personalized genomic medicine is predicting the functional impact of novel genomic variation. Various methods of missense variants pathogenicity prediction have been developed by now. Here we present a new strategy for developing a pathogenicity predictor of improved accuracy by applying and training a supervised machine learning model in a gene-specific manner. Our meta-predictor combines outputs of various existing predictors, supplements them with an extended set of stability and structural features of the protein, as well as its physicochemical properties, and adds information about allele frequency from various datasets. We used such a supervised gene-specific meta-predictor approach to train the model on the CFTR gene, and to predict pathogenicity of about 1,000 variants of unknown significance that we collected from various publicly available and internal resources. Our CFTR-specific meta-predictor based on the Random Forest model performs better than other machine learning algorithms that we tested, and also outperforms other available tools, such as CADD, MutPred, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2. Our predicted pathogenicity probability correlates well with clinical measures of Cystic Fibrosis patients and experimental functional measures of mutated CFTR proteins. Training the model on one gene, in contrast to taking a genome wide approach, allows taking into account structural features specific for a particular protein, thus increasing the overall accuracy of the predictor. Collecting data from several separate resources, on the other hand, allows to accumulate allele frequency information, estimated as the most important feature by our approach, for a larger set of variants. Finally, our predictor will be hosted on the ClinGen Consortium database to make it available to CF researchers and to serve as a feasibility pilot study for other Mendelian diseases.",

We found that cold stress survival with acclimation, cold stress survival without acclimation, and starvation resistance declined with age and that changes in the genetic architecture of each phenotype were consistent with MA predictions. We used a novel test for MA and AP by calculating the additive effect of polymorphisms across ages and found support for both MA and AP mechanisms in the age-related decline in stress tolerance. These patterns suggest both MA and AP contribute to age-related change in stress response and highlight the utility of association mapping to identify genetic shifts across age.",

    "abstract": "Precise coordination of synaptic connections ensures proper information flow within circuits. The activity of presynaptic organizing molecules signaling to downstream pathways is essential for such coordination, though such entities remain incompletely known. We show that LRP4, a conserved transmembrane protein known for its postsynaptic roles, functions presynaptically as an organizing molecule. In the Drosophila brain, LRP4 preferentially localizes to excitatory neuron terminals at or near active zones. Loss of presynaptic LRP4 reduces excitatory (not inhibitory) synapse number, impairs active zone architecture, and abolishes olfactory attraction - the latter of which can be suppressed by reducing presynaptic GABAB receptors. LRP4 overexpression increases synapse number in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting an instructive role and a common downstream synapse addition pathway. Mechanistically, LRP4 functions via the conserved kinase SRPK79D to ensure normal synapse number and behavior. This highlights a presynaptic function for LRP4, enabling deeper understanding of how synapse organization is coordinated.",

Two types of telocytes were identified: intraepithelial and stromal telocytes. Intraepithelial telocytes comprised the cellular lining of the lymph spaces where they shed the secretory vesicles. Stromal telocytes shed their secretory vesicles in the secondary circulatory vessels. Telocyte enlarged and exhibited high secretory activities. They exert their effect either by direct contact or by paracrine mode. In sanity treated samples, chloride cells enlarged and the mitochondria became cigar-shaped. pavement cells enlarged and micro-ridges elongated. Stromal telocytes established contact with stem cell and skeletal myoblast. Macrophages and Rodlet cells increased in number. In conclusion, intraepithelial and stromal responded to salinity stress by activation of cellular signaling. They play a major role in osmoregulation, immunity, and regeneration.",

However, most algorithms for constructing co-expression networks were developed in the microarray era, before high-throughput sequencing--with its unique statistical properties--became the norm for expression measurement. Here we develop Bayesian Relevance Networks, an algorithm that uses Bayesian reasoning about expression levels to account for the differing levels of uncertainty in expression measurements between highly- and lowly-expressed entities, and between samples with different sequencing depths. It combines data from groups of samples (e.g., replicates) to estimate group expression levels and confidence ranges. It then computes uncertainty-moderated estimates of cross-group correlations between entities, and uses permutation testing to assess their statistical significance. Using large scale miRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that our Bayesian update of the classical Relevance Networks algorithm provides improved reproducibility in co-expression estimates and lower false discovery rates in the resulting co-expression networks.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) play a key role in regulating plant development and response to environmental stimuli. While most genes revert to single copy after a duplication event, transcription factors are retained at a significantly higher rate. However, it is unclear why TF duplicates have higher rates of retention relative to other genes. In this study, we compared three types of features (expression, sequence, and conservation) of retained TFs following whole genome duplication (WGD) events to genes with other functions, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. We found that gene function groups with higher maximum expression but lower mean expression tended to have higher duplicate retention rate post WGD, though TFs in particular are retained more often than would be expected based on the features examined. Conversely, expression of individual genes was not associated with duplication, but sequence conservation was. Furthermore, we found that the evolution of TF expression patterns and cis-regulatory cites favors the partitioning of ancestral states among the resulting duplicates. In particular, we found that one duplicate retains the majority of ancestral expression and cis-regulatory sites, while the \\\"non-ancestral\\\" duplicate was enriched for novel regulatory sites. To investigate how this pattern of partitioning pattern evolved, we modeled the retention of ancestral states in duplicate pairs using a system of differential equations. Our findings indicate that duplicate pairs evolve to a partitioned state more often than away from it, which in combination with accumulation of new regulatory sites in non-ancestral duplicates, suggest that selection favors partitioning via neofunctionalization.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGene expression is controlled by regulatory proteins known as transcription factors. These factors control how an organism develops and responds to its environment. The evolution of transcription factor functions also contributes to the emergence of new species and crop domestication. In plants, new transcription factors mainly arise due to polyploidy, multiplication of the genome. Although most duplicated copies are lost following a genome duplication event, transcription factors are exceptional because they are often kept. Furthermore, we found that transcription factor duplicates that tend to diverge in how they are expressed and regulated in an unusual way where one copy mirrors the original, pre-duplication functional states of the ancestral gene, while the other loses the ancestral status and instead accumulates novel regulatory sites. Our results suggest these duplicate transcription factors may have been kept because one copy preserve ancestral function while the other has evolved new ones.",

    "abstract": "Identifying co-regulated genes can provide a useful approach for defining pathway-specific machinery in an organism. To be efficient, this approach relies on thorough genome annotation, which is not available for most organisms with sequenced genomes. Studies in Tetrahymena thermophila, the most experimentally accessible ciliate, have generated a rich transcriptomic database covering many well-defined physiological states. Genes that are involved in the same pathway show significant co-regulation, and screens based on gene co-regulation have identified novel factors in specific pathways, for example in membrane trafficking. However, a limitation has been the relatively sparse annotation of the Tetrahymena genome, making it impractical to approach genome-wide analyses. We have therefore developed an efficient approach to analyze both co-regulation and gene annotation, called the Co-regulation Data Harvester (CDH). The CDH automates identification of co-regulated genes by accessing the Tetrahymena transcriptome database, determines their orthologs in other organisms via reciprocal BLAST searches, and collates the annotations of those orthologs' functions. Inferences drawn from the CDH reproduce and expand upon experimental findings in Tetrahymena. The CDH, which is freely available, represents a powerful new tool for analyzing cell biological pathways in Tetrahymena. Moreover, to the extent that genes and pathways are conserved between organisms, the inferences obtained via the CDH should be relevant, and can be explored, in many other systems.",

    "abstract": "As glaciers thaw in response to warming, they release dissolved organic matter (DOM) to alpine lakes and streams. The United States contains an abundance of both alpine glaciers and rock glaciers. Differences in DOM composition and bioavailability between glacier types, like rock and ice glaciers, remain undefined. To assess differences in glacier and rock glacier DOM we evaluated bioavailability and molecular composition of DOM from four alpine catchments each with a glacier and a rock glacier at their headwaters. We assessed bioavailability of DOM by incubating each DOM source with a common microbial community and evaluated chemical characteristics of DOM before and after incubation using untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry based metabolomics (GC-MS). Prior to incubations, ice glacier and rock glacier DOM had similar C:N ratios and chemical diversity, but differences in DOM composition. Incubations with a common microbial community showed DOM from ice glacier meltwaters contained a higher proportion of bioavailable DOM (BDOM) and resulted in greater bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). After incubation, DOM composition from each source was statistically indistinguishable. This study provides an example of how MS based metabolomics can be used to assess effects of DOM composition on differences in bioavailability of DOM. Furthermore, it illustrates the importance of microbial metabolism in structuring composition of DOM. Even though rock glaciers had significantly less BDOM than ice glaciers, both glacial types still have potential to be important sources of BDOM to alpine headwaters over the coming decades.\\n\\nKey PointsBioavailability of organic matter released from glaciers is greater than that of rock glaciers in the Rocky Mountains.\\n\\nThe use of GC-MS for ecosystem metabolomics represents a novel approach for examining complex organic matter pools.\\n\\nBoth glaciers and rock glaciers supply highly bioavailable sources of organic matter to alpine headwaters in Colorado.",

    "abstract": "Perrault syndrome (PS) is a rare recessive disorder characterized by ovarian dysgenesis and sensorineural deafness. It is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, and previously mutations have been described in different genes, mostly related to mitochondrial proteostasis. We diagnosed three unrelated females with PS and set out to identify the underlying genetic cause using exome sequencing. We excluded mutations in the known PS genes, but identified a single homozygous mutation in the ERAL1 gene (c.707A>T; p.Asn236Ile). Since ERAL1 protein binds to the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and is involved in the assembly of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit, the identified variant represented a likely candidate. In silico analysis of a 3D model for ERAL1 suggested that the mutated residue hinders protein-substrate interactions, potentially affecting its function. On a molecular basis, PS skin fibroblasts had reduced ERAL1 protein levels. Complexome profiling of the cells showed an overall decrease in the levels of assembled small ribosomal subunit, indicating that the ERAL1 variant affects mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Moreover, levels of the 12S rRNA were reduced in the patients, and were fully rescued by lentiviral expression of wild type ERAL1. At the physiological level, mitochondrial respiration was markedly decreased in PS fibroblasts, confirming disturbed mitochondrial function. Finally, knockdown of the C. elegans ERAL1 homologue E02H1.2 almost completely blocked egg production in worms, mimicking the compromised fertility in PS-affected women. Our cross-species data in patient cells and worms support the hypothesis that mutations in ERAL1 can cause PS and are associated with changes in mitochondrial metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that conflict is common among gene trees in phylogenomic studies, and that less than one percent of genes may ultimately drive species tree inference in supermatrix analyses. Here, we examined two datasets where supermatrix and coalescent-based species trees conflict. We identified two highly influential \\\"outlier\\\" genes in each dataset. When removed from each dataset, the inferred supermatrix trees matched the topologies obtained from coalescent analyses. We also demonstrate that, while the outlier genes in the vertebrate dataset have been shown in a previous study to be the result of errors in orthology detection, the outlier genes from a plant dataset did not exhibit any obvious systematic error and therefore may be the result of some biological process yet to be determined. While topological comparisons among a small set of alternate topologies can be helpful in discovering outlier genes, they can be limited in several ways, such as assuming all genes share the same topology. Coalescent species tree methods relax this assumption but do not explicitly facilitate the examination of specific edges. Coalescent methods often also assume that conflict is the result of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here we explored a framework that allows for quickly examining alternative edges and support for large phylogenomic datasets that does not assume a single topology for all genes. For both datasets, these analyses provided detailed results confirming the support for coalescent-based topologies. This framework suggests that we can improve our understanding of the underlying signal in phylogenomic datasets by asking more targeted edge-based questions.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism underlying selective myelination of axons versus dendrites or neuronal somata relies on the expression of somatodendritic membrane myelination inhibitors (i.e. JAM2). However, axons still present long unmyelinated segments proposed to contribute to axonal plasticity and higher order brain functions. Why these segments remain unmyelinated is still an unresolved issue. The bifunctional lectin galectin-4 (Gal-4) organizes the transport of axon glycoproteins by binding to N-acetyllactosamine (LacNac) termini of N-glycans. We have shown that Gal-4 is sorted to segmental domains (G4Ds) along the axon surface, reminiscent of these long unmyelinated axon segments in cortical neurons. We report here that oligodendrocytes (OLGs) do not deposit myelin on Gal-4 covered surfaces or myelinate axonal G4Ds. In addition, Gal-4 interacts and co-localizes in G4Ds with contactin-1, a marker of non-myelinated nodes of Ranvier. Neither Gal-4 expression nor G4D dimensions are affected by myelin extracts or myelinating OLGs, but are reduced with neuron maturation. As in vitro, Gal-4 is consistently segregated from myelinated structures in the brain. Our data shape the novel concept that neurons establish and regulate axon membrane domains expressing Gal-4, the first inhibitor of myelination identified in axons, whose boundaries delineate myelination-incompetent axon segments along neuron development.",

A reliable method will greatly expand the scope of feasible collaborations and maximize the utilization of technical expertise. When choosing a method, standardizability is as important a factor to consider as fidelity due to the susceptibility of single-cell RNAseq analysis to technical noises. Existing approaches such as cryopreservation and chemical fixation are less than ideal for failing to satisfy either or both of these standards.\\n\\nResultsHere we propose a new strategy that leverages preservation schemes developed for organ transplantation. We evaluated the strategy by storing intact mouse kidneys in organ transplant preservative solution at hypothermic temperature for up to 4 days (6 hrs, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days), and comparing the quality of preserved and fresh samples using FACS and single cell RNAseq. We demonstrate that the strategy effectively maintained cell viability, transcriptome integrity, cell population heterogeneity, and transcriptome landscape stability for samples after up to 3 days of preservation. The strategy also facilitated the definition of the diverse spectrum of kidney resident immune cells, to our knowledge the first time at single cell resolution.\\n\\nConclusionsHypothermic storage of intact primary tissues in organ transplant preservative maintains the quality and stability of the transcriptome of cells for single cell RNAseq analysis.

In this study, the gut microbiota profiles of rats with methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) were analysed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The faecal microbial diversity was slightly higher in the METH CPP group. The propionate-producing genus Phascolarctobacterium was attenuated in the METH CPP group, and the family Ruminococcaceae was elevated in the METH CPP group. Short chain fatty acid analysis revealed that the concentrations of propionate were decreased in the faecal matter of METH-administered rats. These findings provide direct evidence that administration of METH causes gut dysbiosis, enable a better understanding of the function of gut microbiota in the process of drug abuse, and provide a new paradigm for addiction treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSuccess in school and the labour market is due to more than just high intelligence. Associations between traits such as attention, self-regulation, and perseverance in childhood, and later outcomes have been investigated by psychologists, economists, and epidemiologists. Such traits have been loosely referred to as \\\"non-cognitive\\\" skills. There has been no attempt to systematically assess the relative importance of non-cognitive skills in early life on later outcomes.\\n\\nMethodsThe systematic review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42013006566) in December 2013. We systematically reviewed electronic databases covering psychology, education, health and economics for articles published from database conception until September 2015. Titles and abstracts were screened for eligibility, and from eligible articles data was extracted on study design, sample type and size, age of participants at exposure and outcome, loss to follow up, measurement of exposure and outcome, type of intervention and comparison group, confounding adjustment and results. Where possible we extracted a standardised effect size. We reviewed all studies and rated their evidence quality as  better, weak, or poor on the basis of study design and potential for confounding, selection and measurement bias.\\n\\nResultsWe reviewed 375 studies and provided interpretation of results from 142 (38%) better quality studies comprising randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental, fixed effects including twin studies, longitudinal and some cross-sectional designs that made reasonable attempts to control confounding. In the academic achievement category outcomes were reported in 78 publications of better quality studies which were consistent with 0.1-0.2 SD effects.\\n\\nPsychosocial outcomes were reported in 65 better quality studies consistent with effects of 0.3-0.4 SD. For the language and cognitive category there were 42 publications reporting better quality studies consistent with effects of 0.3-0.4 SD. For physical health, results across only eight better quality studies were inconsistent but centred around zero. Analysis of funnel plots consistently showed asymmetric distributions, raising the potential of small study bias which may inflate these observed effects.\\n\\nConclusionsThe evidence under-pinning the importance of non-cognitive skills for life success is diverse and inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is tentative evidence from published studies that non-cognitive skills associate with modest improvements in academic achievement, psychosocial, and language and cognitive outcomes with effects in the range of 0.2-0.4 SD. The quality of evidence under-pinning this field is generally low with more than a third of studies making little or no attempt to control even the most basic confounding (endogeneity) bias. The evidence could be improved by adequately powering studies, and using procedures and tools that improve the conduct and reporting of RCTs and observational studies. Interventions designed to develop childrens non-cognitive skills could potentially improve opportunities, particularly for disadvantaged children. The inter-disciplinary researchers interested in these skills should take a more rigorous approach to determine which interventions are most effective.",

    "abstract": "Moving the arm is complicated by mechanical interactions that arise between limb segments. Such intersegmental dynamics cause torques applied at one joint to produce movement at multiple joints and, in turn, the only way to create single joint movement is by applying torques at multiple joints. Here, we investigated whether the nervous system accounts for intersegmental limb dynamics across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints during self-initiated reaching and when countering external mechanical perturbations. Our first experiment tested whether the timing and amplitude of shoulder muscle activity accounts for interaction torques produced during single-joint elbow movements from different elbow initial orientations and over a range of movement speeds. We found that shoulder muscle activity reliably preceded movement onset and elbow agonist activity, and was scaled to compensate for the magnitude of interaction torques arising because of forearm rotation. Our second experiment tested whether elbow muscles compensate for interaction torques introduced by single-joint wrist movements. We found that elbow muscle activity preceded movement onset and wrist agonist muscle activity, and thus the nervous system predicted interaction torques arising because of hand rotation. Our third and fourth experiments tested whether shoulder muscles compensate for interaction torques introduced by different hand orientations during self-initiated elbow movements and when countering mechanical perturbations that caused pure elbow motion. We found that the nervous system predicted the amplitude and direction of interaction torques, appropriately scaling the amplitude of shoulder muscle activity during self-initiated elbow movements and rapid feedback control. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the nervous system robustly accounts for intersegmental dynamics, and that the process is similar across the proximal to distal musculature of the arm as well as between feedforward (i.e., self-initiated) and feedback (i.e., reflexive) control.\\n\\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYIntersegmental dynamics complicate the mapping between applied joint torques and the resulting joint motions. Here, we provide evidence that the nervous system robustly predicts these intersegmental limb dynamics across the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints during reaching and when countering external perturbations.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of complex body plans in land plants has been paralleled by gene duplication and divergence within nuclear auxin-signaling networks. A deep mechanistic understanding of auxin signaling proteins therefore may allow rational engineering of novel plant architectures. Towards that end, we analyzed natural variation in the auxin receptor F-box family of wild accessions of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana and used this information to populate a structure/function map. We employed a synthetic assay to identify natural hypermorphic F-box variants, and then assayed auxin-associated phenotypes in accessions expressing these variants. To more directly measure the impact of the strongest variant in our synthetic assay on auxin sensitivity, we generated transgenic plants expressing this allele. Together, our findings link evolved sequence variation to altered molecular performance and auxin sensitivity. This approach demonstrates the potential for combining synthetic biology approaches with quantitative phenotypes to harness the wealth of available sequence information and guide future engineering efforts of diverse signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Considerable efforts are currently being devoted to enhance the speed, spatial resolution and the size of the 3D sample volumes in which calcium imaging methods can capture neuronal network activity in different model systems. In the mammalian brain, tissue scattering severely limits the use of parallel acquisition techniques such as wide-field imaging and, as a consequence, methods based on two-photon point-scanning (2PM) have become the method of choice. However, 2PM faces severe restrictions due to technical limitations such as scan speed, laser power, and those related to the fluorescent probes, calling for conceptually new approaches to enhance the performance of two-photon calcium imaging schemes. Here we provide a detailed quantitative evaluation and comparison of different excitation/detection modalities from the perspective of detecting neuronal activity that are based on different point-spread functions (PSF), laser repetition rates and sampling strategies. We demonstrate the conditions for which imaging speed and signal-to-noise ratio are optimized for a given average power. Our results are based on numerical simulations which are informed by experimentally measured parameters and show that volumetric field of view and acquisition speed can be considerably improved compared to traditional 2PM schemes by a holistic optimization approach.",

    "abstract": "An ideal gene drive system to alter wild populations would 1) exclusively affect organisms within the political boundaries of consenting communities, and 2) be capable of restoring any engineered population to its original genetic state. Here we describe  daisy quorum drive systems that meet these criteria by combining daisy drive with underdominance. A daisy quorum drive system is predicted to spread through a population until all of its daisy elements have been lost, at which point its fitness becomes frequency-dependent: mostly altered populations become fixed for the desired change, while engineered genes at low frequency are swiftly eliminated by natural selection. The result is an engineered population surrounded by wild-type organisms with limited mixing at the boundary. Releasing large numbers of wild-type organisms or a few bearing a population suppression element can reduce the engineered population below the quorum, triggering elimination of all engineered sequences. In principle, the technology can restore any drive-amenable population carrying engineered genes to wild-type genetics. Daisy quorum systems may enable efficient, community-supported, and genetically reversible ecological engineering.\\n\\nSummaryLocal communities should be able to control their own environments without forcing those choices on others. Ideally, each community could reversibly alter local wild organisms in ways that cannot spread beyond their own boundaries, and any engineered population could be restored to its original genetic state. We've invented a 'daisy quorum' drive system that appears to meet these criteria.\\n\\n\\\"Daisy\\\" refers to a daisy drive, which typically uses a daisy-chain of linked genes to spread a change through a local population while losing links every generation until it stops spreading. \\\"Quorum\\\" reflects the system's ability to \\\"vote\\\" on whether a local population should be altered or not: once all daisy elements are lost, it favors replication by the altered version or the original depending on which is more abundant in the local area. Put together, they result in a change that first spreads through a local population, then either becomes locally prevalent is eliminating, inhibiting mixing at the boundary. All organisms in the target population are altered, but changes are unable to spread much beyond that area due to being greatly outnumbered by wild-type organisms and consequently less able to replicate.\\n\\nWe haven't yet performed any experiments involving daisy quorum systems. Rather, were describing what we intend to do, including the safeguards we will use and our assessment of risks, in the hope that others will evaluate our plans and tell us if there's anything wrong that we missed. We hope that all researchers working on gene drive systems - and other technologies that could impact the shared environment - will similarly pre-register their plans. Sharing plans can reduce needless duplication, accelerate progress, and make the proposed work safer for everyone.",

    "abstract": "Heritability, h2, is a foundational concept in genetics, critical to understanding the genetic basis of complex traits. Recently-developed methods that estimate heritability from genotyped SNPs, h2 SNP, explain substantially more genetic variance than genome-wide significant loci, but less than classical estimates from twins and families. However, h2SNP estimates have yet to be comprehensively compared under a range of genetic architectures, making it difficult to draw conclusions from sometimes conflicting published estimates. Here, we used thousands of real whole genome sequences to simulate realistic phenotypes under a variety of genetic architectures, including those from very rare causal variants. We compared the performance of ten methods across different types of genotypic data (commercial SNP array positions, whole genome sequence variants, and imputed variants) and under differing causal variant frequencies, levels of stratification, and relatedness thresholds. These results provide guidance in interpreting past results and choosing optimal approaches for future studies. We then chose two methods (GREML-MS and GREML-LDMS) that best estimated overall h2SNP and the causal variant frequency spectra to six phenotypes in the UK Biobank using imputed genome-wide variants. Our results suggest that as imputation reference panels become larger and more diverse, estimates of the frequency distribution of causal variants will become increasingly unbiased and the vast majority of trait narrow-sense heritability will be accounted for.",

    "abstract": "Systems neuroscience is in a head-long rush to record from as many neurons at the same time as possible. As the brain computes and codes using neuron populations, it is hoped these data will uncover the fundamentals of neural computation. But with hundreds, thousands, or more simultaneously recorded neurons comes the inescapable problems of visualising, describing, and quantifying their interactions. Here I argue that network science provides a set of scalable, analytical tools that already solve these problems. By treating neurons as nodes and their interactions as links, a single network can visualise and describe an arbitrarily large recording. I show that with this description we can quantify the effects of manipulating a neural circuit, track changes in population dynamics over time, and quantitatively define theoretical concepts of neural populations such as cell assemblies. Using network science as a core part of analysing population recordings will thus provide both qualitative and quantitative advances to our understanding of neural computation.",

    "abstract": "The Zika virus has been the primary suspect in the large increase in incidence of microcephaly in 2015-6 in Brazil. However its role is not confirmed despite individual cases in which viral infections were found in neural tissue. Recently, the disparity between the incidences in different geographic locations has led to questions about the viruss role. Here we consider the alternative possibility that the use of the insecticide pyriproxyfen for control of mosquito populations in Brazilian drinking water is the primary cause. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile hormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat soluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development has been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone analog that was approved as an insecticide based upon tests performed in the 1970s, has metabolites that bind to the mammalian retinoid X receptor, and has been shown to cause developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing microcephaly in human babies via maternal exposure and activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses. Moreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in exposed rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented-- it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife, the epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area of Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, and have not been adequately confirmed. Given this combination of information about molecular mechanisms and toxicological evidence, we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal link to microcephaly is investigated further.",

    "abstract": "Perception is produced by  reading out the representation of a sensory stimulus contained in the firing rates of a population of neurons. To examine experimentally how populations code information, a common approach is to decode a linearly-weighted sum of the neurons firing rates. This approach is popular because of its biological validity: weights in a computational decoder are analogous to synaptic strengths. For neurons recorded in vivo, weights are highly variable when derived through machine learning methods, but it is unclear what neuronal properties explain this variability, and how the variability affects decoding performance. To address this, we recorded from neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) viewing stimuli comprising a sheet of dots that moved coherently in one of twelve different directions. We found that high gain and direction selectivity both predicted that a neuron would be weighted more highly in an optimised decoding model. Although learned weights differed markedly from weights chosen according to a priori rules based on a neurons tuning profile, decoding performance was only marginally better for the learned weights. In the models with a priori rules, selectivity is the best predictor of weighting, and defining weights according to a neurons preferred direction and selectivity improves decoding performance to very near the maximum level possible, as defined by the learned weights.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe examined which aspects of a neurons tuning account for its contribution to sensory coding. Strongly direction-selective neurons were weighted most highly by machine learning algorithms trained to discriminate motion direction. Models with a priori defined decoding weights demonstrate that the learned weighting scheme causally improved direction representation by a neuronal population. Optimising decoders (using machine learning) lead to only marginally better performance than decoders based purely on a neurons preferred direction and selectivity.",
