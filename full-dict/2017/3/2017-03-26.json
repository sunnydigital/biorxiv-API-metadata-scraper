    "abstract": "BackgroundIntrinsically disordered proteins lack a stable three-dimensional structure under physiological conditions. While this property has gained considerable interest within the past two decades, disorder poses substantial challenges to experimental characterization efforts. In effect, numerous computational tools have been developed to predict disorder from primary sequences, however, interpreting the output of these algorithms remains a challenge.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present Disorder Atlas, web-based software that facilitates the interpretation of intrinsic disorder predictions using proteome-based descriptive statistics. This service is also equipped to facilitate large-scale systematic exploratory searches for proteins encompassing disorder features of interest, and further allows users to browse the prevalence of multiple disorder features at the proteome level. Disorder Atlas is freely available for non-commercial users at http://www.disorderatlas.org.\\n\\nConclusionDisorder Atlas enables a standardized interpretation of intrinsic disorder predictions, and provides researchers with a tool to assess disorder on multiple scales.",

    "abstract": "Humans often evaluate sensory signals according to their reliability for optimal decision-making. However, how do we evaluate percepts generated in the absence of direct input that are, therefore, completely unreliable? Here, we utilize the phenomenon of filling-in occurring at the physiological blind-spots to compare partially inferred and veridical percepts. Subjects chose between stimuli that elicit filling-in, and perceptually equivalent ones presented outside the blind-spots, looking for a Gabor stimulus without a small orthogonal inset. In ambiguous conditions, when the stimuli were physically identical and the inset was absent in both, subjects behaved opposite to optimal, preferring the blind-spot stimulus as the better example of a collinear stimulus, even though no relevant veridical information was available. Thus, a percept that is partially inferred is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. In other words: Humans treat filled-in inferred percepts as more real than veridical ones.",

    "abstract": "The transition from single-cell to multicellular behavior is important in early development but rarely studied. The starvation-induced aggregation of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum into a multicellular slug is known to result from single-cell chemotaxis towards emitted pulses of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, how exactly do transient short-range chemical gradients lead to coherent collective movement at a macroscopic scale? Here, we developed a multiscale model verified by quantitative microscopy to describe wide-ranging behaviors from chemotaxis and excitability of individual cells to aggregation of thousands of cells. To better understand the mechanism of long-range cell-cell communication and hence aggregation, we analyzed cell-cell correlations, showing evidence of self-organization at the onset of aggregation (as opposed to following a leader cell). Surprisingly, cell collectives, despite their finite size, show features of criticality known from phase transitions in physical systems. By comparing wild-type and mutant cells with impaired aggregation, we found the longest cellcell communication distance in wild-type cells, suggesting that criticality provides an adaptive advantage and optimally sized aggregates for the dispersal of spores.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCells are often coupled to each other in cell collectives, such as aggregates during early development, tissues in the developed organism, and tumors in disease. How do cells communicate over macroscopic distances much larger than the typical cell-cell distance to decide how they should behave? Here, we developed a multiscale model of social amoeba, spanning behavior from individuals to thousands of cells. We show that local cell-cell coupling via secreted chemicals may be tuned to a critical value, resulting in emergent long-range communication and heightened sensitivity. Hence, these aggregates are remarkably similar to bacterial biofilms and neuronal networks, all communicating in a pulse-like fashion. Similar organizing principles may also aid our understanding of the remarkable robustness in cancer development.",

    "abstract": "SummaryRegulatory changes are broadly accepted as key drivers of phenotypic divergence. However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Abstract.If protein sequences are recoded with a binary alphabet derived from a division of the 20 amino acids into two subsets, a protein can be identified from its subsequences by searching through a recoded sequence database. A binary-coded primary sequence can be obtained for an unbroken protein molecule from current blockades in a nanopore. Only two (instead of 20) blockade levels need to be recognized to identify a residues subset; a hard or soft detector can do this with two current thresholds. Computations were done on the complete proteome of Helicobacter pylori (http://www.uniprot.org; database id UP000000210, 1553 sequences) using a binary alphabet based on published data for residue volumes in the range [~]0.06 nm3 to [~]0.225 nm3. Assuming normally distributed volumes, more than 93% of binary subsequences of length 20 from the primary sequences of H. pylori are correct with a confidence level of 90-95%; they can uniquely identify over 98% of the proteins. Recently published work shows that a 0.7 nm diameter nanopore can measure residue volume with a resolution of [~]0.07 nm3; this makes the procedure described here both feasible and practical. This is a non-destructive single-molecule method without the vagaries of proteolysis.",

    "abstract": "Software to automate digital pathology relies on image quality and the rates of false positive and negative objects in these images. Cytogenetic biodosimetry detects dicentric chromosomes (DCs) that arise from exposure to ionizing radiation, and determines radiation dose received from the frequency of DCs. We present image segmentation methods to rank high quality cytogenetic images and eliminate suboptimal metaphase cell data based on novel quality measures. Improvements in DC recognition increase the accuracy of dose estimates, by reducing false positive (FP) DC detection. A set of chromosome morphology segmentation methods selectively filtered out false DCs, arising primarily from extended prometaphase chromosomes, sister chromatid separation and chromosome fragmentation. This reduced FPs by 55% and was highly specific to the abnormal structures ([&ge;]97.7%). Additional procedures were then developed to fully automate image review, resulting in 6 image-level filters that, when combined, selectively remove images with consistently unparsable or incorrectly segmented chromosome morphologies. Overall, these filters can eliminate half of the FPs detected by manual image review. Optimal image selection and FP DCs are minimized by combining multiple feature based segmentation filters and a novel image sorting procedure based on the known distribution of chromosome lengths. Applying the same segmentation filtering procedures to both calibration and test sample image data reduced the average dose estimation error from 0.4Gy to <0.2Gy, obviating the need to first manually review these images. This reliable and scalable solution enables batch processing multiple samples of unknown dose, and meets current requirements for triage radiation biodosimetry of high quality metaphase cell preparations.",

Gene expression values and RNA-seq quality metrics from FFPE or decalcified tumor RNA showed minimal differences when compared to matched flash-frozen or non-decalcified tumors. ecRNA-seq was then applied on a longitudinal collection of 11 primary breast cancers and patient-matched de novo or recurrent BoM. BoMs harbored shifts to more Her2 and LumB PAM50 intrinsic subtypes, temporally influenced expression evolution, recurrently dysregulated prognostic gene sets and altered expression of clinically actionable genes, particularly in the CDK-Rb-E2F and FGFR-signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "Variation between and within individuals in life history traits is ubiquitous in natural populations. When affecting fitness-related traits such as survival or reproduction, individual heterogeneity plays a key role in population dynamics and life history evolution. However, it is only recently that properly accounting for individual heterogeneity when studying population dynamics of free-ranging populations has been made possible through the development of appropriate statistical models. We aim here to review case studies of individual heterogeneity in the context of capture-recapture models for the estimation of population size and demographic parameters with imperfect detection. First, we define what individual heterogeneity means and clarify the terminology used in the literature. Second, we review the literature and illustrate why individual heterogeneity is used in capture-recapture studies by focusing on the detection of life-history trade-offs, including senescence. Third, we explain how to model individual heterogeneity in capture-recapture models and provide the code to fit these models (https://github.com/oliviergimenez/indhet_in_CRmodels). The distinction is made between situations in which heterogeneity is actually measured and situations in which part of the heterogeneity remains unobserved. Regarding the latter, we outline recent developments of random-effect models and finite-mixture models. Finally, we discuss several avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "A popular strategy (EMMAX) for genome wide association (GWA) analysis fits all marker effects as classical random effects (i.e., Gaussian prior) by which association for the specific marker of interest is inferred by treating its effect as fixed. It seems more statistically coherent to specify all markers as sharing the same prior distribution, whether it is Gaussian, heavy-tailed (BayesA), or has variable selection specifications based on a mixture of, say, two Gaussian distributions (SSVS). Furthermore, all such GWA inference should be formally based on posterior probabilities or test statistics as we present here, rather than merely being based on point estimates. We compared these three broad categories of priors within a simulation study to investigate the effects of different degrees of skewness for quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects and numbers of QTL using 43,266 SNP marker genotypes from 922 Duroc-Pietrain F2 cross pigs. Genomic regions were based either on single SNP associations, on non-overlapping windows of various fixed sizes (0.5 to 3 Mb) or on adaptively determined windows that cluster the genome into blocks based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). We found that SSVS and BayesA lead to the best receiver operating curve properties in almost all cases. We also evaluated approximate marginal a posteriori (MAP) approaches to BayesA and SSVS as potential computationally feasible alternatives; however, MAP inferences were not promising, particularly due to their sensitivity to starting values. We determined that it is advantageous to use variable selection specifications based on adaptively constructed genomic window lengths for GWA studies.\\n\\nSUMMARYGenome wide association (GWA) analyses strategies have been improved by simultaneously fitting all marker effects when inferring upon any single marker effect, with the most popular distributional assumption being normality. Using data generated from 43,266 genotypes on 922 Duroc-Pietrain F2 cross pigs, we demonstrate that GWA studies could particularly benefit from more flexible heavy-tailed or variable selection distributional assumptions. Furthermore, these associations should not just be based on single markers or even genomic windows of markers of fixed physical distances (0.5 - 3.0 Mb) but based on adaptively determined genomic windows using linkage disequilibrium information.",

However, DVGs can also facilitate viral persistence. Why and how these two opposing functions of DVGs are achieved remain unknown. Here we report that during Sendai and respiratory syncytial virus infections DVGs selectively protect a subpopulation of cells from death and promote the establishment of persistent infections. We find that during Sendai virus infection this phenotype results from DVGs stimulating a MAVS-mediated TNF response that drives apoptosis of highly infected cells while extending the survival of cells enriched in DVGs. The pro-survival effect of TNF depends on the activity of the TNFR2/TRAF1 pathway that is regulated by MAVS signaling. These results identify TNF as a pivotal factor in determining cell fate during a viral infection and delineate a MAVS/TNFR2-mediated mechanism that drives the persistence of otherwise acute viruses.",

With a nonlinear decoding approach, we can extract the particular aspect of the neural population response that reflects the task-induced emergence of bistable attractor dynamics in a neural population, which could be obscured by standard unsupervised dimensionality reductions such as PCA. The dynamical modulation selectively increases the information relevant to task demands, indicating that such modulation is beneficial for perceptual decisions.

    "abstract": "Coral reef ecosystems owe their ecological success-and vulnerability to climate change-to the symbiotic metabolism of corals and Symbiodinium spp. The urgency to understand and predict the stability and breakdown of these symbioses (i.e., coral  bleaching) demands the development and application of theoretical tools. Here, we develop a dynamic bioenergetic model of coral-Symbiodinium symbioses that demonstrates realistic steady-state patterns in coral growth and symbiont abundance across gradients of light, nutrients, and feeding. Furthermore, by including a mechanistic treatment of photo-oxidative stress, the model displays dynamics of bleaching and recovery that can be explained as transitions between alternate stable states. These dynamics reveal that  healthy and  bleached states correspond broadly to nitrogen- and carbon-limitation in the system, with transitions between them occurring as integrated responses to multiple environmental factors. Indeed, a suite of complex emergent behaviors reproduced by the model (e.g., bleaching is exacerbated by nutrients and attenuated by feeding) suggests it captures many important attributes of the system; meanwhile, its modular framework and open source R code are designed to facilitate further problem-specific development. We see significant potential for this modeling framework to generate testable hypotheses and predict integrated, mechanistic responses of corals to environmental change, with important implications for understanding the performance and maintenance of symbiotic systems.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenotyping and parameter estimation using high throughput sequencing data are everyday tasks for population geneticists, but methods developed for diploids are typically not applicable to polyploid taxa. This is due to their duplicated chromosomes, as well as the complex patterns of allelic exchange that often accompany whole genome duplication (WGD) events. For WGDs within a single lineage (auto polyploids), inbreeding can result from mixed mating and/or double reduction. For WGDs that involve hybridization (allopolyploids), alleles are typically inherited through independently segregating subgenomes.\\n\\nResultsWe present two new models for estimating genotypes and population genetic parameters from genotype likelihoods for auto- and allopolyploids. We then use simulations to compare these models to existing approaches at varying depths of sequencing coverage and ploidy levels. These simulations show that our models typically have lower levels of estimation error for genotype and parameter estimates, especially when sequencing coverage is low.

    "abstract": "1Many studies have predicted large changes in forest dynamics during the next century because of global warming. Although empirical approaches and studies based on species distribution models provide valuable information about future changes, they do not take into account biotic interactions and stand-level demographic variations. The objective of this study was to quantify the local and regional variability of the growth and regeneration of three important forest species growing often in mixed stands in Europe (Picea abies (L.) Karst., Abies alba Mill., Fagus sylvatica), and to assess the climatic drivers of this variability. For that purpose, we collected a large forestry data set compiling the long-term (up to 100 years) evolution of species and size distributions for 163 stands across Europe, in the mesic distribution area of these forests. We used an inverse modeling approach, Approximate Bayesian Computation, to calibrate an individual-based model of forest dynamics on these data. Our study revealed that the variability of the demographic processes was of the same order of magnitude between stands of a same forest as between different forests. Out of the three species and two demographic processes studied, only the fir growth strongly varied with temperature. Water availability did not explain any demographic variation over stands. For these forests experiencing mesic conditions, local unmeasured factors seem therefore to have an influence at least as important as macro-environmental factors on demographic variations. Efforts to include these important factors in projection scenarios should therefore be prioritized. Besides, our study demonstrates that inverse modelling methods make possible the analysis of long-term forestry data. Such data should therefore be more widely compiled and used for ecological and global change research.",

    "abstract": "A classic problem in microbiology is that bacteria display two types of growth behavior when cultured on a mixture of two carbon sources: in certain mixtures the bacteria consume the two carbon sources sequentially (diauxie) and in other mixtures the bacteria consume both sources simultaneously (co-utilization). The search for the molecular mechanism of diauxie led to the discovery of the lac operon and gene regulation in general. However, why microbes would bother to have different strategies of taking up nutrients remained a mystery. Here we show that diauxie versus co-utilization can be understood from the topological features of the metabolic network. A model of optimal allocation of protein resources to achieve maximum growth quantitatively explains why and how the cell makes the choice when facing multiple carbon sources. Our work solves a long-standing puzzle and sheds light on microbes optimal growth in different nutrient conditions.",

In cryo-CLEM, a target protein of interest is tagged with a fluorophore and the location of the corresponding fluorescent signal is used to identify the structure in low-contrast but feature-rich cryo-EM images. To date, cryo-CLEM studies of mammalian cells have relied on very bright organic dyes or fluorescent protein tags concentrated in virus particles. Here we describe a method to expand the application of cryo-CLEM to cells harboring genetically-encoded fluorescent proteins. We discovered that a variety of mammalian cells exhibit strong punctate autofluorescence when imaged under cryogenic conditions (80K). Compared to fluorescent protein tags, these sources of autofluorescence exhibit a broader spectrum of fluorescence, which we exploited to develop a simple, robust approach to discriminate between the two. We validate this method in INS-1 E cells using a mitochondrial marker, and apply it to study the ultrastructural variability of secretory granules in a near-native state within intact INS-1E pancreatic cells by high-resolution 3D electron cryotomography.",

Seminal plasma, due to its proximity to prostate, is a promising fluid for biomarker discovery and non-invasive diagnostics. In this study, we investigated if seminal plasma proteins could increase specificity of detecting primary prostate cancer and discriminate between high- and low-grade cancers.\\n\\nExperimental DesignTo select 148 most promising biomarker candidates, we combined proteins identified through five independent data mining or experimental approaches: tissue transcriptomics, seminal plasma proteomics, cell secretomics, tissue specificity and androgen regulation. A rigorous biomarker development pipeline based on targeted proteomics assays was designed to evaluate the most promising candidates.\\n\\nResultsWe qualified 77 and verified 19 proteins in seminal plasma of 67 negative biopsy and 155 prostate cancer patients. Verification revealed a prostate-specific, secreted and androgen-regulated protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 4 (TGM4), which could predict prostate cancer on biopsy and outperformed age and serum PSA. Machine-learning approaches also revealed improved multi-marker combinations for diagnosis and prognosis. In the independent verification set measured by an inhouse ELISA, TGM4 was up-regulated 3.7-fold (P=0.006) and revealed AUC 0.66 for detecting prostate cancer on biopsy for patients with serum PSA[&ge;]4 ng/mL and age[&ge;]50. Low levels of TGM4 (median 120 pg/mL) were detected in blood serum, but could not differentiate between negative biopsy, prostate cancer or prostate inflammation.\\n\\nConclusionsPerformance of TGM4 warrants its further investigation within the distinct genomic subtypes and evaluation for the inclusion into emerging multi-biomarker panels.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits remains a major challenge in biology. Polygenicity, phenotypic plasticity and epistasis contribute to phenotypic variance in ways that are rarely clear. This uncertainty is problematic for estimating heritability, for predicting individual phenotypes from genomic data, and for parameterizing models of phenotypic evolution. Here we report a recombinant inbred line (RIL) quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping panel for the hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the C. elegans multiparental experimental evolution (CeMEE) panel. The CeMEE panel, comprising 507 RILs, was created by hybridization of 16 wild isolates, experimental evolution at moderate population sizes and predominant outcrossing for 140-190 generations, and inbreeding by selfing for 13-16 generations. The panel contains 22% of single nucleotide polymorphisms known to segregate in natural populations, and complements existing mapping resources for C. elegans by providing high nucleotide diversity across >95% of the genome. We apply it to study the genetic basis of two fitness components, fertility and hermaphrodite body size at time of reproduction, with high broad sense heritability in the CeMEE. While simulations show we should detect common alleles with additive effects as small as 5%, at gene-level resolution, the genetic architectures of these traits does not feature such alleles. We instead find that a significant fraction of trait variance, particularly for fertility, can be explained by sign epistasis with weak main effects. In congruence, phenotype prediction, while generally poor (r2 < 10%), requires modeling epistasis for optimal accuracy, with most variance attributed to the highly recombinant, rapidly evolving chromosome arms.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput measurements of molecular phenotypes provide an unprecedented opportunity to model cellular processes and their impact on disease. Such highly-structured data is strongly confounded, and principal components and their variants reliably estimate latent confounders. Conditioning on PCs in downstream analyses is known to improve power and reduce multiple-testing miscalibration and is an indispensable element of thousands of published functional genomic analyses. Further clarifying this approach is of fundamental interest to the genomics and statistics communities. We uncover a novel bias induced by PC conditioning and provide an analytic, deterministic and intuitive approximation. The bias exists because PCs are, roughly, unshielded colliders on a causal path: because PCs partially incorporate a causal genotype effect on one phenotype, the genotype becomes correlated with every phenotype conditional on PCs. We empirically quantify this bias in realistic simulations. For small genetic effects, a nearly negligible bias is observed for all tested PC variants. For large genetic effects, or other differential covariates, dramatic false positives can arise. Though one PC variant (supervised SVA) largely avoids this bias, it is computationally prohibitive genome-wide; further, its immunity to this bias is novel. Our analysis informs best practices for confounder correction in genomic studies.",

We identified a tripartite connectivity-based parcellation of SN with a limbic, cognitive and motor arrangement. The medial SN connects with limbic striatal and cortical regions and encodes value (greater response to monetary wins than losses during fMRI), while the ventral SN connects with associative regions of cortex and striatum and encodes salience (equal response to wins and losses). The lateral SN connects with somatomotor regions of striatum and cortex and also encodes salience. Connectivity within the value-coding medial SN network was associated with a measure of decisional impulsivity, while the salience-coding ventral SN network was associated with motor impulsivity. In sum, there is anatomical and functional heterogeneity of human SN, and separate SN networks underpin value versus salience coding, and impulsive choice versus impulsive action.",

    "abstract": "Unlike synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability is assumed to be a stable property of neurons. For example, learning of somatic conductances is generally not incorporated into computational models, and the discharge pattern of neurons in response to test stimuli is frequently used as a basis for phenotypic classification. However, it is increasingly evident that signal processing properties of neurons are more generally plastic on the timescale of minutes. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic firing patterns of CA3 neurons of the rat hippocampus in vitro undergo rapid long-term plasticity in response to a few minutes of only subthreshold synaptic conditioning. This plasticity on the spike-timing could also be induced by intrasomatic injection of subthreshold depolarizing pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors, indicating that discharge dynamics are modulated locally. Cluster analysis of firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the patterns initially exhibited by the cells. We used a conductance-based model to decide appropriate pharmacological blockade, and found that the observed transitions are likely due to recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances. We conclude that CA3 neurons adapt their conductance profile to the subthreshold activity of their input, so that their intrinsic firing pattern is not a static signature, but rather a reflection of their history of subthreshold activity. In this way, recurrent output from CA3 neurons may collectively shape the temporal dynamics of their embedding circuits.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDespite being widely conserved across the animal phyla, it is still a mystery why nerve cells present diverse discharge dynamics upon somatic step currents. Adding a new timing dimension to the intrinsic plasticity literature, here we show that CA3 neurons rapidly adapt through the space of known firing patterns in response to the subthreshold signals that they receive from their embedding circuit. This result implies that CA3 neurons collectively adjust their network processing to the temporal statistics of their circuit.",
