    "abstract": "O_LIPairwise measures of neutral genetic differentiation are supposed to contain information about past and on-going dispersal events and are thus often used as dependent variables in correlative analyses to elucidate how neutral genetic variation is affected by landscape connectivity. However, spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of genetic drift, stemming from variations in population sizes, may inflate variance in measures of genetic differentiation and lead to erroneous or incomplete interpretations in terms of connectivity. Here, we tested the efficiency of two distance-based metrics designed to capture the unique influence of spatial heterogeneity in local drift on genetic differentiation. These metrics are easily computed from estimates of effective population sizes or from environmental proxies for local carrying capacities, and allow us to introduce the hypothesis of Spatial-Heterogeneity-in-Effective-Population-Sizes (SHNe). SHNe can be tested in a way similar to isolation-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance within the classical landscape genetics hypothesis-testing framework.\\nC_LIO_LIWe used simulations under various models of population structure to investigate the reliability of these metrics to quantify the unique contribution of SHNe in explaining patterns of genetic differentiation. We then applied these metrics to an empirical genetic dataset obtained for a freshwater fish (Gobio occitaniae).\\nC_LIO_LISimulations showed that SHNe explained up to 60% of variance in genetic differentiation (measured as Fst) in the absence of gene flow, and up to 20% when migration rates were as high as 0.10. Furthermore, one of the two metrics was particularly robust to uncertainty in the estimation of effective population sizes (or proxies for carrying capacity). In the empirical dataset, the effect of SHNe on spatial patterns of Fst was five times higher than that of isolation-by-distance, uniquely contributing to 41% of variance in pairwise Fst. Taking the influence of SHNe into account also allowed decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the upper estimate of effective dispersal distance.\\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that the use of SHNe metrics in landscape genetics will substantially improve the understanding of evolutionary drivers of genetic variation, providing substantial information as to the actual drivers of patterns of genetic differentiation in addition to traditional measures of Euclidean distance or landscape resistance.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a persons genotype to a disease or phenotype. They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating polygenic scores have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can make use of LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and p-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.",

However, the stochastic blinking of single fluorophores can introduce large uncertainties into the final count. Here we provide a theoretical foundation for applying SLM to the problem of molecular counting based on the distribution of blinking events from a single fluorophore. We also show that by redundantly tagging single-molecules with multiple, blinking fluorophores, the accuracy of the technique can be enhanced by harnessing the central limit theorem. The coefficient of variation (CV) then, for the number of molecules M estimated from a given number of blinks B, scales like [Formula], where Nl is the mean number of labels on a target.

    "abstract": "The focus of the computational structural biology community has taken a dramatic shift over the past one-and-a-half decades from the classical protein structure prediction problem to the possible understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) or proteins containing regions of disorder (IDPR). The current interest lies in the unraveling of a disorder-to-order transitioning code embedded in the amino acid sequences of IDPs / IDPRs. Disordered proteins are characterized by an enormous amount of structural plasticity which makes them promiscuous in binding to different partners, multi-functional in cellular activity and atypical in folding energy landscapes resembling partially folded molten globules. Also, their involvement in several deadly human diseases (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases) makes them attractive drug targets, and important for a biochemical understanding of the disease(s). The study of the structural ensemble of IDPs is rather difficult, in particular for transient interactions. When bound to a structured partner, an IDPR adapts an ordered conformation in the complex. The residues that undergo this disorder-to-order transition are called protean residues, generally found in short contiguous stretches and the first step in understanding the modus operandi of an IDP / IDPR would be to predict these residues. There are a few available methods which predict these protean segments from their amino acid sequences; however, their performance reported in the literature leaves clear room for improvement. With this background, the current study presents 'Proteus', a random forest classifier that predicts the likelihood of a residue undergoing a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a potential partner protein. The prediction is based on features that can be calculated using the amino acid sequence alone. Proteus compares favorably with existing methods predicting twice as many true positives as the second best method (55% vs. 27%) with a much higher precision on an independent data set. The current study also sheds some light on a possible 'disorder-to-order' transitioning consensus, untangled, yet embedded in the amino acid sequence of IDPs. Some guidelines have also been suggested for proceeding with a real-life structural modeling involving an IDPR using Proteus.\\n\\nSoftware Availabilityhttps://github.com/bjornwallner/proteus",

    "abstract": "Changes in inhibitory connections are essential for experience-dependent circuit adaptations. Defects in inhibitory synapses are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, but the molecular processes underlying inhibitory synapse formation are not well understood. Here we use high resolution two-photon microscopy in organotypic hippocampal slices to examine the signaling pathways induced by the postsynaptic signaling molecule Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) during inhibitory synapse formation. By monitoring changes in individual GFP-labeled presynaptic boutons we found that the primary action of Sema4D is to induce stabilization of presynaptic boutons within tens of minutes. Stabilizing boutons rapidly recruited synaptic vesicles, which was followed by accumulation of postsynaptic gephyrin. Newly formed inhibitory synapses were complete and functional after 24 hours, as determined by electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We further showed that Sema4D signaling is regulated by network activity and can induce a local increase in bouton density, suggesting a possible role in circuit adaptation. We further examined the intracellular signaling cascade triggered by Sema4D and found that bouton stabilization occurred through rapid remodeling of actin, and this could be mimicked by the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B or by reducing ROCK activity. The intracellular signaling cascade required activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET, which is a well-known autism risk factor. Our immunohistochemistry data suggests that MET may be localized to presynaptic inhibitory axons. Together, our data yield important insights in the molecular pathway underlying activity-dependent Sema4D-induced synapse formation and reveal a novel role for MET in inhibitory synapses.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGABAergic synapses provide the main inhibitory control of neuronal activity in the brain. We make important steps in unraveling the molecular processes that take place when formation of inhibitory synapses is triggered by a specific signaling molecule, Sema4D. We find that this process depends on network activity and involves specific remodeling of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. We also reveal a previously unknown role for MET in inhibitory synapses. As defects in GABAergic synapses have been implied in many brain disorders, and mutations in MET are strong risk factors for autism, our findings urge for a further investigation of the role of MET at inhibitory synapses.",

This protein complex harbors a processive nuclease and two helicases activities that give it the ability to process duplex DNA ends. These enzymatic activities make RecBCD a major player in double strand break repair, conjugational recombination and degradation of linear DNA. In this work, we unravel a new role of the RecBCD complex in the processing of DNA single-strand gaps that are generated at DNA replication-blocking lesions. We show that independently of its nuclease or helicase activities, the entire RecBCD complex is required for recombinational repair of the gap and efficient translesion synthesis. Since none of the catalytic functions of RecBCD are required for those processes, we surmise that the complex acts as a structural element that stabilizes the blocked replication fork, allowing efficient DNA damage tolerance.",

The importance of sexual spores for the establishment of new disease centers remains unclear, particularly in the large maritime pine plantations of southwestern France. An analysis of the genetic diversity of a local fungal population distributed over 500 ha in this French forest showed genetic recombination between genotypes to be frequent, consistent with regular sexual reproduction within the population. The estimated spatial genetic structure displayed a significant pattern of isolation by distance, consistent with the dispersal of sexual spores mostly at the spatial scale studied. Using these genetic data, we inferred an effective density of reproductive individuals of 0.1 to 0.3 individuals/ha, and a second moment of parent-progeny dispersal distance of 130 to 800 m, compatible with the main models of fungal spore dispersal. These results contrast with those obtained for studies of A. ostoyae over larger spatial scales, suggesting that inferences about mean spore dispersal may be best performed at fine spatial scales (i.e. a few kilometers) for most fungal species.",

In ants, workers first try to prevent infection of colony members. Here, we show that if this fails and a pathogen establishes an infection, ants employ an efficient multicomponent behaviour - \\\"destructive disinfection\\\" - to prevent further spread of disease through the colony. Ants specifically target infected pupae during the pathogens non-contagious incubation period, relying on chemical  sickness cues emitted by pupae. They then remove the pupal cocoon, perforate its cuticle and administer antimicrobial poison, which enters the body and prevents pathogen replication from the inside out. Like the immune system of a body that specifically targets and eliminates infected cells, this social immunity measure sacrifices infected brood to stop the pathogen completing its lifecycle, thus protecting the rest of the colony. Hence, the same principles of disease defence apply at different levels of biological organisation.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, is counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.",

    "abstract": "Hebbian plasticity, a synaptic mechanism which detects and amplifies co-activity between neurons, is considered a key ingredient underlying learning and memory in the brain. However, Hebbian plasticity alone is unstable, leading to runaway neuronal activity, and therefore requires stabilization by additional compensatory processes. Traditionally, a diversity of homeostatic plasticity phenomena found in neural circuits are thought to play this role. However, recent modelling work suggests that the slow evolution of homeostatic plasticity, as observed in experiments, is insufficient to prevent instabilities originating from Hebbian plasticity. To remedy this situation, we suggest that homeostatic plasticity is complemented by additional rapid compensatory processes, which rapidly stabilize neuronal activity on short timescales.",

The absence of a model similar in size and behavior to human eyes has made it difficult to investigate its pathogenesis. Here, we present a porcine ex vivo model that recreates the features of PG including intraocular hypertension, pigment accumulation in the trabecular meshwork and relative failure of phagocytosis. In in vitro monolayer cultures as well as in ex vivo eye perfusion cultures, we found that the trabecular meshwork (TM) cells that regulate outflow, form actin stress fibers and have a decreased phagocytosis.

    "abstract": "Several methods have been developed to measure dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in fMRI data. These methods are often based on a sliding-window analysis, which aims to capture how the brains functional organization varies over the course of a scan. The aim of many studies is to compare dFC across groups, such as younger versus older people. However, spurious group differences in measured dFC may be caused by other sources of heterogeneity between people. For example, the shape of the haemodynamic response function (HRF) and levels of measurement noise have been found to vary with age. We use a generic simulation framework for fMRI data to investigate the effect of such heterogeneity on estimates of dFC. Our findings show that, despite no differences in true dFC, individual differences in measured dFC can result from other (non-dynamic) features of the data, such as differences in neural autocorrelation, HRF shape, connectivity strength and measurement noise. We also find that common dFC methods such as k-means and multilayer modularity approaches can detect spurious group differences in dynamic connectivity due to inappropriate setting of their hyperparameters. fMRI studies therefore need to consider alternative sources of heterogeneity across individuals before concluding differences in dFC.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has rapidly gained popularity for profiling transcriptomes of hundreds to thousands of single cells. This technology has led to the discovery of novel cell types and revealed insights into the development of complex tissues. However, many technical challenges need to be overcome during data generation. Due to minute amounts of starting material, samples undergo extensive amplification, increasing technical variability. A solution for mitigating amplification biases is to include Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs), which tag individual molecules. Transcript abundances are then estimated from the number of unique UMIs aligning to a specific gene and PCR duplicates resulting in copies of the UMI are not included in expression estimates. Here we investigate the effect of gene length bias in scRNA-Seq across a variety of datasets differing in terms of capture technology, library preparation, cell types and species. We find that scRNA-seq datasets that have been sequenced using a full-length transcript protocol exhibit gene length bias akin to bulk RNA-seq data. Specifically, shorter genes tend to have lower counts and a higher rate of dropout. In contrast, protocols that include UMIs do not exhibit gene length bias, and have a mostly uniform rate of dropout across genes of varying length. Across four different scRNA-Seq datasets profiling mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we found the subset of genes that are only detected in the UMI datasets tended to be shorter, while the subset of genes detected only in the full-length datasets tended to be longer. We briefly discuss the role of these genes in the context of differential expression testing and GO analysis. In addition, despite clear differences between UMI and full-length transcript data, we illustrate that full-length and UMI data can be combined to reveal underlying biology influencing expression of mESCs.",

Since gene expression is highly heterogeneous between cells, single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to identify how individual pluripotent cells function. Here, we present results from the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from 18,787 individual WTC CRISPRi human induced pluripotent stem cells. We developed an unsupervised clustering method, and through this identified four subpopulations distinguishable on the basis of their pluripotent state including: a core pluripotent population (48.3%), proliferative (47.8%), early-primed for differentiation (2.8%) and late-primed for differentiation (1.1%). For each subpopulation we were able to identify the genes and pathways that define differences in pluripotent cell states. Our method identified four transcriptionally distinct predictor gene sets comprised of 165 unique genes that denote the specific pluripotency states; and using these sets, we developed a multigenic machine learning prediction method to accurately classify single cells into each of the subpopulations. Compared against a set of established pluripotency markers, our method increases prediction accuracy by 10%, specificity by 20%, and explains a substantially larger proportion of deviance (up to 3-fold) from the prediction model. Finally, we developed an innovative method to predict cells transitioning between subpopulations, and support our conclusions with results from two orthogonal pseudotime trajectory methods.",

We developed an approach for constructing complete pseudomolecules for polyploid species using genotyping-by-sequencing data from outcrossing mapping populations coupled with high coverage whole genome sequence data of a reference genome. Our approach combines de novo assembly with linkage mapping to arrange scaffolds into pseudomolecules. We show that the method is able to reconstruct simulated chromosomes for both diploid and tetraploid genomes. Comparisons to three existing genetic mapping tools show that our method outperforms the other methods in accuracy on both grouping and ordering, and is robust to the presence of substantial amounts of missing data and genotyping errors. We applied our method to three real datasets including a diploid Ipomoea trifida and two tetraploid potato mapping populations. The linkage maps show significant concordance with the reference chromosomes. We resolved seven assembly errors for the published Ipomoea trifida genome assembly as well as anchored an unplaced scaffold in the published potato genome.",

While there is a general consensus that secreted compounds can be shared and therefore have social consequences for the bacterial collective, we know little about the physical limits of such bacterial social interactions. Here, we address this issue by studying the sharing of iron-scavenging siderophores between surface-attached microcolonies of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using single-cell fluorescent microscopy, we show that siderophores, secreted by producers, quickly reach non-producers within a range of 100 m, and significantly boost their fitness. Producers in turn respond to variation in sharing efficiency by adjusting their pyoverdine investment levels. These social effects wane with larger cell-to-cell distances and on hard surfaces. Thus, our findings reveal the boundaries of compound sharing, and show that sharing is particularly relevant between nearby yet physically separated bacteria on soft surfaces, matching realistic natural conditions such as those encountered in soft tissue infections.",

    "abstract": "Genomic prediction is emerging in a wide range of fields including animal and plant breeding, risk prediction in human precision medicine and forensic. It is desirable to establish a theoretical framework for genomic prediction accuracy when the reference data consists of information sources with varying degrees of relationship to the target individuals. A reference set can contain both close and distant relatives as well as  unrelated individuals from the wider population in the genomic prediction. The various sources of information were modeled as different populations with different effective population sizes (Ne). Both the effective number of chromosome segments (Me) and Ne are considered to be a function of the data used for prediction. We validate our theory with analyses of simulated as well as real data, and illustrate that the variation in genomic relationships with the target is a predictor of the information content of the reference set. With a similar amount of data available for each source, we show that close relatives can have a substantially larger effect on genomic prediction accuracy than lesser related individuals. We also illustrate that when prediction relies on closer relatives, there is less improvement in prediction accuracy with an increase in training data or marker panel density. We release software that can estimate the expected prediction accuracy and power when combining different reference sources with various degrees of relationship to the target, which is useful when planning genomic prediction (before or after collecting data) in animal, plant and human genetics.",

Streptomyces species are prolific producers of bioactive specialised metabolites with adaptive functions in nature and some have found utility in human medicine such as antibiotics. Whilst the biosynthesis of these specialised metabolites is directed by dedicated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), little attention has been focussed on how these organisms have evolved robustness into their genomes to facilitate the metabolic plasticity required to provide chemical precursors for biosynthesis. Here we show that specific expansions of gene families in central carbon metabolism have evolved and become fixed in Streptomyces bacteria to enable plasticity and robustness that maintain cell functionality whilst costly specialised metabolites are produced. These expanded gene families, in addition to being a metabolic adaptation, make excellent targets for metabolic engineering of industrial specialised metabolite producing bacteria.",

These advances fuel the need for high-speed microscopy approaches to image large samples quantitatively and at high resolution. While Light Sheet Microscopy (LSM), with its high planar imaging speed and low photo-bleaching, can be effective, scaling up to larger imaging volumes has been hindered by the use of orthogonal light-sheet illumination. To address this fundamental limitation, we have developed Light Sheet Theta Microscopy (LSTM), which uniformly illuminates samples from same side as the detection objective, thereby eliminating limits on lateral dimensions without sacrificing imaging resolution, depth and speed. We present detailed characterization of LSTM, and show that this approach achieves rapid high-resolution imaging of large intact samples with superior uniform high-resolution than LSM. LSTM is a significant step in high-resolution quantitative mapping of structure and function of large intact biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Marine fish contribute to the carbon cycle by producing mineralized intestinal aggregates generated as by-products of their osmoregulation. Here we aimed at characterizing the control of intestinal aggregate production in the gilthead sea bream in response to near future increases of environmental CO2. Our results demonstrate that hypercapnia (800 and 1200 atm CO2) elicits higher intestine epithelial HCO3- secretion and the subsequent parallel increase of intestinal aggregate production when compared to present values (400 atm CO2). Intestinal gene expression analysis revealed the up-regulation of crucial transport mechanisms involved not only in the intestinal secretion cascade (Slc4a4, Slc26a3 and Slc26a6) of sea bream, but also in other mechanisms involved in intestinal ion uptake linked to water absorption such as NKCC2 and the Aquaporin 1b. These results highlight the important role of fish in the marine carbon cycle, and their potential growing impact of intestinal biomineralization processes in the scenario of ocean acidification.",

This measurement could foster investigation of insect wing stiffness distribution.\\n\\nAbstractFor measuring the shape and deformation of insect wing, a scanning setup adopting line laser and coaxial LED light is developed. Wing shape can be directly acquired from the line laser images by triangulation. Yet the wing deformation field can also be obtained by a self-devised algorithm that processes the images from line laser and coaxial LED simultaneously. During the experiment, three wing samples from termite and mosquito under concentrated force are scanned. The venation and corrugation could be significantly identified from shape measurement result. The deformation field is sufficiently accurate to demonstrate its variation from wing base to tip. The load conditions in experiments are also be discussed. For softer wings, local deformation is apparent if pinhead is employed to impose force. The similarity analysis is better than 5% deformation ratio as a static criterion, if the wing is simplified as a cantilever beam. The setup is proved to be effective and versatile. The shape and deformation fields would give enough details for the measurement of wing stiffness distribution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.If protein sequences are recoded with a binary alphabet derived from a division of the 20 amino acids into two subsets, a protein can be identified from its subsequences by searching through a recoded sequence database. A binary-coded primary sequence can be obtained for an unbroken protein molecule from current blockades in a nanopore. Only two (instead of 20) blockade levels need to be recognized to identify a residues subset; a hard or soft detector can do this with two current thresholds. Computations were done on the complete proteome of Helicobacter pylori (http://www.uniprot.org; database id UP000000210, 1553 sequences) using a binary alphabet based on published data for residue volumes in the range [~]0.06 nm3 to [~]0.225 nm3. Assuming normally distributed volumes, more than 93% of binary subsequences of length 20 from the primary sequences of H. pylori are correct with a confidence level of 90-95%; they can uniquely identify over 98% of the proteins. Recently published work shows that a 0.7 nm diameter nanopore can measure residue volume with a resolution of [~]0.07 nm3; this makes the procedure described here both feasible and practical.

However, the large amount of data means that the number of putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) far exceeds our ability to experimentally characterize them. This necessitates the need for development of further tools to analyze putative BGCs to flag those of interest for further characterization.\\n\\nResults: Clustertools implements a framework to aid in the characterization of putative BGCs. It does this by or-ganizing genomic information on coding sequences in a way that enables directed, hypothesis-driven queries for functional elements in close physical proximity of each other. Genomic sequence databases can be constructed in clusterTools with an interface to the NCBI Genbank and Genomes databases, or from private sequence databases. clusterTools can be used either to identify interesting BGCs from a database of putative BGCs, or on databases of genomic sequences to identify and download regions of interest in the DNA for further processing and annotation in programs such as antiSMASH. We have used clusterTools to identify putative and known biosynthetic gene clus-ters involved in bacterial polyketide alkaoloid and tetronate biosynthesis.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementation: Clustertools is implemented in Python and is available via the AGPL. Stand-alone versions of clusterTools are available for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux upon registration (https://goo.gl/forms/QRKTkpqiA0g31IWp1).

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe World Health Organisation recommends the use of catch-up campaigns as part of the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) to accelerate herd protection and hence PCV impact. The value of a catch-up campaign is a trade-off between the costs of vaccinating additional age groups and the benefit of additional direct and indirect protection. There is a paucity of observational data, particularly from low-middle income countries to quantify the optimal breadth of such catch-up campaigns.\\n\\nMethodsIn Kilifi, Kenya PCV10 was introduced in 2011 using the 3-dose EPI infant schedule and a catch-up campaign in children <5 years old. We fitted a transmission dynamic model to detailed local data including nasopharyngeal carriage and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) to infer the marginal impact of the PCV catch-up campaign over hypothetical routine cohort vaccination in that setting, and to estimate the likely impact of alternative campaigns and their dose-efficiency.\\n\\nResultsWe estimated that, within 10 years of introduction, the catch-up campaign among <5y olds prevents an additional 65 (48 to 84) IPD cases, compared to PCV cohort introduction alone. Vaccination without any catch-up campaign prevented 155 (121 to 193) IPD cases and used 1321 (1058 to 1698) PCV doses per IPD case prevented. In the years after implementation, the PCV programme gradually accrues herd protection and hence its dose-efficiency increases: 10 years after the start of cohort vaccination alone the programme used 910 (732 to 1184) doses per IPD case averted. We estimated that a two-dose catch-up among <1y olds uses an additional 910 (732 to 1184) doses per additional IPD case averted. Furthermore, by extending a single dose catch-up campaign to children 1 to <2y old and subsequently to 2 to <5y olds the campaign uses an additional 412 (296 to 606) and 543 (403 to 763) doses per additional IPD case averted. These results were not sensitive to vaccine coverage, serotype competition, the duration of vaccine protection or the relative protection of infants.\\n\\nConclusionsWe find that catch-up campaigns are a highly dose-efficient way to accelerate population protection against pneumococcal disease.",

However, it is not known whether these changes are causative or a consequence of an underlying ageing process. It has also not been shown whether this  epigenetic clock is unique to humans or conserved in the more experimentally tractable mouse.\\n\\nResultsWe have generated a comprehensive set of genome-scale base-resolution methylation maps from multiple mouse tissues spanning a wide range of ages. Many CpG sites show significant tissue-independent correlations with age and allowed us to develop a multi-tissue predictor of age in the mouse. Our model, which estimates age based on DNA methylation at 329 unique CpG sites, has a median absolute error of 3.33 weeks, and has similar properties to the recently described human epigenetic clock. Using publicly available datasets, we find that the mouse clock is accurate enough to measure effects on biological age, including in the context of interventions. While females and males show no significant differences in predicted DNA methylation age, ovariectomy results in significant age acceleration in females. Furthermore, we identify significant differences in age-acceleration dependent on the lipid content of the offspring diet.\\n\\nConclusionsHere we identify and characterize an epigenetic predictor of age in mice, the mouse epigenetic clock. This clock will be instrumental for understanding the biology of ageing and will allow modulation of its ticking rate and resetting the clock in vivo to study the impact on biological age.",

However, an innovative genotype-specific approach targeting protein sequence variants instead of a reference protein target is currently lacking. In this short communication we report a remarkable observation of antibody-mediated knockdown of intracellular protein expression. This suggests allele-specific inhibition of protein-variant expression can be achieved by intracellular delivery of lipid conjugated linear epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies.

Reef-building corals are no exception, with phenotypic plasticity among the most plausible explanations for alternative morphospecies. As potential molecular signatures of phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic processes may contribute to our understanding of morphospecies. We compared genetic and epigenetic variation in Caribbean branching Porites spp., testing the hypothesis that epigenetics-- specifically, differential patterns of DNA methylation--play a role in alternative morphotypes of a group whose taxonomic status has been questioned. We used reduced representation genome sequencing to analyze over 1,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms and CpG sites in 27 Porites spp. exhibiting a range of morphotypes from a variety of habitats in Belize. We found stronger evidence for genetic rather than epigenetic structuring, identifying three well-defined genetic groups. One of these groups exhibited significantly thicker branches, and branch thickness was a better predictor of genetic groups than depth, habitat, or symbiont type. Epigenetic patterns were more subtle, with no clear groups. The more thickly branched individuals in one of the genetic groups exhibited some epigenetic similarity, suggesting potential covariation of genetics and epigenetics. This covariation was further supported by a positive association between pairwise genetic and epigenetic distance. We speculate that epigenetic patterns are a complex mosaic reflecting inheritance and diverse environmental histories. Given the role of genetics in branching Porites spp. morphospecies we were able to detect with genome-wide sequencing, use of such techniques throughout the geographic range may help settle their phylogeny.",

In circulation, CTCs are found both as single cells and as clusters of cells. The clusters of CTCs, although many fewer in number, possess much higher metastatic potential as compared to that of individual CTCs. In this review, we highlight recent insights into molecular mechanisms that can enable the formation of these clusters - (a) hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype of cells that couples their ability to migrate and adhere, and (b) intercellular communication that can spatially coordinate the cluster formation and provide survival signals to cancer cells. Building upon these molecular mechanisms, we also offer a possible mechanistic understanding of why clusters are endowed with a higher metastatic potential. Finally, we discuss the highly aggressive Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) as an example of a carcinoma that can metastasize via clusters and corroborates the proposed molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding problem in ecology is whether structured life cycles impede or facilitate coexistence between species. Theory based on populations with two discrete stages in the life-cycle indicates that coexistence requires at least one species to shift its niche between stages and that each species is a better competitor in one of the niches. However, in many cases, niche shifts are associated with changes in an underlying continuous trait like organism size and we have few predictions for how the conditions for coexistence are affected by this type of ontogenetic dynamics. Here we develop a framework for analyzing species coexistence based on Integral Projection Models (IPMs) that incorporates continuous ontogenetic changes in both the resource niche and competitive ability. We parameterize the model using experimental data from Trinidadian guppies and make predictions about how niche shifts and competitive symmetries allow or prevent species coexistence. Overall, our results show that the effects of competition on fitness depend upon trait-mediated niche-separation, trait-mediated competitive asymmetry in the part of the niche that is shared across body sizes, and the sensitivity of fitness to body size. When all three conditions are considered, we find multiple ecological and evolutionary routes to coexistence. When both species can shift their niche with increasing body size and competition for resources among the species and sizes is symmetric, then the species that shifts its niche to a greater degree with ontogeny will competitively exclude the other species. When competitive ability increases with increasing body size, then the two species can coexist when the better competitor shifts its niche with body size to a lesser degree than the weaker competitior. This region of coexistence shrinks as the better competitor increasingly shifts its niche with increasing size. When both species shift their niches with size, but each is a better competitor on resources used by smaller or larger individuals, then the model predicts an alternative stable state over some range of niche shifts. We discuss how our results provide new insights into species coexistence and the evolutionary consequences of size-structured interspecific competition.",

Mean home range size was 818 km2 (95% CI:425-1981) in the Dry Chaco and 237 km2 (95% CI:90-427) in the Humid Chaco/Pantanal. Core areas, defined as the home range area where use was equal to expected use, was consistent across sexes and systems represented on average by the 59% utility distribution isopleth (range:56-64%). Males had a higher probability of larger home ranges and more directional and greater daily movements than females collectively and within systems. The large home ranges in the Dry Chaco are attributable to the relatively low productivity of that semi-arid ecosystem and high heterogeneity in resource distribution while larger than expected home ranges in the Humid Chaco/Pantanal compared to home range estimates from the Brazilian Pantanal may be due to differences in geomorphology and hydrological cycle. The large home ranges of jaguars in western Paraguay and a low proportional area of protected areas in the region demonstrate the importance of private ranchland for the long-term conservation of the species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBacillus cereus sensu lato (s. l.) is an ecologically diverse bacterial group of medical and agricultural significance. In this study, I use publicly available genomes to characterize the B. cereus s. l. pan-genome and perform the largest phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of this group to date in terms of the number of genes and taxa included. With these fundamental data in hand, I identify genes associated with particular phenotypic traits (i.e., \\\"pan-GWAS\\\" analysis), and quantify the degree to which taxa sharing common attributes are phylogenetically clustered.\\n\\nMethodsA rapid k-mer based approach (Mash) was used to create reduced representations of selected Bacillus genomes, and a fast distance-based phylogenetic analysis of this data (FastME) was performed to determine which species should be included in B. cereus s. l. The complete genomes of eight B. cereus s. l. species were annotated de novo with Prokka, and these annotations were used by Roary to produce the B. cereus s. l. pan-genome. Scoary was used to associate gene presence and absence patterns with various phenotypes. The orthologous protein sequence clusters produced by Roary were filtered and used to build HaMStR databases of gene models that were used in turn to construct phylogenetic data matrices. Phylogenetic analyses used RAxML, DendroPy, ClonalFrameML, PAUP*, and SplitsTree. Bayesian model-based population genetic analysis assigned taxa to clusters using hierBAPS. The genealogical sorting index was used to quantify the phylogenetic clustering of taxa sharing common attributes.\\n\\nThe B. cereus s. l. pan-genome currently consists of {approx}60,000 genes, {approx}600 of which are \\\"core\\\" (common to at least 99% of taxa sampled). Pan-GWAS analysis revealed genes associated with phenotypes such as isolation source, oxygen requirement, and ability to cause diseases such as anthrax or food poisoning. Extensive phylogenetic analyses using an unprecedented amount of data produced phylogenies that were largely concordant with each other and with previous studies. Phylogenetic support as measured by bootstrap probabilities increased markedly when all suitable pan-genome data was included in phylogenetic analyses, as opposed to when only core genes were used. Bayesian population genetic analysis recommended subdividing the three major clades of B. cereus s. l. into nine clusters. Taxa sharing common traits and species designations exhibited varying degrees of phylogenetic clustering.",

To investigate the means by which the human active X is protected from silencing by XIST, we updated the search for a key dosage sensitive XIST repressor using new cytogenetic data with more precise resolution. Here, based on a previously unknown sex bias in copy number variations, we identify a unique region in our genome, and propose candidate genes that lie within, as they could inactivate XIST. Unlike males, the females who duplicate this region of chromosome 19 (partial 19 trisomy) do not survive embryogenesis; this preimplantation loss of females may be one reason that more human males are born than females.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection maintains advantageous diversity in populations through various mechanisms. While extensively explored from a theoretical perspective, an empirical understanding of its prevalence and targets lags behind our knowledge of positive selection. Here we describe the Non-Central Deviation (NCD), a simple yet powerful statistic to detect long-term balancing selection (LTBS) that quantifies how close frequencies are to expectations under LTBS, and provides the basis for a neutrality test. NCD can be applied to a single locus or genomic data, and can be implemented considering only polymorphisms (NCD1) or also considering fixed differences with respect to an outgroup (NCD2) species. Incorporating fixed differences improves power, and NCD2 has higher power to detect LTBS in humans under different frequencies of the balanced allele(s) than other available methods. Applied to genome-wide data from African and European human populations, in both cases using chimpanzee as an outgroup, NCD2 shows that, albeit not prevalent, LTBS affects a sizable portion of the genome: about 0.6% of analyzed genomic windows and 0.8% of analyzed positions. Significant windows (p < 0.0001) contain 1.6% of SNPs in the genome, which disproportionally fall within exons and change protein sequence, but are not enriched in putatively regulatory sites. These windows overlap about 8% of the protein-coding genes, and these have larger number of transcripts than expected by chance even after controlling for gene length. Our catalog includes known targets of LTBS but a majority of them (90%) are novel. As expected, immune-related genes are among those with the strongest signatures, although most candidates are involved in other biological functions, suggesting that LTBS potentially influences diverse human phenotypes.",

This imaging was obtained from the medial prefrontal cortex (the prelimbic area) and the hippocampal CA1 region. We found that the neural activity related to reward prediction is higher in the prelimbic area than in layer 2/3 of the secondary motor area, while it is negligible in the hippocampal CA1 region.

    "abstract": "In the nervous system, communication occurs via synaptic transmission where signaling molecules (neurotransmitters) are released by the presynaptic neuron, and they influence electrical activity of another neuron (postsynaptic neuron). The inherent probabilistic release of neurotransmitters is a significant source of noise that critically impacts the timing of spikes (action potential) in the postsynaptic neuron. We develop a stochastic model that incorporates noise mechanisms in synaptic transmission, such as, random docking of neurotransmitter-filled vesicle to a finite number of docking sites, with each site having a probability of vesicle release upon arrival of an action potential. This random, burst-like release of neurotransmitters serves as an input to an integrate-and-fire model, where spikes in the postsynaptic neuron are triggered when its membrane potential reaches a critical threshold for the first time. We derive novel analytical results for the probability distribution function of spike timing, and systematically investigate how underlying model parameters and noise processes regulate variability in the inter-spike times. Interestingly, in some parameter regimes, independent arrivals of action potentials in the presynaptic neuron generate strong dependencies in the spike timing of the postsynaptic neuron. Finally, we argue that probabilistic release of neurotransmitters is not only a source of disturbance, but plays a beneficial role in synaptic information processing.",

    "abstract": "The midbrain map of auditory space commands sound-orienting responses in barn owls. Owls precisely localize sounds in frontal space but underestimate the direction of peripheral sound sources. This bias for central locations was proposed to be adaptive to the decreased reliability in the periphery of sensory cues used for sound localization by the owl. Understanding the neural pathway supporting this biased behavior provides a means to address how adaptive motor commands are implemented by neurons. Here we find that the sensory input for sound direction is weighted by its reliability in premotor neurons of the owls midbrain tegmentum such that the mean population firing rate approximates the head-orienting behavior. We provide evidence that this coding may emerge through convergence of upstream projections from the midbrain map of auditory space. We further show that manipulating the sensory input yields changes predicted by the convergent network in both premotor neural responses and behavior. This work demonstrates how a topographic sensory representation can be linearly read out to adjust behavioral responses by the reliability of the sensory input.\\n\\nSignificance statementThis research shows how statistics of the sensory input can be integrated into a behavioral command by readout of a sensory representation. The firing rate of midbrain premotor neurons receiving sensory information from a topographic representation of auditory space is weighted by the reliability of sensory cues. We show that these premotor responses are consistent with a weighted convergence from the topographic sensory representation. This convergence was also tested behaviorally, where manipulation of stimulus properties led to bidirectional changes in sound localization errors. Thus a topographic representation of auditory space is translated into a premotor command for sound localization that is modulated by sensory reliability.",

    "abstract": "Excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the mammalian sensory cortex form interconnected circuits that control cortical stimulus selectivity and sensory acuity. Theoretical studies have predicted that suppression of inhibition in such excitatory-inhibitory networks can lead to either an increase or, paradoxically, a decrease in excitatory neuronal firing, with consequent effects on stimulus selectivity. We tested whether modulation of inhibition or excitation in the auditory cortex could evoke such a variety of effects in tone-evoked responses and in behavioral frequency discrimination acuity. We found that, indeed, the effects of optogenetic manipulation on stimulus selectivity and behavior varied in both magnitude and sign across subjects, possibly reflecting differences in circuitry or expression of optogenetic factors. Changes in neural population responses consistently predicted behavioral changes for individuals separately, including improvement and impairment in acuity. This correlation between cortical and behavioral change demonstrates that, despite complex and varied effects these manipulations can have on neuronal dynamics, the resulting changes in cortical activity account for accompanying changes in behavioral acuity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryExcitatory and inhibitory interactions determine stimulus specificity and tuning in sensory cortex, thereby controlling perceptual discrimination acuity. Modeling of such excitatory-inhibitory circuits has predicted that suppressing the activity of inhibitory neurons can lead to increases or, paradoxically, decreases in excitatory activity, depending on the architecture and modulation parameters of the inhibitory component of the network. Here, we capitalized on differences between subjects to test whether suppressing/activating inhibition and excitation across a range of parameters in sensory cortex can in fact exhibit such paradoxical effects for both stimulus sensitivity and behavioral discriminability. Indeed, we found that the same optogenetic manipulation in the auditory cortices of different mice could improve or impair frequency discrimination acuity, in a fashion that was predictable from the effects on cortical responses to tones. The same manipulations sometimes produced opposite changes in the behavior of different individuals, supporting theoretical predictions for inhibition-stabilized networks.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of species phenotypes occurs through changes both in protein sequence and gene expression levels. Though much of plant morphological evolution can be explained by changes in gene expression, examining its evolution has challenges. To gain a new perspective on organ evolution in plants, we applied a phylotranscriptomics approach. We combined a phylostratigraphic approach with gene expression based on the strand-specific RNA-seq data from seedling, floral bud, and root of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions to examine the age and sequence divergence of transcriptomes from these organs and how they adapted over time. Our results indicate that, among the sense and antisense transcriptomes of these organs, the sense transcriptomes of seedlings are the evolutionarily oldest across all accessions and are the most conserved in amino acid sequence for most accessions. In contrast, among the sense transcriptomes from these same organs, those from floral bud are evolutionarily youngest and least conserved in sequence for most accessions. Different organs have adaptive peaks at different stages in their evolutionary history, however, from the Magnoliophyta stage to the Brassicale stage, all three organs show a common adaptive signal. Our research is significant because it offers novel evolutionary insight on plant organs revealed by phylotranscriptomics.",

    "abstract": "Geographically separated populations can convergently adapt to the same selection pressure. Convergent evolution at the level of a gene may arise via three distinct modes. The selected alleles can (1) have multiple independent mutational origins, (2) be shared due to shared ancestral standing variation, or (3) spread throughout subpopulations via gene flow. We present a model-based, statistical approach that utilizes genomic data to detect cases of convergent adaptation at the genetic level, identify the loci involved and distinguish among these modes. To understand the impact of convergent positive selection on neutral diversity at linked loci, we make use of the fact that hitchhiking can be modeled as an increase in the variance in neutral allele frequencies around a selected site within a population. We build on coalescent theory to show how shared hitchhiking events between subpopulations act to increase covariance in allele frequencies between subpopulations at loci near the selected site, and extend this theory under different models of migration and selection on the same standing variation. We incorporate this hitchhiking effect into a multivariate normal model of allele frequencies that also accounts for population structure. Based on this theory, we present a composite-likelihood-based approach that utilizes genomic data to identify loci involved in convergence, and distinguishes among alternate modes of convergent adaptation. We illustrate our method on genome-wide polymorphism data from two distinct cases of convergent adaptation. First, we investigate the adaptation for copper toxicity tolerance in two populations of the common yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus. We show that selection has occurred on an allele that has been standing in these populations prior to the onset of copper mining in this region. Lastly, we apply our method to data from four populations of the killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, that show very rapid convergent adaptation for tolerance to industrial pollutants. Here, we identify a single locus at which both independent mutation events and selection on an allele shared via gene flow, either slightly before or during selection, play a role in adaptation across the species range.",

Duplicate genes (i.e., homeologs, in the case of a whole genome duplication) may retain their ancestral function, sub- or neofunctionalize, or be lost entirely. A primary way that duplicate genes may evolve new functions is by altering their expression patterns. Comparing the expression patterns of duplicate genes may give clues as to whether any of these evolutionary processes have occurred.\\n\\nResults: We develop a likelihood ratio test for the analysis of the expression ratios of duplicate genes across two conditions (e.g., tissues). We demonstrate an application of this test by comparing homeolog expression patterns of 1,448 homeologous gene pairs using RNA-seq data generated from the leaves and petals of an allotetraploid monkeyflower (Mimulus luteus). We assess the sensitivity of this test to different levels of homeolog expression bias and compare the method to several alternatives.\\n\\nConclusions: The likelihood ratio test derived here is a direct, transparent, and easily implemented method for detecting changes in homeolog expression bias that outperforms three alternative approaches. While our method was derived with homeolog analysis in mind, this method can be used to analyze changes in the ratio of expression levels between any two genes in any two conditions.",

    "abstract": "Sensory attenuation refers to the cortical suppression of self-generated sensations relative to externally-generated sensations. This attenuation of cortical responsiveness is the result of internal forward models which make precise predictions about forthcoming sensations. Forward models of sensory attenuation in the auditory domain are thought to operate along auditory white matter pathways such as the arcuate fasciculus and the frontal aslant. The aim of this study was to investigate whether brain regions that are structurally connected via these white matter pathways are also effectively connected during overt speech, as well as as when listening to externally-generated speech that is temporally predictable via a visual cue. Using Electroencephalography (EEG) and Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) we investigated network models that link the primary auditory cortex to Wernickes and Brocas area either directly or indirectly through Geschwinds territory, which are structurally connected via the arcuate fasciculus. Connections between Brocas and supplementary motor area, which are structurally connected via the frontal aslant, were also included. Our results revealed that bilateral areas interconnected by indirect and direct pathways of the arcuate fasciculus, in addition to regions interconnected by the frontal aslant best explain the EEG responses to both self-generated speech, and speech that is externally-generated but temporally predictable. These findings indicate that structurally connected brain regions thought to be involved in auditory attenuation are also effectively connected. Critically, our findings expand on the notion of internal forward models, whereby sensory consequences of our actions are internally predicted and reflected in reduced cortical responsiveness to these sensations.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIEffective connectivity of auditory attenuation to self-generated and predictable speech\\nC_LIO_LIEEG and DCM were used to investigate several plausible network models\\nC_LIO_LIStructurally connected brain areas of auditory attenuation are effectively connected\\nC_LIO_LIInternal forward models modulate self-generated and predictable speech\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumours from each of 10 tumour types at 5 tumour cellularity levels (20-100%, 150 BAM files in total). In addition to these reference sets, we expect Bamgineer to be of use for systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms using their own data and expected tumour content for a variety of applications. The source code and reference datasets are freely available at http://github.org/pughlab/bamgineer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\\n\\nCell migration within tissues involves the interaction of many cells from distinct subpopulations. In this work, we present a discrete model of collective cell migration where the motion of individual cells is driven by random forces, short range repulsion forces to mimic crowding, and longer range attraction forces to mimic adhesion. This discrete model can be used to simulate a population of cells that is composed of K [&ge;] 1 distinct subpopulations. To analyse the discrete model we formulate a hierarchy of moment equations that describe the spatial evolution of the density of agents, pairs of agents, triplets of agents, and so forth. To solve the hierarchy of moment equations we introduce two forms of closure: (i) the mean field approximation, which effectively assumes that the distributions of individual agents are independent; and (ii) a moment dynamics description that is based on the Kirkwood superposition approximation. The moment dynamics description provides an approximate way of incorporating spatial patterns, such as agent clustering, into the continuum description. Comparing the performance of the two continuum descriptions confirms that both perform well when adhesive forces are sufficiently weak. In contrast, the moment dynamics description outperforms the mean field model when adhesive forces are sufficiently large. This is a first attempt to provide an accurate continuum description of a lattice-free, multi-species model of collective cell migration.",

In contrast, intraspecific variation in these rates is strongly mass-dependent. These contrasting patterns suggest that the causes of variation in leaf mass per area (LMA) may be fundamentally different within vs. among species.\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a statistical modeling framework to decompose LMA into two conceptual components - metabolic LMAm (which determines photosynthetic capacity and dark respiration) and structural LMAs (which determines leaf toughness and potential leaf lifespan) - using leaf trait data from tropical forests in Panama and a global leaf-trait database.\nC_LIO_LIDecomposing LMA into LMAm and LMAs improves predictions of leaf trait variation (photosynthesis, respiration, and lifespan). We show that strong area-dependence of metabolic traits across species can result from multiple factors, including high LMAs variance and/or a slow increase in photosynthetic capacity with increasing LMAm. In contrast, strong mass-dependence of metabolic traits within species results from LMAm increasing from sunny to shady conditions. LMAm and LMAs were nearly independent of each other in both global and Panama datasets.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: Our results suggest that leaf functional variation is multi-dimensional and that biogeochemical models should treat metabolic and structural leaf components separately.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is widespread and variable in nature. Although female-biased SSD predominates among insects, the proximate ecological and evolutionary factors promoting this phenomenon remain largely unstudied. Here, we employ modern phylogenetic comparative methods on 8 subfamilies of Iberian grasshoppers (85 species) to examine the validity of different models of evolution of body size and SSD and explore how they are shaped by a suite of ecological variables (habitat specialization, substrate use, altitude) and/or constrained by different evolutionary pressures (female fecundity, strength of sexual selection, length of the breeding season). Body size disparity primarily accumulated late in the history of the group and did not follow a Brownian motion pattern, indicating the existence of directional evolution for this trait. We found support for the converse of Renschs rule across all taxa but not within the two most speciose subfamilies (Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae), which showed an isometric pattern. Our results do not provide support for the fecundity or sexual selection hypotheses and we did not find evidence for significant effects of habitat use. Contrary to that expected, we found that species with narrower reproductive window are less dimorphic in size than those that exhibit a longer breeding cycle, suggesting that male protandry cannot solely account for the evolution of female-biased SSD in Orthoptera. Our study highlights the need to consider alternatives to the classical evolutionary hypotheses when trying to explain why in certain insect groups males remain small.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are a substantial source of genomic variation and contribute to a wide range of human disorders. Gene-disrupting exonic CNVs have important clinical implications as they can underlie variability in disease presentation and susceptibility. The relationship between exonic CNVs and clinical traits has not been broadly explored at the population level, primarily due to technical challenges. We surveyed common and rare CNVs in the exome sequences of 50,726 adult DiscovEHR study participants with linked electronic health records (EHRs). We evaluated the diagnostic yield and clinical expressivity of known pathogenic CNVs, and performed tests of association with EHR-derived serum lipids, thereby evaluating the relationship between CNVs and complex traits and phenotypes in an unbiased, real-world clinical context. We identified CNVs from megabase to exon-level resolution, demonstrating reliable, high-throughput detection of clinically relevant exonic CNVs. In doing so, we created a catalog of high-confidence common and rare CNVs and refined population frequency estimates of known and novel gene-disrupting CNVs. Our survey among an unselected clinical population provides further evidence that neuropathy-associated duplications and deletions in 17p12 have similar population prevalence but are clinically under-diagnosed. Similarly, adults who harbor 22q11.2 deletions frequently had EHR documentation of neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders and congenital anomalies, but not a formal genetic diagnosis (i.e., deletion). In an exome-wide association study of lipid levels, we identified a novel five-exon duplication within LDLR segregating in a large kindred with features of familial hypercholesterolemia. Exonic CNVs provide new opportunities to understand and diagnose human disease.",

    "abstract": "As a major orchestrator of the cellular epigenome, the repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) can either repress or activate thousands of genes depending on cellular context, suggesting a highly context-dependent REST function tuned by environmental cues. While REST shows cell-type non-selective active transcription1, an N-terminal REST4 isoform caused by alternative splicing - inclusion of an extra exon (N3c) which introduces a premature stop codon - has been implicated in neurogenesis and tumorigenesis2-5. Recently, in line with established epigenetic regulation of pre-mRNA splicing6,7, we demonstrated that REST undergoes extensive, context-dependent alternative splicing which results in the formation of a large number of mRNA variants predictive of multiple protein isoforms8. Supported by that immunoblotting/-staining with different anti-REST antibodies yield inconsistent results, alternative splicing allows production of various structurally and functionally different REST protein isoforms in response to shifting physiological requirements, providing a reasonable explanation for the diverse, highly context-dependent REST function. However, REST isoforms might be differentially assayed or manipulated, leading to data misinterpretation and controversial findings. For example, in contrast to the proposed neurotoxicity of elevated nuclear REST in ischemia9 and Huntingtons disease10,11, Lu et al. recently reported decreased nuclear REST in Alzheimers disease and neuroprotection of REST in ageing brain12. Unfortunately, alternative REST splicing was largely neglected by Lu et al., making it necessary for a reevaluation of their findings.",
