    "abstract": "Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (i) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (ii) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry or CyTOF is an emerging technology for high-dimensional multiparameter single cell analysis that overcomes many limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry. New methods for analyzing CyTOF data attempt to improve automation, scalability, performance, and interpretation of data generated in large studies. Assigning individual cells into discrete groups of cell types (gating) involves time-consuming sequential manual steps, untenable for larger studies. We introduce DeepCyTOF, a standardization approach for gating, based on deep learning techniques. DeepCyTOF requires labeled cells from only a single sample. It is based on domain adaptation principles and is a generalization of previous work that allows us to calibrate between a target distribution and a source distribution in an unsupervised manner. We show that Deep-CyTOF is highly concordant (98%) with cell classification obtained by individual manual gating of each sample when applied to a collection of 16 biological replicates of primary immune blood cells, even when measured accross several instruments. Further, DeepCyTOF achieves very high accuracy on the semi-automated gating challenge of the FlowCAP-I competition as well as two CyTOF datasets generated from primary immune blood cells: (i)14 subjects with a history of infection with West Nile virus (WNV), (ii) 34 healthy subjects of different ages. We conclude that deep learning in general, and DeepCyTOF specifically, offers a powerful computational approach for semi-automated gating of CyTOF and flow cytometry data.",

    "abstract": "Narrative reports suggest that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with biogeographic ancestry (BGA) in the Americas. If so, SES potentially acts as a confound that needs to be taken into account when evaluating the relation between medical outcomes and BGA. To explore how systematic BGA-SES associations are, a meta-analysis of American studies was conducted. 41 studies were identified, yielding a total of 64 independent samples with directions of associations, including 48 independent samples with effect sizes. An analysis of association directions found a high degree of consistency. The square root n-weighted directions were 0.83 (K = 36), -0.81 (K = 41) and -0.82 (K = 39) for European, Amerindian and African BGA, respectively. An analysis of effect size magnitudes found that European BGA was positively associated with SES, with a meta-analytic effect size of r = .18 [95% CI: .13 to .24, K = 28, n = 35,476.50], while both Amerindian and African BGA were negatively associated with SES, having meta-analytic effect sizes of -.14 [-.18 to -.10, k =31, n = 28,937.50] and -.11 [-.15 to -.07, K = 28, n = 32,710.50], respectively. There was considerable cross-sample variation in effect sizes (mean I2 = 92%), but the sample size was not enough for performing credible moderator analysis.

    "abstract": "A quantitative model to genetically interpret the histology in whole microscopy slide images is desirable to guide downstream immuno-histochemistry, genomics, and precision medicine. We constructed a statistical model that predicts whether or not SPOP is mutated in prostate cancer, given only the digital whole slide after standard hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] staining. Using a TCGA cohort of 177 prostate cancer patients where 20 had mutant SPOP, we trained multiple ensembles of residual networks, accurately distinguishing SPOP mutant from SPOP non-mutant patients (test AUROC=0.74, p=0.0007 Fishers Exact Test). We further validated our full metaensemble classifier on an independent test cohort from MSK-IMPACT of 152 patients where 19 had mutant SPOP. Mutants and non-mutants were accurately distinguished despite TCGA slides being frozen sections and MSK-IMPACT slides being formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (AUROC=0.86, p=0.0038). Moreover, we scanned an additional 36 MSK-IMPACT patients having mutant SPOP, trained on this expanded MSK-IMPACT cohort (test AUROC=0.75, p=0.0002), tested on the TCGA cohort (AUROC=0.64, p=0.0306), and again accurately distinguished mutants from non-mutants using the same pipeline. Importantly, our method demonstrates tractable deep learning in this \\\"small data\\\" setting of 20-55 positive examples and quantifies each predictions uncertainty with confidence intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first statistical model to predict a genetic mutation in cancer directly from the patients digitized H&E-stained whole microscopy slide. Moreover, this is the first time quantitative features learned from patient genetics and histology have been used for content-based image retrieval, finding similar patients for a given patient where the histology appears to share the same genetic driver of disease i.e. SPOP mutation (p=0.0241 Kosts Method), and finding similar patients for a given patient that does not have have that driver mutation (p=0.0170 Kosts Method).\\n\\nSignificance StatementThis is the first pipeline predicting gene mutation probability in cancer from digitized H&E-stained microscopy slides. To predict whether or not the speckle-type POZ protein [SPOP] gene is mutated in prostate cancer, the pipeline (i) identifies diagnostically salient slide regions, (ii) identifies the salient region having the dominant tumor, and (iii) trains ensembles of binary classifiers that together predict a confidence interval of mutation probability. Through deep learning on small datasets, this enables automated histologic diagnoses based on probabilities of underlying molecular aberrations and finds histologically similar patients by learned genetic-histologic relationships.\\n\\nConception, Writing: AJS, TJF.

    "abstract": "Cancer hallmarks are evolutionary traits required by a tumour to develop. While extensively characterised, the way these traits are achieved through the accumulation of somatic mutations in key biological pathways is not fully understood. To shed light on this subject, we characterised the landscape of pathway alterations associated with somatic mutations observed in 4,415 patients across ten cancer types, using 374 orthogonal pathway gene-sets mapped onto canonical cancer hallmarks. Towards this end, we developed SLAPenrich: a computational method based on population-level statistics, freely available as an open source R package. Assembling the identified pathway alterations into sets of hallmark signatures allowed us to connect somatic mutations to clinically interpretable cancer mechanisms. Further, we explored the heterogeneity of these signatures, in terms of ratio of altered pathways associated with each individual hallmark, assuming that this is reflective of the extent of selective advantage provided to the cancer type under consideration. Our analysis revealed the predominance of certain hallmarks in specific cancer types, thus suggesting different evolutionary trajectories across cancer lineages.\\n\\nFinally, although many pathway alteration enrichments are guided by somatic mutations in frequently altered high-confidence cancer genes, excluding these driver mutations preserves the hallmark heterogeneity signatures, thus the detected hallmarks predominance across cancer types. As a consequence, we propose the hallmark signatures as a ground truth to characterise tails of infrequent genomic alterations and identify potential novel cancer driver genes and networks.",

However, it is unclear whether this simple 1-dimensional model is sufficiently rich to capture the set of key alterations of neural circuit processing in brain disorders. Here we used a combination of computational modeling and large-scale analysis of in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging data from somatosensory cortex of wild-type and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice, a model of Fragile X syndrome, to test the E/I imbalance model. Our main findings were: 1) the E/I imbalance model was not rich enough to capture the alterations in neural activity statistics in Fmr1 KO mice; 2) in a computational model we found greatly varying magnitudes and directions of effects of synaptic and cellular properties on network activity; 3) evidence for opposite changes in circuit properties of Fmr1 KO mice at different stages of development; 4) a reduction in the entropy of circuit activity in young Fmr1 KO mice compared to wild-type, but an opposite increase in adult Fmr1 KO mice. These findings suggest qualitatively new strategies for developing treatments for Fragile-X Syndrome and related disorders.",

This is difficult since many traits evolve simultaneously as populations or species diverge. Here we investigate the ecological variables and traits that underlie Mimulus laciniatus adaptation to granite outcrops compared to its sympatric, mesic-adapted progenitor M. guttatus. We use fine scale measurements of soil moisture and herbivory to examine differences in selective forces between the species habitats, and measure selection on flowering time, flower size, plant height, and leaf shape in a reciprocal transplant using M. laciniatus x M. guttatus F4 hybrids. We find that differences in drought & herbivory drive survival differences between habitats, that M. laciniatus and M. guttatus are each better adapted to their native habitat, and differential habitat selection on flowering time, plant stature, and leaf shape. We conclude that while early flowering time, small stature, and lobed leaf shape underlie plant fitness in M. laciniatus seasonally dry environment, increased plant size is advantageous in a competitive mesic environment replete with herbivores like M. guttatus.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetics can be used to elucidate the movement of genes between populations of organisms, using phylogeographic methods. This has been widely done to quantify pathogen movement between different host populations, the migration history of humans, and the geographic spread of languages or the gene flow between species using the location or state of samples alongside sequence data. Phylogenies therefore offer insights into migration processes not available from classic epidemiological or occurrence data alone. Phylogeographic methods have however several known shortcomings. In particular, one of the most widely used methods treats migration the same as mutation, and therefore does not incorporate information about population demography. This may lead to severe biases in estimated migration rates for datasets where sampling is biased across populations. The structured coalescent on the other hand allows us to coherently model the migration and coalescent process, but current implementations struggle with complex datasets due to the need to infer ancestral migration histories. Thus, approximations to the structured coalescent, which integrate over all ancestral migration histories, have been developed. However, the validity and robustness of these approximations remain unclear. We present an exact numerical solution to the structured coalescent that does not require the inference of migration histories. While this solution is computationally unfeasible for large datasets, it clarifies the assumptions of previously developed approximate methods and allows us to provide an improved approximation to the structured coalescent. We have implemented these methods in BEAST2, and we show how these methods compare under different scenarios.",

Brazil has the highest number of reported ZIKV cases worldwide (>200,000 by 24 Dec 20162) as well as the greatest number of cases associated with microcephaly and other birth defects (2,366 confirmed cases by 31 Dec 20162). Following the initial detection of ZIKV in Brazil, 47 countries and territories in the Americas have reported local ZIKV transmission, with 22 of these reporting ZIKV-associated severe disease3. Yet the origin and epidemic history of ZIKV in Brazil and the Americas remain poorly understood, despite the value of such information for interpreting past trends in reported microcephaly. To address this we generated 53 complete or partial ZIKV genomes, mostly from Brazil, including data generated by the ZiBRA project - a mobile genomics lab that travelled across Northeast Brazil in 2016. One sequence represents the earliest confirmed ZIKV infection in Brazil. Joint analyses of viral genomes with ecological and epidemiological data estimate that the ZIKV epidemic first became established in NE Brazil by March 2014 and likely disseminated from there, both nationally and internationally, before the first detection of ZIKV in the Americas. Estimated dates of the international spread of ZIKV from Brazil coincide with periods of high vector suitability in recipient regions and indicate the duration of pre-detection cryptic transmission in those regions. NE Brazils role in the establishment of ZIKV in the Americas is further supported by geographic analysis of ZIKV transmission potential and by estimates of the virus basic reproduction number.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryVirus genomes reveal the establishment of Zika virus in Northeast Brazil and the Americas, and provide an appropriate timeframe for baseline (pre-Zika) microcephaly in different regions.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection maintains advantageous diversity in populations through various mechanisms. While extensively explored from a theoretical perspective, an empirical understanding of its prevalence and targets lags behind our knowledge of positive selection. Here we describe the Non-Central Deviation (NCD), a simple yet powerful statistic to detect long-term balancing selection (LTBS) that quantifies how close frequencies are to expectations under LTBS, and provides the basis for a neutrality test. NCD can be applied to a single locus or genomic data, and can be implemented considering only polymorphisms (NCD1) or also considering fixed differences with respect to an outgroup (NCD2) species. Incorporating fixed differences improves power, and NCD2 has higher power to detect LTBS in humans under different frequencies of the balanced allele(s) than other available methods. Applied to genome-wide data from African and European human populations, in both cases using chimpanzee as an outgroup, NCD2 shows that, albeit not prevalent, LTBS affects a sizable portion of the genome: about 0.6% of analyzed genomic windows and 0.8% of analyzed positions. Significant windows (p < 0.0001) contain 1.6% of SNPs in the genome, which disproportionally fall within exons and change protein sequence, but are not enriched in putatively regulatory sites. These windows overlap about 8% of the protein-coding genes, and these have larger number of transcripts than expected by chance even after controlling for gene length. Our catalog includes known targets of LTBS but a majority of them (90%) are novel. As expected, immune-related genes are among those with the strongest signatures, although most candidates are involved in other biological functions, suggesting that LTBS potentially influences diverse human phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits remains a major challenge in biology. Polygenicity, phenotypic plasticity and epistasis contribute to phenotypic variance in ways that are rarely clear. This uncertainty is problematic for estimating heritability, for predicting individual phenotypes from genomic data, and for parameterizing models of phenotypic evolution. Here we report a recombinant inbred line (RIL) quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping panel for the hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the C. elegans multiparental experimental evolution (CeMEE) panel. The CeMEE panel, comprising 507 RILs, was created by hybridization of 16 wild isolates, experimental evolution at moderate population sizes and predominant outcrossing for 140-190 generations, and inbreeding by selfing for 13-16 generations. The panel contains 22% of single nucleotide polymorphisms known to segregate in natural populations, and complements existing mapping resources for C. elegans by providing high nucleotide diversity across >95% of the genome. We apply it to study the genetic basis of two fitness components, fertility and hermaphrodite body size at time of reproduction, with high broad sense heritability in the CeMEE. While simulations show we should detect common alleles with additive effects as small as 5%, at gene-level resolution, the genetic architectures of these traits does not feature such alleles. We instead find that a significant fraction of trait variance, particularly for fertility, can be explained by sign epistasis with weak main effects. In congruence, phenotype prediction, while generally poor (r2 < 10%), requires modeling epistasis for optimal accuracy, with most variance attributed to the highly recombinant, rapidly evolving chromosome arms.",

In the continuous branch case we suggest approximations to the limit distribution. We propose heuristic methods of simulating from these distributions and it may be observed that these algorithms result in reasonable tails. Therefore, we propose a way based on the quantiles of the derived distributions for hypothesis testing, whether an observed phylogenetic tree is consistent with the pure-birth process. Simulating a sample by the proposed heuristics is rapid, while exact simulation (simulating the tree and then calculating the index) is a time-consuming procedure.

Demosponges form the largest class in sponges, but previous studies have relied on the only draft demosponge genome of Amphimedon queenslandica. Here we present the 125-megabase draft genome of a contractile laboratory demosponge Tethya wilhelma, sequenced to almost 150x coverage. We explore the genetic repertoire of transporters, receptors, and neurotransmitter metabolism across early-branching metazoans in the context of the evolution of these gene families. Presence of many genes is highly variable across animal groups, with many gene family expansions and losses. Three sponge classes show lineage-specific expansions of GABA-B receptors, far exceeding the gene number in vertebrates, while ctenophores appear to have secondarily lost most genes in the GABA pathway. Both GABA and glutamate receptors show lineage-specific domain rearrangements, making it difficult to trace the evolution of these gene families. Gene sets in the examined taxa suggest that nervous systems evolved independently at least twice and either changed function or were lost in sponges. Changes in gene content are consistent with the view that ctenophores and sponges are the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and provide additional support for the proposed clade of Placozoa/Cnidaria/Bilateria.",

One can then ask, for an arbitrary individuals brain: given recordings from a limited set of locations in that individuals brain, along with the observed spatial correlations learned from other peoples recordings, how much can be inferred about ongoing activity at other locations throughout that individuals brain?

Such genetic variants can be drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis and, as a side effect, create new vulnerabilities for potential therapeutic exploitation. To systematically identify genotype-dependent vulnerabilities and synthetic lethal interactions, forward genetic screens in different genetic backgrounds have been conducted. We devised MINGLE, a computational framework that integrates CRISPR/Cas9 screens originating from many different libraries and laboratories to build genetic interaction maps. It builds on analytical approaches that were established for genetic network discovery in model organisms. We applied this method to integrate and analyze data from 85 CRISPR/Cas9 screens in human cancer cell lines combining functional data with information on genetic variants to explore the relationships of more than 2.1 million gene-background relationships. In addition to known dependencies, our analysis identified new genotype-specific vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Experimental validation of predicted vulnerabilities associated with aberrant Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling identified GANAB and PRKCSH as new positive regulators of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. By clustering genes with similar genetic interaction profiles, we drew the largest genetic network in cancer cells to date. Our scalable approach highlights how diverse genetic screens can be integrated to systematically build informative maps of genetic interactions in cancer, which can grow dynamically as more data is included.",

    "abstract": "Sperm hyper-activation is a dramatic change in sperm behavior where mature sperm burst into a final sprint in the race to the egg. The mechanism of sperm hyper-activation in many metazoans, including humans, consists of a jolt of Ca2+ into the sperm flagellum via CatSper ion channels. Surprisingly, CatSper genes have been independently lost in several animal lineages. In Drosophila, sperm hyper-activation is performed through the co-option of the polycystic kidney disease 2 (Dpkd2) Ca2+ channel. The parallels between CatSpers in primates and Dpkd2 in Drosophila provide a unique opportunity to examine the molecular evolution of the sperm hyper-activation machinery in two independent, nonhomologous calcium channels separated by more than 500 million years of divergence. Here, we use a comprehensive phylogenomic approach to investigate the selective pressures on these sperm hyper-activation channels. First, we find that the entire CatSper complex evolves rapidly under recurrent positive selection in primates. Second, we find that pkd2 has parallel patterns of adaptive evolution in Drosophila. Third, we show that this adaptive evolution of pkd2 is driven by its role in sperm hyper-activation. These patterns of selection suggest that the evolution of the sperm hyper-activation machinery is driven by sexual conflict with antagonistic ligands that modulate channel activity. Together, our results add sperm hyper-activation channels to the class of fast evolving reproductive proteins and provide insights into the mechanisms used by the sexes to manipulate sperm behavior.",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of fitness-affecting mutations are deleterious. How natural populations evolve to cope is a question of fundamental interest. Previous studies have reported the evolution of mutational robustness, that is, natural selection favoring populations with less deleterious mutations. By definition, mutational robustness provides a short-term fitness advantage. However, this overlooks the fact that mutational robustness decreases finite asexual populations ability to purge recurrent deleterious mutations. Thus, mutational robustness also results in higher risk of long-term extinction by Mullers ratchet. Here, we explore the tension between short- and long- term response to deleterious mutations. We first show that populations can resist the ratchet if either the selection coefficient or the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations increases as fitness declines. We designate these properties as ratchet robustness, which fundamentally reflects a negative feedback between mutation rate and the tendency to accumulate more mutations. We also find in simulations that populations can evolve ratchet robustness when challenged by deleterious mutations. We conclude that mutational robustness cannot be selected for in the long term, but it can be favored in the short-term, purely because of temporary fitness advantage. We also discuss other potential causes of mutational robustness in nature.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in sensory neuroscience involves understanding how neural circuits shape computations across cascaded cell layers. Here we develop a computational framework to reconstruct the response properties of experimentally unobserved neurons in the interior of a multilayered neural circuit. We combine non-smooth regularization with proximal consensus algorithms to overcome difficulties in fitting such models that arise from the high dimensionality of their parameter space. Our methods are statistically and computationally efficient, enabling us to rapidly learn hierarchical non-linear models as well as efficiently compute widely used descriptive statistics such as the spike triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) for high dimensional stimuli. For example, with our regularization framework, we can learn the STA and STC using 5 and 10 minutes of data, respectively, at a level of accuracy that otherwise requires 40 minutes of data without regularization. We apply our framework to retinal ganglion cell processing, learning cascaded linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) models of retinal circuitry, consisting of thousands of parameters, using 40 minutes of responses to white noise. Our models demonstrate a 53% improvement in predicting ganglion cell spikes over classical linear-nonlinear (LN) models. Internal nonlinear subunits of the model match properties of retinal bipolar cells in both receptive field structure and number. Subunits had consistently high thresholds, leading to sparse activity patterns in which only one subunit drives ganglion cell spiking at any time. From the model's parameters, we predict that the removal of visual redundancies through stimulus decorrelation across space, a central tenet of efficient coding theory, originates primarily from bipolar cell synapses. Furthermore, the composite nonlinear computation performed by retinal circuitry corresponds to a boolean OR function applied to bipolar cell feature detectors. Our general computational framework may aid in extracting principles of nonlinear hierarchical sensory processing across diverse modalities from limited data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryComputation in neural circuits arises from the cascaded processing of inputs through multiple cell layers. Each of these cell layers performs operations such as filtering and thresholding in order to shape a circuits output. It remains a challenge to describe both the computations and the mechanisms that mediate them given limited data recorded from a neural circuit. A standard approach to describing circuit computation involves building quantitative encoding models that predict the circuit response given its input, but these often fail to map in an interpretable way onto mechanisms within the circuit. In this work, we build two layer linear-nonlinear cascade models (LN-LN) in order to describe how the retinal output is shaped by nonlinear mechanisms in the inner retina. We find that these LN-LN models, fit to ganglion cell recordings alone, identify filters and nonlinearities that are readily mapped onto individual circuit components inside the retina, namely bipolar cells and the bipolar-to-ganglion cell synaptic threshold. This work demonstrates how combining simple prior knowledge of circuit properties with partial experimental recordings of a neural circuits output can yield interpretable models of the entire circuit computation, including parts of the circuit that are hidden or not directly observed in neural recordings.",

In the case of craft beer, this has traditionally only encompassed locally sourced barley, hops, and other agricultural adjuncts. The identification and use of novel yeasts in brewing lags behind. We sought to bridge this gap by bio-prospecting for wild yeasts, with a focus on the American Midwest. We isolated 284 different strains from 54 species of yeast and have begun to determine their fermentation characteristics. During this work, we found several isolates of five species that produce lactic acid and ethanol during wort fermentation: Hanseniaspora vineae, Lachancea fermentati, Lachancea thermotolerans, Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. Tested representatives of these species yielded excellent attenuation, lactic acid production, and sensory characteristics, positioning them as viable alternatives to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for the production of sour beers. Indeed, we suggest a new LAB-free paradigm for sour beer production that we term \\\"primary souring\\\" because the lactic acid production and resultant pH decrease occurs during primary fermentation, as opposed to kettle souring or souring via mixed culture fermentation.\\n\\nChemical compounds studied in this article: Lactic acid (PubChem CID: 612); Ethanol (PubChem CID: 702)\\n\\nAbbreviations: ABV, alcohol by volume; DIC, differential interference contrast; EtOH, ethanol; FG, final gravity; gDNA, genomic DNA; IBU, international bittering unit; LAB, lactic acid bacteria; LASSO, lactic acid specific soft-agar overlay; N-J, neighbor-joining; OG, original gravity; WLN, Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient; YPD, yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose",

    "abstract": "In systems and synthetic biology, it is common to build chemical reaction network (CRN) models of biochemical circuits and networks. Although automation and other high-throughput techniques have led to an abundance of data enabling data-driven quantitative modeling and parameter estimation, the intense amount of simulation needed for these methods still frequently results in a computational bottleneck. Here we present bioscrape (Bio-circuit Stochastic Single-cell Reaction Analysis and Parameter Estimation) - a Python package for fast and flexible modeling and simulation of highly customizable chemical reaction networks. Specifically, bioscrape supports deterministic and stochastic simulations, which can incorporate delay, cell growth, and cell division. All functionalities - reaction models, simulation algorithms, cell growth models, partioning models, and Bayesian inference - are implemented as interfaces in an easily extensible and modular object-oriented framework. Models can be constructed via Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) or specified programmatically via a Python API. Simulation run times obtained with the package are comparable to those obtained using C code - this is particularly advantageous for computationally expensive applications such as Bayesian inference or simulation of cell lineages.

    "abstract": "The enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), found in strictly anaerobic methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea, catalyzes a reversible reaction involved in the production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The  subunit of this enzyme (McrA) contains several unusual post-translational modifications, including an exceptionally rare thioamidation of glycine. Based on the presumed function of homologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of thioamide-containing natural products, we hypothesized that the archaeal tfuA and ycaO genes would be responsible for post-translational installation of thioglycine into McrA. Mass spectrometric characterization of McrA in a {Delta}ycaO-tfuA mutant of the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans revealed the presence of glycine, rather than thioglycine, supporting this hypothesis. Physiological characterization of this mutant suggested a new role for the thioglycine modification in enhancing protein stability, as opposed to playing a direct catalytic role. The universal conservation of this modification suggests that MCR arose in a thermophilic ancestor.",

In contrast, diverse evidence suggests that the system is mercurial in the unicellular fresh water green alga, Chlamydomonas, but intense autofluorescence from photosynthesis pigments has hindered the investigation. By expressing a bright fluorescent reporter protein at the endogenous level, we demonstrate in real time discreet sweeping changes in algal microtubules elicited by fluctuation of intracellular H+ and Na+.

Yet, the causal role of the gut microbiota during host aging is largely unexplored. Here, using the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), a naturally short-lived vertebrate, we show that the gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating vertebrate life span. Recolonizing the gut of middle-age individuals with bacteria from young donors resulted in life span extension and delayed behavioral decline. This intervention prevented the decrease in microbial diversity associated with host aging and maintained a young-like gut bacterial community, characterized by overrepresentation of the key genera Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Propionigenium and Psychrobacter. Our findings demonstrate that the natural microbial gut community of young individuals can causally induce long-lasting beneficial systemic effects that lead to life span extension in a vertebrate model.",

    "abstract": "Polyadenylation is a nuclear process that involves the endonucleolytic cleavage of RNA transcripts and the addition of poly(A) tails. The cleavage often takes place at different positions within the same RNA transcript, generating alternative 3ends. Polyadenylation regulates mRNA localization, stability and translation and is likely to regulate complex processes such as synapse formation, synaptic plasticity and memory. Here we examined whether PolyA Binding Protein Nuclear 1 (Pabpn1), an RNA binding protein known to regulate alternative polyadenylation and polyA tail length in other systems, regulates neuronal mRNA function. Using immunocytochemistry we determined that Pabpn1 is present in both hippocampal slices and cultured hippocampal neurons. Applying shRNAs to knock-down Pabpn1 we discovered that Pabpn1 regulates the mRNA abundance and localization of key synaptic plasticity genes including Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II Alpha (Camk2a) and Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor AMPA Type Subunit 2 (Gria2). Furthermore, Pabpn1 knock-down prevented the homeostatic scaling of synaptic transmission elicited by bicuculline. These data demonstrate a link between Pabpn1, polyadenylation and neuronal plasticity.",

    "abstract": "A putative lipopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster is conserved in many species of Actinobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. marinum, but the specific function of the encoding proteins has been elusive. Using both in vivo heterologous reconstitution and in intro biochemical analyses, we have revealed that the five encoding biosynthetic enzymes are capable of synthesizing a new family of isonitrile lipopeptides (INLPs) through a thio-template mechanism. The biosynthesis features the generation of isonitrile from a single precursor Gly promoted by a thioesterase and a non-heme iron(II)-dependent oxidase homologue, and the acylation of both amino groups of Lys by the same isonitrile acyl chain facilitated by a single condensation domain of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). In addition, the deletion of INLP biosynthetic genes in M. marinum has decreased the intracellular metal concentration, suggesting the role of this biosynthetic gene cluster in metal transport.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMycobacterium tuberculosis is the leading causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), of which millions of deaths occur annually. A putative lipopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster has been shown to be essential for the survival of this pathogen in hosts, and homologous gene clusters have also been found in all pathogenic mycobacteria and other species of Actinobacteria. We have identified the function of these gene clusters in making a new family of isonitrile lipopeptides. The biosynthesis has several unique features, including an unprecedented mechanism for isonitrile synthesis. Our results have further suggested that these biosynthetic gene clusters play a role in metal transport, and thus have shed light on a new metal transport system that is crucial for virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Trihelix transcription factors are characterized by containing a conserved trihelix (helix-loop-helix-loop-helix) domain that bind to GT elements required for light response, play roles in light stress, and also in abiotic stress responses. However, only few of them have been functionally characterised. In the present study, we characterized the function of AST1 (Arabidopsis SIP1 clade Trihelix1) in response to abiotic stress. AST1 shows transcriptional activation activity, and its expression is induced by osmotic and salt stress. The genes regulated by AST1 were identified using qRT-PCR and transcriptome assays. A conserved sequence highly present in the promoters of genes regulated by AST1 was identified, which is bound by AST1, and termed AGAG-box with the sequence [A/G][G/A][A/T]GAGAG. Additionally, AST1 also binds to some GT motifs including GGTAATT, TACAGT, GGTAAAT and GGTAAA, but failed in binding to GTTAC and GGTTAA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with qRT-PCR analysis suggested that AST1 binds to AGAG-box and/or some GT motifs to regulate the expression of stress tolerance genes, resulting in reduced reactive oxygen species, Na+ accumulation, stomatal apertures, lipid peroxidation, cell death and water loss rate, and increased proline content and reactive oxygen species scavenging capability. These physiological changes mediated by AST1 finally improve abiotic stress tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Unlike synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability is assumed to be a stable property of neurons. For example, learning of somatic conductances is generally not incorporated into computational models, and the discharge pattern of neurons in response to test stimuli is frequently used as a basis for phenotypic classification. However, it is increasingly evident that signal processing properties of neurons are more generally plastic on the timescale of minutes. Here we demonstrate that the intrinsic firing patterns of CA3 neurons of the rat hippocampus in vitro undergo rapid long-term plasticity in response to a few minutes of only subthreshold synaptic conditioning. This plasticity on the spike-timing could also be induced by intrasomatic injection of subthreshold depolarizing pulses and was blocked by kinase inhibitors, indicating that discharge dynamics are modulated locally. Cluster analysis of firing patterns before and after conditioning revealed systematic transitions towards adapting and intrinsic burst behaviours, irrespective of the patterns initially exhibited by the cells. We used a conductance-based model to decide appropriate pharmacological blockade, and found that the observed transitions are likely due to recruitment of calcium and M-type potassium conductances. We conclude that CA3 neurons adapt their conductance profile to the subthreshold activity of their input, so that their intrinsic firing pattern is not a static signature, but rather a reflection of their history of subthreshold activity. In this way, recurrent output from CA3 neurons may collectively shape the temporal dynamics of their embedding circuits.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDespite being widely conserved across the animal phyla, it is still a mystery why nerve cells present diverse discharge dynamics upon somatic step currents. Adding a new timing dimension to the intrinsic plasticity literature, here we show that CA3 neurons rapidly adapt through the space of known firing patterns in response to the subthreshold signals that they receive from their embedding circuit. This result implies that CA3 neurons collectively adjust their network processing to the temporal statistics of their circuit.",

    "abstract": "It is generally believed that during economic decisions, striatal neurons represent the values associated with different actions. This hypothesis is based on a large number of studies, in which the neural activity of striatal neurons was measured while the subject was learning to prefer the more rewarding action. Here we show that these publications are subject to at least one of two critical confounds and that most are subject to both. First, we show that even weak temporal correlations in the neuronal data may result in an erroneous identification of action-value representations. We demonstrate this by erroneously identifying action-value representations, both in simulations and in the neural activity recorded in unrelated experiments. Second, we show that the experiments and analyses designed to dissociate action-value representation from the representation of other decision variables cannot do so. Specifically, we show that neurons representing policy may be erroneous identified as representing action-values. We suggest different solutions to identifying action-value representation that are not subject to these confounds. Applying one of these solutions to previously identified action-value neurons in the basal ganglia we fail to detect action-value representations there. Thus, we conclude that the claim that striatal neurons encode action-values must await new experiments and analyses.",
