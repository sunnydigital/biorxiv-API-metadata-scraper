    "abstract": "As a global issue the effects of climate change are difficult to manage on a region scale. However, more often than not it is only one of many problems that need to be addressed in species conservation. Non-climatic factors - especially those of anthropogenic origins - play equally if not more important roles with regards to population developments of species and often provide much better toeholds for conservation activities. We examined the population trends of the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in New Zealand using monitoring data dating back to the 1980s. We developed a Bayesian population model incorporating various climatic factors to assess the relative influence of climate change on the penguin numbers over the past 30 years. Sea surface temperature (SST) proved to be the dominating factor influencing survival of both adult birds and fledglings. Increasing SST since the mid-1990s went along with a reduction in survival rates and population decline. The population model showed that 33% of the variation in population numbers could be explained by SST alone, significantly increasing pressure on the penguin population. Consequently, the population becomes less resilient to nonclimate related impacts, such as fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and human disturbance. But their exact contribution towards population trends is extremely difficult to assess principally due to the absence of quantifiable data. This potentially creates an analysis bias towards climate variables, effectively distracting from non-climate factors that can be managed on a regional scale to ensure the viability of the population.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition refers to the ability to reflect on and monitor ones cognitive processes, such as perception, memory and decision-making. Metacognition is often assessed in the lab by whether an observers confidence ratings are predictive of objective success, but simple correlations between performance and confidence are susceptible to undesirable influences such as response biases. Recently an alternative approach to measuring metacognition has been developed (Maniscalco & Lau, 2012) that characterises metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d') by assuming a generative model of confidence within the framework of signal detection theory. However, current estimation routines require an abundance of confidence rating data to recover robust parameters, and only provide point estimates of meta-d. In contrast, hierarchical Bayesian estimation methods provide opportunities to enhance statistical power, incorporate uncertainty in group-level parameter estimates and avoid edge-correction confounds. Here I introduce such a method for estimating metacognitive efficiency (meta-d/d) from confidence ratings and demonstrate its application for assessing group differences. A tutorial is provided on both the meta-d model and the preparation of behavioural data for model fitting. Through numerical simulations I show that a hierarchical approach outperforms alternative fitting methods in situations where limited data are available, such as when quantifying metacognition in patient populations. In addition, the model may be flexibly expanded to estimate parameters encoding other influences on metacognitive efficiency.

Small-scale genetic structures of female genotypes in truffle orchards are known, but it has not yet been studied in male genotypes. In this study, our aim was to characterize the small-scale genetic structure of both male and female genotypes over five years in an orchard to better understand the T. melanosporum sexual reproduction strategy, male genotype dynamics, and origins. Two-hundred forty-one ascocarps, 475 ectomycorrhizas, and 20 soil cores were harvested and genotyped using microsatellites and mating type genes. Isolation by distance analysis revealed pronounced small-scale genetic structures for both female and male genotypes. The genotypic diversity was higher for male than female genotypes with numerous small size genotypes suggesting an important turnover due to ascospore recruitment. Larger and perennial female and male genotypes were also detected. Only three genotypes (1.5 %) were found as both female and male genotypes (hermaphrodites) while most were detected only as female or male genotype (dioecy). Our results suggest that germinating ascospores act as male genotypes, but we also proposed that soil mycelium could be a reservoir of male genotypes.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that the allocation and synthesis of total cellular resources in microorganisms are uniquely determined by the growth conditions. Adaptation to a new physiological state leads to a change in cell size via reallocation of cellular resources. However, it has not been understood how cell size is coordinated with biosynthesis and robustly adapts to physiological states. We show that cell size in Escherichia coli can be predicted for any steady-state condition by projecting all biosynthesis into three measurable variables representing replication initiation, replication-division cycle, and the global biosynthesis rate. These variables can be decoupled by selectively controlling their respective core biosynthesis using CRISPR interference and antibiotics, verifying our predictions that different physiological states can result in the same cell size. We performed extensive growth inhibition experiments, and discovered that cell size at replication initiation per origin, namely the initiation mass or \\\"unit cell,\\\" is remarkably invariant under perturbations targeting transcription, translation, ribosome content, replication kinetics, fatty acid and cell-wall synthesis, cell division, and cell shape. Based on this invariance and balanced resource allocation, we explain why the total cell size is the sum of all unit cells. These results provide an overarching framework with quantitative predictive power over cell size in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Organ formation is a multi-scale event that involves changes at the intracellular, cellular and tissue level. Organogenesis often starts with the formation of characteristically shaped organ precursors. However, the cellular mechanisms driving organ precursor formation are often not clear. Here, using zebrafish, we investigate the epithelial rearrangements responsible for the development of the hemispherical retinal neuroepithelium (RNE), a part of the optic cup. We show that in addition to basal shrinkage of RNE cells, active migration of connected epithelial cells into the RNE is a crucial player in its formation. This cellular movement is driven by progressive cell-matrix contacts and actively translocates prospective RNE cells to their correct location before they adopt neuroepithelial fate. Failure of this migration during neuroepithelium formation leads to ectopic determination of RNE cells and consequently impairs optic cup formation. Overall, this study illustrates how spatiotemporal coordination between morphogenic movements and fate determination critically influences organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "A common approach to design genetic circuits is to compose gene expression cassettes together. While appealing, this modular approach is challenged by the fact that expression of each gene depends on the availability of transcriptional/translational resources, which is in turn determined by the presence of other genes in the circuit. This raises the question of how competition for resources by different genes affects a circuits behavior. Here, we create a library of genetic activation cascades in bacteria E. coli, where we explicitly tune the resource demand by each gene. We develop a general Hill-function-based model that incorporates resource competition effects through resource demand coefficients. These coefficients lead to non-regulatory interactions among genes that reshape circuits behavior. For the activation cascade, such interactions result in surprising biphasic or monotonically decreasing responses. Finally, we use resource demand coefficients to guide the choice of ribosome binding site (RBS) and DNA copy number to restore the cascades intended monotonically increasing response. Our results demonstrate how unintended circuits behavior arises from resource competition and provide a model-guided methodology to minimize the resulting effects.\\n\\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Geographically limited dispersal can shape genetic population structure and result in a correlation between genetic and geographic distance, commonly called isolation-bydistance. Despite the prevalence of isolation-by-distance in nature, to date few studies have empirically demonstrated the processes that generate this pattern, largely because few populations have direct measures of individual dispersal and pedigree information. Intensive, long-term demographic studies and exhaustive genomic surveys in the Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of dispersal on genetic structure. Here, we used a panel of genome-wide SNPs and extensive pedigree information to explore the role of limited dispersal in shaping patterns of isolation-by-distance in both sexes, and at an exceedingly fine spatial scale (within ~10 km). Isolation-by-distance patterns were stronger in male-male and male-female comparisons than in female-female comparisons, consistent with observed differences in dispersal propensity between the sexes. Using the pedigree, we demonstrated how various genealogical relationships contribute to fine-scale isolation-by-distance. Simulations using field-observed distributions of male and female natal dispersal distances showed good agreement with the distribution of geographic distances between breeding individuals of different pedigree relationship classes. Furthermore, we extended Malecots theory of isolation-by-distance by building coalescent simulations parameterized by the observed dispersal curve, population density, and immigration rate, and showed how incorporating these extensions allows us to accurately reconstruct observed sex-specific isolation-by-distance patterns in autosomal and Z-linked SNPs. Therefore, patterns of fine-scale isolation-by-distance in the Florida Scrub-Jay can be well understood as a result of limited dispersal over contemporary timescales.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDispersal is a fundamental component of the life history of most organisms and therefore influences many biological processes. Dispersal is particularly important in creating genetic structure on the landscape. We often observe a pattern of decreased genetic relatedness between individuals as geographic distances increases, or isolation-by-distance. This pattern is particularly pronounced in organisms with extremely short dispersal distances. Despite the ubiquity of isolation-by-distance patterns in nature, there are few examples that explicitly demonstrate how limited dispersal influences spatial genetic structure. Here we investigate the processes that result in spatial genetic structure using the Florida Scrub-Jay, a bird with extremely limited dispersal behavior and extensive genome-wide data. We take advantage of the long-term monitoring of a contiguous population of Florida Scrub-Jays, which has resulted in a detailed pedigree and measurements of dispersal for hundreds of individuals. We show how limited dispersal results in close genealogical relatives living closer together geographically, which generates a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance at an extremely small spatial scale (<10 km) in just a few generations. Given the detailed dispersal, pedigree, and genomic data, we can achieve a fairly complete understanding of how dispersal shapes patterns of genetic diversity over short spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "To stand straight and upright along their growth, plants needs to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observation of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed (tilted) coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. This relationship appears to be critical to the postural control of the organ, and indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila segmentation is a well-established paradigm for developmental pattern formation. However, the later stages of segment patterning, regulated by the \\\"pair-rule\\\" genes, are still not well understood at the systems level. Building on established genetic interactions, I construct a logical model of the Drosophila pair-rule system that takes into account the demonstrated stage-specific architecture of the pair-rule gene network. Simulation of this model can accurately recapitulate the observed spatiotemporal expression of the pair-rule genes, but only when the system is provided with dynamic \\\"gap\\\" inputs. This result suggests that dynamic shifts of pair-rule stripes are essential for segment patterning in the trunk, and provides a functional role for observed posterior-to-anterior gap domain shifts that occur during cellularisation. The model also suggests revised patterning mechanisms for the parasegment boundaries, and accounts for the even-skipped null mutant phenotype. Strikingly, a slightly modified version of the model is able to pattern segments in either simultaneous or sequential modes, depending only on initial conditions. This suggest that fundamentally similar mechanisms may underlie segmentation in short-germ and long-germ arthropods.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale genomic, chemical and pharmacological data provides new opportunities for drug discovery and repositioning. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous data not only serves as a promising tool for identifying new drug-target interactions (DTIs), which is an important step in drug development, but also provides a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drug action. In this work, we integrate diverse drug-related information, including drugs, proteins, diseases and side-effects, together with their interactions, associations or similarities, to construct a heterogeneous network with 12,015 nodes and 1,895,445 edges. We then develop a new computational pipeline, called DTINet, to predict novel drug-target interactions from the constructed heterogeneous network. Specifically, DTINet focuses on learning a low-dimensional vector representation of features for each node, which accurately explains the topological properties of individual nodes in the heterogeneous network, and then predicts the likelihood of a new DTI based on these representations via a vector space projection scheme. DTINet achieves substantial performance improvement over other state-of-the-art methods for DTI prediction. Moreover, we have experimentally validated the novel interactions between three drugs and the cyclooxygenase (COX) protein family predicted by DTINet, and demonstrated the new potential applications of these identified COX inhibitors in preventing inflammatory diseases. These results indicate that DTINet can provide a practically useful tool for integrating heterogeneous information to predict new drug-target interactions and repurpose existing drugs.

    "abstract": "To understand cellular coordination of multiple transcriptome regulation mechanisms, we simultaneously measured transcription rate (TR), mRNA abundance (RA) and translation activity (TA). This revealed multiple quantitative insights. First, the genomic profiles of the three parameters are systematically different in key statistical features. Sequentially more genes exhibit extreme low or high expression values from TR to RA, then to TA. That is, because of cellular coordination of these regulatory mechanisms, sequentially higher levels of gene expression selectivity are achieved as genetic information flow from the genome to the proteome. Second, the contribution of the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism to the cellular coordination process was assessed. The data enabled an estimation of mRNA stability, revealing a moderate but significant positive correlation between the estimated mRNA stability and translation activity. Third, the proportion of a mRNA occupied by un-translated regions (UTR) exhibits a negative relationship with the level of this correlation, and is thus a major determinant of the mode of regulation of the mRNA. High-UTR-proportion mRNAs tend to defy the stabilization-by-translation regulatory mechanism, staying out of the polysome but remaining stable; mRNAs with little UTRs largely follow this regulation. In summary, we quantitatively delineated the relationship among multiple transcriptome regulation parameters, i.e., cellular coordination of corresponding regulatory mechanisms.",

First, we found that duration estimation was resilient to changes in surface or numerosity, whereas lengthening (shortening) duration yielded under- (over-) estimations of surface and numerosity.

However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1).

In addition, CRISPR/Cas9 editing could be benefited once more attention is given to potential abnormal splicing outcomes other than off-target effects at the DNA level. Although large-scale multiplexed genome editing has been demonstrated in yeast, and has also been attempted for particular exons or genes in other eukaryotic cells to achieve saturation, in practice it is much more difficult to measure splicing consequences with genome-wide saturation editing in human cells. Instead, massive somatic mutations accumulated in cancer cohorts provide invaluable opportunities to study somatic mutation-associated splicing events. Abnormal splicing is not necessarily limited to single genes. Transcript fusion is a special form of abnormal splicing that connects two or more genes due to splicing on a transcriptional level (rather than chromosomal translocations such as BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia). It could arise from conventional splicing on read-through transcripts when the two genes are next to each other and on the same strand, or from trans-splicing when two genes are on different chromosomes, strands or far away - a few cases had been reported. However, it was found that these fusions not only occurred in tumors but also in normal tissues; there was limited investigation regarding how the fusion could happen, whether it be due to mutations or not, and what the downstream perturbations were. Here, in an effort to characterize somatic mutation-associated abnormal splicing (especially in its simplest form, exon skipping events), we identified over one hundred such events in various tumors, including those in MET, PTEN and TP53. Surprisingly, we detected a recurrent, but previously undescribed, tumor-specific transcript fusion event between the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and the RAS oncogene family gene RAB44. By creating genome-edited cell lines, we demonstrate a causal relationship between splice-site mutations in CDKN1A and the fusion to the RAB44 transcript. We further provide evidence that the fusion arises from a readthrough transcript that escapes exosome-mediated degradation when the splice-site mutation occurred, and we show that the presence of the fusion transcript correlates with TP53 inactivation and CDK activation. The strong tissue specificity of RAB44 and the relatively high prevalence of this transcript fusion in multiple types of cancers warrants further study which could inform subclassifications of these cancers and the development of targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been widely used in explaining animal behavior. In reinforcement learning, the agent learns the value of the states in the task, collectively constituting the task state space, and use the knowledge to choose actions and acquire desired outcomes. It has been proposed that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes the task state space during reinforcement learning. However, it is not well understood how the OFC acquires and stores task state information. Here, we propose a neural network model based on reservoir computing. Reservoir networks exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic activity patterns that are suitable to encode task states. The information can be extracted by a linear readout trained with reinforcement learning. We demonstrate how the network acquires and stores the task structures. The network exhibits reinforcement learning behavior and its aspects resemble experimental findings of the OFC. Our study provides a theoretical explanation of how the OFC may contribute to reinforcement learning and a new approach to understanding the neural mechanism underlying reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Place cells of the rodent hippocampus fire action potentials when the animal traverses a particular spatial location in a given environment. Therefore, for any given trajectory one will observe a repeatable sequence of place cell activations as the animal explores. Interestingly, when the animal is quiescent or sleeping, one can observe similar sequences of activation, although at a highly compressed rate, known as \\\"replays\\\". It is hypothesized that this replay underlies the process of memory consolidation whereby memories are \\\"transferred\\\" from hippocampus to cortex. However, it remains unclear how the memory of a particular environment is actually encoded in the place cell activity and what the mechanism for replay is. Here we study how plasticity during spatial exploration shapes the patterns of synaptic connectivity in model networks of place cells. Specifically, we show how plasticity leads to the emergence of patterns of activity which represent the spatial environment learned. These states become spontaneously active when the animal is quiescent, reproducing the phenomenology of replays. Interestingly, replay emerges most rapidly when place cell activity is modulated by an ongoing oscillation. The optimal oscillation frequency can be calculated analytically, is directly related to the plasticity rule, and for experimentally determined values of the plasticity window in rodent slices gives values in the theta range. A major prediction of this model is that the pairwise correlation of place cells which encode for neighboring locations should increase during initial exploration, leading up to the critical transition. We find such an increase in a population of simultaneously recorded CA1 pyramidal cells from a rat exploring a novel track. Furthermore, in a rat in which hippocampal theta is reduced through inactivation of the medial septum we find no such increase. Our model is the first to show how theta-modulation can speed up learning by facilitating the emergence of environment-specific network-wide patterns of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal circuits.",

    "abstract": "The structure in cortical micro-circuits deviates from what would be expected in a purely random network, which has been seen as evidence of clustering. To address this issue we sought to reproduce the non-random features of cortical circuits by considering several distinct classes of network topology, including clustered networks, networks with distance-dependent connectivity and those with broad degree distributions. To our surprise we found that all these qualitatively distinct topologies could account equally well for all reported non-random features, despite being easily distinguishable from one another at the network level. This apparent paradox was a consequence of estimating network properties given only small sample sizes. In other words, networks which differ markedly in their global structure can look quite similar locally. This makes inferring network structure from small sample sizes, a necessity given the technical difficulty inherent in simultaneous intracellular recordings, problematic. We found that a network statistic called the sample degree correlation (SDC) overcomes this difficulty. The SDC depends only on parameters which can be reliably estimated given small sample sizes, and is an accurate fingerprint of every topological family. We applied the SDC criterion to data from rat visual and somatosensory cortex and discovered that the connectivity was not consistent with any of these main topological classes. However, we were able to fit the experimental data with a more general network class, of which all previous topologies were special cases. The resulting network topology could be interpreted as a combination of physical spatial dependence and non-spatial, hierarchical clustering.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe connectivity of cortical micro-circuits exhibits features which are inconsistent with a simple random network. Here we show that several classes of network models can account for this non-random structure despite qualitative differences in their global properties. This apparent paradox is a consequence of the small numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons in experiment: when inferred via small sample sizes many networks may be indistinguishable, despite being globally distinct. We develop a connectivity measure which successfully classifies networks even when estimated locally, with a few neurons at a time. We show that data from rat cortex is consistent with a network in which the likelihood of a connection between neurons depends on spatial distance and on non-spatial, asymmetric clustering.",

    "abstract": "The emergent dynamics in networks of recurrently coupled spiking neurons depends on the interplay between single-cell dynamics and network topology. Most theoretical studies on network dynamics have assumed simple topologies, such as connections which are made randomly and independently with a fixed probability (Erdos-Renyi network) (ER), or all-to-all connected networks. However, recent findings from slice experiments suggest that the actual patterns of connectivity between cortical neurons are more structured than in the ER random network. Here we explore how introducing additional higher-order statistical structure into the connectivity can affect the dynamics in neuronal networks. Specifically, we consider networks in which the number of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic contacts for each neuron, the degrees, are drawn from a joint degree distribution. We derive mean-field equations for a single population of homogeneous neurons and for a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, where the neurons can have arbitrary degree distributions. Through analysis of the mean-field equations and simulation of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, we show that such networks have potentially much richer dynamics than an equivalent ER network. Finally, we relate the degree distributions to so-called cortical motifs.",

However, connecting changes in gene expression to increased fitness, and identifying the functional basis of those changes, remains challenging. To study adaptive evolution of gene expression in real time, we performed long term experimental evolution (LTEE) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) in ammonium-limited chemostats. Following several hundred generations of continuous selection we found significant divergence of nitrogen-responsive gene expression in lineages with increased fitness. In multiple independent lineages we found repeated selection for non-synonymous mutations in the zinc finger DNA binding domain of the activating transcription factor (TF), GAT1, that operates within incoherent feedforward loops to control expression of the nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) regulon. Missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of GAT1 reduce its binding affinity for the GATAA consensus sequence in a promoter-specific manner, resulting in increased expression of ammonium permease genes via both direct and indirect effects, thereby conferring increased fitness. We find that altered transcriptional output of the NCR regulon results in antagonistic pleiotropy in alternate environments and that the DNA binding domain of GAT1 is subject to purifying selection in natural populations. Our study shows that adaptive evolution of gene expression can entail tuning expression output by quantitative changes in TF binding affinities while maintaining the overall topology of a gene regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the nature of decision-related signals in sensory neurons promises to give insights into their role in perceptual decision-making. Those signals, traditionally quantified as choice probabilities (CP), are well-understood in a feedforward framework assuming zero-signal trials with no choice bias. Here, we extend this understanding by analytically solving models of choice-related signals that account for informative stimuli, choice bias, and importantly, feedback signals reflecting either internal states, such as attention or belief, or the outcome of the decision process. First, we relate CPs to Choice Triggered Averages (CTAs), which quantify choice-related average changes in neural responses, and show that both have general expressions valid for activity-choice covariations of both feedforward or feedback origin. These expressions allow a meaningful calculation of CPs across all trials, including non-zero signal trials. Second, we derive how CPs and CTAs depend on feedforward and feedback weights and on noise correlations under several plausible model architectures. Third, we examine different types of feedback signals, related to predictive coding, probabilistic inference, and attention, and we predict how CPs and CTAs depend in each case on the stimulus signal level and on the neural tuning properties. Finally, we show that measuring both CPs and CTAs offers complementary information about the origin of choice-related signals, especially when studying temporal changes of activity-choice covariations across the trial time. Overall, our work provides new analytical tools to better understand the link between sensory representations and perceptual decisions.",

These characteristics were compared to the subjects DSM scores and ANT performance.\\n\\nResultsThe target-related potentials late characteristics from the C4 and C3 did not shown significant difference between the groups. The difference between ERPs of the C3 and C4 channels inside the interval of 40-290 ms after target onset was larger in the ADHD group than in control, mainly for incongruent target condition. This asymmetry and right late component were correlated with DSM scores, mainly to hyperactive and impulsive criteria.\\n\\nConclusionIn ADHD patients, the results suggest ERP pattern of right-side functional predominance in the motor control, which correlates to DSM scores, mainly to hyperactive and impulsive criteria.",

    "abstract": "Different coding strategies are used to represent odor information at various stages of the mammalian olfactory system. A temporal latency code represents odor identity in olfactory bulb (OB), but this temporal information is discarded in piriform cortex (PCx) where odor identity is instead encoded through ensemble membership. We developed a spiking PCx network model to understand how this transformation is implemented. In the model, the impact of OB inputs activated earliest after inhalation is amplified within PCx by diffuse recurrent collateral excitation, which then recruits strong, sustained feedback inhibition that suppresses the impact of later-responding glomeruli. Simultaneous OB-PCx recordings indicate that indeed, over a single sniff, the earliest-active OB inputs are most effective at driving PCx activity. We model increasing odor concentrations by decreasing glomerulus onset latencies while preserving their activation sequences. This produces a multiplexed cortical odor code in which activated ensembles are robust to concentration changes while concentration information is encoded through population synchrony. Our model demonstrates how PCx circuitry can implement multiplexed ensemble-identity/temporal-concentration odor coding.",

    "abstract": "In many disciplines, data is highly decentralized across thousands of online databases (repositories, registries, and knowledgebases). Wringing value from such databases depends on the discipline of data science and on the humble bricks and mortar that make integration possible; identifiers are a core component of this integration infrastructure. Drawing on our experience and on work by other groups, we outline ten lessons we have learned about the identifier qualities and best practices that facilitate large-scale data integration. Specifically, we propose actions that identifier practitioners (database providers) should take in the design, provision and reuse of identifiers; we also outline important considerations for those referencing identifiers in various circumstances, including by authors and data generators. While the importance and relevance of each lesson will vary by context, there is a need for increased awareness about how to avoid and manage common identifier problems, especially those related to persistence and web-accessibility/resolvability. We focus strongly on web-based identifiers in the life sciences; however, the principles are broadly relevant to other disciplines.",

    "abstract": "To decipher the molecular mechanism of biological function, it is critical to map the molecular composition of individual cells in the context of their biological environment in situ. Immunofluorescence (IF) provides specific labeling for molecular profiling. However, conventional IF methods have finite multiplexing capabilities due to spectral overlap of the fluorophores. Various sequential imaging methods have been developed to circumvent this spectral limit, but are not widely adopted due to the common limitation of requiring multi-rounds of slow (typically over 2 hours at room temperature to overnight at 4 {degrees}C in practice) immunostaining. DNA-Exchange-Imaging is a practical platform for rapid in situ spectrally-unlimited multiplexing. This technique overcomes speed restrictions by allowing for single-step immunostaining with DNA-barcoded antibodies, followed by rapid (less than 10 minutes) buffer exchange of fluorophore-bearing DNA imager strands. By eliminating the need for multiple rounds of immunostaining, DEI enables rapid spectrally unlimited sequential imaging. The programmability of DNA-Exchange-Imaging allows us to further adapt it to diverse microscopy platforms (with Exchange-Confocal, Exchange-SIM, Exchange-STED, and Exchange-PAINT demonstrated here), achieving highly multiplexed in situ protein visualization in diverse samples (including neuronal and tumor cells as well as fresh-frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue sections) and at multiple desired resolution scales (from ~300 nm down to sub-20-nm). Validation highlights include 8-target imaging using single-channel Exchange-Confocal in tens of micron thick retina tissue sections in 2-3 hours (as compared to days required in principle by previous methods using comparable equipment), and 8-target super-resolution imaging with ~20 nm resolution using Exchange-PAINT in primary neurons. These results collectively suggest DNA-Exchange as a versatile, practical platform for rapid, highly multiplexed in situ imaging, potentially enabling new applications ranging from basic science, to drug discovery, and to clinical pathology.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetics of lifetime fitness is crucial to understand a species ecological preferences and ultimately predict its ability to cope with novel environmental conditions. Yet, there is a dearth of information regarding the impact of the ecological variance experienced by natural populations on expressed phenotypic and fitness differences. Here, we follow the natural dynamics of experimental A. thaliana populations over 5 successive plantings whose timing was determined by the natural progression of the plants life cycle and disentangle the environmental and genetic factors that drive plant ecological performance at a given locality. We show that, at the intermediate latitude where the experiment was conducted, a given genotype can experience different life cycles across successive seasons. Lifetime fitness across these seasons varied strongly, with a fall planting yielding 36-fold higher fitness compared to a spring planting. In addition, the actual life-stage at which plant overwinter oscillated across years, depending on the timing of the end of the summer season. We observed a rare but severe fitness differential after inadequate early flowering in one of the five planting. Substrate variation played a comparatively minor role, but also contributed to modulate the magnitude of fitness differentials between genotypes. Finally, reciprocal introgressions on chromosome 4 demonstrated that the fitness effect of a specific chromosomal region is strongly contingent on micro-geographic and seasonal fluctuations. Our study contributes to emphasize the extent to which the fitness impact of phenotypic traits and the genes that encode them in the genome can fluctuate. Experiments aiming at dissecting the molecular basis of local adaptation must apprehend the complexity introduced by temporal fluctuations because they massively affect the expression of phenotype and fitness differences.",

Their navigational routes cross dynamic environments suggesting adaptation to novel configurations. Arthropods and vertebrates share neural organizational principles and it has been shown that rodents modulate their neural spatial representation accordingly with environmental changes. However, it is unclear whether insects reflexively adapt to environmental changes or retain memory traces of previously explored situations. We sought to disambiguate between insect behavior at environmental novel situations and reconfiguration conditions. An immersive mixed-reality multi-sensory setup was built to replicate multi-sensory cues. We have designed an experimental setup where female crickets Gryllus Bimaculatus were trained to move towards paired auditory and visual cues during primarily phonotactic driven behavior. We hypothesized that insects were capable of identifying sensory modifications in known environments. Our results show that, regardless of the animals history, novel situation conditions did not compromise the animals performance and navigational directionality towards a novel target location. However, in trials where visual and auditory stimuli were spatially decoupled, the animals heading variability towards a previously known location significantly increased. Our findings showed that crickets are able to behaviorally manifest environmental reconfiguration, suggesting the encoding for spatial representation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCyanobacteria are photoautotrophic organisms with environmental, evolutionary, and industrial importance. Knowledge of its regulatory interactions are important to predict, optimise, and engineer their characteristics. However, at present, very few of their regulatory interactions are known. The regulatory interactions are known only for a few model organisms such as Escherichia coli due to technical and economical constraints, which are unlikely to change soon. Thus, mapping of regulatory interactions from well-studied organisms to less-studied organisms by using computational techniques is widely used. Reverse Best Hit (RBH), with appropriate algorithm parameters, is a simple and efficient method for detecting functional homologs.\\n\\nDescriptionWe predict the regulatory interactions in 30 strains of cyanobacteria using the known regulatory interactions from the best-studied organism, E. coli. RBH method with appropriate parameters is used to identify the functional homologs. An interaction is mapped to a cyanobacterial strain if functional homologs exist for a known transcription factor and its target gene. The confidence of the detected homologs and interactions are also provided. Since RBH is a conservative method, homolog-grouping is performed to recover lost putative interactions. A database of the predicted interactions from all the 30 strains of cyanobacteria is constructed.\\n\\nConclusionRegcyanoDB contains 20,280 interactions with confidence levels for 30 cyanobacterial strains. The predicted regulatory interactions exhibit a scale free network topology as observed in model organisms. The interacting genes in E. coli and cyanobacteria are mostly found to have the same gene annotation. This database can be used for posing novel hypotheses and validation studies in wet-lab and computational domains.\\n\\nThe database is available at http://www.che.iitb.ac.in/grn/RegCyanoDB/",

    "abstract": "Large lake ecosystems support a variety of ecosystem services in surrounding communities, including recreational and commercial fishing. However, many northern temperate fisheries are contaminated by mercury. Annual variation in mercury accumulation in fish has previously been linked to water level (WL) fluctuations, opening the possibility of regulating water levels in a manner that minimizes or reduces mercury contamination in fisheries. Here, we compiled a long-term dataset (1997-2015) of mercury content in young-of-year Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) from six lakes on the border between the U.S. and Canada and examined whether mercury content appeared to be related to several metrics of WL fluctuation (e.g., spring WL rise, annual maximum WL, and year-to-year change in maximum WL). Using simple correlation analysis, several WL metrics appear to be strongly correlated to Yellow Perch mercury content, although the strength of these correlations varies by lake. We also used many WL metrics, water quality measurements, temperature and annual deposition data to build predictive models using partial least squared regression (PLSR) analysis for each lake. These PLSR models showed some variation among lakes, but also supported strong associations between WL fluctuations and annual variation in Yellow Perch mercury content. The study lakes underwent a modest change in WL management in 2000, when winter WL minimums were increased by about 1 m in five of the six study lakes. Using the PLSR models, we estimated how this change in WL management would have affected Yellow Perch mercury content. For four of the study lakes, the change in WL management that occurred in 2000 likely reduced Yellow Perch mercury content, relative to the previous WL management regime.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian X and Y chromosomes evolved from an ordinary autosomal pair. Genetic decay of the Y led to X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females, but some Y-linked genes were retained during the course of sex chromosome evolution, and many X-linked genes did not become subject to XCI. We reconstructed gene-by-gene dosage sensitivities on the ancestral autosomes through phylogenetic analysis of microRNA (miRNA) target sites and compared these preexisting characteristics to the current status of Y-linked and X-linked genes in mammals. Preexisting heterogeneities in dosage sensitivity, manifesting as differences in the extent of miRNA-mediated repression, predicted either the retention of a Y homolog or the acquisition of XCI following Y gene decay. Analogous heterogeneities among avian Z-linked genes predicted either the retention of a W homolog or gene-specific dosage compensation following W gene decay. Genome-wide analyses of human copy number variation indicate that these heterogeneities consisted of sensitivity to both increases and decreases in dosage. We propose a model of XY/ZW evolution incorporating such preexisting dosage sensitivities in determining the evolutionary fates of individual genes. Our findings thus provide a more complete view of the role of dosage sensitivity in shaping the mammalian and avian sex chromosomes, and reveal an important role for post-transcriptional regulatory sequences (miRNA target sites) in sex chromosome evolution.",

We further introduce a simple but highly effective pipeline to greatly improve the reproducibility of functional annotation. Using five categories of independent experimental results, we extensively compared the annotation produced by IDEAS and the Roadmap Epigenomics consortium. While the overall concordance between the two maps was high, we observed many differences in the details and in the position-wise consistency of annotation across cell types. We show that the IDEAS annotation was uniformly and often substantially more accurate than the Roadmap Epigenomics result. This study therefore reports on the quality of an existing functional map in 127 human genomes and provides an alternative and better map to be used by the community. The annotation result can be visualized in the UCSC genome browser via the hub at http://bx.psu.edu/~yuzhang/Roadmap_ideas/ideas_hub.txt",

To support high levels of transcription, repetitive arrays of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) are necessary and the long-standing hypothesis is that they undergo sequence homogenization towards rDNA uniformity.\\n\\nHere I present evidence of the rich genetic diversity in human rDNA, both within and between individuals. Using state-of-the-art genome sequencing data revealed an average of 192.7 intra-individual variants, including some deeply penetrating the rDNA copies, such as the bi-allelically expressed 28S.59A>G. From 104 diverse genomes, 947 high-confidence variants were identified and unmask a hidden genetic diversity of humans.\\n\\nThese findings support the emerging concept that ribosomes are heterogeneous within cells and extends the heterogeneity into the realm of population genetics. Fundamentally, do our ribosomal variants determine how our cells interpret the genome?",

    "abstract": "AbstractCurrent T-cell epitope prediction tools are a valuable resource in designing targeted immunogenicity experiments. They typically focus on, and are able to, accurately predict peptide binding and presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. However, recognition of the peptide-MHC complex by a T-cell receptor is often not included in these tools. We developed a classification approach based on random forest classifiers to predict recognition of a peptide by a T-cell and discover patterns that contribute to recognition. We considered two approaches to solve this problem: (1) distinguishing between two sets of T-cell receptors that each bind to a known peptide and (2) retrieving T-cell receptors that bind to a given peptide from a large pool of T-cell receptors. Evaluation of the models on two HIV-1, B*08-restricted epitopes reveals good performance and hints towards structural CDR3 features that can determine peptide immunogenicity. These results are of particularly importance as they show that prediction of T-cell epitope and T-cell epitope recognition based on sequence data is a feasible approach. In addition, the validity of our models not only serves as a proof of concept for the prediction of immunogenic T-cell epitopes but also paves the way for more general and high performing models.",

    "abstract": "Immature neural circuits undergo synaptic refinement, in which activity-dependent competition between synapses results in pruning of inappropriate connections and maintenance of appropriate ones. A longstanding question is how neuronal activity eliminates specific synapses based on their strength. The technical challenges of in vivo studies have made it difficult to identify a molecular link between decreased activity and synapse elimination. We developed an organotypic coculture model of the mouse retinogeniculate system that facilitates real-time imaging and elucidation of molecular mechanisms underlying the removal of less active synapses during synaptic competition. Using this model we show for the first time that complement component C1q is necessary for activity-dependent synaptic competition and preferentially localizes to less active, competing presynaptic inputs. In conjunction with classic in vivo and ex vivo models, this coculture model is a new tool to reveal molecular pathways underlying CNS circuit refinement.",

In the photosynthetic organisms, the light-driven formation of the WOC from dissolved metal ions is a key process because it is essential in both initial activation and continuous repair of PSII. Structural information is required for understanding of this chaperone-free metal-cluster assembly. For the first time, we obtained a structure of PSII from Thermosynechococcus elongatus without the Mn4CaO5-cluster. Surprisingly, cluster-removal leaves the positions of all coordinating amino acid residues and most nearby water molecules largely unaffected, resulting in a pre-organized ligand shell for kinetically competent and error-free photo-assembly of the Mn4CaO5-cluster. First experiments initiating (i) partial disassembly and (ii) partial re-assembly after complete depletion of the Mn4CaO5-cluster agree with a specific bi-manganese cluster, likely a di--oxo bridged pair of Mn(III) ions, as an assembly intermediate.",

Here, using auxin-inducible degron techniques to acutely deplete CTCF in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that cell growth is severely slowed yet chromatin organization remains largely intact after loss of CTCF. Depletion of CTCF reduces interactions between chromatin loop anchors, diminishes occupancy of cohesin complex genome-wide, and slightly weakens topologically associating domain (TAD) structure, but the active and inactive chromatin compartments are maintained and the vast majority of TAD boundaries persist. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation and histone marks associated with enhancers are broadly unchanged upon CTCF depletion. Our results suggest CTCF-independent mechanisms in maintenance of chromatin organization.",

Defining the downstream regulatory mechanisms influenced by cytokines is central to defining drug and disease mechanisms. One promising strategy is to use interactions between expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cytokine levels to define target genes and mechanisms.\\n\\nResultsIn a clinical trial for anti-IL-6 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus we measured interferon (IFN) status, anti-IL-6 drug exposure and genome-wide gene expression at three time points (379 samples from 157 individuals). First, we show that repeat transcriptomic measurements increases the number of cis eQTLs identified compared to using a single time point by 64%. Then, after identifying 4,818 cis-eQTLs, we observed a statistically significant enrichment of in vivo eQTL interactions with IFN status (p<0.001 by permutation) and anti-IL-6 drug exposure (p<0.001). We observed 210 and 72 interactions for IFN and anti-IL-6 respectively (FDR<20%). Anti-IL-6 interactions have not yet been described while 99 of the IFN interactions are novel. Finally, we found transcription factor binding motifs interrupted by eQTL interaction SNPs, pointing to key regulatory mediators of these environmental stimuli and therefore potential therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases. In particular, genes with IFN interactions are enriched for ISRE binding site motifs, while those with anti-IL-6 interactions are enriched for IRF4 motifs.\\n\\nConclusionThis study highlights the potential to exploit clinical trial data to discover in vivo eQTL interactions with therapeutically relevant environmental variables.",

Initial results suggest multiple, gene-specific mechanisms and the involvement of a wide range of cellular machineries. In this Commentary, we review recent findings from candidate approaches and unbiased screening methods that provide initial insight into the cellular mechanisms of positioning and their functional consequences.

Multiplexing samples for single cell capture and library preparation in dscRNA-seq would enable cost-effective designs of differential expression and genetic studies while avoiding technical batch effects, but its implementation remains challenging. Here, we introduce an in-silico algorithm demuxlet that harnesses natural genetic variation to discover the sample identity of each cell and identify droplets containing two cells. These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments where cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than standard workflows. To demonstrate the performance of demuxlet, we sequenced 3 pools of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 8 lupus patients. Given genotyping data for each individual, demuxlet correctly recovered the sample identity of > 99% of singlets, and identified doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. In PBMCs, we demonstrate the utility of multiplexed dscRNA-seq in two applications: characterizing cell type specificity and inter-individual variability of cytokine response from 8 lupus patients and mapping genetic variants associated with cell type specific gene expression from 23 donors. Demuxlet is fast, accurate, scalable and could be extended to other single cell datasets that incorporate natural or synthetic DNA barcodes.",

However, relatively few analyses are able to validate these inferences with independent data. Here, we leverage written records that describe distinct Brassica rapa crops to corroborate demographic models of domestication. Brassica rapa crops are renowned for their outstanding morphological diversity, but the relationships and order of domestication remains unclear. We generated genome-wide SNPs from 126 accessions collected globally using high-throughput transcriptome data. Analyses of more than 31,000 SNPs across the B. rapa genome revealed evidence for five distinct genetic groups and supported a European-Central Asian origin of B. rapa crops. Our results supported the traditionally recognized South Asian and East Asian B. rapa groups with evidence that pak choi, Chinese cabbage, and yellow sarson are likely monophyletic groups. In contrast, the oil-type B. rapa subsp. oleifera and brown sarson were polyphyletic. We also found no evidence to support the contention that rapini is the wild type or the earliest domesticated subspecies of B. rapa. Demographic analyses suggested that B. rapa was introduced to Asia 2400-4100 years ago, and that Chinese cabbage originated 1200-2100 years ago via admixture of pak choi and European-Central Asian B. rapa. We also inferred significantly different levels of founder effect among the B. rapa subspecies. Written records from antiquity that document these crops are consistent with these inferences. The concordance between our age estimates of domestication events with historical records provides unique support for our demographic inferences.",

This enables investigation of minute vertical stresses (<1 Pa) involved in podosome protrusion, protein specific cell-substrate interaction and amoeboid migration through spatial confinement in real time.
