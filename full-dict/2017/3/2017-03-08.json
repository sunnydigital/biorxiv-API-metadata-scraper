    "abstract": "Several diseases related to cell proliferation are characterized by the accumulation of somatic DNA changes, with respect to wildtype conditions. Cancer and HIV are two common examples of such diseases, where the mutational load in the cancerous/viral population increases over time. In these cases, selective pres sures are often observed along with competition, co-operation and parasitism among distinct cellular clones. Recently, we presented a mathematical framework to model these phenomena, based on a combination of Bayesian inference and Suppes theory of probabilistic causation, depicted in graphical structures dubbed Suppes-Bayes Causal Networks (SBCNs). SBCNs are generative probabilistic graphical models that recapitulate the potential ordering of accumulation of such DNA changes during the progression of the disease. Such models can be inferred from data by exploiting likelihood-based model-selection strategies with regularization. In this paper we discuss the theoretical foun dations of our approach and we investigate in depth the influence on the model-selection task of: (i) the poset based on Suppes theory and (ii) different regulariza tion strategies. Furthermore, we provide an example of application of our framework to HIV genetic data highlighting the valuable insights provided by the inferred SBCN.",

Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is used to identify sleep types across the lifespan. Bayesian regressions quantify the presence, and absence, of relationships between sleep quality and health measures.\\n\\nResultsBetter sleep is generally associated with better health outcomes, strongly so for mental health, moderately for cognitive and physical health, but not for sleep quality and neural health. Latent Class Analysis identified four sleep types:  Good sleepers (68.6%, most frequent in middle age),  inefficient sleepers (13.05%, most frequent in old age),  Delayed sleepers (9.76%, most frequent in young adults) and  poor sleepers (8.6%, most frequent in old age). There is little evidence for interactions between sleep quality and age on health outcomes. Finally, we observe u-shaped associations between sleep duration and mental health (depression and anxiety) as well as self-reported general health, such that both short and long sleep were associated with poorer outcomes.\\n\\nConclusionsLifespan changes in sleep quality are multifaceted and not captured well by summary measures, but instead as partially independent symptoms that vary in prevalence across the lifespan.

    "abstract": "Our work addresses two key challenges, one biological and one methodological. First, we aim to understand how proliferation and cellular migration rates in the intestinal epithelium are related under healthy, damaged (Ara-C treated) and recovering conditions, and how these relations can be used to identify mechanisms of repair and regeneration. We analyse new data, presented in more detail in a companion paper, in which BrdU/IdU cell-labelling experiments were performed under these respective conditions. Second, in considering how to more rigorously process these data and interpret them using mathematical models, we develop a probabilistic, hierarchical framework. This framework provides a best-practice approach for systematically modelling and understanding the uncertainties that can otherwise undermine drawing reliable conclusions - uncertainties in experimental measurement and treatment, difficult-to-compare mathematical models of underlying mechanisms, and unknown or unobserved parameters. Both discrete and continuous mechanistic models are considered and related via hierarchical conditional probability assumptions. This allows the incorporation of features of both continuum tissue models and discrete cellular models. We perform model checks on both in-sample and out-of-sample datasets and use these checks to illustrate how to test possible model improvements and assess the robustness of our conclusions. This allows us to consider - and ultimately decide against - the need to retain finite-cell-size effects to explain a small misfit appearing in one set of long-time, out-of-sample predictions. Our approach leads us to conclude, for the present set of experiments, that a primarily proliferation-driven model is adequate for predictions over most time-scales. We describe each stage of our framework in detail, and hope that the present work may also serve as a guide for other applications of the hierarchical approach to problems in computational and systems biology more generally.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe intestinal epithelium serves as an important model system for studying the dynamics and regulation of multicellular populations. It is characterised by rapid rates of self-renewal and repair; failure of the regulation of these processes is thought to explain, in part, why many tumours occur in the intestinal and similar epithelial tissues. These features have led to a large amount of work on estimating rate parameters in the intestine. There still remain, however, large gaps between the raw data collected, the experimental interpretation of these data, and speculative mechanistic models for underlying processes. In our view hierarchical statistical modelling provides an ideal, but currently underutilised, method to begin to bridge these gaps. This approach makes essential use of the distinction between  measurement,  process and  parameter models, giving an explicit framework for combining experimental data and mechanistic modelling in the presence of multiple sources of uncertainty. As we illustrate, the hierarchical approach also provides a suitable framework for addressing other methodological questions of broader interest in systems biology: how to systematically relate discrete and continuous mechanistic models; how to formally interpret and visualise statistical evidence; and how to express causal assumptions in terms of conditional independence.",

    "abstract": "Trial-and-error learning requires evaluating variable actions and reinforcing successful variants. In songbirds, vocal exploration is induced by LMAN, the output of a basal ganglia-circuit that also contributes a corrective bias to the vocal output. This bias is gradually consolidated in RA, a motor cortex analogue downstream of LMAN. We develop a new model of such two-stage learning. Using stochastic gradient descent, we derive how the activity in  tutor circuits (e.g., LMAN) should match plasticity mechanisms in  student circuits (e.g., RA) to achieve efficient learning. We further describe a reinforcement learning framework through which the tutor can build its teaching signal. We show that mismatches between the tutor signal and the plasticity mechanism can impair learning. Applied to birdsong, our results predict the temporal structure of the corrective bias from LMAN given a plasticity rule in RA. Our framework can be applied predictively to other paired brain areas showing two-stage learning.",

Here, we combine field observations with long-term data concerning natural hybridizations, climate, land-use, and field-validated species distribution models for two deeply divergent and naturally sympatric toad species in Europe (Bufo bufo and Bufotes viridis species groups). We show that climate warming and seasonal extreme temperatures are conspiring to set the scene for these maladaptive hybridisations, by differentially affecting life-history traits of both species. Our results identify and provide evidence of an ultimate cause for such events, and reveal that the potential influence of climate change on interspecific hybridisations goes far beyond closely related species. Furthermore, climate projections suggest that the chances for these events will steadily increase in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation is a ubiquitous mechanism by which organisms respond to their environment. While organisms are often found to be adapted to the environments they experience, the role of gene regulation in environmental adaptation is not often known. In this study, we examine divergence in cis-regulatory effects between two Saccharomyces species, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum, that have substantially diverged in their thermal growth profile. We measured allele specific expression (ASE) in the species hybrid at three temperatures, the highest of which is lethal to S. uvarum but not the hybrid or S. cerevisiae. We find that S. uvarum alleles can be expressed at the same level as S. cerevisiae alleles at high temperature and most cis-acting differences in gene expression are not dependent on temperature. While a small set of 136 genes show temperature-dependent ASE, we find no indication that signatures of directional cis-regulatory evolution are associated with temperature. Within promoter regions we find binding sites enriched upstream of temperature responsive genes, but only weak correlations between binding site and expression divergence. Our results indicate that temperature divergence between S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum has not caused widespread divergence in cis-regulatory activity, but point to a small subset of genes where the species alleles show differences in magnitude or opposite responses to temperature. The difficulty of explaining divergence in cis-regulatory sequences with models of transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome positioning highlights the importance of identifying mutations that underlie cis-regulatory divergence between species.",

Although non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that include microRNA (miRNA) regulates gene expression inside the cell where they are transcribed, extracellular miRNA has been recently discovered outside the cells, proposing that miRNA might be released to participate in cell-to-cell communication. Despite its importance of extracellular miRNA, the molecular mechanisms by which miRNA can be stored in vesicles and released by vesicle fusion remain enigmatic. Using next-generation sequencing, vesicle purification techniques, and synthetic neurotransmission, we observe that large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) contain a variety of miRNAs including miR-375.

    "abstract": "A thermodynamic method for computing the stability and dynamics of chromatin loops is proposed. The CTCF-mediated interactions as observed in ChIA-PET experiments for human B-lymphoblastoid cells are evaluated in terms of a polymer model for chain folding physical properties and the experimentally observed frequency of contacts within the chromatin regions. To estimate the optimal free energy and a Boltzmann distribution of suboptimal structures, the approach uses dynamic programming with methods to handle degeneracy and heuristics to compute parallel and antiparallel chain stems and pseudoknots. Moreover, multiple loops mediated by CTCF proteins connected together and forming multimeric islands are simulated using the same model. Based on the thermodynamic properties of those topological three-dimensional structures, we predict the correlation between the relative activity of chromatin loop and the Boltzmann probability, or the minimum free energy, depending also on its genomic length. Segments of chromatin where the structures show a more stable minimum free energy (for a given genomic distance) tend to be inactive, whereas structures that have lower stability in the minimum free energy (with the same genomic distance) tend to be active.",

Here, we describe an image-based quantitative screen of the single-gene knockout collection of Escherichia coli, and identify many new genes involved in cell morphogenesis, population growth, nucleoid (bulk chromosome) dynamics and cell division. Functional analyses, together with high-dimensional classification, unveil new associations of morphological and cell cycle phenotypes with specific functions and pathways. Additionally, correlation analysis across ~4,000 genetic perturbations shows that growth rate is surprisingly not predictive of cell size. Growth rate was also uncorrelated with the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell constriction. Rather, our analysis identifies scaling relationships between cell size and nucleoid size and between nucleoid size and the relative timings of nucleoid separation and cell division. These connections suggest that the nucleoid links cell morphogenesis to the cell cycle.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/101832_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (43K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@63d469org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7117org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22a436org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b0167_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict microbial community dynamics lags behind the quantity of data available in these systems. Most predictive models use only environmental parameters, although a long history of ecological literature suggests that community complexity should also be an informative parameter. Thus, we hypothesize that incorporating information about a communitys complexity might improve predictive power in microbial models. Here, we present a new metric, called community \\\"cohesion,\\\" that quantifies the degree of connectivity of a microbial community. We validate our approach using long-term (10+ year) phytoplankton datasets, where absolute abundance counts are available. As a case study of our metrics utility, we show that community cohesion is a strong predictor of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (R2 = 0.47) between phytoplankton communities in Lake Mendota, WI, USA. Our cohesion metrics outperform a model built using all available environmental data collected during a long-term sampling program. The result that cohesion corresponds strongly to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is consistent across the five lakes analyzed here. Our cohesion metrics can be used as a predictor for many community-level properties, such as phylogenetic diversity, nutrient fluxes, or ecosystem services. We explain here the calculation of our cohesion metrics and their potential uses in microbial ecology.\\n\\nConflict of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosis and symptom severity in schizophrenia are associated with irregularities across neural oscillatory frequency bands, including theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. However, electroencephalographic signals consist of both periodic and aperiodic activity characterized by the (1/fX) shape in the power spectrum. In this paper we investigated oscillatory and aperiodic activity differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls during a target detection task. Separation into periodic and aperiodic components revealed that the steepness of the power spectrum better predicted group status than traditional band-limited oscillatory power in a classification analysis. Aperiodic activity also outperformed the predictions made using participants behavioral responses. Additionally, the differences in aperiodic activity were highly consistent across all electrodes. In sum, compared to oscillations the aperiodic activity appears to be a more accurate and more robust way to differentiate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding the neurobiological origins of schizophrenia and identifying reliable and consistent biomarkers are of critical importance to improving treatment of that disease. Numerous studies have reported disruptions to neural oscillations in patients with schizophrenia. This has, in part, led to schizophrenia being characterized as a disease of disrupted neural coordination, reflected by changes in frequency band power. We report however that changes in the aperiodic signal can also predict clinical status. Unlike band-limited power though, aperiodic activity predicts status better than participants own behavioral performance and acts as a consistent predictor across all electrodes. Alterations in the aperiodic signal are consistent with well-established inhibitory neuron dysfunctions associated with schizophrenia, allowing for a direct link between noninvasive EEG and chronic, widespread, neurobiological deficits.",

Despite existing well characterized frameworks for practice-based training in K-12 teacher education, the major principles of these frameworks have not yet been transferred to instructor development in higher educational contexts, including training of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs). We sought to determine whether a practice-based training program could help GTAs learn and use evidence-based teaching methods in their classrooms. We implemented a weekly training program for introductory biology GTAs, which included structured drills of techniques selected to enhance student practice, logic-development, and accountability and reduce apprehension. GTAs received regular performance feedback based on classroom observations. To quantify use of target techniques and levels of student participation, we collected and coded 160 hours of video footage. We found that, although GTAs adopted and utilized many of the target techniques with high frequency, techniques which enforced student participation were not stably adopted and their use was unresponsive to formal feedback. We also found that techniques discussed in training, but not practiced, were not used at quantifiable frequencies, further supporting the importance of practice-based training for influencing instructional practices.",

    "abstract": "1.Combining endurance training with resistance training (RT) may attenuate skeletal muscle hypertrophic adaptation versus RT alone; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We investigated changes in markers of ribosome biogenesis, a process linked with skeletal muscle hypertrophy, following concurrent training versus RT alone. Twenty-three males underwent eight weeks of RT, either performed alone (RT group, n = 8), or combined with either high-intensity interval training (HIT+RT group, n = 8), or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT+RT group, n = 7). Muscle samples (vastus lateralis) were obtained before training, and immediately before, 1 h and 3 h after the final training session. Training-induced changes in basal expression of the 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor (45S pre-rRNA), and 5.8S and 28S mature rRNAs, were greater with concurrent training versus RT. However, during the final training session, RT further increased both mTORC1 (p70S6K1 and rps6 phosphorylation) and 45S pre-rRNA transcription-related signalling (TIF-1A and UBF phosphorylation) versus concurrent training. These data suggest that when performed in a training-accustomed state, RT induces further increases mTORC1 and ribosome biogenesis related signalling in human skeletal muscle versus concurrent training; however, changes in ribosome biogenesis markers were more favourable following a period of short-term concurrent training versus RT performed alone.",

Adaptive evolution is constrained by these trade-offs, but their consequences for the repeatability and predictability of evolution are unclear. Here we develop an eco-evolutionary model with a metabolic trade-off to generate networks of mutational paths in microbial communities and show that these networks have descriptive and predictive information about the evolving communities. We find that long-term outcomes, including community collapse, diversity, and cycling, have characteristic evolutionary dynamics that determine the entropy, or repeatability, of mutational paths. Although reliable prediction of evolutionary outcomes from environmental conditions is difficult, graph-theoretic properties of the mutational networks enable accurate prediction even from incomplete observations. In conclusion, we present a novel methodology for analyzing adaptive evolution and report that the dynamics of adaptation are a key variable for predictive success.",

The O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), targets specific Serines and Threonines (S/T) in intracellular proteins. However, unlike phosphorylation, fewer than 25% of known O-GlcNAc sites match a clear sequence pattern. Accordingly, the three dimensional structures of O-GlcNAc sites were characterised to investigate the role of structure in molecular recognition. Of the 143/1,584 O-GlcNAc sites in 620 proteins were mapped to protein X-ray structures. The modified S/T were 1.7x more likely to be annotated in the REM465 field which defines missing residues in a protein structure, while 7 O-GlcNAc sites were solvent inaccessible and unlikely to be targeted by OGT. The 132/143 sites with complete backbone atoms clustered into 10 groups, but these were indistinguishable from clusters from unmodified S/T. This suggests there is no prevalent three-dimensional motif for OGT recognition. Predicted features from the 620 proteins were compared to unmodified S/T in O-GlcNAcylated proteins and globular proteins. The Jpred4 predicted secondary structure shows that modified S/T were more likely to be coils. 5/6 methods to predict intrinsic disorder indicated O-GlcNAcylated S/T to be significantly more disordered than unmodified S/T. Although the analysis did not find a pattern in the site three-dimensional structure, it revealed the residues around the modification site are likely to be disordered and suggests a potential role of secondary structure elements in OGT site recognition.",

While cell orientation and proliferation are known to shape the joint, dynamic imaging of developing joints in vivo have not been possible in other species. Using genetic labelling techniques in zebrafish we were able, for the first time, to dynamically track cell behaviours in intact moving joints. We identify that proliferation and migration, which contribute to joint morphogenesis, are mechanically controlled and are significantly reduced in immobilised larvae. By comparison to strain maps of the developing skeleton we identify canonical Wnt signalling as a candidate to transduce mechanical forces into joint cell behaviours. We show that in the jaw Wnt signalling is reduced specifically in regions of high strain in response to loss of muscle activity. By pharmacological manipulation of canonical Wnt signalling we demonstrate that Wnt acts downstream of mechanical activity and is required for joint patterning and chondrocyte maturation. Wntl6, independent of muscle activity, controls proliferation and migration, but plays no role in chondrocyte intercalation.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPhylogenetic comparative methods have been used to model trait evolution, to test selection versus neutral hypotheses, to estimate optimal trait-values, and to quantify the rate of adaptation towards these optima. Several authors have proposed algorithms calculating the likelihood for trait evolution models, such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, in time proportional to the number of tips in the tree. Combined with gradient-based optimization, these algorithms enable maximum likelihood (ML) inference within seconds, even for trees exceeding 10,000 tips. Despite its useful statistical properties, ML has been criticised for being a point estimator prone to getting stuck in local optima. As an elegant alternative, Bayesian inference explores the entire information in the data and compares it to prior knowledge but, usually, runs in much longer time, even for small trees. Here, we propose an approach to use the full potential of ML and Bayesian inference, while keeping the runtime within minutes. Our approach combines (i) a new algorithm for parallel likelihood calculation; (ii) a previously published method for adaptive Metropolis sampling. In principle, the strategy of (i) and (ii) can be applied to any likelihood calculation on a tree which proceeds in a pruning-like fashion leading to enormous speed improvements. As a showcase, we implement the phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mixed model (POUMM) in the form of an easy-to-use and highly configurable R-package. In addition to the above-mentioned usage of comparative methods, the POUMM allows to estimate non-heritable variance and phylogenetic heritability. Using simulations and empirical data from 487 mammal species, we show that the POUMM is far more reliable in terms of unbiased estimates and false positive rate for stabilizing selection, compared to its alternative - the non-mixed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, which assumes a fully heritable and perfectly measurable trait. Further, our analysis reveals that the phylogenetic mixed model (PMM), which assumes neutral evolution (Brownian motion) can be a very unstable estimator of phylogenetic heritability, even if the Brownian motion assumption is only weakly violated. Our results prove the need for a simultaneous account for selection and non-heritable variance in phylogenetic evolutionary models and challenge stabilizing selection hypotheses stated in numerous macro-evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic chromatin is partitioned into domains called TADs that are broadly conserved between species and virtually identical among cell types within the same species. Previous studies in mammals have shown that the DNA binding protein CTCF and cohesin contribute to a fraction of TAD boundaries. Apart from this, the molecular mechanisms governing this partitioning remain poorly understood. Using our new software, HiCExplorer, we annotated high-resolution (570 bp) TAD boundaries in flies and identified eight DNA motifs enriched at boundaries. Known insulator proteins bind five of these motifs while the remaining three motifs are novel. We find that boundaries are either at core promoters of active genes or at non-promoter regions of inactive chromatin and that these two groups are characterized by different sets of DNA motifs. Most boundaries are present at divergent promoters of constitutively expressed genes and the gene expression tends to be coordinated within TADs. In contrast to mammals, the CTCF motif is only present on 2% of boundaries in flies. We demonstrate that boundaries can be accurately predicted using only the motif sequences, along with open chromatin, suggesting that DNA sequence encodes the 3D genome architecture in flies. Finally, we present an interactive online database to access and explore the spatial organization of fly, mouse and human genomes, available at http://chorogeome.ie-freiburg.mpg.de.",

    "abstract": "Rapid diversification often involves complex histories of gene flow that leave variable and conflicting signatures of evolutionary relatedness across the genome. Identifying the extent and source of variation in these evolutionary relationships can provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms involved in rapid radiations. Here we compare the discordant evolutionary relationships associated with species phenotypes across 42 whole genomes from a sympatric adaptive radiation of Cyprinodon pupfishes endemic to San Salvador Island, Bahamas and several outgroup pupfish species in order to understand the rarity of these trophic specialists within the larger radiation of Cyprinodon. 82% of the genome depicts close evolutionary relationships among the San Salvador Island species reflecting their geographic proximity, but the vast majority of the fixed variants between the specialist species lie in regions with discordant topologies. These regions include signatures of selective sweeps and adaptive introgression from neighboring islands into each of the specialist species. Hard selective sweeps of genetic variation on San Salvador contributed 10-fold more to divergence between specialist species within the radiation than adaptive introgression of Caribbean genetic variation; however, some of these introgressed regions from distant islands were associated with the primary axis of oral jaw divergence within the radiation. For example, standing variation in a proto-oncogene (ski) known to have effects on jaw size introgressed into one San Salvador specialist from an island 300 km away. The complex emerging picture of the origins of adaptive radiation on San Salvador indicates that multiple sources of genetic variation contributed to the adaptive phenotypes of novel trophic specialists on the island. Our findings suggest that a suite of factors, including rare adaptive introgression, may also be required to trigger adaptive radiation in the presence of ecological opportunity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGroups of closely related species can rapidly evolve to occupy diverse ecological roles, but the ecological and genetic conditions that trigger this diversification are still highly debated. We examine patterns of molecular evolution across the genomes of a rapid radiation of pupfishes that includes two trophic specialists. Despite apparently widespread ecological opportunities and gene flow across the Caribbean, this radiation is endemic to a single Bahamian Island. Using the whole genomes of 42 pupfish we find evidence of extensive and previously unexpected variation in evolutionary relatedness among Caribbean pupfish. Two sources of genetic variation have contributed to the adaptive diversification of complex phenotypes in this system: selective sweeps of genetic variation from across the Caribbean that was brought into San Salvador through hybridization and genetic variation found on San Salvador. While genetic variation from San Salvador appears to be relatively more common in the divergence observed among specialists, hybridization probably played an important role in the evolution of the complex phenotypes as well. Our findings that multiple sources of genetic variation contribute to the San Salvador radiation suggest that a complex suite of factors, including hybridization with other species, may be required to trigger adaptive radiation in the presence of ecological opportunity.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying stability properties of ecosystems is an important problem in ecology. A common approach is based on the recovery from pulse perturbations, and posits that the faster ecosystems return to their pre-perturbation state, the more stable they are. In theoretical studies the recovery dynamics are often collapsed into a single quantity: the long-term rate of return, called asymptotic resilience. However, empirical studies typically measure the recovery dynamics at much shorter time scales. In this paper we explain why asymptotic resilience is rarely representative of the short-term recovery. First, we show that, in contrast to asymptotic resilience, short-term return rates depend on features of the perturbation, in particular on the way its intensity is distributed over species. We argue that empirically relevant predictions can be obtained by considering the median response over a set of perturbations, for which we provide explicit formulas. Next, we show that the recovery dynamics are controlled through time by different species: abundant species tend to govern the short-term recovery, while rare species often dominate the long-term recovery. This shift from abundant to rare species typically causes short-term return rates to be unrelated to asymptotic resilience. Finally, we discuss how these findings might help to better connect empirical observations and theoretical predictions.",

We tested this idea with selection experiments on burying beetles (Nicrophorus vespilloides), sub-social insects that exhibit biparental care. Populations responded to selection for larger adults only when parents cared for their offspring, and responded to selection for smaller adults only when we prevented parents from providing care. Comparative analyses revealed a similar pattern: evolutionary increases in species size within the genus Nicrophorus are associated with the obligate provision of care. Synthesising our results with previous studies, we suggest that cooperative social environments enhance the response to selection whereas conflict can prevent further directional selection.",

    "abstract": "Giardia is a highly prevalent, understudied protistan parasite causing significant diarrheal disease worldwide. Its life cycle consists of two stages: infectious cysts ingested from contaminated food or water sources, and motile trophozoites that colonize and attach to the gut epithelium, later encysting to form new cysts that are excreted into the environment. Current understanding of parasite physiology in the host is largely inferred from transcriptomic studies using Giardia grown axenically or in co-culture with mammalian cell lines. The dearth of information about the diversity of host-parasite interactions occurring within distinct regions of the gastrointestinal tract has been exacerbated by a lack of methods to directly and non-invasively interrogate disease progression and parasite physiology in live animal hosts. By visualizing Giardia infections in the mouse gastrointestinal tract using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of tagged parasites, we recently showed that parasites colonize the gut in high-density foci that may cause localized pathology to the epithelium. Encystation is also initiated in these foci throughout the entire course of infection, yet how the physiology of parasites within high-density foci in the host gut differs from that of cells in laboratory culture is unclear. Here we use BLI to precisely select parasite samples from high-density foci in the proximal intestine to interrogate in vivo Giardia gene expression in the host. Relative to axenic culture, we noted significantly higher expression (> 10-fold) of oxidative stress, membrane transporter, and metabolic and structural genes associated with encystation in the high-density foci. These differences in gene expression within parasite foci in the host may reflect physiological changes associated with high-density growth in localized regions of the gut. We also identified and verified six novel cyst-specific proteins, including new components of the cyst wall that were highly expressed in these foci. Our in vivo transcriptome data support an emerging view that parasites encyst early in localized regions in the gut, possibly as a consequence of nutrient limitation, and also impact local metabolism and physiology.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenomic datasets have been successfully used to address questions involving evolutionary relationships, patterns of genome structure, signatures of selection, and gene and genome duplications. However, despite the recent explosion in genomic and transcriptomic data, the utility of these data sources for efficient divergence-time inference remains unexamined. Phylogenomic datasets pose two distinct problems for divergence-time estimation: (i) the volume of data makes inference of the entire dataset intractable, and (ii) the extent of underlying topological and rate heterogeneity across genes makes model mis-specification a real concern. \\\"Gene shopping\\\", wherein a phylogenomic dataset is winnowed to a set of genes with desirable properties, represents an alternative approach that holds promise in alleviating these issues. We implemented an approach for phylogenomic datasets (available in SortaDate) that filters genes by three criteria: (i) clock-likeness, (ii) reasonable tree length (i.e., discernible information content), and (iii) least topological conflict with a focal species tree (presumed to have already been inferred). Such a winnowing procedure ensures that errors associated with model (both clock and topology) mis-specification are minimized, therefore reducing error in divergence-time estimation. We demonstrated the efficacy of this approach through simulation and applied it to published animal (Aves, Diplopoda, and Hymenoptera) and plant (carnivorous Caryophyllales, broad Caryophyllales, and Vitales) phylogenomic datasets. By quantifying rate heterogeneity across both genes and lineages we found that every empirical dataset examined included genes with clock-like, or nearly clock-like, behavior. Moreover, many datasets had genes that were clock-like, exhibited reasonable evolutionary rates, and were mostly compatible with the species tree. We identified overlap in age estimates when analyzing these filtered genes under strict clock and uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) models. However, this overlap was often due to imprecise estimates from the UCLN model. We find that \\\"gene shopping\\\" can be an efficient approach to divergence-time inference for phylogenomic datasets that may otherwise be characterized by extensive gene tree heterogeneity.",

To discover such mutations, we assembled the first reference quality genome of Drosophila melanogaster since its initial sequencing. By comparing this genome to the existing D. melanogaster assembly, we create a structural variant map of unprecedented resolution, revealing extensive genetic variation that has remained hidden until now. Many of these variants constitute strong candidates underlying phenotypic variation, including tandem duplications and a transposable element insertion that dramatically amplifies the expression of detoxification genes associated with nicotine resistance. The abundance of important genetic variation that still evades discovery highlights how crucial high quality references are to deciphering phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Allelic heterogeneity is a common phenomenon where a gene exhibit different phenotype depending on the nature of its genetic mutations. In the context of genes affecting malaria susceptibility, it allowed us to explore and understand the intricate host-parasite interactions during malaria infections. In this study, we described a gene encoding erythrocytic ankyrin-1 (Ank-1) which exhibits allelic-dependent heterogeneous phenotypes during malaria infections. We conducted an ENU mutagenesis screen on mice and identified two Ank-1 mutations, one resulted in an amino acid substitution (MRI95845), and the other a truncated Ank-1 protein (MRI96570). Both mutations caused hereditary spherocytosis-like phenotypes and confer differing protection against Plasmodium chabaudi infections. Upon further examination, the Ank-1(MRI96570) mutation was found to inhibit intra-erythrocytic parasite maturation, whereas Ank-1(MW95845) caused increased bystander erythrocyte clearance during infection. This is the first description of allelic heterogeneity in ankyrin-1 from the direct comparison between two Ank-1 mutations. Despite the lack of direct evidence from population studies, this data further supported the protective roles of ankyrin-1 mutations in conferring malaria protection. This study also emphasized the importance of such phenomenon to achieve a better understanding of host-parasite interactions, which could be the basis of future studies.",

    "abstract": "Histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me) is thought to participate in a host of co-transcriptional regulatory events. To study the function of this residue independent from the enzymes that modify it, we used a \\\"histone replacement\\\" system in Drosophila to generate a non-modifiable H3K36 lysine-to-arginine (H3K36R) mutant. We observed global dysregulation of mRNA levels in H3K36R animals that correlates with the incidence of H3K36me3. Similar to previous studies, we found that mutation of H3K36 also resulted in H4 hyperacetylation. However, neither cryptic transcription initiation, nor alternative pre-mRNA splicing, contributed to the observed changes in expression, in contrast with previously reported roles for H3K36me. Interestingly, knockdown of the RNA surveillance nuclease, Xrn1, and members of the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex, restored mRNA levels for a class of downregulated, H3K36me3-rich genes. We propose a posttranscriptional role for modification of replication-dependent H3K36 in the control of metazoan gene expression.\\n\\nImpact StatementPost-translational modification of histone H3K36 is neither required to suppress cryptic transcription initiation nor to include alternative exons in Drosophila; instead it promotes expression of active genes by stimulating polyadenylation.",

    "abstract": "Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill in this gap, we present a deep learning (DL) based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We build the DL based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients data using RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and methylation data from TCGA, which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P=7.13e-6) and good model fitness (C-index=0.68). More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19, EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n=230, C-index=0.75), NCI cohort (n=221, C-index=0.67), Chinese cohort (n=166, C-index=0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n=40, C-index=0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n=27, C-index=0.82). This is the first study to employ deep learning to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of HCC patients. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction.",

They report that a Bayesian implementation of the Mk model [2] was most accurate (but with low resolution), while a maximum likelihood (ML) implementation of the same model was least accurate. They conclude by strongly advocating that Bayesian implementations of the Mk model should be the default method of analysis for such data. While we appreciate the authors attempt to investigate the accuracy of alternative methods of analysis, their conclusion is based on an inappropriate comparison of the ML point estimate, which does not consider confidence, with the Bayesian consensus, which incorporates estimation credibility into the summary tree. Using simulation, we demonstrate that ML and Bayesian estimates are concordant when confidence and credibility are comparably reflected in summary trees, a result expected from statistical theory. We therefore disagree with the conclusions of PEA and consider their prescription of any default method to be poorly founded. Instead, we recommend caution and thoughtful consideration of the model or method being applied to a morphological dataset.",

    "abstract": "Smooth muscle cells and pericytes, together called mural cells, coordinate many distinct vascular functions. Smooth muscle cells are ring-shaped and cover arterioles with circumferential processes, whereas pericytes extend thin processes that run longitudinally along capillaries. In between these canonical mural cell types are cells with mixed phenotype of both smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Recent studies suggest that these transitional cells are critical for controlling blood flow to the capillary bed during health and disease, but there remains confusion on how to identify them and where they are located in the brain microvasculature. To address this issue, we measured the morphology, vascular territory, and -smooth muscle actin content of structurally diverse mural cells in adult mouse cortex. We first imaged intact 3-D vascular networks to establish the locations of major gradations in mural cell appearance as arterioles branched into capillaries. We then imaged individual mural cells occupying the regions within these gradations. This revealed two transitional cells that were often similar in appearance, but with sharply contrasting levels of -smooth muscle actin. Our findings highlight the diversity of mural cell morphologies in brain microvasculature, and provide guidance for identification and categorization of mural cell types.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are the functional molecules in organisms and are therefore excellent biomarker candidates for a diversity of diseases. Immunoassays and mass spectrometry (MS) are two major technologies being used in proteomics; however, they either lack specificity or sensitivity. An emerging trend is to combine immunoassays with MS (which we call \\\"affinity-MS\\\"). This is an important milestone in quantitative proteomics, making it possible to measure low-abundance proteins with high specificity. The targeted enrichment and the assignment of mass-to-charge ratios to different molecules provide two selection criteria, making affinity-MS highly specific. Picogram-per-milliliter limits of detection have been obtained for many proteins. Furthermore, multiplexing capacity of >150 proteins has been achieved. This article reviews different formats of affinity-enrichment methods, and demonstrates how they are interfaced with both electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS. The pros and cons of these techniques are compared, and future prospectives are discussed.",

To develop this method, we investigated the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling during anterior-posterior patterning of the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) from Arabidopsis Thaliana was fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and Drosophila {beta}-catenin to form an easy to visualize optogenetic switch. Blue light illumination caused oligomerization of the fusion protein and inhibited downstream Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo. Temporal inactivation of {beta}-catenin confirmed that Wnt signaling is required not only for Drosophila pattern formation, but also for maintenance later in development. We anticipate that this method will be easily extendable to other developmental signaling pathways and many other experimental systems.",

We previously demonstrated FGF2 induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) to RGC lineage, capable of retinal Ganglion Cell Layer (GCL) integration upon transplantation in mice. Here, we evaluated possible improvement of visual function by transplantation of ES cell derived neural progenitors in RGC depleted glaucoma mice models. ESC derived neural progenitors (ES-NP) were transplanted into NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) injected, RGC-ablated mouse models and a pre-clinical glaucoma mouse model (DBA/2J) having sustained higher intra ocular pressure (IOP). Visual acuity and functional integration was evaluated by behavioural experiments and immunohistochemistry, respectively. GFP-expressing ES-NPs transplanted in NMDA-injected RGC-depleted mice differentiated into RGC lineage and possibly integrating into GCL. An improvement in visual acuity was observed after two months of transplantation, when compared to the pre-transplantation values. Expression of c-Fos in the transplanted cells, upon light induction, further suggests functional integration into the host retinal circuitry. However, the transplanted cells did not send axonal projections into optic nerve. Transplantation experiments in DBA/2J mouse showed no significant improvement in visual functions, possibly due to both host and transplanted retinal cell death which could be due to an inherent high IOP. We showed that, transplantation of ES-NPs into the retina of RGC-ablated mouse models could survive, differentiate to RGC lineage, and possibly integrate into GCL to improve visual function. However, for the survival of transplanted cells in glaucoma, strategies to control the IOP are warranted.",

We studied the genome wide gene expression dynamics during eye-antennal disc development in D. melanogaster to identify new central regulators of the underlying gene regulatory network. Expression based gene clustering and transcription factor motif enrichment analyses revealed a central regulatory role of the transcription factor Hunchback (Hb). We confirmed that hb is expressed in two polyploid retinal subperineurial glia cells (carpet cells). Our functional analysis shows that Hb is necessary for carpet cell development and loss of Hb function results in abnormal glia cell migration and photoreceptor axon guidance patterns. Additionally, we show for the first time that the carpet cells are an integral part of the blood-brain barrier.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease, driven by aberrant activity in numerous signaling pathways in even individual malignant cells. Epigenetic changes are critical mediators of these functional changes that drive and maintain the malignant phenotype. Changes in DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, non-coding RNAs, post-translational modifications are all epigenetic drivers in cancer, independent of changes in the DNA sequence. These epigenetic alterations, once thought to be crucial only for the malignant phenotype maintenance, are now recognized as critical also for disrupting essential pathways that protect the cells from uncontrolled growth, longer survival and establishment in distant sites from the original tissue. In this review, we focus on DNA methylation and chromatin structure in cancer. While associated with cancer, the precise functional role of these alterations is an area of active research using emerging high-throughput approaches and bioinformatics analysis tools. Therefore, this review describes these high-throughput measurement technologies, public domain databases for high-throughput epigenetic data in tumors and model systems, and bioinformatics algorithms for their analysis. Advances in bioinformatics data integration techniques that combine these epigenetic data with genomics data are essential to infer the function of specific epigenetic alterations in cancer, and are therefore also a focus of this review. Future studies using these emerging technologies will elucidate how alterations in the cancer epigenome cooperate with genetic aberrations to cause tumorigenesis initiation and progression. This deeper understanding is essential to future studies that will precisely infer patients prognosis and select patients who will be responsive to emerging epigenetic therapies.",

    "abstract": "Native plasmids constitute a major category of extrachromosomal DNA elements responsible for harboring and transferring genes important in survival and fitness. A focused evaluation of plasmidomes can reveal unique adaptations required by microbial communities. We examined the plasmid DNA from two pristine wells at the Oak Ridge Field Research Center. Using a cultivation-free method that targets plasmid DNA, a total of 42,440 and 32,232 (including 67 and 548 complete circular units) scaffolds > 2 kb were obtained from the two wells. The taxonomic distribution of bacteria in the two wells showed greater similarity based on their plasmidome sequence, relative to 16S rRNA sequence comparison. This similarity is also evident in the plasmid encoded functional genes. Among functionally annotated genes, candidates providing resistance to copper, zinc, cadmium, arsenic, and mercury were particularly abundant and common to the plasmidome of both wells. The primary function encoded by the most abundant circularized plasmid, common to both wells, was mercury resistance, even though the current ground water does not contain detectable levels of mercury. This study reveals that the plasmidome can have a unique ecological role in maintaining the latent capacity of a microbiome enabling rapid adaptation to environmental stresses.",

    "abstract": "Bergmanns rule is a widely-accepted biogeographic rule stating that individuals within a species are smaller in warmer environments. While there are many single-species studies and integrative reviews documenting this pattern, a data-intensive approach has not been used yet to determine the generality of this pattern. We assessed the strength and direction of the intraspecific relationship between temperature and individual mass for 952 bird and mammal species. For eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10% of variation in mass, and for 79% of species the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmanns rule is not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.",
