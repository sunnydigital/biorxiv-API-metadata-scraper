    "abstract": "Local non-linearities in dendrites render neuronal output dependent on the spatial distribution of synapses. A neuron will activate differently depending on whether active synapses are spatially clustered or dispersed. While this sensitivity can in principle expand neuronal computational capacity, it has thus far been employed in very few learning paradigms. To make use of this sensitivity, groups of correlated neurons need to make contact with distinct dendrites, and this requires a mechanism to ensure the correct distribution of synapses contacting from distinct ensembles. To address this problem, we introduce the requirement that on a short time scale, a pre-synaptic neuron makes a constant number of synapses with the same strength on a post-synaptic neuron. We find that this property enables clusters to distribute correctly and guarantees their functionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a change in the input statistics can reshape the spatial distribution of synapses. Finally, we show under which conditions clusters do not distribute correctly, e.g. when cross-talk between dendrites is too strong. As well as providing insight into potential biological mechanisms of learning, this work paves the way for new learning algorithms for artificial neural networks that exploit the spatial distribution of synapses.",

    "abstract": "The response and effect trait framework, if supported empirically, would provide for powerful and general predictions about how biodiversity loss will lead to loss in ecosystem function. This framework proposes that species traits will explain how different species respond to disturbance (i.e. response traits) as well as their contribution to ecosystem function (i.e. effect traits). However, predictive response and effect traits remain elusive for most systems. Here, we present detailed data on crop pollination services provided by native, wild bees to explore the role of six commonly used species traits in determining how crop pollination is affected by increasing agricultural intensification. Analyses were conducted in parallel for three crop systems (watermelon, cranberry, and blueberry) located within the same geographical region (mid-Atlantic USA). Bee species traits did not strongly predict species response to agricultural intensification, and the few traits that were weakly predictive were not consistent across crops. Similarly, no trait predicted species overall functional contribution in any of the three crop systems, although body size was a good predictor of per capita efficiency in two systems. So far, most studies looking for response or effect traits in pollination systems have found weak and often contradicting links. Overall we were unable to make generalizable predictions regarding species responses to land-use change and its effect on the delivery of ecosystem services. Pollinator traits may be useful for understanding ecological processes in some systems, but thus far the promise of traits-based ecology has yet to be fulfilled for pollination ecology.",

    "abstract": "Identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes from RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies is among the most common analyses in genomics. However, RNAseq DE analysis presents several statistical and computational challenges, including over-dispersed read counts and, in some settings, sample non-independence. Previous count-based methods rely on simple hierarchical Poisson models (e.g., negative binomial) to model independent over-dispersion, but do not account for sample non-independence due to relatedness, population structure and/or hidden confounders. Here, we present a Poisson mixed model with two random effects terms that account for both independent over-dispersion and sample non-independence. We also develop a scalable sampling-based inference algorithm using a latent variable representation of the Poisson distribution. With simulations, we show that our method properly controls for type I error and is generally more powerful than other widely used approaches, except in small samples (n<15) with other unfavorable properties (e.g., small effect sizes). We also apply our method to three real data sets that contain related individuals, population stratification, or hidden confounders. Our results show that our method increases power in all three data compared to other approaches, though the power gain is smallest in the smallest sample (n=6).

    "abstract": "Efficient collective migration depends on a balance between contractility and cytoskeletal rearrangements, adhesion, and mechanical cell-cell communication, all controlled by GTPases of the RHO family. By comprehensive screening of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in human bronchial epithelial cell monolayers, we identified GEFs that are required for collective migration at large, such as SOS1 and {beta}-PIX, and RHOA GEFs that are implicated in intercellular communication. Downregulation of the latter GEFs differentially enhanced front-to-back propagation of guidance cues through the monolayer, and was mirrored by downregulation of RHOA expression and myosin-II activity. Phenotype-based clustering of knock-down behaviors identified RHOA-ARHGEF18 and ARHGEF3-ARHGEF28-ARHGEF11 clusters, indicating that the latter may signal through other RHO-family GTPases. Indeed, knock-down of RHOC produced an intermediate between the two phenotypes. We conclude that for effective collective migration the RHOA-GEFs-[-&gt;]ARHOA/C[-&gt;] actomyosin pathways must be optimally tuned to compromise between generation of motility forces and restriction of intercellular communication.",

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous mutations in human SMN1. Expression of a duplicate gene (SMN2) primarily results in skipping of exon 7 and production of an unstable protein isoform, SMN{Delta}7. Although SMN2 exon skipping is the principal contributor to SMA severity, mechanisms governing stability of SMN isoforms are poorly understood. We used a Drosophila model system and label-free proteomics to identify the SCFSlmb ubiquitin E3 ligase complex as a novel SMN binding partner. SCFSlmb interacts with a phospho-degron embedded within the human and fruitfly SMN YG-box oligomerization domains. Substitution of a conserved serine (S270A) interferes with SCFSlmb binding and stabilizes SMN{Delta}7. SMA-causing missense mutations that block multimerization of full-length SMN are also stabilized in the degron mutant background. Overexpression of SMN{Delta}7S270A, but not wild-type SMN{Delta}7, provides a protective effect in SMA model mice and human motor neuron cell culture systems. Our findings support a model wherein the degron is exposed when SMN is monomeric, and sequestered when SMN forms higher-order multimers.",

    "abstract": "A number of open questions in human evolutionary genetics would become tractable if we were able to directly measure evolutionary fitness. As a step towards this goal, we developed a method to examine whether individual genetic variants, or sets of genetic variants, currently influence viability. The approach consists in testing whether the frequency of an allele varies across ages, accounting for variation in ancestry. We applied it to the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging (GERA) cohort and to the parents of participants in the UK Biobank. Across the genome, we find only a few common variants with large effects on age-specific mortality: tagging the APOE {varepsilon}4 allele and near CHRNA3. These results suggest that when large, even late onset effects are kept at low frequency by purifying selection. Testing viability effects of sets of genetic variants that jointly influence one of 42 traits, we detect a number of strong signals. In participants of the UK Biobank study of British ancestry, we find that variants that delay puberty timing are enriched in longer-lived parents (P~6x10-6 for fathers and P~2x10-3 for mothers), consistent with epidemiological studies. Similarly, in mothers, variants associated with later age at first birth are associated with a longer lifespan (P~1x10-3). Signals are also observed for variants influencing cholesterol levels, risk of coronary artery disease, body mass index, as well as risk of asthma. These signals exhibit consistent effects in the GERA cohort and among participants of the UK Biobank of non-British ancestry. Moreover, we see marked differences between males and females, most notably at the CHRNA3 locus, and variants associated with risk of coronary artery disease and cholesterol levels. Beyond our findings, the analysis serves as a proof of principle for how upcoming biomedical datasets can be used to learn about selection effects in contemporary humans.",

In two different, concurrent listening tasks, participants (n = 7) were fitted with individualized in-Ear-EEG pieces and were either asked to attend to one of two dichotically-presented, concurrent tone streams or to one of two diotically-presented, concurrent audiobooks. A forward encoding model was trained to predict the EEG response at single EEG channels. We found that all individual participants attentional focus could be predicted from single-channel EEG response recorded from short-distance configurations consisting only of a single in-Ear-EEG electrode and an adjacent scalp-EEG electrode. The responses to attended and ignored stimuli reveal differences consistent across subjects. In sum, our findings show that the EEG response from a single-channel, hearing-aid-compatible configuration provides valuable information to identify a listeners focus of attention.",

    "abstract": "The organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is dictated by microtubule nucleators or organizing centers. Toxoplasma gondii, an important human parasite, has an array of 22 regularly spaced cortical microtubules stemming from a hypothesized organizing center, the apical polar ring. Here, we examine the functions of the apical polar ring by characterizing two of its components, KinesinA and APR1, and discovered that its putative role in templating can be separated from its mechanical stability. Parasites that lack both KinesinA and APR1 ({Delta}kinesinA{Delta}apr1) are capable of generating 22 cortical microtubules. However, the apical polar ring is fragmented in live{Delta} kinesinA{Delta}apr1 parasites, and is undetectable by electron microscopy after detergent extraction. Disintegration of the apical polar ring results in the detachment of groups of microtubules from the apical end of the parasite. These structural defects are linked to a diminished ability of the parasite to move and to invade host cells, as well as decreased secretion of effectors important for these processes. Together, the findings demonstrate the importance of the structural integrity of the apical polar ring and the microtubule array in the Toxoplasma lytic cycle, which is responsible for massive tissue destruction in acute toxoplasmosis.",

    "abstract": "Advances in DNA sequencing and informatics have revolutionised biology over the past four decades, but technological limitations have left many applications unexplored1,2. Recently, portable, real-time, nanopore sequencing (RTnS) has become available. This offers opportunities to rapidly collect and analyse genomic data anywhere3-5. However, the generation of datasets from large, complex genomes has been constrained to laboratories6,7. The portability and long DNA sequences of RTnS offer great potential for field-based species identification, but the feasibility and accuracy of these technologies for this purpose have not been assessed. Here, we show that a field-based RTnS analysis of closely-related plant species (Arabidopsis spp.)8 has many advantages over laboratory-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods for species level identification-by-sequencing and de novo phylogenomics. Samples were collected and sequenced in a single day by RTnS using a portable, \\\"al fresco\\\" laboratory. Our analyses demonstrate that correctly identifying unknown reads from matches to a reference database with RTnS reads enables rapid and confident species identification. Individually annotated RTnS reads can be used to infer the evolutionary relationships of A. thaliana. Furthermore, hybrid genome assembly with RTnS and HTS reads substantially improved upon a genome assembled from HTS reads alone. Field-based RTnS makes real-time, rapid specimen identification and genome wide analyses possible. These technological advances are set to revolutionise research in the biological sciences9 and have broad implications for conservation, taxonomy, border agencies and citizen science.",

Here we report that Gde2 knockdown in zebrafish embryos leads to developmental defects, particularly, impaired motility and reduced pancreas differentiation, as shown by decreased expression of insulin and other pancreatic markers. Exogenous expression of human GDE2, but not catalytically dead GDE2, similarly leads to developmental defects. These data reveal functional conservation between zebrafish and human GDE2, and suggest that strict regulation of GDE2 expression and catalytic activity is critical for correct embryonic patterning. In particular, our data uncover a role for GDE2 in regulating pancreas differentiation.",

The current study aims to replicate and extend prior research by examining the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on the association between intelligence and victimization by analyzing twin and sibling data from two nationally representative samples of American youth. Quantitative genetic analyses indicate that common additive genetic factors, as well as non-shared environmental factors, explained the phenotypic association between intelligence and victimization. Finally, our results revealed that after correcting for possible familial confounding, the effect of intelligence on victimization experiences remained statistically significant.

As a result, protein levels do not scale linearly with mRNA levels, but instead scale with the abundance of mRNA raised to the power of an \\\"amplification exponent\\\". Here we show that to quantitate translational control, the translation rate must be decomposed into two components. One, TRmD, depends on the mRNA level and defines the amplification exponent. The other, TRmIND, is independent of mRNA amount and impacts the correlation coefficient between protein and mRNA levels. We show that in S. cerevisiae TRmD represents [~]20% of the variance in translation and directs an amplification exponent of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval [1.14, 1.26]. TRmIND constitutes the remaining [~]80% of the variance in translation and explains [~]5% of the variance in protein expression. We also find that TRmD and TRmIND are preferentially determined by different mRNA sequence features: TRmIND by the length of the open reading frame and TRmD both by a [~]60 nucleotide element that spans the initiating AUG and by codon and amino acid frequency. Our work provides more appropriate estimates of translational control and implies that TRmIND is under different evolutionary selective pressures than TRmD.",

We identified residues that are required for activation of immunity mediated by the rice XA21 receptor but that are not essential for root growth induced by PSY. Finally, we showed that a Xanthomonas strain lacking raxX is impaired in virulence.\\nC_LIO_LIThese findings suggest that RaxX serves as a molecular mimic of PSY peptides to facilitate Xoo infection and that XA21 has evolved the ability to recognize and respond specifically to the microbial form of the peptide.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) greatly diversifies metazoan transcriptomes and proteomes and is crucial for gene regulation. Current computational analysis methods of AS from Illumina RNA-seq data rely on pre-annotated libraries of known spliced transcripts, which hinders AS analysis with poorly annotated genomes and can further mask unknown AS patterns. To address this critical bioinformatics problem, we developed a method called the Junction Usage Model (JUM) that uses a bottom-up approach to identify, analyze and quantitate global AS profiles without any prior transcriptome annotations. JUM accurately reports global AS changes in terms of the five conventional AS patterns and an additional \\\"Composite\\\" category composed of inseparable combinations of conventional patterns. JUM stringently classifies the difficult and disease-relevant pattern of intron retention, reducing the false positive rate of IR detection commonly seen in other annotation-based methods to near negligible rates. When analyzing AS in RNA-samples derived from Drosophila heads, human tumors and human cell lines bearing cancer-associated splicing factor mutations, JUM consistently identified ~ twice the number of novel AS events missed by other methods. Computational simulations showed JUM exhibits a 1.2-4.8 times higher true positive rate at a fixed cut-off of 5% false discovery rate. In summary, JUM provides a new framework and improved method that removes the necessity for transcriptome annotations and enables the detection, analysis and quantification of AS patterns in complex metazoan transcriptomes with superior accuracy.",

    "abstract": "While its mechanism and biological significance are unknown, the utility of a short mitochondrial DNA sequence as a \\\"barcode\\\" providing accurate species identification has revolutionized the classification of organisms. Since highest accuracy was achieved with recently diverged species, hopes were raised that barcodes would throw light on the speciation process. Indeed, a failure of a maternally-donated, rapidly mutating, mitochondrial genome to coadapt its gene products with those of a paternally-donated nuclear genome could result in developmental failure, thus creating a post-zygotic barrier leading to reproductive isolation and sympatric branching into independent species. However, the barcode itself encodes a highly conserved, species-invariant, protein, and the discriminatory power resides in the non-amino acid specific bases of synonymous codons. It is here shown how the latter could register changes in the oligonucleotide frequencies of nuclear DNA that, when they fail to match in pairing meiotic chromosomes, could reproductively isolate the parents (whose hybrid is sterile) so launching a primary divergence into two species. It is proposed that, while not itself contributing to speciation, the barcode sequence provides an index of the nuclear DNA oligonucleotide frequencies that drive speciation.",

    "abstract": "How the program of periodic cell-cycle transcription is controlled has been debated for several years. Models have ranged from control by a CDK-APC/C oscillator, by a transcription factor (TF) network, or by coupled CDK-APC/C and TF networks. In contrast to current models, a recent study concluded that the cell-cycle transcriptional program is primarily controlled by a CDK-APC/C oscillator with little input from the TF network. This conclusion was largely based on an assumption that substantial drops in transcript levels of network TFs would render them unable to regulate their targets. By combining quantitative modeling and an unbiased analysis of the RNA-seq data, we demonstrate that the data from this recent study are completely consistent with previous reports indicating a critical role of a TF network. Moreover, we report substantial transcript dynamics in cells arrested with intermediate levels of B-cyclins, further supporting the model in which oscillating CDK activity is not required to produce phase-specific transcription.",

    "abstract": "Integrating the costs and benefits of collective behaviors is a fundamental challenge to understanding the evolution of group living. These costs and benefits can rarely be quantified simultaneously due to the complexity of the interactions within the group, or even compared to each other because of the absence of common metrics between them. The construction of  living bridges by New World army ants - which they use to shorten their foraging trails - is a unique example of a collective behavior where costs and benefits have been experimentally measured and related to each other. As a result, it is possible to make quantitative predictions about when and how the behavior will be observed. In this paper, we extend a previous mathematical model of these costs and benefits into a general framework for analyzing the optimal formation, and final configuration, of army ant living bridges. We provide experimentally testable predictions of the final bridge position, as well as the optimal formation process for certain cases, for a wide range of scenarios, which more closely resemble common terrain obstacles that ants encounter in nature. As such, our framework offers a rare benchmark for determining the evolutionary pressures governing the evolution of a naturally occurring collective animal behavior.",

    "abstract": "Infrastructures for data, such as repositories, curation systems, aggregators, indexes and standards are public goods. This means that finding sustainable economic models to support them is a challenge. This is due to free-loading, where someone who does not contribute to the support of the infrastructure nonetheless gains the benefit of it. The work of Mancur Olson (1974) suggests there are only three ways to address this for large groups: compulsion (often as some form of taxation) to support the infrastructure; the provision of non-collective (club) goods limited to those who contribute as a side-effect of providing the collective good; or mechanisms that lower the effective number of participants in the negotiation (oligopoly).\\n\\nIn this paper I use Olsons framework to analyze existing scholarly infrastructures and proposals for the sustainability of new infrastructures. I argue that the focus on sustainability models prior to seeking a set of agreed governance principles is the wrong approach. Rather we need to understand how to navigate from club-like to public-like goods. We need to define the communities that contribute and identify club-like benefits for those contributors. We need interoperable principles of governance and resourcing to provide public-like goods and we should draw on the political economics of taxation to develop this.",

Here, we develop a method to quantitatively determine proteins localization interdependencies at high throughput. We show that this method can be used to systematically obtain weighted, signed and directional pathway relationships, and hence to reconstruct a detailed pathway wiring. As proof-of-principle, we focus on 42 factors that control cell polarity in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and use high-throughput confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis to reconstruct their Localization Interdependency Network (LIN). Through this approach we identify 554 pairwise interactions across the factors, including 98% putative new directed links. Validation of an unexpected interaction between two polarity factor subgroups - the polarity landmark proteins and the cell integrity pathway components - by orthogonal phenotyping demonstrates the power of the LIN approach in detecting subtle, systems-level causal connections.",

    "abstract": "Insect genitalia exhibit rapid divergent evolution. Truly extraordinary structures have evolved in some groups, presumably as a result of post-mating sexual selection. To increase our understanding of this phenomenon, we studied the function of one such structure. The male genitalia of Callosobruchus subinnotatus (Coleoptera: Bruchinae) contain a pair of jaw-like structures with unknown function. Here, we used phenotypic engineering to ablate the teeth on these jaws. We then experimentally assessed the effects of ablation of the genital jaws on mating duration, ejaculate weight, male fertilization success and female fecundity, using a double-mating experimental design. We predicted that copulatory wounding in females should be positively related to male fertilization success. However, we found no significant correlation between genital tract scarring in females and male fertilization success. Male fertilization success was, however, positively related to the amount of ejaculate transferred by males and negatively related to female ejaculate dumping. Ablation of male genital jaws did not affect male relative fertilization success but resulted in a reduction in female egg production. Our results suggest that postmating sexual selection in males indeed favors these genital jaws, but not primarily through an elevated relative success in sperm competition but by increasing female egg production.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption has been linked to over 200 diseases and is responsible for over 5% of the global disease burden. Well known genetic variants in alcohol metabolizing genes, e.g. ALDH2, ADH1B, are strongly associated with alcohol consumption but have limited impact in European populations where they are found at low frequency. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of self-reported alcohol consumption in 112,117 individuals in the UK Biobank (UKB) sample of white British individuals. We report significant genome-wide associations at 8 independent loci. These include SNPs in alcohol metabolizing genes (ADH1B/ADH1C/ADH5) and 2 loci in KLB, a gene recently associated with alcohol consumption. We also identify SNPs at novel loci including GCKR, PXDN, CADM2 and TNFRSF11A. Gene-based analyses found significant associations with genes implicated in the neurobiology of substance use (CRHR1, DRD2), and genes previously associated with alcohol consumption (AUTS2). GCTA-GREML analyses found a significant SNP-based heritability of self-reported alcohol consumption of 13% (S.E.=0.01). Sex-specific analyses found largely overlapping GWAS loci and the genetic correlation between male and female alcohol consumption was 0.73 (S.E.=0.09, p-value = 1.37 x 10-16). Using LD score regression, genetic overlap was found between alcohol consumption and schizophrenia (rG=0.13, S.E=0.04), HDL cholesterol (rG=0.21, S.E=0.05), smoking (rG=0.49, S.E=0.06) and various anthropometric traits (e.g. Overweight, rG=-0.19, S.E.=0.05). This study replicates the association between alcohol consumption and alcohol metabolizing genes and KLB, and identifies 4 novel gene associations that should be the focus of future studies investigating the neurobiology of alcohol consumption.",

In the group with SOFA < 8, the simultaneous presence of total IgG <407 mg/dl, IgM < 43 mg/dl and IgA < 219 mg/dl was associated to a reduction in the survival mean time of 6.6 days in the first 28 days, and was a robust predictor of mortality risk either during the acute and the post-acute phase of the disease (OR for ICU mortality: 13.79; OR for hospital mortality: 7.98). This predictive ability remained in the absence of prior immunosupression (OR for ICU mortality: 17.53; OR for hospital mortality: 5.63). Total IgG <407 mg/dl or IgG1 < 332 mg/dl was also an independent predictor of ICU mortality in this group. In contrast, in the SOFA [&ge;] 8 group, we found no immunoglobulin thresholds associated to neither ICU nor to hospital mortality.\\n\\nConclusionsendogenous immunoglobulin levels may have a different impact on the mortality risk of sepsis patients based on their severity. In patients with moderate organ failure, the simultaneous presence of low levels of IgG, IgA and IgM was a consistent predictor of both acute and post-acute mortality.",

    "abstract": "The processes that led to the demise of the Neanderthals and their replacement by modern humans have been the object of speculation, research, and heated debate. Most hypotheses fall into one of two categories: one highlights the role of climate change, epidemics, or other environmental pressures in the Neanderthals demise, and the other attributes it to direct or indirect competition with modern humans, who seem to have occupied the same ecological niche. The latter are based on the assumption that modern humans benefited from some selective advantage over Neanderthals that led to the latters extinction. We show that a scenario that includes migration and selectively neutral species drift can explain the Neanderthals replacement and is in line with the archaeological evidence. Our model offers a parsimonious alternative to those that invoke external factors or selective advantage, and can represent a null hypothesis in assessing such alternatives. We show that for a wide range of parameters this hypothesis cannot be rejected. Moreover, we suggest that although selection and environmental factors may or may not have played a role in the interspecies dynamics of the Neanderthals and modern humans, the eventual outcome of these dynamics, the replacement of the Neanderthals, was the result of the hominid migration dynamics at the end of the middle Paleolithic, namely repeated migration of modern humans from Africa into the Levant and Europe.\\n\\nSignificance statementMultiple factors have been proposed as possible drivers of the extinction of the Neanderthals and their replacement by modern humans circa 40,000 years ago: climate change, epidemics, and - most prominently - a selective advantage, such as superior cognitive capacity of modern humans over Neanderthals. We propose an alternative model that includes only migration of modern humans out of Africa into the Levant and Europe. We show that, given that the two species occupied a similar ecological niche, modern humans were destined to replace the Neanderthals even under a neutral scenario in which neither species has a selective advantage.",

    "abstract": "Disentangling the etiology of common, complex diseases is a major challenge in genetic research. For bipolar disorder (BD), several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed. Similar to other complex disorders, major breakthroughs in explaining the high heritability of BD through GWAS have remained elusive. To overcome this dilemma, genetic research into BD, has embraced a variety of strategies such as the formation of large consortia to increase sample size and sequencing approaches. Here we advocate a complementary approach making use of already existing GWAS data: applying a data mining procedure to identify yet undetected genotype-phenotype relationships. We adapted association rule mining, a data mining technique traditionally used in retail market research, to identify frequent and characteristic genotype patterns showing strong associations to phenotype clusters. We applied this strategy to three independent GWAS datasets from 2,835 phenotypically characterized patients with BD. In a discovery step, 20,882 candidate association rules were extracted. Two of these - one associated with eating disorder and the other with anxiety - remained significant in an independent dataset after robust correction for multiple testing, showing considerable effect sizes (odds ratio ~ 3.4 and 3.0, respectively). Our approach may help detect novel specific genotype-phenotype relationships in BD typically not explored by analyses like GWAS. While we adapted the data mining tool within the context of BD gene discovery, it may facilitate identifying highly specific genotype-phenotype relationships in subsets of genome-wide data sets of other complex phenotype with similar epidemiological properties and challenges to gene discovery efforts.",

Converging evidence indicates that visual experience is an indispensable factor in establishing mature visual system circuitry during sensitive periods and the visual system exhibits substantial plasticity when facing deprivation. The mechanisms that underlie the environmental regulation of visual system development and plasticity are of great interest but need further exploration. Here, we investigated a unique sample of human infants who experienced initial stage blindness (beginning at birth and lasting 2 to 8 months) before the removal of bilateral cataracts. Retinal thickness, axial length, refractive status, visual grating acuity and genetic integrity were recorded during the preoperative period or at surgery, and then during follow-up. The results showed that the development of the retina is malleable and associated with external environment influences. Our work supported that the retina might play critical roles in the development of the experience-dependent visual system and its malleability might partly contribute to the sensitive period plasticity.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe follow-up investigation of a group of human infants, who experienced initial stage blindness before the removal of bilateral cataracts, revealed that retinal development is associated with environment influences and its malleability might be a potential basis of plasticity.",

This additional information permits greater accuracy in the prediction of intracellular fluxes, even when knowledge of the growth medium and biomass composition is incomplete, and allows exploration of organisms metabolism under wide-ranging conditions. However, existing techniques still focus on the reaction as the fundamental unit of their modelling. This carries the advantages of incorporating expression measurements, but discounts the fact that genes (and their associated proteins) may be involved in the catalysis of multiple reactions through the formation of alternative protein complexes.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate an approach focusing not on reactions or genes as the fundamental unit, but on the  Gene Complex (GC), a set of genes that is sufficient to catalyse a given reaction. We define expression-based limits in such a way that proteins cannot do  double duty: no single molecule is permitted to contribute to the catalysis of more than one reaction at a time. Using experimentally determined RNA expression and intracellular fluxes, we validate this novel and more conceptually sound approach.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationAn implementation of the GC-FO_SCPLOWLUXC_SCPLOW algorithm is available as part of the Pyabolism python module. https://github.com/nickfyson/pyabolism\\n\\nContactnickfyson@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Root hair polar growth is endogenously controlled by auxin and sustained by oscillating levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These cells extend several hundred-fold their original size toward signals important for plant survival. Although their final cell size is of fundamental importance, the molecular mechanisms that control it remain largely unknown. Here, we show that ROS production is controlled by the transcription factors RSL4, which in turn is transcriptionally regulated by auxin through several Auxin Responsive Factors (ARFs). In this manner, auxin controls ROS-mediated polar growth by activating RSL4, which then upregulates the expression of genes encoding NADPH oxidases (also known as RBOHs, RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG proteins) and Class-III Peroxidases (PER), which catalyse ROS production. Chemical or genetic interference with the ROS balance or peroxidase activity affect root hair final cell size. Overall, our findings establish a molecular link between auxin regulated ARFs-RSL4 and ROS-mediated polar root hair growth.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTip-growing root hairs are excellent model systems to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell elongation. Root hairs are able to expand in response to external signals, increasing several hundred-fold their original size, which is important for survival of the plant. Although their final cell size is of fundamental importance, the molecular mechanisms that control it remain largely unknown. In this study, we propose a molecular mechanism that links the auxin-Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) module to activation of RSL4, which directly targets genes encoding ROS-producing enzymes, such as NADPH oxidases (or RBOHs) and secreted type-III peroxidases (PERs). Activation of these genes impacts apoplastic ROS homeostasis, thereby stimulating root hair cell elongation.",

    "abstract": "AbstrctGenome-scale sequencing has been of great benefit in recovering species trees, but has not provided final answers. Despite the rapid accumulation of molecular sequences, resolving short and deep branches of the tree of life has remained a challenge, and has prompted the development of new strategies that can make the best use of available data. One such strategy - the concatenation of gene alignments - can be successful when coupled with many tree estimation methods, but has also been shown to fail when there are high levels of incomplete lineage sorting. Here, we focus on the failure of likelihood-based methods in retrieving a rooted, asymmetric four-taxon species tree from concatenated data when the species tree is in or near the anomaly zone - a region of parameter space where the most common gene tree does not match the species tree because of incomplete lineage sorting. First, we use coalescent theory to prove that most informative sites will support the species tree in the anomaly zone, and that as a consequence maximum-parsimony succeeds in recovering the species tree from concatenated data. We further show that maximum-likelihood tree estimation from concatenated data fails both inside and outside the anomaly zone, and that this failure is unconnected to the frequency of the most common gene tree. We provide support for a hypothesis that likelihood-based methods fail in and near the anomaly zone because discordant sites on the species tree have a lower likelihood than those that are discordant on alternative topologies. Our results confirm and extend previous reports of the failure and success of likelihood- and parsimony-based methods, and highlight avenues for future work improving the performance of methods aimed at recovering species tree.",

    "abstract": "While typically investigated as a microorganism capable of extracellular electron transfer to minerals or anodes, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 can also facilitate electron flow from a cathode to terminal electron acceptors such as fumarate or oxygen, thereby providing a model systems for a process that has significant environmental and technological implications. This work demonstrates that cathodic electrons enter the electron transport chain of S. oneidensis when oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor. The effect of electron transport chain inhibitors suggested that a proton gradient is generated during cathode-oxidation, consistent with the higher cellular ATP levels measured in cathode-respiring cells relative to controls. Cathode oxidation also correlated with an increase in the cellular redox (NADH/FMNH2) pool using a bioluminescent assay. Using a proton uncoupler, generation of NADH/FMNH2 under cathodic conditions was linked to reverse electron flow mediated by the proton pumping NADH oxidase Complex I. A decrease in cathodic electron uptake was observed in various mutant strains including those lacking the extracellular electron transfer components necessary for anodic current generation. While no cell growth was observed under these conditions, here we show that cathode oxidation is linked to cellular energy conservation, resulting in a quantifiable reduction in cellular decay rate. This work highlights a potential mechanism for cell survival and/or persistence in environments where growth and division are severely limited.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenotypes based on high-density single nucleotide polymorphisms have recently been used to identify a number of novel recessive mutations that adversely affect fertility in dairy cattle as well as to track conditions such as polledness. The use of sequential mate allocation strategies that account for increases in genomic inbreeding and the economic impact of affected matings may result in faster allele frequency changes than strategies that do not consider inbreeding and monetary losses. However, the effect of gene editing on selection programs also should be considered because gene editing has the potential to dramatically change allele frequencies in livestock populations.\\n\\nMethodsA simulation program developed to evaluate dairy cattle breeding schemes was extended to include the use of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technologies for gene editing. A hypothetical technology with a perfect success rate was used to establish an upper limit on attainable progress, and a scenario with no editing served as a baseline for comparison.\\n\\nResultsThe technologies differed in the rate of success of gene editing as well as the success rate of embryo transfer based on literature estimates. The number of edited alleles was assumed to have no effect on success rate. The two scenarios evaluated considered only the horned locus or 12 recessive alleles that currently are segregating in the U.S. Holstein population. The top 1, 5, or 10% of bulls were edited each generation, and either no cows or the top 1% of cows were edited. Inefficient editing technologies produced less cumulative genetic gain and lower inbreeding than efficient ones. Gene editing was very effective at reducing the frequency of the horned haplotype (increasing the frequency of polled animals in the population), and allele frequencies of the 12 recessives segregating in the U.S. Holstein population decreased faster with editing than without.\\n\\nConclusionsGene editing can be an effective tool for reducing the rate of harmful alleles in a dairy cattle population even if only a small proportion of elite animals are modified.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClinical recommendations to limit gestational weight gain (GWG) imply high GWG is causally related to adverse outcomes in mother or offspring, but GWG is the sum of several inter-related complex phenotypes (maternal fat deposition and vascular expansion, placenta, amniotic fluid and fetal growth). Understanding the genetic contribution to GWG could help clarify the potential effect of its different components on maternal and offspring health. Here we explore the genetic contribution to total, early and late GWG.\\n\\nParticipants and MethodsA genome-wide association study was used to identify maternal and fetal variants contributing to GWG in up to 10,543 mothers and up to 16,317 offspring of European origin, with replication in 10,660 mothers and 7,561 offspring. Additional analyses determined the proportion of variability in GWG from maternal and fetal common genetic variants and the overlap of established genome-wide significant variants for phenotypes relevant to GWG (e.g. maternal BMI and glucose, birthweight).\\n\\nResultsWe found that approximately 20% of the variability in GWG was tagged by common maternal genetic variants, and that the fetal genome made a surprisingly minor contribution to explaining variation in GWG. We were unable to identify any genetic variants that reached genome-wide levels of significance (P<5x10-8) and replicated. Some established maternal variants associated with increased BMI, fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes were associated with lower early, and higher later GWG. Maternal variants related to higher systolic blood pressure were related to lower late GWG. Established maternal and fetal birthweight variants were largely unrelated to GWG.\\n\\nConclusionWe found a modest contribution of maternal common variants to GWG and some overlap of maternal BMI, glucose and type 2 diabetes variants with GWG. These findings suggest that associations between GWG and later offspring/maternal outcomes may be due to the relationship of maternal BMI and diabetes with GWG.",

However, Hebbian plasticity alone is unstable, leading to runaway neuronal activity, and therefore requires stabilization by additional compensatory processes. Traditionally, a diversity of homeostatic plasticity phenomena found in neural circuits are thought to play this role. However, recent modelling work suggests that the slow evolution of homeostatic plasticity, as observed in experiments, is insufficient to prevent instabilities originating from Hebbian plasticity. To remedy this situation, we suggest that homeostatic plasticity is complemented by additional rapid compensatory processes, which rapidly stabilize neuronal activity on short timescales.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular cholesterol transfer to mitochondria, a bottleneck of adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis, relies on the functioning of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR, STARD1), for which many disease-associated mutations have been described. Despite significant progress in the field, the exact mechanism of cholesterol binding and transfer by STARD1 remains debatable, and the solution conformation of STARD1 is insufficiently characterized, partially due to its poor solubility. Although cholesterol binding to STARD1 was widely studied by commercially available fluorescent NBD-analogues, the effect of the NBD group position on binding remained unexplored. Here, we analyzed in detail the hydrodynamic properties and solution conformation of STARD1 and its interaction with cholesterol-like steroids bearing 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD) group in different position, namely 22-NBD-cholesterol (22NC), 25-NBD-cholesterol (25NC), 20-((NBDamino)-pregn-5-en-3-ol (20NP) and 3-(NBDamino)-cholestane (3NC). The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)-based modeling and docking simulations show that, apart from movements of the flexible {Omega}1-loop, STARD1 unlikely undergoes significant structural rearrangements proposed earlier as a gating mechanism for cholesterol binding. While being able to stoichiometrically bind 22NC and 20NP with high fluorescence yield and quantitative exhaustion of fluorescence of some protein tryptophans, STARD1 binds 25NC and 3NC with much lower affinity and poor fluorescence yield. In contrast to 3NC, binding of 20NP leads to STARD1 stabilization and increases the NBD fluorescence lifetime. Remarkably, in terms of fluorescence response, 20NP outperforms commonly used 22NC and is recommended for future studies. Our study benefits from state-of-the-art techniques and revisits the results of the STARD1 research over the last 20 years, revealing important novel information.",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation increasingly threatens the services provided by natural communities and ecosystem worldwide. An understanding of the underlying eco-evolutionary processes in natural settings is lacking, yet critical to realistic and sustainable conservation. Through integrating the multivariate genetic, biotic and abiotic facets of a natural community network experiencing various degrees of habitat fragmentation, we provide unique insights into the processes underlying community functioning in real, natural conditions. The focal community network comprises a parasitic butterfly of conservation concern, and its two obligatory host species, a plant and an ant. We show that fragmentation of butterfly habitat has the potential to impair the balance between dispersal and coevolution. This process can cause coevolutionary burning spots of decreased genetic diversity and therefore of increased extinction risk. We stress that ignoring such eco-evolutionary feed-backs inherent to the very functioning of natural communities can strongly impact their persistence.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCommunities under threat of habitat fragmentation suffer increased extinction risk through coevolutionary overheating.",

The Arabidopsis root is a widely used model for developmental, physiological and cell biological studies. Live imaging greatly aids these efforts, but the horizontal sample position and continuous root tip displacement present significant difficulties. Here, we develop a confocal microscope setup for vertical sample mounting and integrated directional illumination. We present TipTracker - a custom software for automatic tracking of diverse moving objects usable on various microscope setups. Combined, this enables observation of root tips growing along the natural gravity vector over prolonged periods of time, as well as the ability to induce rapid gravity or light stimulation. We also track migrating cells in the developing zebrafish embryo, demonstrating the utility of this system in the acquisition of high resolution data sets of dynamic samples. We provide detailed descriptions of the tools enabling the easy implementation on other microscopes.",

    "abstract": "Proposals to increase research reproducibility frequently call for focusing on effect sizes instead of p values, as well as for increasing the statistical power of experiments. However, it is unclear to what extent these two concepts are indeed taken into account in basic biomedical science. To study this in a real-case scenario, we performed a systematic review of effect sizes and statistical power in studies on learning of rodent fear conditioning, a widely used behavioral task to evaluate memory. Our search criteria yielded 410 experiments comparing control and treated groups in 122 articles. Interventions had a mean effect size of 29.5%, and amnesia caused by memory-impairing interventions was nearly always partial. Mean statistical power to detect the average effect size observed in well-powered experiments with significant differences (37.2%) was 65%, and was lower among studies with non-significant results. Only one article reported a sample size calculation, and our estimated sample size to achieve 80% power considering typical effect sizes and variances (15 animals per group) was reached in only 12.2% of experiments. Actual effect sizes correlated with effect size inferences made by readers on the basis of textual descriptions of results only when findings were non-significant, and neither effect size nor power correlated with study quality indicators, number of citations or impact factor of the publishing journal. In summary, effect sizes and statistical power have a wide distribution in the rodent fear conditioning literature, but do not seem to have a large influence on how results are described or cited. Failure to take these concepts into consideration might limit attempts to improve reproducibility in this field of science.",

    "abstract": "The plant Golgi apparatus modifies and sorts incoming proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and synthesises cell wall matrix material. Plant cells possess numerous motile Golgi bodies, which are connected to the ER by yet to be identified tethering factors. Previous studies indicated a role of cis-Golgi plant golgins (long coiled-coil domains proteins anchored to Golgi membranes) in Golgi biogenesis. Here we show a tethering role for the golgin AtCASP at the ER-Golgi interface. Using live-cell imaging, Golgi body dynamics were compared in Arabidopsis thaliana leaf epidermal cells expressing fluorescently tagged AtCASP, a truncated AtCASP-{Delta}CC lacking the coiled-coil domains, and the Golgi marker STtmd. Golgi body speed and displacement were significantly reduced in AtCASP-{Delta}CC lines. Using a dual-colour optical trapping system and a TIRF-tweezer system, individual Golgi bodies were captured in planta. Golgi bodies in AtCASP-{Delta}CC lines were easier to trap, and the ER-Golgi connection was more easily disrupted. Occasionally, the ER tubule followed a trapped Golgi body with a gap, indicating the presence of other tethering factors. Our work confirms that the intimate ER-Golgi association can be disrupted or weakened by expression of truncated AtCASP-{Delta}CC, and suggests that this connection is most likely maintained by a golgin-mediated tethering complex.\\n\\nHighlightHere we show that the Golgi-associated Arabidopsis thaliana protein AtCASP may form part of a golgin-mediated tethering complex involved in anchoring plant Golgi stacks to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).",

    "abstract": "The variability in transcription factor concentration among cells is an important developmental determinant, yet how variability is controlled remains poorly understood. Studies of variability have focused predominantly on monitoring mRNA production noise. Little information exists about transcription factor protein variability, since this requires the use of quantitative methods with single-molecule sensitivity. Using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), we characterized the concentration and variability of 14 endogenously tagged TFs in live Drosophila imaginal discs. For the Hox TF Antennapedia we investigated whether protein variability results from random stochastic events or is developmentally regulated. We found that Antennapedia transitioned from low concentration/high variability early, to high concentration/low variability later, in development. FCS and temporally resolved genetic studies uncovered that Antennapedia itself is necessary and sufficient to drive a developmental regulatory switch from auto-activation to auto-repression, thereby reducing variability. This switch is controlled by progressive changes in relative concentrations of preferentially activating and repressing Antennapedia isoforms, which bind chromatin with different affinities. Mathematical modelling demonstrated that the experimentally supported auto-regulatory circuit can explain the increase of Antennapedia concentration and suppression of variability over time.",

    "abstract": "The human reference genome is part of the foundation of modern human biology, and a monumental scientific achievement. However, because it excludes a great deal of common human variation, it introduces a pervasive reference bias into the field of human genomics. To reduce this bias, it makes sense to draw on representative collections of human genomes, brought together into reference cohorts. There are a number of techniques to represent and organize data gleaned from these cohorts, many using ideas implicitly or explicitly borrowed from graph based models. Here, we survey various projects underway to build and apply these graph based structures--which we collectively refer to as genome graphs--and discuss the improvements in read mapping, variant calling, and haplotype determination that genome graphs are expected to produce.",
