    "abstract": "Plasmids are autonomous extra-chromosomal elements in bacterial cells that can carry genes that are important for bacterial survival. To benchmark algorithms for automated plasmid sequence reconstruction from short read sequencing data, we selected 42 publicly available complete bacterial genome sequences which were assembled by a combination of long- and short-read data. The selected bacterial genome sequence projects span 12 genera, containing 148 plasmids. We predicted plasmids from short-read data with four different programs (PlasmidSPAdes, Recycler, cBar and PlasmidFinder) and compared the outcome to the reference sequences.\\n\\nPlasmidSPAdes reconstructs plasmids based on coverage differences in the assembly graph. It reconstructed most of the reference plasmids (recall = 0.82) but approximately a quarter of the predicted plasmid contigs were false positives (precision = 0.76). PlasmidSPAdes merged 83 % of the predictions from genomes with multiple plasmids in a single bin. Recycler searches the assembly graph for sub-graphs corresponding to circular sequences and correctly predicted small plasmids but failed with long plasmids (recall = 0.12, precision = 0.30). cBar, which applies pentamer frequency composition analysis to detect plasmid-derived contigs, showed an overall recall and precision of 0.78 and 0.64. However, cBar only categorizes contigs as plasmid-derived and does not bin the different plasmids correctly within a bacterial isolate. PlasmidFinder, which searches for matches in a replicon database, had the highest precision (1.0) but was restricted by the contents of its database and the contig length obtained from de novo assembly (recall = 0.36).\\n\\nSurprisingly, PlasmidSPAdes and Recycler detected single isolated components corresponding to putative novel small plasmids (<10 kbp) which were also predicted as plasmids by cBar.\\n\\nThis study shows that it is possible to automatically predict plasmid sequences, but only for small plasmids. The reconstruction of large plasmids (>50 kbp) containing repeated sequences remains challenging and limits the high-throughput analysis of WGS data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryShort read sequencing of the DNA of bacteria is often used to understand characteristics such as antibiotic resistance. However the assembly of short read sequencing data with the goal of reconstructing a complete genome is often fragmented and leaves gaps. Therefore independently replicating DNA fragments called plasmids cannot easily be identified from an assembly. Lately a number of programs have been developed to enable the automated prediction of the sequences of plasmids. Here we tested these programs by comparing their outcomes with complete genome sequences. None of the tested programs were able to fully and unambiguously predict distinct plasmid sequences. All programs performed best with the prediction of plasmids smaller than 50 kbp. Larger plasmids were only correctly predicted if they were present as a single contig in the assembly. While predictions by PlasmidSPAdes and cBar contained most of the plasmids, they were merged with or indistinguishable from other plasmids and sometimes chromosome sequences. PlasmidFinder missed most plasmids but all its predictions were correct. Without manual steps or long-read sequencing information, plasmid reconstruction from short read sequencing data remains challenging.",

    "abstract": "It is well-established that patterns of functional connectivity (FC) - measures of correlated activity between pairs of voxels or regions observed in the human brain using neuroimaging - are robustly expressed in spontaneous activity during rest. These patterns are not static, but exhibit complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Over the last years, a multitude of methods have been proposed to reveal these dynamics on the level of the whole brain. One finding is that the brain transitions through different FC configurations over time, and substantial effort has been put into characterizing these configurations. However, the dynamics governing these transitions are more elusive, specifically, the contribution of stationary vs. non-stationary dynamics is an active field of inquiry. In this study, we use a whole-brain approach, considering FC dynamics between 66 ROIs covering the entire cortex. We combine an innovative dimensionality reduction technique, tensor decomposition, with a mean field model which possesses stationary dynamics. It has been shown to explain resting state FC averaged over time and multiple subjects, however, this average FC summarizes the spatial distribution of correlations while hiding their temporal dynamics. First, we apply tensor decomposition to resting state scans from 24 healthy controls in order to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics present in the data. We simultaneously utilize temporal and spatial information by creating tensors that are subsequently decomposed into sets of brain regions (\\\"communities\\\") that share similar temporal dynamics, and their associated time courses. The tensors contain pairwise FC computed inside of overlapping sliding windows. Communities are discovered by clustering features pooled from all subjects, thereby ensuring that they generalize. We find that, on the group level, the data give rise to four distinct communities that resemble known resting state networks (RSNs): default mode network, visual network, control networks, and somatomotor network. Second, we simulate data with our stationary mean field model whose nodes are connected according to results from DTI and fiber tracking. In this model, all spatio-temporal structure is due to noisy fluctuations around the average FC. We analyze the simulated data in the same way as the empirical data in order to determine whether stationary dynamics can explain the emergence of distinct FC patterns (RSNs) which have their own time courses. We find that this is the case for all four networks using the spatio-temporal information revealed by tensor decomposition if nodes in the simulation are connected according to model-based effective connectivity. Furthermore, we find that these results require only a small part of the FC values, namely the highest values that occur across time and ROI pair. Our findings show that stationary dynamics can account for the emergence of RSNs. We provide an innovative method that does not make strong assumptions about the underlying data and is generally applicable to resting state or task data from different subject populations.",

    "abstract": "Fishers geometric model was originally introduced to argue that complex adaptations must occur in small steps because of pleiotropic constraints. When supplemented with the assumption of additivity of mutational effects on phenotypic traits, it provides a simple mechanism for the emergence of genotypic epistasis from the nonlinear mapping of phenotypes to fitness. Of particular interest is the occurrence of reciprocal sign epistasis, which is a necessary condition for multipeaked genotypic fitness landscapes. Here we compute the probability that a pair of randomly chosen mutations interacts sign-epistatically, which is found to decrease with increasing phenotypic dimension n, and varies non-monotonically with the distance from the phenotypic optimum. We then derive expressions for the mean number of fitness maxima in genotypic landscapes composed of all combinations of L random mutations. This number increases exponentially with L, and the corresponding growth rate is used as a measure of the complexity of the landscape. The dependence of the complexity on the model parameters is found to be surprisingly rich, and three distinct phases characterized by different landscape structures are identified. Our analysis shows that the phenotypic dimension, which is often referred to as phenotypic complexity, does not generally correlate with the complexity of fitness landscapes and that even organisms with a single phenotypic trait can have complex landscapes. Our results further inform the interpretation of experiments where the parameters of Fisher's model have been inferred from data, and help to elucidate which features of empirical fitness landscapes can be described by this model.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry (CyTOF) has greatly expanded the capability of cytometry. It is now easy to generate multiple CyTOF samples in a single study, with each sample containing single-cell measurement on 50 markers for more than hundreds of thousands of cells. Current methods do not adequately address the issues concerning combining multiple samples for subpopulation discovery, and these issues can be quickly and dramatically amplified with increasing number of samples. To overcome this limitation, we developed Partition-Assisted Clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (PAC-MAN) for the fast automatic identification of cell populations in CyTOF data closely matching that of expert manual-discovery, and for alignments between subpopulations across samples to define dataset-level cellular states. PAC-MAN is computationally efficient, allowing the management of very large CyTOF datasets, which are increasingly common in clinical studies and cancer studies that monitor various tissue samples for each subject.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecently, the cytometry field has experienced rapid advancement in the development of mass cytometry (CyTOF). CyTOF enables a significant increase in the ability to monitor 50 or more cellular markers for millions of cells at the single-cell level. Initial studies with CyTOF focused on few samples, in which expert manual discovery of cell types were acceptable. As the technology matures, it is now feasible to collect more samples, which enables systematic studies of cell types across multiple samples. However, the statistical and computational issues surrounding multi-sample analysis have not been previously examined in detail. Furthermore, it was not clear how the data analysis could be scaled for hundreds of samples, such as those in clinical studies. In this work, we present a scalable analysis pipeline that is grounded in strong statistical foundation. Partition-Assisted Clustering (PAC) offers fast and accurate clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (MAN) utilizes network structures learned from each homogeneous cluster to organize the data into data-set level clusters. PAC-MAN thus enables the analysis of a large CyTOF dataset that was previously too large to be analyzed systematically; this pipeline can be extended to the analysis of similarly large or larger datasets.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction is a defining feature of living systems. To reproduce, aggregates of biological units (e.g., multicellular organisms or colonial bacteria) must fragment into smaller parts. Fragmentation modes in nature range from binary fission in bacteria to collective-level fragmentation and the production of unicellular propagules in multicellular organisms. Despite this apparent ubiquity, the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes has received little attention. Here, we develop a model in which groups arise from the division of single cells that do not separate but stay together until the moment of group fragmentation. We allow for all possible fragmentation patterns and calculate the population growth rate of each associated life cycle. Fragmentation modes that maximise growth rate comprise a restrictive set of patterns that include production of unicellular propagules and division into two similar size groups. Life cycles marked by single-cell bottlenecks maximise population growth rate under a wide range of conditions. This surprising result offers a new evolutionary explanation for the widespread occurrence of this mode of reproduction. All in all, our model provides a framework for exploring the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes and their associated life cycles.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMode of reproduction is a defining trait of all organisms, including colonial bacteria and multicellular organisms. To produce offspring, aggregates must fragment by splitting into two or more groups. The particular way that a given group fragments defines the life cycle of the organism. For instance, insect colonies can reproduce by splitting or by producing individuals that found new colonies. Similarly, some colonial bacteria propagate by fission or by releasing single cells, while others split in highly sophisticated ways; in multicellular organisms reproduction typically proceeds via a single cell bottleneck phase. The space of possibilities for fragmentation is so vast that an exhaustive analysis seems daunting. Focusing on fragmentation modes of a simple kind we parametrise all possible modes of group fragmentation and identify those modes leading to the fastest population growth rate. Two kinds of life cycle dominate: one involving division into two equal size groups, and the other involving production of a unicellular propagule. The prevalence of these life cycles in nature is consistent with our null model and suggests that benefits accruing from population growth rate alone may have shaped the evolution of fragmentation mode.",

    "abstract": "Cross-species comparisons of transcriptional regulation have the potential to identify functionally constrained transcriptional regulation and genes for which a change in transcriptional regulation correlates with a change in phenotype. Conventional differential gene expression analysis and a different approach based on identifying differentially regulated orthologs (DROs) are compared using paired time course gene expression data from two species which respond similarly to cold - maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Both approaches suggest that, for genes conserved at syntenic positions for millions of years, the majority of cold responsive transcriptional regulation is species specific, although initial transcriptional responses to cold appear to be more conserved between the two species than later responses. In maize, the promoters of genes with both species specific and conserved transcriptional responses to cold tend to contain more micrococcal nuclease hypersensitive sites in their promoters, a proxy for open chromatin. However, genes with conserved patterns of transcriptional regulation between the two species show lower ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions consistent with this population of genes experiencing stronger purifying selection. We hypothesize that cold responsive transcriptional regulation is a fast evolving and largely neutral molecular phenotype for the majority of genes in Andropogoneae, while a smaller core set of genes involved in perceiving and responding to cold stress are subject to functionally constrained cold responsive regulation.",

Demosponges form the largest class in sponges, but previous studies have relied on the only draft demosponge genome of Amphimedon queenslandica. Here we present the 125-megabase draft genome of a contractile laboratory demosponge Tethya wilhelma, sequenced to almost 150x coverage. We explore the genetic repertoire of transporters, receptors, and neurotransmitter metabolism across early-branching metazoans in the context of the evolution of these gene families. Presence of many genes is highly variable across animal groups, with many gene family expansions and losses. Three sponge classes show lineage-specific expansions of GABA-B receptors, far exceeding the gene number in vertebrates, while ctenophores appear to have secondarily lost most genes in the GABA pathway. Both GABA and glutamate receptors show lineage-specific domain rearrangements, making it difficult to trace the evolution of these gene families. Gene sets in the examined taxa suggest that nervous systems evolved independently at least twice and either changed function or were lost in sponges. Changes in gene content are consistent with the view that ctenophores and sponges are the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and provide additional support for the proposed clade of Placozoa/Cnidaria/Bilateria.",

Point mutations in the BICD2 gene have been identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but how these mutations cause disease is unknown. To investigate this question, we have developed in vitro motility assays with purified DDB and BICD2s membrane vesicle partner, the GTPase Rab6a. Rab6a-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial liposomes, released BICD2 from an autoinhibited state and promoted robust dynein-dynactin transport. In these assays, BICD2 mutants showed an enhanced ability to form motile DDB complexes. Increased retrograde transport by BICD2 mutants also was observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay. When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, the hyperactive BICD2 mutants decreased neurite growth. Our results reveal that dominant mutations in BICD2 hyperactivate DDB motility and suggest that an imbalance of minus- versus plus-end-directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Our study revealed the presence of all major classes of chromatophores (melanophores, xanthophores, erythrophores, violet-blue iridophores, xantho-erythrophores) and crystalline platelets in various combinations in the iris and ocular media (cornea, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, outer lens membrane) of Poecilia reticulata. This novel ocular media study of P. reticulata takes into account the distinct interactions of Purple Body (Pb) based on results of previous Bias and Squire Purple Body (Pb) publications. Taken in conjunction with other researchers published results (regarding UV reflected color and pattern, vision, mate choice, individual preferences, and opsin capabilities) this indicates that these ocular chromatophore populations together create a complex ocular filter mechanism. This mechanism in turn provides spectral capabilities into the UV and Near-UV wavelengths in both Pb and non-Pb individuals. The chromatophores in the cornea, aqueous humor, covering membranes of the lens, and the vitreous humor comprise an ocular filter system that could reduce UV damage to the internal structures of the eye. The guppys ability to use UVA as a visual component provides a \\\"private signally system\\\" that cannot be detected by some predators. While non-Pb guppies should derive benefit in the near-UV from violet-blue iridophore units, greater benefit will be derived by Pb individuals with more violet iridophores functioning in the lower UV and near-UV wavelengths. To our knowledge little has been published for P. reticulata concerning pigmentation within the guppy eye. Macroscopic and microscopic imagery is presented.",

    "abstract": "The recent surge in enthusiasm for simultaneously inferring relationships from extinct and extant species has reinvigorated interest in statistical approaches for modelling morphological evolution. Current statistical methods use the Mk model to describe substitutions between discrete character states. Although representing a significant step forward, the Mk model presents challenges in biological interpretation, and its adequacy in modelling morphological evolution has not been well explored. Another major hurdle in morphological phylogenetics concerns the process of character coding of discrete characters. The often subjective nature of discrete character coding can generate discordant results that are rooted in individual researchers subjective interpretations. Employing continuous measurements to infer phylogenies may alleviate some of these issues. Although not widely used in the inference of topology, models describing the evolution of continuous characters have been well examined, and their statistical behaviour is well understood. Also, continuous measurements avoid the substantial ambiguity often associated with the assignment of discrete characters to states. I present a set of simulations to determine whether use of continuous characters is a feasible alternative or supplement to discrete characters for inferring phylogeny. I compare relative reconstruction accuracy by inferring phylogenies from simulated continuous and discrete characters. These tests demonstrate significant promise for continuous traits by demonstrating their higher overall accuracy as compared to reconstruction from discrete characters under Mk when simulated under unbounded Brownian motion, and equal performance when simulated under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. Continuous characters also perform reasonably well in the presence of covariance between sites. I argue that inferring phylogenies directly from continuous traits may be benefit efforts to maximise phylogenetic information in morphological datasets by preserving larger variation in state space compared to many discretisation schemes. I also suggest that the use of continuous trait models in phylogenetic reconstruction may alleviate potential concerns of discrete character model adequacy, while identifying areas that require further study in this area. This study provides an initial controlled demonstration of the efficacy of continuous characters in phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "Mature Purple Body and Non-Purple Body male guppies differ from each other in several ways. Non-Purple males may have large numbers of xanthophores, erythrophores, and blue iridophores, in addition to the usual dendritic, corolla and punctate melanophores. Fewer violet iridophores are found. In contrast, homozygous Purple Body males lack collected and clustered xanthophores, although isolated single xanthophores remain. Violet iridophores and blue iridophores (violet-blue chromatophores units) abound. The dendrites of dendritic melanophores are finer and form chains with each other. Punctate and corolla melanophores in areas comprising orange ornaments are greatly reduced in number. The heterozygous Purple Body male has erythrophores similar to those of non-Purple males, but yellow pigment is reduced. The melanophores are not as greatly changed in orange ornaments. In Domestic Guppy strains, and at least in one suspected instance in wild-type, melanophore structure and populations may be further modified by one or more additional autosomal genes.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants can contribute to oncogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, yet, despite their importance, the identification of structural variants in cancer genomes remains challenging. Here, we present an integrative framework for comprehensively identifying structural variation in cancer genomes. For the first time, we apply next-generation optical mapping, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and whole genome sequencing to systematically detect SVs in a variety of cancer cells.\\n\\nUsing this approach, we identify and characterize structural variants in up to 29 commonly used normal and cancer cell lines. We find that each method has unique strengths in identifying different classes of structural variants and at different scales, suggesting that integrative approaches are likely the only way to comprehensively identify structural variants in the genome. Studying the impact of the structural variants in cancer cell lines, we identify widespread structural variation events affecting the functions of non-coding sequences in the genome, including the deletion of distal regulatory sequences, alteration of DNA replication timing, and the creation of novel 3D chromatin structural domains.\\n\\nThese results underscore the importance of comprehensive structural variant identification and indicate that non-coding structural variation may be an underappreciated mutational process in cancer genomes.",

    "abstract": "During the 1960s, small quantities of radioactive materials were co-disposed with chemical waste at the Little Forest Legacy Site (Sydney, Australia) in three-metre-deep, unlined trenches. Chemical and microbial analyses, including functional and taxonomic information derived from shotgun metagenomics, were collected across a six-week period immediately after a prolonged rainfall event to assess how changing water levels impact upon the microbial ecology and contaminant mobility. Collectively, results demonstrated that oxygen-laden rainwater rapidly altered the redox balance in the trench water, strongly impacting microbial functioning as well as the radiochemistry. Two contaminants of concern, plutonium and americium, were shown to transition from solid-iron-associated species immediately after the initial rainwater pulse, to progressively more soluble moieties as reducing conditions were enhanced. Functional metagenomics revealed the potentially important role that the taxonomically-diverse microbial community played in this transition. In particular, aerobes dominated in the first day followed by an increase of facultative anaerobes/denitrifiers at day four. Towards the mid-end of the sampling period, the functional and taxonomic profiles depicted an anaerobic community distinguished by a higher representation of dissimilatory sulfate reduction and methanogenesis pathways.

    "abstract": "Gonorrhea is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infections in England. Over 41,000 cases were recorded in 2015, more than half of which occurred in men who have sex with men (MSM). As the bacterium has developed resistance to each first-line antibiotic in turn, we need an improved understanding of fitness benefits and costs of antibiotic resistance to inform control policy and planning. Cefixime was recommended as a single dose treatment for gonorrhea from 2005 to 2010, during which time resistance increased and subsequently declined. We developed a stochastic compartmental model representing the natural history and transmission of cefixime sensitive and resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in MSM in England, which was applied to data on diagnoses and prescriptions between 2008 and 2015. We estimated that asymptomatic carriers play a crucial role in overall transmission dynamics, with about 40% of infections remaining asymptomatic and untreated, accounting for 96% of onward transmission. The fitness cost of cefixime resistance in the absence of cefixime usage was estimated to be such that the number of secondary infections caused by resistant strains is only about half as much as for the susceptible strains, which is insufficient to maintain persistence. However, we estimated that treatment of cefixime-resistant strains with cefixime was unsuccessful in 84% of cases, representing a fitness benefit of resistance. This benefit was large enough to counterbalance the fitness cost when 31% of cases are treated with cefixime, and when more than 51% of cases were treated with cefixime the resistant strain had a net fitness advantage over the susceptible strain. Our findings have important implications for antibiotic stewardship and public health policies, and in particular suggest that cefixime could be used to treat a minority of gonorrhea cases without raising resistance levels.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins are translocated across biomembranes via protein translocons in targeting to their subcellular destinations. Hitherto, the SecYEG/Sec61 translocon, existing in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, represents the most intensively studied one. According to the current perception, both periplasmic and {beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins ({beta}-barrel OMPs) are translocated via the SecYEG translocon in bacterial cells, although direct living cell evidences remain lacking. Here, mainly via in vivo protein photo-crosslinking analysis, we revealed that the never reported membrane-integrated SecAN protein apparently functions as the translocon for {beta}-barrel OMPs. Additionally, SecAN contains a GXXXG motif known for mediating protein interactions in biomembranes, and processing of {beta}-barrel OMP precursors was severely affected in cells producing an assembly-defective SecAN variant resulted from the GXXXG motif mutations. Furthermore, SecAN was demonstrated to directly interact with the Bam complex, thus likely be a part of the supercomplex that we revealed earlier to be responsible for {beta}-barrel OMP biogenesis.",

One remarkable aspect of human population history as inferred from genetics is a consistent \\\"wave\\\" of larger effective population size, prior to the bottlenecks and expansions of the last 100,000 years. Here I carry out a series of simulations to investigate how introgression and gene flow from genetically divergent ancestral populations affect the inference of ancestral effective population size. Both introgression and gene flow from an extinct, genetically divergent population consistently produce a wave in the history of inferred effective population size. The time and amplitude of the wave reflect the time of origin of the genetically divergent ancestral populations and the strength of introgression or gene flow. These results demonstrate that even small fractions of introgression or gene flow from ancient populations may have large effects on the inference of effective population size.",

Consequently, our understanding of the contribution of the remaining seven gene segments to the evolution and epidemiological dynamics of seasonal influenza is relatively limited. The increased availability of next generation sequencing technologies allows rapid and economic whole genome sequencing (WGS). Here, 150 influenza A(H3N2) positive clinical specimens with linked epidemiological data, from the 2014/15 season in Scotland, were sequenced directly using both Sanger sequencing of the HA1 region and WGS using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences generated by both methods were highly consistent and WGS provided on average >90% whole genome coverage. As reported in other European countries during 2014/15, all strains belonged to genetic group 3C, with subgroup 3C.2a predominating. Inter-subgroup reassortants were identified (9%), including three 3C.3 viruses descended from a single reassortment event, which had persisted in the population. Significant phylogenetic associations with cases of severe acute respiratory illness observed herein warrant further investigation. Severe cases were also more likely to be associated with reassortant viruses (odds ratio: 4.4 (1.3-15.5)) and occur later in the season. These results suggest that increased levels of WGS, linked to clinical and epidemiological data, could improve influenza surveillance.",

How neuronal networks underlying the spatial firing patterns are formed is largely unknown but they are hypothesized to develop from topographic modules of synchronized neurons in superficial MEC. Here, we show that developing MEC neuronal networks in the second postnatal week are synchronously active in spatially-grouped modules. Network synchrony is intrinsic to MEC and desynchronized just prior to the emergence of spatially-tuned firing properties. The MEC network is modulated but not driven by the immature hippocampus and is tightly-coupled to neighboring neocortical networks. Unlike hippocampal networks, developing modules are dominated by glutamatergic excitation rather than GABAergic inhibition. Our results demonstrate that intrinsically synchronous modules exist in immature MEC: these may play a key role in establishing and organizing circuitry necessary for spatially-tuned firing properties of MEC neurons.",

A decrease in the transient peak and sustained increase of circulating insulin by glucose infusion accompany T2DM pathogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying this abnormal temporal pattern of circulating insulin concentration remains unknown. Here we show that bidirectional changes of hepatic and peripheral insulin clearance characterize this abnormal temporal pattern of circulating insulin concentration during the progression of T2DM. We developed a mathematical model using a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in 111 subjects, including healthy normoglycemic and diabetic subjects. The hepatic and peripheral insulin clearance significantly increase and decrease, respectively, during the progression of glucose intolerance. The increased hepatic insulin clearance reduces the amplitude of circulating insulin concentration, whereas the decreased peripheral insulin clearance changes the temporal patterns of circulating insulin concentration from transient to sustained. These results provide insight that may be useful in treating T2DM associated with aberrant insulin clearance.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a study by Rahmani et al [1] claimed that a reference-free cell-type deconvolution method, called ReFACTor, leads to improved power and improved estimates of cell-type composition compared to competing reference-free and reference-based methods in the context of Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, we identified many critical flaws (both conceptual and statistical in nature), which seriously question the validity of their claims. We outlined constructive criticism in a recent correspondence letter, Zheng et al [2]. The purpose of this letter is two-fold. First, to present additional analyses, which demonstrate that our original criticism is statistically sound. Second, to highlight additional serious concerns, which Rahmani et al have not yet addressed. In summary, we find that ReFACTor has not been demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art reference-free methods such as SVA or RefFreeEWAS, nor state-of-the-art reference-based methods. Thus, the claim by Rahmani et al (a claim reiterated in their recent response letter [3]) that ReFACT or represents an advance over the state-of-the-art is not supported by an objective and rigorous statistical analysis of the data.",

    "abstract": "N-linked glycosylation of proteins has both functional and structural significance. Importantly, the glycan structure of a therapeutic protein influences its efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity. In this work, we developed glycosylation flux analysis (GFA) for predicting intracellular production and consumption rates (fluxes) of glycoforms, and applied this method to CHO fed-batch monoclonal antibody (mAb) production using two different media compositions, with and without additional manganese feeding. The GFA is based on a constraint-based modelling of the glycosylation network, employing a pseudo steady state assumption. While the glycosylation fluxes in the network are balanced at each time point, the GFA allows the fluxes to vary with time by way of two scaling factors: (1) an enzyme-specific factor that captures the temporal changes among glycosylation reactions catalyzed by the same enzyme, and (2) the cell specific productivity factor that accounts for the dynamic changes in the mAb production rate. The GFA of the CHO fed-batch cultivations showed that regardless of the media composition, the fluxes of galactosylation decreased with the cultivation time in comparison to the other glycosylation reactions. Furthermore, the GFA showed that the addition of Mn, a cofactor of galactosyltransferase, has the effect of increasing the galactosylation fluxes but only during the beginning of the cultivation period. The results thus demonstrated the power of the GFA in delineating the dynamic alterations of the glycosylation fluxes by local (enzyme-specific) and global (cell specific productivity) factors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnalysis of physical activity usually focuses on a small number of summary statistics derived from accelerometer recordings: average counts per minute, and the proportion of time spent in moderate-vigorous physical activity or in sedentary behaviour. We show how bigrams, a concept from the field of text mining, can be used to describe how a persons activity levels change across (brief) time points. These variables can, for instance, differentiate between two people with the same time in moderate activity, where one person often stays in moderate activity from one moment to the next and the other does not.\\n\\nMethodsWe use data on 4810 participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We generate a profile of bigram frequencies for each participant and test the association of each frequency with body mass index (BMI), as an exemplar.\\n\\nResultsWe found several associations between changes in bigram frequencies and BMI. For instance, a 1 standard deviation decrease in the number of adjacent minutes in sedentary then moderate activity (or vice versa), with a corresponding increase in the number of adjacent minutes in moderate then vigorous activity (or vice versa), was associated with a 2.36 kg/m2 lower BMI [95% CI: -3.47, -1.26], after accounting for the time spent at sedentary, low, moderate and vigorous activity.\\n\\nConclusionsActivity bigrams are novel variables that capture how a persons activity changes from one moment to the next.

    "abstract": "Although patterns of social contacts are believed to be an important determinant of infectious disease transmission, there is little empirical evidence to back this up. Indeed, no previous study has linked individuals risk of respiratory infection with their current pattern of social contacts. We explored whether the frequency of different types of social encounters were associated with current pneumococcal carriage and self-reported acute respiratory symptoms (ARS), though a survey in Uganda in 2014. In total 566 participants were asked about their daily social encounters and about symptoms of ARS in the last two weeks. A nasopharyngeal specimen was also taken from each participant. We found that the frequency of physical (i.e. skin-to-skin), long ([&ge;]1h) and household contacts - which capture some measure of close (i.e. relatively intimate) contact -, was higher among pneumococcal carriers than non-carriers, and among people with ARS compared to those without, irrespective of their age. With each additional physical encounter the age-adjusted risk of carriage and ARS increased by 6% (95%CI 2-9%) and 9% (1-18%) respectively. In contrast, the number of casual contacts (<5 minutes long) was not associated with either pneumococcal carriage or ARS. A detailed analysis by age of contacts showed that the number of close contacts with young children (<5 years) was particularly higher among older children and adult carriers than non-carriers, while the higher number of contacts among people with ARS was more homogeneous across contacts of all ages. Our findings provide key evidence that the frequency of close interpersonal contact is important for transmission of respiratory infections, but not that of casual contacts. Such results strengthen the evidence for public health measures based upon assumptions of what contacts are important for transmission, and are important to improve disease prevention and control efforts, as well as inform research on infectious disease dynamics.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAlthough social contacts are an important determinant for the transmission of many infectious diseases it is not clear how the nature and frequency of contacts shape individual infection risk. We explored whether frequency, duration and type of social encounters were associated with someones risk of respiratory infection, using nasopharyngeal carriage (NP) of Streptococcus pneumoniae and acute respiratory symptoms as endpoints. To do so, we conducted a survey in South-West Uganda collecting information on peoples social encounters, respiratory symptoms, and pneumococcal carriage status. Our results show that both pneumococcal carriage and respiratory symptoms are independently associated with a higher number of social encounters, irrespective of a persons age. More specifically, our findings strongly suggest that the frequency of close contacts is important for transmission of respiratory infections, particularly pneumococcal carriage. In contrast, our study showed no association with the frequency of short casual contacts. Those results are essential for both improving disease prevention and control efforts as well as informing research on infectious disease dynamics and transmission models.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal cigarette smoke is an environmental stressor that has a profound effect on DNA methylation in the exposed offspring. We have previously shown that some of these effects persist throughout childhood and into adolescence. Of interest is whether these signals persist into adulthood.\\n\\nWe conducted an analysis to investigate associations between reported maternal smoking in pregnancy and DNA methylation in peripheral blood of women in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (n=754; mean age 30 years). We observed associations at 15 CpG sites in 11 gene regions, MYO1G, FRMD4A, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, ARL4C, AHRR, TIFAB, MDM4, AX748264, DRD1, FTO (FDR < 5%). All but two of these CpG sites have previously been identified in relation to prenatal smoke exposure in the offspring at birth and the majority showed persistent hypermethylation among the offspring of smokers.\\n\\nWe confirmed that most of these associations were not driven by own smoking and that they were still present 18 years later (N = 656; mean age 48 years). In addition, we replicated findings of a persistent methylation signal related to prenatal smoke exposure in peripheral blood among men in the ALSPAC cohort (N = 230; mean age 53 years). For both participant groups, there was a strong signal of association above that expected by chance at CpG sites previously associated with prenatal smoke exposure in newborns (Wilcoxon rank sum p-value < 2.2 x 10-4). Furthermore, we found that a prenatal smoking score, derived by combining methylation values at these CpG sites, could predict whether the mothers of the ALSPAC women smoked during pregnancy with an AUC 0.69 (95% 0.67, 0.73).",

    "abstract": "Both the composition of cell types and their spatial distribution in a tissue play a critical role in cellular function, organ development, and disease progression. For example, intratumor heterogeneity and the distribution of transcriptional and genetic events in single cells drive the genesis and development of cancer. However, it can be challenging to fully characterize the molecular profile of cells in a tissue with high spatial resolution because microscopy has limited ability to extract comprehensive genomic information, and the spatial resolution of genomic techniques tends to be limited by dissection. There is a growing need for tools that can be used to explore the relationship between histological features, gene expression patterns, and spatially correlated genomic alterations in healthy and diseased tissue samples. Here, we present a technique that combines label-free histology with spatially resolved multi-omics in un-fixed and unstained tissue sections. This approach leverages stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to provide chemical contrast that reveals histological tissue architecture, allowing for high-resolution in situ laser micro-dissection of regions of interests. These micro-tissue samples are then processed for DNA and RNA sequencing to identify unique genetic profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique by mapping gene expression and copy number alterations to histologically defined regions in human squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our approach provides complementary insights in tumorigenesis and offers an integrative tool for macroscale cancer tissues with spatial multi-omics assessments.",

    "abstract": "The localisation of oskar mRNA to the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte defines where the abdomen and germ cells form in the embryo. Kinesin 1 transports oskar mRNA to the oocyte posterior along a polarised microtubule cytoskeleton that grows from non-centrosomal microtubule organising centres (ncMTOCs) along the anterior/lateral cortex. Here we show that the formation of this polarised microtubule network also requires the posterior regulation of microtubule growth. A mutation in the Dynactin Arp1 subunit causes most oskar mRNA to localise in the posterior cytoplasm rather than cortically. oskar mRNA transport and anchoring are normal in this mutant, but the microtubules fail to reach the posterior pole. Thus, Dynactin acts as an anti-catastrophe factor that extends microtubule growth posteriorly. Kinesin 1 transports Dynactin to the oocyte posterior, creating a positive feedback loop that increases the length and persistence of the posterior microtubules that deliver oskar mRNA to the cortex.",

    "abstract": "Selection against migrants is key to maintaining genetic differences between populations linked by dispersal. Yet, migrants are not just passively weeded out by selection. Migrants may mitigate fitness costs by proactively choosing among available habitats, or by phenotypic plasticity. We previously reported that a reciprocal transplant of lake and stream stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) found little support for divergent selection. We revisit that experiment to test whether phenotypic plasticity in gene expression may have helped migrants adjust to unfamiliar habitats. We measured gene expression profiles in stickleback via TagSeq and tested whether migrants between lake and stream habitats exhibited a plastic response to their new environment that allowed them to converge on the expression profile of adapted natives. We report extensive gene expression differences between genetically divergent lake and stream stickleback, despite gene flow. But for many genes, expression was highly plastic. Fish transplanted into the adjoining habitat partially converged on the expression profile typical of their new habitat. This suggests that expression plasticity may soften the impact of migration. Nonetheless, lake and stream fish differed in survival rates and parasite infection rates in our study, implying that expression plasticity is not fast or extensive enough to fully homogenize fish performance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCatch-up campaigns (CCs) at the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) may accelerate the impact of PCVs. However, limited vaccine supplies may delay vaccine introduction if additional doses are needed for such campaigns. We studied the relative impact of introducing PCV13 with and without catch-up campaign, and the implications of potential introduction delays.\\n\\nMethodsWe used a dynamic transmission model applied to the population of Nha Trang in Sout central Vietnam. Four strategies were considered: routine vaccination (RV) only, and RV alongside catch-up campaigns among <1y olds (CC1), <2y olds (CC2) and <5y olds (CC5). The model was parameterised with local data on human social contact rates, and was fitted to local carriage data. Post-PCV predictions were based on best estimates of parameters governing post-PCV dynamics, including serotype competition, vaccine efficacy and duration of protection.\\n\\nResultsOur model predicts elimination of vaccine-type (VT) carriage across all age groups within 10 years of introduction in all scenarios with near-complete replacement by non-VT. Most of the benefit of CCs is predicted to occur within the first 3 years after introduction, with the highest impact in the first year, when IPD incidence is predicted to be 11% (95%CrI 9 - 14%) lower than RV with CC1, 25% (21 - 30 %) lower with CC2 and 38% (32 - 46%) lower with CC5.\\n\\nHowever, CCs would only prevent more cases of IPD insofar such campaigns do not delay introduction by more than 31 (95%CrI 30 - 32) weeks with CC1, 58 (53 - 63) weeks with CC2 and 89 (78 - 101) weeks for CC5.\\n\\nConclusionCCs are predicted to offer a substantial additional reduction in pneumococcal disease burden over RV alone, if their implementation does not result in much introduction delay. Those findings are important to help guide vaccine introduction in countries that have not yet introduced PCV, particularly in Asia.",

The central problem is that it affects patients suffering from AIDS, cystic fibrosis, cancer, burn victims etc. P. aeruginosa creates and inhabits surface-associated biofilms. Biofilms increase resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses, because of those current treatments are not effective. It is imperative to find new antibacterial treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa, but detailed molecular properties of the LasR protein are not clearly known to date. In the present study, we tried to analyse the molecular properties of the LasR protein as well as the mode of its interactions with autoinducer (AI) the N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3-0-C12-HSL).\\n\\nResultsWe performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the LasR protein of P. aeruginosa with the 3-0-C12-HSL ligand.

A new interaction site of the 3-0-C12-HSL with LasR protein was found, which involves interaction with conservative residues from ligand binding domain (LBD), beta turns in the short linker region (SLR) and DNA binding domain (DBD).

    "abstract": "The auditory system processes temporal information at multiple scales, and disruptions to this temporal processing may lead to deficits in auditory tasks such as detecting and discriminating sounds in a noisy environment. Here, a modelling approach is used to study the temporal regularity of firing by chopper cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus, in both the normal and impaired auditory system. Chopper cells, which have a strikingly regular firing response, divide into two classes, sustained and transient, based on the time course of this regularity. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the behaviour of chopper cells, and the difference between sustained and transient cells in particular. However, there is no conclusive evidence so far. Here, a reduced mathematical model is developed and used to compare and test a wide range of hypotheses with a limited number of parameters. Simulation results show a continuum of cell types and behaviours: chopper-like behaviour arises for a wide range of parameters, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may underlie this behaviour. The model accounts for systematic trends in regularity as a function of stimulus level that have previously only been reported anecdotally. Finally, the model is used to predict the effects of a reduction in the number of auditory nerve fibres (deafferentation due to, for example, cochlear synaptopathy).
