    "abstract": "BackgroundGlobal increase in ambient temperatures constitute a significant challenge to wild and cultivated plant species. Forward genetic analyses of individual temperature-responsive traits have resulted in the identification of several signaling and response components. However, a comprehensive knowledge about temperature sensitivity of different developmental stages and the contribution of natural variation is still scarce and fragmented at best.\\n\\nResultsHere, we systematically analyze thermomorphogenesis throughout a complete life cycle in ten natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown in four different temperatures ranging from 16 to 28 {degrees}C. We used Q10, GxE, phenotypic divergence and correlation analyses to assess temperature sensitivity and genotype effects of more than 30 morphometric and developmental traits representing five phenotype classes. We found that genotype and temperature differentially affected plant growth and development with variing strengths. Furthermore, overall correlations among phenotypic temperature responses was relatively low which seems to be caused by differential capacities for temperature adaptations of individual accessions.\\n\\nConclusionGenotype-specific temperature responses may be attractive targets for future forward genetic approaches and accession-specific thermomorphogenesis maps may aid the assessment of functional relevance of known and novel regulatory components.",

    "abstract": "Non-spatial selective attention is based on the notion that specific features or objects in the visual environment are effectively prioritized in cortical visual processing. Feature-based attention (FBA) in particular, is a well-studied process that dynamically and selectively enhances neurons preferentially processing the attended feature attribute (e.g. leftward motion). In everyday life, however, behavior may require high sensitivity for an entire feature dimension (e.g. motion). Yet, evidence for feature dimension-specific attentional modulation on a cellular level is lacking. We here investigate neuronal activity in macaque motion-selective medio-temporal area (MT) in an experimental setting requiring the monkeys to detect either a motion change or a color change. We hypothesized that neural activity in MT is enhanced if the task requires perceptual sensitivity to motion. Despite identical visual stimulation, we found that mean firing rates were higher in the motion task, and response variability and latency were lower as compared to the color task. This task-specific response modulation in the processing of visual motion was independent from the relation between attended and stimulating motion direction. It emerged already in the absence of visual input, and consisted of a spatially global and tuning-independent shift of the MT baseline activity. The results provide single cell support for the hypothesis of a feature dimension-specific top-down signal emphasizing the processing of an entire feature class.",

    "abstract": "One central goal of genome biology is to understand how the usage of the genome differs between organisms. Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across all animal groups and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome usage and composition, taking into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, essentially all animals have comparable amounts of introns and intergenic sequence, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more dependent on genome size than previously thought.\\n\\nAuthors SummaryWithin our anthropocentric genomic framework, many analyses tends to try to define humans, mammals, or vertebrates relative to the so-called \\\"lower\\\" animals. This implicitly posits that vertebrates are complex organisms with large genomes and invertebrates are simple organisms with small genomes. This has the problem that genome size is therefore presumed to correlate with complexity and ignores any unknown complexity of vast numbers of invertebrate groups, many with large genomes. Animals vary widely in genome size, by almost three orders of magnitude, but when sequencing new animal genomes preference is given to those with smaller genomes for reasons of cost. In trying to understand how genomes are used in general, there is an added layer of complication from quality of the assembly and annotation. We have examined genome usage across a wide range of animals and have described ways to account for errors of low-quality annotations. We also show that the genomes of invertebrates and vertebrates are not so different, and that when large-genome invertebrates are added, genome size alone appears to be defining the fraction of the genome that is genes.",

    "abstract": "Codon usage in 2730 genomes is analyzed for evolutionary patterns in the usage of synonymous codons and amino acids across prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa. We group genomes together that have similar amounts of intra-genomic bias in their codon usage, and then compare how usage of particular different codons is diversified across each genome group, and how that usage varies from group to group. Inter-genomic diversity of codon usage increases with intra-genomic usage bias, following a universal pattern. The frequencies of the different codons vary in robust mutual correlation, and the implied synonymous codon and amino acid usages drift together. This kind of correlation indicates that the variation of codon usage across organisms is chiefly a consequence of lateral DNA transfer among diverse organisms. The group of genomes with the greatest intra-genomic bias comprises two distinct subgroups, with each one restricting its codon usage to essentially one unique half of the genetic code table. These organisms include eubacteria and archaea thought to be closest to the hypothesized last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Their codon usages imply genetic diversity near the hypothesized base of the tree of life. There is a continuous evolutionary progression across taxa from the two extremely diversified usages toward balanced usage of different codons (as approached, e.g. in mammals). In that progression, codon frequency variations are correlated as expected from a blending of the two extreme codon usages seen in prokaryotes.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe redundancy intrinsic to the genetic code allows different amino acids to be encoded by up to six synonymous codons. Genomes of different organisms prefer different synonymous codons, a phenomenon known as  codon usage bias. The phenomenon of codon usage bias is of fundamental interest for evolutionary biology, and is important in a variety of applied settings (e.g., transgene expression). The spectrum of codon usage biases seen in current organisms is commonly thought to have arisen by the combined actions of mutations and selective pressures. This view focuses on codon usage in specific genomes and the consequences of that usage for protein expression.\\n\\nHere we investigate an unresolved question of molecular genetics: are there global rules governing the usage of synonymous codons made by genomic DNA across organisms? To answer this question, we employed a data-driven approach to surveying 2730 species from all kingdoms of the  tree of life in order to classify their codon usage. A first major result was that the large majority of these organisms use codons rather uniformly on the genome-wide scale, without giving preference to particular codons among possible synonymous alternatives. A second major result was that two compartments of codon usage seem to co-exist and to be expressed in different proportions by different organisms. As such, we investigate how individual different codons are used in different organisms from all taxa. Whereas codon usage is generally believed to be the evolutionary result of both mutations and natural selection, our results suggest a different perspective: the usage of different codons (and amino acids) by different organisms follows a superposition of two distinct patterns of usage. One distinction locates to the third base pair of all different codons, which in one pattern is U or A, and in the other pattern is G or C. This result has two major implications: (1) the variation of codon usage as seen across different organisms is best accounted for by lateral gene transfer among diverse organisms; (2) the organisms that are by protein homology grouped near the base of the  tree of life comprise two genetically distinct lineages.\\n\\nWe find that, over evolutionary time, codon usages have converged from two distinct, non-overlapping usages (e.g., as evident in bacteria and archaea) to a near-uniform, balanced usage of synonymous codons (e.g., in mammals). This shows that the variations of codon (and amino acid) biases reveal a distinct evolutionary progression. We also find that codon usage in bacteria and archaea is most diverse between organisms thought to be closest to the hypothesized last universal common ancestor (LUCA). The dichotomy in codon (and amino acid usages) present near the origin of the current  tree of life might provide information about the evolutionary development of the genetic code.",

    "abstract": "During rest, envelopes of band-limited on-going MEG signals co-vary across the brain in consistent patterns, which have been related to resting-state networks measured with fMRI. To investigate the genesis of such envelope correlations, we consider a whole-brain network model assuming two distinct fundamental scenarios: one where each brain area generates oscillations in a single frequency, and a novel one where each brain area can generate oscillations in multiple frequency bands. The models share, as a common generator of damped oscillations, the normal form of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation operating at the critical border between the steady state and the oscillatory regime. The envelopes of the simulated signals are compared with empirical MEG data using new methods to analyse the envelope dynamics in terms of their phase coherence and stability across the spectrum of carrier frequencies.\\n\\nConsidering the whole-brain model with a single frequency generator in each brain area, we obtain the best fit with the empirical MEG data when the fundamental frequency is tuned at 12Hz. However, when multiple frequency generators are placed at each local brain area, we obtain an improved fit of the spatio-temporal structure of on-going MEG data across all frequency bands. Our results indicate that the brain is likely to operate on multiple frequency channels during rest, introducing a novel dimension for future models of large-scale brain activity.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory and metabolic network models have been used successfully in many organisms, but inherent differences between them make networks difficult to integrate. Probabilistic Regulation Of Metabolism (PROM) provides a partial solution, but it does not incorporate network inference and underperforms in eukaryotes. We present an Integrated Deduced REgulation And Metabolism (IDREAM) method that combines statistically inferred Environment and Gene Regulatory Influence Network (EGRIN) models with the PROM framework to create enhanced metabolic-regulatory network models. We used IDREAM to predict phenotypes and genetic interactions between transcription factors and genes encoding metabolic activities in the eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. IDREAM models contain many fewer interactions than PROM and yet produce significantly more accurate growth predictions. IDREAM consistently outperformed PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions. Importantly, IDREAMs enhanced accuracy makes it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects. With experimental validation, these novel genetic interactions involving the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex suggested a new role for fatty acid-responsive factor Oaf1 in regulating acetyl-CoA production in glucose grown cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe integration of gene regulatory and metabolic network models is an important goal in computational biology, in order to develop methods that can identify the underlying mechanistic links in biological networks and advance metabolic engineering techniques. In this paper, we develop a framework called Integrated Deduced REgulation And Metabolism (IDREAM) that can improve our ability to predict phenotypes of microorganisms, and particularly it can address the challenges in evaluating phenotypic consequence of perturbing transcriptional regulation of metabolism in a eukaryotic cell. We compare the predictive performance of an IDREAM S. cerevisiae model with a PROM model using a TRN available from the YEASTRACT database. IDREAM outperforms PROM using any of three popular yeast metabolic models and across three experimental growth conditions, making it possible to identify subtle synthetic growth defects, and a new role for Oaf1 in the regulation of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "We propose a voxel-wise general linear model with autoregressive noise and heteroscedastic noise innovations (GLMH) for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The model is analyzed from a Bayesian perspective and has the benefit of automatically down-weighting time points close to motion spikes in a data-driven manner. We develop a highly efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that allows for Bayesian variable selection among the regressors to model both the mean (i.e., the design matrix) and variance. This makes it possible to include a broad range of explanatory variables in both the mean and variance (e.g., time trends, activation stimuli, head motion parameters and their temporal derivatives), and to compute the posterior probability of inclusion from the MCMC output. Variable selection is also applied to the lags in the autoregressive noise process, making it possible to infer the lag order from the data simultaneously with all other model parameters. We use both simulated data and real fMRI data from OpenfMRI to illustrate the importance of proper modeling of heteroscedasticity in fMRI data analysis. Our results show that the GLMH tends to detect more brain activity, compared to its homoscedastic counterpart, by allowing the variance to change over time depending on the degree of head motion.",

In order to work well with so few samples, Differential Gene Expression (DGE) tools typically assume the form of the underlying distribution of gene expression. A recent highly replicated study revealed that RNA-seq gene expression measurements in yeast are best represented as being drawn from an underlying negative binomial distribution. In this paper, the statistical properties of gene expression in the higher eukaryote Arabidopsis thaliana are shown to be essentially identical to those from yeast despite the large increase in the size and complexity of the transcriptome: Gene expression measurements from this model plant species are consistent with being drawn from an underlying negative binomial or log-normal distribution and the false positive rate performance of nine widely used DGE tools is not strongly affected by the additional size and complexity of the A. thaliana transcriptome. For RNA-seq data, we therefore recommend the use of DGE tools that are based on the negative binomial distribution.",

Thirty-three adults performed a self-face recognition task from a series of self-other face morphs with simultaneous eye-tracking. Participants were found to look at lower part of the face for longer duration for self-face compared to other-face. Participants with a reduced overlap between self and other face representations, as indexed by a steeper slope of the psychometric response curve for self-face recognition, spent a greater proportion of time looking at the upper regions of faces identified as self. Additionally, the association of autism-related traits with self-face processing metrics was tested, since autism has previously been associated with atypical self-processing, particularly in the psychological domain. Autistic traits were associated with reduced looking time to both self and other faces. However, no self-face specific association was noted with autistic traits, suggesting that autism-related features may be related to self-processing in a domain specific manner.",

While exceptions to these assumptions can profoundly influence evolutionary inference, detecting them can require extensive sampling, abundant sequence data, and detailed testing. Using advancements in high-throughput sequencing, we analyzed the whole plastomes of 65 accessions of Picea, a genus of ~35 coniferous forest tree species, to test for deviations from canonical plastome evolution. Using complementary hypothesis and data-driven tests, we found evidence for chimeric plastomes generated by interspecific hybridization and recombination in the clade comprising Norway spruce (P. abies) and ten other species. Support for interspecific recombination remained after controlling for sequence saturation, positive selection, and potential alignment artifacts. These results reconcile previous conflicting plastid-based phylogenies and strengthen the mounting evidence of reticulate evolution in Picea. Given the relatively high frequency of hybridization and biparental plastid inheritance in plants, we suggest interspecific plastome recombination may be more widespread than currently appreciated and could underlie reported cases of discordant plastid phylogenies.",

    "abstract": "1An animal embryo begins its life as a ball of epithelial cells. In the course of development, invariably, this cellular ball will undergo a process of gastrulation to form a multilayered structure with the different germ layers designated to form organs with different shapes and functions. In the fruit fly Drosophia melanogaster, gastrulation begins with the constriction of mesodermal cells that make up a rectangular domain in the ventral part of the embryo. A remarkable aspect of this morphogenetic event is its anisotropy - the mesoderm constricts much more along one axis than along the other. In this paper we propose an explanation of this observed anisotropy. Specifically, we show that tissue contraction must be anisotropic, provided that the tissue is elastic and that the contractile domain is elongated (e.g. rectangular as opposed to square). This conclusion is generic in the sense that it does not depend on the specific values of model parameters. Since our recent study demonstrated that embryonic tissue is elastic on a developmentally relevant time-scale, it appears likely that the anisotropy of mesoderm contraction is an elastic effect. Our model makes a number of specific predictions that appear in close agreement with the available data.",

Although fewer than 0.25% of the records in our data set are known to be faulty, we would expect that there are many more in GenBank that have not yet been identified. By automated comparison with literature they can be identified with a precision of up to 10% and a recall of up to 30%, while strongly outperforming several baselines. While these results leave substantial room for improvement, they reflect both the very imbalanced nature of the data, and the limited explicitly labelled data that is available. Overall, the obtained results show promise for the development of a new kind of approach to detecting low-quality and suspicious sequence records based on literature analysis and consistency. From a practical point of view, this will greatly help curators in identifying inconsistent records in large-scale sequence databases by highlighting records that are likely to be inconsistent with the literature.",

However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTHow is temporal information processed in human visual cortex? Visual input is relayed to V1 through segregated transient and sustained channels in the retina and LGN. However, there is intense debate as to how transient and sustained channels contribute to visual processing beyond V1. Using a 2 temporal-channel encoding model we can predict fMRI responses to time-varying stimuli ranging from milliseconds to seconds. The transient channel dominates responses in the periphery of early visual cortex and lateral occipito-temporal regions. However, both sustained and transient channels drive responses in central early visual cortex and ventral occipito-temporal regions. Together these finding resolve an outstanding debate and lay the foundation for a complete temporal model of neural processing in visual cortex. Importantly, this encoding approach can be applied with fMRI to decipher neural computations in millisecond resolution in any part of the brain, which has vast implications for understanding neural processing.",

    "abstract": "Microbes may maximize the number of daughter cells per time or per amount of nutrients consumed. These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in E. coli, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWhen cells compete for nutrients, those that grow faster and produce more offspring per time are favored by natural selection. In contrast, when cells need to maximize the cell number at a limited nutrient supply, fast growth does not matter and an efficient use of nutrients (i.e. high biomass yield) is essential. This raises a basic question about metabolism: can cells achieve high growth rates and yields simultaneously, or is there a conflict between the two goals? Using a new modeling method called Enzymatic Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM), we predict cellular growth rates and find that growth rate/yield trade-offs and the ensuing preference for enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways are not universal, but depend on growth conditions such as external glucose and oxygen concentrations.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of tissue integrity is essential for the life of multicellular organisms. Healing of a skin wound is a paradigm for how various cell types localize and repair tissue perturbations in an orchestrated fashion. To investigate biophysical mechanisms associated with wound localization, we focus on a model system consisting of a fibroblast monolayer on an elastic substrate. We find that the creation of an edge in the monolayer causes cytosolic calcium oscillations throughout the monolayer. The oscillation frequency increases with cell density, which shows that wound-induced calcium oscillations occur collectively. Inhibition of myosin II reduces the number of oscillating cells, demonstrating a coupling between actomyosin activity and calcium response. The spatial distribution of oscillating cells depends on the stiffness of the substrate. For soft substrates with a Youngs modulus E ~ 360 Pa, oscillations occur on average within 0.2 mm distance from the wound edge. Increasing substrate stiffness leads to an average localization of oscillations away from the edge (up to ~0.6 mm). In addition, we use traction force microscopy to determine stresses between cells and substrate. We find that an increase of substrate rigidity leads to a higher traction magnitude. For E < ~2 kPa, the traction magnitude is strongly concentrated at the monolayer edge, while for E > ~8 kPa, traction magnitude is on average almost uniform beneath the monolayer. Thus, the spatial occurrence of calcium oscillations correlates with the cell-substrate traction. Overall, the experiments with fibroblasts demonstrate a collective, chemomechanical localization mechanism at the edge of a wound with a potential physiological role.",

    "abstract": "To make accurate perceptual estimates observers must take the reliability of sensory information into account. Despite many behavioural studies showing that subjects weight individual sensory cues in proportion to their reliabilities, it is still unclear when during a trial neuronal responses are modulated by the reliability of sensory information, or when they reflect the perceptual weights attributed to each sensory input during decision making. We investigated these questions using a combination of psychophysics, EEG based neuroimaging and single-trial decoding. Our results show that the weighted integration of sensory information in the brain is a dynamic process; effects of sensory reliability on task-relevant EEG components were evident around 84ms after stimulus onset, while neural correlates of perceptual weights emerged around 120ms after stimulus onset. These neural processes also had different underlying topographies, arising from areas consistent with sensory and parietal regions. Together these results reveal the temporal dynamics of perceptual and neural audio-visual integration and support the notion of temporally early and functionally specific multisensory processes in the brain.",

We isolated monocytes from 134 genotyped individuals, stimulated the cells with three defined microbe-associated molecular patterns (LPS, MDP, and ppp-dsRNA), and profiled the transcriptome at three time points. After mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), we identified 417 response eQTLs (reQTLs) with differing effect between the conditions. We characterized the dynamics of genetic regulation on early and late immune response, and observed an enrichment of reQTLs in distal cis-regulatory elements. Response eQTLs are also enriched for recent positive selection with an evolutionary trend towards enhanced immune response. Finally, we uncover novel reQTL effects in multiple GWAS loci, and show a stronger enrichment of response than constant eQTLs in GWAS signals of several autoimmune diseases. This demonstrates the importance of infectious stimuli modifying genetic predisposition to disease.",

Recent studies have shown that antibody mediated immune responses are more cross-reactive than previously believed, and shape patterns of humoral immunity to influenza A viruses over long periods. Here we quantify antibody responses to the hemagglutinin subunit 1 (HA1) across a range of subtypes using protein microarray analysis of cross-sectional serological surveys carried out in the Netherlanc before and after the A/2009 (H1N1) pandemic. We find significant associations of responses, both within and between subtypes. Interestingly, substantial overall reactivity is observed to HA1 of avian H7N7 and H9N2 viruses. Seroprevalence of H7N7 correlates with antibody titer to A/1968 (H3N2), and is highest in persons born between 1954 and 1969. Seroprevalence of H9N2 is high across all ages, and correlates strongly with A/1957 (H2N2). This correlation is most pronounced in A/2009 (H1N1) infected persons born after 1968 who have never encountered A/1957 (H2N2)-like viruses. We conclude that heterosubtypic antibody crossreactivity, both between human subtypes and between human and nonhuman subtypes, is common in the human population.",

    "abstract": "Over the last ten years, isogenic tagging (IT) has revolutionised the study of bacterial infection dynamics in laboratory animal models. However, quantitative analysis of IT data has been hindered by the piecemeal development of relevant statistical models. The most promising approach relies on stochastic Markovian models of bacterial population dynamics within and among organs. Here we present an efficient numerical method to fit such stochastic dynamic models to in vivo experimental IT data. A common approach to statistical inference with stochastic dynamic models relies on producing large numbers of simulations, but this remains a slow and inefficient method for all but simple problems, especially when tracking bacteria in multiple locations simultaneously. Instead, we derive and solve the systems of ordinary differential equations for the two lower-order moments of the stochastic variables (mean, variance and covariance). For any given model structure, and assuming linear dynamic rates, we demonstrate how the model parameters can be efficiently and accurately estimated by divergence minimisation. We then apply our method to an experimental dataset and compare the estimates and goodness-of-fit to those obtained by maximum likelihood estimation. While both sets of parameter estimates had overlapping confidence regions, the new method produced lower values for the division and death rates of bacteria: these improved the goodness-of-fit at the second time point at the expense of that of the first time point. This flexible framework can easily be applied to a range of experimental systems. Its computational efficiency paves the way for model comparison and optimal experimental design.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecent advancements in technology have meant that microbiologists are producing vast amounts of experimental data. However, statistical methods by which we can analyse that data, draw informative inference, and test relevant hypotheses, are much needed. Here, we present a new, efficient inference tool for estimating parameters of stochastic models, with a particular focus on models of within-host bacterial dynamics. The method relies on matching the two lower-order moments of the experimental data (i.e., mean, variance and covariance), to the moments from the mathematical model. The method is verified, and particular choices justified, through a number of simulation studies.

It remains unknown whether the NPCs within a species are homogeneous or vary depending on the cell type, or physiological condition. Here, we present evidence for compositionally distinct NPCs that form within a single cell in a binucleated ciliate. In Tetrahymena thermophila, each cell contains both a transcriptionally-active macronucleus (MAC) and a germline micronucleus (MIC). By combining in silico analysis, mass spectrometry analysis for immuno-isolated proteins, and subcellular localization analysis of GFP fused proteins, we identified numerous novel components of MAC and MIC NPCs. Core members of the Nup107-160 scaffold complex were enriched in MIC NPCs. Strikingly, two paralogs of Nup214 and of Nup153 localized exclusively to either MAC or MIC NPCs. Furthermore, the transmembrane components Pom121 and Pom82 localize exclusively to MAC and MIC NPCs, respectively. Our results argue that functional nuclear dimorphism in ciliates is likely to depend on compositional and structural specificity of NPCs.",

In Australia multiple-resistant populations of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) are effectively controlled by soil-applied herbicides which provide adequate weed control.\\n\\nIn this study we define the mechanistic basis of the experimentally-evolved resistance to the soil-applied herbicide pyroxasulfone in a L. rigidum population. TLC and HPLC-MS provide biochemical confirmation that pyroxasulfone resistance is metabolism-based with identification and quantification of pyroxasulfone metabolites formed via a glutathione conjugation pathway in pyroxasulfone-resistant L. rigidum plants. The observed over-expression of two putative resistance-endowing GST genes is consistent with pyroxasulfone-resistance in parental plants (P6) and positively correlated to pyroxasulfone resistance in F1 pair-cross progenies. Thus, a major detoxification mechanism involves glutathione conjugation to pyroxasulfone and GST over-expression in pyroxasulfone-resistant L. rigidum plants. The definition of the genetic basis of metabolic resistance in weeds can be a first crucial step towards chemical means to reverse resistance and improve long-term weed resistance management.",

    "abstract": "Our ability to unambiguously image and track individual molecules in live cells is limited by packing of multiple copies of labeled molecules within the resolution limit. Here we devise a universal genetic strategy to precisely control copy number of fluorescently labeled molecules in a cell. This system has a dynamic titration range of >10,000 fold, enabling sparse labeling of proteins expressed at different abundance levels. Combined with photostable labels, this system extends the duration of automated single-molecule tracking by 2 orders of magnitude. We demonstrate long-term imaging of synaptic vesicle dynamics in cultured neurons as well as in intact zebrafish. We found axon initial segment utilizes a  waterfall mechanism gating synaptic vesicle transport polarity by promoting anterograde transport processivity. Long-time observation also reveals that transcription factor hops between clustered binding sites in spatially-restricted sub-nuclear regions, suggesting that topological structures in the nucleus shape local gene activities by a sequestering mechanism. This strategy thus greatly expands the spatiotemporal length scales of live-cell single-molecule measurements, enabling new experiments to quantitatively understand complex control of molecular dynamics in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) causes Huntington disease (HD), and lowering its levels is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here we show that scheduled feeding significantly decreases mHTT protein levels through enhanced autophagy in the CNS of an HD mouse model, while short term fasting is sufficient to observe similar effects in peripheral tissue. Furthermore, preventing proteolysis at the caspase-6 cleavage site D586 (C6R) makes mHTT a better substrate for autophagy, additionally increasing its clearance. Mice expressing mutant C6R also exhibit increased autophagy at baseline compared to an HD model with cleavable mHTT, suggesting that the native function of HTT in promoting autophagy is disrupted upon cleavage and re-established by prevention of cleavage by caspase-6. In HD patients, mHTT clearance and autophagy may therefore become increasingly impaired as a function of age and disease stage by gradually increased activity of mHTT-processing enzymes.",

The recently discovered arginine rhamnosylation activates the polyproline specific bacterial translation elongation factor EF-P. EF-P is rhamnosylated on arginine 32 by the glycosyltransferase EarP. However, the enzymatic mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we solved the crystal structure of EarP from Pseudomonas putida. The enzyme is composed of two opposing domains with Rossmann-folds, thus constituting a GT-B glycosyltransferase. While TDP-rhamnose is located within a highly conserved pocket of the C-domain, EarP recognizes the EF-P via its KOW-like N-domain. Based on our structural data combined with an in vitro /in vivo enzyme characterization, we propose a mechanism of inverting arginine glycosylation.

    "abstract": "As glaciers thaw in response to warming, they release dissolved organic matter (DOM) to alpine lakes and streams. The United States contains an abundance of both alpine glaciers and rock glaciers. Differences in DOM composition and bioavailability between glacier types, like rock and ice glaciers, remain undefined. To assess differences in glacier and rock glacier DOM we evaluated bioavailability and molecular composition of DOM from four alpine catchments each with a glacier and a rock glacier at their headwaters. We assessed bioavailability of DOM by incubating each DOM source with a common microbial community and evaluated chemical characteristics of DOM before and after incubation using untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry based metabolomics (GC-MS). Prior to incubations, ice glacier and rock glacier DOM had similar C:N ratios and chemical diversity, but differences in DOM composition. Incubations with a common microbial community showed DOM from ice glacier meltwaters contained a higher proportion of bioavailable DOM (BDOM) and resulted in greater bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). After incubation, DOM composition from each source was statistically indistinguishable. This study provides an example of how MS based metabolomics can be used to assess effects of DOM composition on differences in bioavailability of DOM. Furthermore, it illustrates the importance of microbial metabolism in structuring composition of DOM. Even though rock glaciers had significantly less BDOM than ice glaciers, both glacial types still have potential to be important sources of BDOM to alpine headwaters over the coming decades.\\n\\nKey PointsBioavailability of organic matter released from glaciers is greater than that of rock glaciers in the Rocky Mountains.\\n\\nThe use of GC-MS for ecosystem metabolomics represents a novel approach for examining complex organic matter pools.\\n\\nBoth glaciers and rock glaciers supply highly bioavailable sources of organic matter to alpine headwaters in Colorado.",

The role of de novo mutations in regulatory elements affecting known DD associated genes or other genes is essentially unexplored. We identified de novo mutations in three classes of putative regulatory elements in almost 8,000 DD patients. Here we show that de novo mutations in highly conserved fetal-brain active elements are significantly and specifically enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identified a significant two-fold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements. We estimate that, genome-wide, de novo mutations in fetaLbrain active elements are likely to be causal for 1-3% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant and that only a small fraction (<2%) of de novo mutations in these elements are pathogenic. Our findings represent a robust estimate of the contribution of de novo mutations in regulatory elements to this genetically heterogeneous set of disorders, and emphasise the importance of combining functional and evolutionary evidence to delineate regulatory causes of genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the roles of ion currents is crucial to predict the action of pharmaceuticals and mutations in different scenarios, and thereby to guide clinical interventions in the heart, brain and other electrophysiological systems. Our ability to predict how ion currents contribute to cellular electrophysiology is in turn critically dependent on our characterisation of ion channel kinetics -- the voltage-dependent rates of transition between open, closed and inactivated channel states. We present a new method for rapidly exploring and characterising ion channel kinetics, applying it to the hERG potassium channel as an example, with the aim of generating a quantitatively predictive representation of the ion current. We fit a mathematical model to currents evoked by a novel 8 second sinusoidal voltage clamp in CHO cells over-expressing hERG1a. The model is then used to predict over 5 minutes of recordings in the same cell in response to further protocols: a series of traditional square step voltage clamps, and also a novel voltage clamp comprised of a collection of physiologically-relevant action potentials. We demonstrate that we can make predictive cell-specific models that outperform the use of averaged data from a number of different cells, and thereby examine which changes in gating are responsible for cell-cell variability in current kinetics. Our technique allows rapid collection of consistent and high quality data, from single cells, and produces more predictive mathematical ion channel models than traditional approaches.\\n\\nTable of Contents CategoryTechniques for Physiology1\\n\\nKey PointsO_LIIon current kinetics are commonly represented by current-voltage relationships, time-constant voltage relationships, and subsequently mathematical models fitted to these.

    "abstract": "Inexpensive, high-throughput sequencing has led to the generation of large numbers of sequenced genomes representing diverse lineages in both model and non-model organisms. Such resources are well suited for the creation of new multiparent populations to identify quantitative trait loci that contribute to variation in phenotypes of interest. However, despite significant drops in per-base sequencing costs, the costs of sample handling and library preparation remain high, particularly when many samples are sequenced. We describe a novel method for pooled genotyping of offspring from multiple genetic crosses, such as those that that make up multiparent populations. Our approach, which we call \\\"private haplotype barcoding\\\" (PHB), utilizes private haplotypes to deconvolve patterns of inheritance in individual offspring from mixed pools composed of multiple offspring. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by applying the PHB method to whole genome sequencing of 96 segregants from 12 yeast crosses, achieving over a 90% reduction in sample preparation costs relative to non-pooled sequencing. In addition, we implement a hidden Markov model to calculate genotype probabilities for a generic PHB run and a specialized hidden Markov model for the yeast crosses that improves genotyping accuracy by making use of tetrad information. Private haplotype barcoding holds particular promise for facilitating inexpensive genotyping of large pools of offspring in diverse non-model systems.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry (CyTOF) has greatly expanded the capability of cytometry. It is now easy to generate multiple CyTOF samples in a single study, with each sample containing single-cell measurement on 50 markers for more than hundreds of thousands of cells. Current methods do not adequately address the issues concerning combining multiple samples for subpopulation discovery, and these issues can be quickly and dramatically amplified with increasing number of samples. To overcome this limitation, we developed Partition-Assisted Clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (PAC-MAN) for the fast automatic identification of cell populations in CyTOF data closely matching that of expert manual-discovery, and for alignments between subpopulations across samples to define dataset-level cellular states. PAC-MAN is computationally efficient, allowing the management of very large CyTOF datasets, which are increasingly common in clinical studies and cancer studies that monitor various tissue samples for each subject.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRecently, the cytometry field has experienced rapid advancement in the development of mass cytometry (CyTOF). CyTOF enables a significant increase in the ability to monitor 50 or more cellular markers for millions of cells at the single-cell level. Initial studies with CyTOF focused on few samples, in which expert manual discovery of cell types were acceptable. As the technology matures, it is now feasible to collect more samples, which enables systematic studies of cell types across multiple samples. However, the statistical and computational issues surrounding multi-sample analysis have not been previously examined in detail. Furthermore, it was not clear how the data analysis could be scaled for hundreds of samples, such as those in clinical studies. In this work, we present a scalable analysis pipeline that is grounded in strong statistical foundation. Partition-Assisted Clustering (PAC) offers fast and accurate clustering and Multiple Alignments of Networks (MAN) utilizes network structures learned from each homogeneous cluster to organize the data into data-set level clusters. PAC-MAN thus enables the analysis of a large CyTOF dataset that was previously too large to be analyzed systematically; this pipeline can be extended to the analysis of similarly large or larger datasets.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of high-speed CMOS detectors is fast marching the field of transmission electron microscopy into an intersection with the computer science field of big data. Automated data pipelines to control the instrument and the initial processing steps are imposing more and more onerous requirements on data transfer and archiving. We present a proposal for expansion of the venerable MRC file format to combine integer decimation and lossless compression to reduce storage requirements and improve file read/write times by >1000 % compared to uncompressed floating-point data. The integer decimation of data necessitates application of the gain normalization and outlier pixel removal at the data destination, rather than the source. With direct electron detectors, the normalization step is typically provided by the vendor and is not open-source. We provide robustly tested normalization algorithms that perform at-least as well as vendor software. We show that the generation of hot pixels is a highly dynamic process in direct electron detectors, and that outlier pixels must be detected on a stack-by-stack basis. In comparison, the low-frequency bias features of the detectors induced by the electronics on-top of the active layer, are extremely stable with time. Therefore we introduce a stochastic-based approach to identify outlier pixels and smoothly filter them, such that the degree of correlated noise in micrograph stacks is reduced. Both a priori and a posteriori gain normalization approaches that are compatible with pipeline image processing are discussed. The a priori approach adds a gamma-correction to the gain reference, and the a posteriori approach normalized by a moving average of time-adjacent stacks, with the current stack being knocked-out, known as the KOMA (knock-out moving average) filter. The combination of outlier filter and KOMA normalization over ~25 frames can reduce the correlated noise in movies to nearly zero.

    "abstract": "The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) plays a central role in cyanobacterial photoprotection. Photoconversion entails significant structural rearrangements in OCP required for its binding to the phycobilisome to induce excitation energy dissipation, whereas the fluorescence recovery protein (FRP) is required for OCP detachment and restoration of phycobilisome fluorescence. Although key to understanding the whole reversible mechanism of photoprotection, the FRP binding site on OCP has been representing challenge since the discovery of FRP in 2010 and is currently unknown. OCP comprises two structural domains organized into a compact basic orange form due to specific protein-chromophore and inter-domain protein-protein interactions and interacts with FRP tightly only when photoactivated. As an important stabilizing element in the orange OCP, the short A-helix within the N-terminal extension (NTE) binds to OCPs C-terminal domain (CTD), but unfolds upon photoactivation and interferes with phycobilisome binding. By using an alloy of biochemical and biophysical techniques, here we demonstrate that the NTE shares specific structural and functional similarities with FRP and discover the main site of OCP-FRP interactions in the OCP-CTD.",

    "abstract": "Taxonomy and nomenclature data are critical for any project that synthesizes biodiversity data, as most biodiversity data sets use taxonomic names to identify taxa. Open Tree of Life is one such project, synthesizing sets of published phylogenetic trees into comprehensive supertrees. No single published taxonomy met the taxonomic and nomenclatural needs of the project. Here we describe a system for reproducibly combining several source taxonomies into a synthetic taxonomy, and we discuss the challenges of taxonomic and nomenclatural synthesis for downstream biodiversity projects.",
