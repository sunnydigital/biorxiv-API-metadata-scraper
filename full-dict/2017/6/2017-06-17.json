    "abstract": "Chromosome segregation requires robust interactions between the macromolecular kinetochore structure and dynamic microtubule polymers. A key outstanding question is how kinetochore-microtubule attachments are modulated to ensure that bi-oriented attachments are selectively stabilized and maintained. The Astrin-SKAP complex localizes preferentially to properly bi-oriented sister kinetochores, representing the final outer kinetochore component recruited prior to anaphase onset. Here, we reconstitute the 4-subunit Astrin-SKAP complex, including a novel MYCBP subunit. Our work demonstrates that the Astrin-SKAP complex contains separable kinetochore localization and microtubule binding domains. In addition, through cross-linking analysis in human cells and biochemical reconstitution, we show that the Astrin-SKAP complex binds synergistically to microtubules with the Ndc80 complex, the core component of the kinetochore-microtubule interface, to form an integrated interface. We propose a model in which the Astrin-SKAP complex acts together with the Ndc80 complex to stabilize correctly formed kinetochore-microtubule interactions.",

    "abstract": "Severe cellular sensitivity and aberrant chromosomal rearrangements in response to DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) inducing agents are hallmarks of Fanconi anemia (FA) deficient cells. These phenotypes have previously been ascribed to inappropriate activity of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) rather than a direct consequence of DNA ICL repair defects. Here we used chemical inhibitors, RNAi, and Clusterd Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 to inactivate various components of NHEJ in cells from FA patients. We show that suppression of DNA-PKcs, DNA Ligase IV and 53BP1 is not capable of rescuing ICL-induced proliferation defects and only 53BP1 knockout partially suppresses the chromosomal abnormalities of FA patient cells.",

    "abstract": "Descending signals from the brain play critical roles in controlling and modulating locomotion kinematics. In the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system, descending AVB premotor interneurons exclusively form gap junctions with B-type motor neurons that drive forward locomotion. We combined genetic analysis, optogenetic manipulation, and computational modeling to elucidate the function of AVB-B gap junctions during forward locomotion. First, we found that some B-type motor neurons generated intrinsic rhythmic activity, constituting distributed central pattern generators. Second, AVB premotor interneurons drove bifurcation of B-type motor neuron dynamics, triggering their transition from stationary to oscillatory activity. Third, proprioceptive couplings between neighboring B-type motor neurons entrained the frequency of body oscillators, forcing coherent propagation of bending waves. Despite substantial anatomical differences between the worm motor circuit and those in higher model organisms, we uncovered converging principles that govern coordinated locomotion.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA deep understanding of the neural basis of motor behavior must integrate neuromuscular dynamics, mechanosensory feedback, as well as global command signals, to predict behavioral dynamics. Here, we report on an integrative approach to defining the circuit logic underlying coordinated locomotion in C. elegans. Our combined experimental and computational analysis revealed that (1) motor neurons in C. elegans could function as intrinsic oscillators; (2) Descending inputs and proprioceptive couplings work synergistically to facilitate the sequential activation of motor neuron activities, allowing bending waves to propagate efficiently along the body. Our work thus represents a key step towards an integrative view of animal locomotion.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCortical spreading depression (CSD) is believed to promote migraine headache by enhancing the activity and mechanosensitivity of trigeminal intracranial meningeal afferents. One putative mechanism underlying this afferent response involves an acute excitation of meningeal afferents by cortical efflux of K+ and the ensuing antidromic release of pro-inflammatory sensory neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).\\n\\nObjectivesWe sought to investigate whether (i) a brief meningeal K+ stimulus leads to CGRP-dependent enhancement of meningeal afferent responses, and (ii) CSD-induced meningeal afferent activation and sensitization involve CGRP receptor signaling.\\n\\nMethodsExtracellular single-unit recording were used to record the activity of meningeal afferents in anesthetized male rats. Stimulations included a brief meningeal application of K+ or induction of CSD in the frontal cortex using pinprick. CSD was documented by recording changes in cerebral blood flow using laser Doppler flowmetery. CGRP receptor activity was inhibited with BIBN4096 (333M, i.v.).\\n\\nResultsMeningeal K+ stimulation acutely activated 86% of the afferent tested and also promoted in ~65% of the afferents a 3-fold increase in ongoing activity which was delayed by 23.3{+/-}4.1 min and lasted for 22.2{+/-}5.6 min. K+ stimulation did not promote mechanical sensitization. Pretreatment with BIBN4096 suppressed the K+- induced delayed afferent activation, reduced CSD-evoked cortical hyperemia, but had no effect on the enhanced activation or mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents following CSD.\\n\\nConclusionWhile CGRP-mediated activation of meningeal afferents evoked by cortical efflux of K+ could promote headache, acute activation of CGRP receptors may not play a key role in mediating CSD-evoked headache.\\n\\nPrevious presentation of the research, manuscript, or abstractParts of the manuscript have been presented previously only in an abstract form.",

    "abstract": "Type VII secretion systems (T7SS) are found in many bacteria and secrete proteins involved in virulence and bacterial competition. In Staphylococcus aureus the small ubiquitin-like EsaB protein has been previously implicated as having a regulatory role in the production of the EsxC substrate. Here we show that in the S. aureus RN6390 strain, EsaB does not genetically regulate production of any T7 substrates or components, but is indispensable for secretion activity. Consistent with EsaB being a core component of the T7SS, loss of either EsaB or EssC are associated with upregulation of a common set of iron acquisition genes. However, a further subset of genes were dysregulated only in the absence of EsaB. In addition, fractionation revealed that although an EsaB fusion to yellow fluorescent protein partially localised to the membrane, it was still membrane-localised when the T7SS was absent. Taken together our findings suggest that EsaB has T7SS-dependent and T7SS-independent roles in S. aureus.",
