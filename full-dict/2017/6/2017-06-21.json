    "abstract": "Genetic studies of familial schizophrenia in Finland have observed significant associations with a group of biologically related genes, DISC1, NDE1, NDEL1, PDE4B and PDE4D, the \\\"DISC1 network\\\". Here, we utilize gene expression and psychoactive medication use data to study their biological consequences and potential treatment implications. Gene expression levels were determined in 64 individuals from 18 families, whilst prescription medication information has been collected over a ten-year period for 931 affected individuals. We demonstrate that the NDE1 SNP rs2242549 associates with significant changes in gene expression for 2,908 probes (2,542 genes), of which 794 probes (719 genes) were replicable. A significant number of the genes altered were predicted targets of microRNA-484 (p=3.0x10-8), located on a non-coding exon of NDE1. Variants within the NDE1 locus also displayed significant genotype by gender interaction to early cessation of psychoactive medications metabolized by CYP2C19. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-484 can affect the expression of CYP2C19 in a cell culture system. Thus, variation at the NDE1 locus may alter risk of mental illness, in part through modification of miR-484, and such modification alters treatment response to specific psychoactive medications, leading to the potential for use of this locus in targeting treatment.",

    "abstract": "The expression of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) remains a major bottleneck in the characterization of this important protein class. IMP expression levels are currently unpredictable, which renders the pursuit of IMPs for structural and biophysical characterization challenging and inefficient. Experimental evidence demonstrates that changes within the nucleotide or amino-acid sequence for a given IMP can dramatically affect expression; yet these observations have not resulted in generalizable approaches to improved expression. Here, we develop a data-driven statistical predictor named IMProve, that, using only sequence information, increases the likelihood of selecting an IMP that expresses in E. coli. The IMProve model, trained on experimental data, combines a set of sequence-derived features resulting in an IMProve score, where higher values have a higher probability of success. The model is rigorously validated against a variety of independent datasets that contain a wide range of experimental outcomes from various IMP expression trials. The results demonstrate that use of the model can more than double the number of successfully expressed targets at any experimental scale. IMProve can immediately be used to identify favorable targets for characterization.",

    "abstract": "Ecologists have recognised the effects of biotic interactions on the spatial distribution of living organisms. Yet, the spatial structure of plant interaction networks in real-world ecosystems has remained elusive so far. Using spatial pattern and network analyses, we found that alpine plant communities are organised in spatially variable and complex networks. Specifically, the cohesiveness of complex networks is promoted by short-distance positive plant interactions. At fine spatial scale, where positive mutual interactions prevailed, networks were characterised by a large connected component. With increasing scale, when negative interactions took over, network architecture became more hierarchical with many detached components that show a network collapse. This study highlights the crucial role of positive interactions for maintaining species diversity and the resistance of communities in the face of environmental perturbations.",

    "abstract": "The Drosophila melanogaster white-eyed w1118 line serves as a blank control, allowing genetic recombination of any gene of interest along with a readily recognizable marker. w1118 flies display behavioral susceptibility to environmental stimulation such as light. It is of great importance to characterize the behavioral performance of w1118 flies because this would provide a baseline from which the effect of the gene of interest could be differentiated. Little work has been performed to characterize the walking behavior in adult w1118 flies. Here we show that pulsed light stimulation increased the regularity of walking trajectories of w1118 flies in circular arenas. We statistically modeled the distribution of distances to center and extracted the walking structures of w1118 flies. Pulsed light stimulation redistributed the time proportions for individual walking structures. Specifically, pulsed light stimulation reduced the episodes of crossing over the central region of the arena. An addition of four genomic copies of mini-white, a common marker gene for eye color, mimicked the effect of pulsed light stimulation in reducing crossing in a circular arena. The reducing effect of mini-white was copy-number-dependent. These findings highlight the rhythmic light stimulation-evoked modifications of walking behavior in w1118 flies and an unexpected behavioral consequence of mini-white in transgenic flies carrying w1118 isogenic background.",

    "abstract": "Replication defective viral genomes (DVGs) generated during virus replication are the primary triggers of antiviral immunity in many RNA virus infections. However, DVGs can also facilitate viral persistence. Why and how these two opposing functions of DVGs are achieved remain unknown. Here we report that during Sendai and respiratory syncytial virus infections DVGs selectively protect a subpopulation of cells from death and promote the establishment of persistent infections. We find that during Sendai virus infection this phenotype results from DVGs stimulating a MAVS-mediated TNF response that drives apoptosis of highly infected cells while extending the survival of cells enriched in DVGs. The pro-survival effect of TNF depends on the activity of the TNFR2/TRAF1 pathway that is regulated by MAVS signaling. These results identify TNF as a pivotal factor in determining cell fate during a viral infection and delineate a MAVS/TNFR2-mediated mechanism that drives the persistence of otherwise acute viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDetailed modelling of the neutral mutational process in cancer cells is crucial for identifying driver mutations and understanding the mutational mechanisms that act during cancer development. The neutral mutational process is very complex: whole-genome analyses have revealed that the mutation rate differs between cancer types, between patients and along the genome depending on the genetic and epigenetic context. Therefore, methods that predict the number of different types of mutations in regions or specific genomic elements must consider local genomic explanatory variables. A major drawback of most methods is the need to average the explanatory variables across the entire region or genomic element. This procedure is particularly problematic if the explanatory variable varies dramatically in the element under consideration.\\n\\nResultsTo take into account the fine scale of the explanatory variables, we model the probabilities of different types of mutations for each position in the genome by multinomial logistic regression. We analyse 505 cancer genomes from 14 different cancer types and compare the performance in predicting mutation rate for both regional based models and site-specific models. We show that for 1000 randomly selected genomic positions, the site-specific model predicts the mutation rate much better than regional based models. We use a forward selection procedure to identify the most important explanatory variables. The procedure identifies site-specific conservation (phyloP), replication timing, and expression level as the best predictors for the mutation rate. Finally, our model confirms and quantifies certain well-known mutational signatures.\\n\\nConclusionWe find that our site-specific multinomial regression model outperforms the regional based models. The possibility of including genomic variables on different scales and patient specific variables makes it a versatile framework for studying different mutational mechanisms. Our model can serve as the neutral null model for the mutational process; regions that deviate from the null model are candidates for elements that drive cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Sustained and elevated activity during the working memory delay period has long been considered the primary neural correlate for maintaining information over short time intervals. This idea has recently been reinterpreted in light of findings generated from multiple neural recording modalities and levels of analysis. To further investigate the sustained or transient nature of activity, the temporal-spectral evolution (TSE) of delay period activity was examined in humans with high density EEG during performance of a Sternberg working memory paradigm with a relatively long six second delay and with novel scenes as stimuli. Multiple analyses were conducted using different trial window durations and different baseline periods for TSE computation. Sensor level analyses revealed transient rather than sustained activity during delay periods. Specifically, the consistent finding among the analyses was that high amplitude activity encompassing the theta range was found early in the first three seconds of the delay period. These increases in activity early in the delay period correlated positively with subsequent ability to distinguish new from old probe scenes. Source level signal estimation implicated a right parietal region of transient early delay activity that correlated positively with working memory ability. This pattern of results adds to recent evidence that transient rather than sustained delay period activity supports visual working memory performance. The findings are discussed in relation to synchronous and desynchronous intra- and inter-regional neural transmission, and choosing an optimal baseline for expressing temporal-spectral delay activity change.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms evolved adaptive responses that enable them to survive stressful challenges in ever changing environments by adjusting metabolism through the modulation of gene expression, protein levels and activity, and flow of metabolites. More frequent challenges allow natural selection ampler opportunities to select from a larger number of phenotypes that are compatible with survival. Understanding the causal relationships between physiological and metabolic requirements that are needed for cellular stress adaptation and gene expression changes that are used by organisms to achieve those requirements may have a significant impact in our ability to interpret and/or guide evolution.\\n\\nHere, we study those causal relationships during heat shock adaptation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We do so by combining dozens of independent experiments measuring whole genome gene expression changes during stress response with a nonlinear simplified kinetic model of central metabolism.\\n\\nThis combination is used to create a quantitative, multidimensional, genotype-to-phenotype mapping of the metabolic and physiological requirements that enable cell survival to the feasible changes in gene expression that modulate metabolism to achieve those requirements. Our results clearly show that the feasible changes in gene expression that enable survival to heat shock are specific for this stress. In addition, they suggest that genetic programs for adaptive responses to desiccation/rehydration and to pH shifts might be selected by physiological requirements that are qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different to those for heat shock adaptation. In contrast, adaptive responses to other types of stress do not appear to be constrained by the same qualitative physiological requirements. Our model also explains at the mechanistic level how evolution might find different sets of changes in gene expression that lead to metabolic adaptations that are equivalent in meeting physiological requirements for survival. Finally, our results also suggest that physiological requirements for heat shock adaptation might be similar between unicellular ascomycetes that live in similar environments. Our analysis is likely to be scalable to other adaptive response and might inform efforts in developing biotechnological applications to manipulate cells for medical, biotechnological, or synthetic biology purposes.",

    "abstract": "A gene drive biases inheritance of a gene so that it increases in frequency within a population even when the gene confers no fitness benefit. There has been renewed interest in environmental releases of engineered gene drives due to recent proof of principle experiments with the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a drive mechanism. Release of modified organisms, however, is controversial, especially when the drive mechanism could theoretically alter all individuals of a species. Thus, it is desirable to have countermeasures to reverse a drive if a problem arises. Several genetic mechanisms for limiting or eliminating gene drives have been proposed and/or developed, including synthetic resistance, reversal drives, and immunizing reversal drives. While predictions about efficacy of these mechanisms have been optimistic, we lack detailed analyses of their expected dynamics. We develop a discrete time model for population genetics of a drive and proposed genetic countermeasures. Efficacy of drive reversal varies between countermeasures. For some parameter values, the model predicts unexpected behavior including polymorphic equilibria and oscillatory dynamics. The timing and number of released individuals containing a genetic countermeasure can substantially impact outcomes. The choice among countermeasures by researchers and regulators will depend on specific goals and population parameters of target populations.",

Here, we present the largest collection of novel complete extrachromosomal genetic elements to date, and compare the diversity, distribution, and content of circular sequences from 12 rat cecum samples from the pristine Falkland Islands and Danish hospital sewers, two environments with contrasting anthropogenic impact. Using a validated pipeline, we find 1,869 complete, circular, non-redundant sequences, of which only 114 are previously described. While sequences of similar size from the two environments share general features, the size distribution of the elements between environments differs significantly, with hospital sewer samples hosting larger circular elements than Falkland Island samples, a possible consequence of the massive anthropogenic influence in the hospital sewer environment. Several antibiotic resistance genes have been identified with a notably larger diversity in hospital sewer samples than in Falkland Islands samples in concordance with expectations. Our findings suggest that even though sequences of similar length carry similar traits, the mobilome of rat gut bacteria are affected by human activities in that sewer rats have larger elements and more diverse large elements than pristine island rats.

As dispersal is central to range dynamics, factors promoting fast and distant dispersal are key to understanding and predicting species ranges. During range expansions, genetic variation is depleted at the expanding front. Such conditions should reduce evolutionary potential, while increasing kin competition. Organisms able to recognise relatives may be able to assess increased levels of relatedness at expanding range margins and to increase their dispersal in a plastic manner. Using individual-based simulations and experimental range expansions of a spider mite, we demonstrate that plastic responses to kin structure can be at least as important as evolution in driving range expansion speed.

    "abstract": "Beta-hairpins are a substructure found in proteins that can lend insight into more complex systems. Furthermore, the folding of beta-hairpins is a valuable test case for benchmarking experimental and theoretical methods. Here, we simulate the folding of CLN025, a miniprotein with a beta-hairpin structure, at its experimental melting temperature using a range of state-of-the-art protein force fields. We construct Markov state models in order to examine the thermodynamics, kinetics, mechanism, and rate-determining step of folding. Mechanistically, we find the folding process is rate-limited by the formation of the turn region hydrogen bonds, which occurs following the downhill hydrophobic collapse of the extended denatured protein. These results are presented in the context of established and contradictory theories of the beta-hairpin folding process. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AMBER-FB15 force field, at this temperature, best describes the characteristics of the full experimental CLN025 conformational ensemble, while the AMBER ff99SB-ILDN and CHARMM22* force fields display a tendency to overstabilize the native state.",

    "abstract": "The current paradigm of treatment for dental caries (tooth decay) in primary teeth is dangerous, fails to reach many children, and suffers high recurrence. Acceptance of the paradigm arises from a misperception that untreated caries in primary teeth is a threat to life. We show a linear relationship between age and deaths in the United States from 1999 through 2015 caused by dental caries, pulpal / periapical abscess, or facial cellulitis. The intercept of 6 years coincides with emergence of the first permanent tooth: it appears that caries in primary teeth is not a threat to life. Thus, treatment goals should be to avoid pain, which is not possible with operative dentistry, as it causes pain. Medical management of caries is a distinct treatment philosophy which employs topical minimally invasive therapies that treat the disease, and is not merely prevention. Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a central agent to enable effective non-invasive treatment. The announcement of FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation suggests that SDF will become the first FDA approved drug for treating the disease dental caries. Since our last review, 4 clinical trials have been completed, which inform an update to the application protocol and frequency regimen. Suggestions from these studies are to skip the rinsing step due to demonstration of safety and concern of diminished effectiveness by dilution, and to start patients with an intensive regimen of multiple applications over the first few weeks. Breakthroughs in elucidating the impact of SDF on tooth structure and the plaque microbiome inform potential opportunities for bioengineering and understanding caries arrest, respectively. Dentists have been surprised by preference of this treatment over traditional invasive approaches. Renewed interest in this old material has delivered progress to optimize the judicious use of SDF, and enable a revolution in caries management - particularly for primary teeth.\\n\\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYAnesthesia is inappropriate for first-line treatment of early childhood caries now that safe topical treatments such as silver diamine fluoride are available.",

    "abstract": "Sleep plays an important role in consolidation of recent memories. However, the mechanisms of consolidation remain poorly understood. In this study, using a realistic computational model of the thalamocortical network, we demonstrated that sleep spindles (the hallmark of N2 stage sleep) and slow oscillations (the hallmark of N3 stage sleep) both facilitate spike sequence replay as necessary for consolidation. When multiple memories were trained, the local nature of spike sequence replay during spindles allowed replay of the memories independently, while during slow oscillations replay of the weak memory was competing to the strong memory replay. This led to the weak memory extinction unless when sleep spindles (N2 sleep) preceded slow oscillations (N3 sleep), as observed during natural sleep. Our study presents a mechanistic explanation for the role of sleep rhythms in memory consolidation and proposes a testable hypothesis how the natural structure of sleep stages provides an optimal environment to consolidate memories.\\n\\nSignificant StatementNumerous studies suggest importance of NREM sleep rhythms - spindles and slow oscillations - in sleep related memory consolidation. However, synaptic mechanisms behind the role of these rhythms in memory and learning are still unknown. Our new study predicts that sleep replay - the neuronal substrate of memory consolidation - is organized within the sleep spindles and coordinated by the Down to Up state transitions of the slow oscillation. For multiple competing memories, slow oscillations facilitated only strongest memory replay, while sleep spindles allowed a consolidation of the multiple competing memories independently. Our study predicts how the basic structure of the natural sleep stages provides an optimal environment for consolidation of multiple memories.",

    "abstract": "Maturation of GABAergic circuits in primary visual cortex (V1) opens a critical period (CP), a developmental window of enhanced plasticity for visual functions. However, how inhibition promotes the plasticity remains unclear. Here, we investigated the developmental dynamics of auditory responses and audiovisual interactions in mouse V1. Modulation of V1 spiking activity by a transient sound was temporally dynamic with alternating enhancement and suppression phases. When paired with grating visual stimuli, sound-driven spike enhancement and suppression were weaker and stronger with preferred orientation than with non-preferred orientations, respectively, leading to impaired net orientation selectivity in V1 neurons. Strikingly, the net orientation selectivity was impervious to sound specifically during the CP due to equal total amounts of sound-driven spike enhancements and suppressions. This balance of spike modulations at the CP was achieved by the preferential maturation of sound-driven spike suppression. However, further maturation of sound-driven spike enhancement broke the balance after the CP. Spectral analysis of field potentials revealed the enhancement of a GABA-mediated sound-driven power suppression specifically at CP. Reduction of inhibition by 10-day dark-exposure or genetic deletion of GAD65 gene dampened sound-driven spike suppression in V1. Furthermore, acute suppression of either parvalbumin-expressing (PV) or somatostatinexpressing (SST) neurons suggested their early or late recruitments by sound, respectively. Our results point to the dampened net non-visual sensory influence as one of the functional roles of GABA circuit maturation during a developmental CP. The insensitivity of visual selectivity to sound during the CP may promote functional maturation of V1 as visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major pathway by which cells internalize materials from the external environment. Dynamin, a large multidomain GTPase, is a key regulator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It assembles at the necks of invaginated clathrin-coated pits and, through GTP hydrolysis, catalyzes scission and release of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane. Several small molecule inhibitors of dynamins GTPase activity, such as Dynasore and Dyngo-4a, are currently available, although their specificity has been brought into question. Previous screens for these inhibitors measured dynamins stimulated GTPase activity due to lack of sufficient sensitivity, hence the mechanisms by which they inhibit dynamin are uncertain. We report a highly sensitive fluorescence-based assay capable of detecting dynamins basal GTPase activity under conditions compatible with high throughput screening. Utilizing this optimized assay, we conducted a pilot screen of 8000 compounds and identified several \\\"hits\\\" that inhibit the basal GTPase activity of dynamin-1. Subsequent dose-response curves were used to validate the activity of these compounds. Interestingly, we found neither Dynasore nor Dyngo-4a inhibited dynamins basal GTPase activity, although both inhibit assembly-stimulated GTPase activity. This assay provides the basis for a more extensive search for robust dynamin inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The Interferon-Induced Proteins with Tetratricopeptide Repeats (IFITs) are a group of potently expressed Interferon Stimulated Genes that mediate antiviral innate immunity. Previous studies have revealed that most IFITs partake in higher order structures, potentially as part of an  IFIT interactome that results in viral inhibition. Recent crystal structures of a mutated, monomeric form of IFIT1 revealed the molecular basis of how it recognizes non-self, capped viral mRNAs to selectively inhibit their translation. However, wild-type IFIT1 forms dimers in solution and the role of dimerization was not examined in detail. Here we present a structural and biochemical analysis of wild-type IFIT1 in complex with capped and uncapped RNA. Wild-type IFIT1 forms an antiparallel, elongated dimer that is in stark contrast to the domain-swapped, parallel dimer found in IFIT2. Dimerization takes place through a small, C-terminal interface that is evolutionarily conserved in IFIT1 and IFIT1B proteins. The interface is modular and can be grafted onto IFIT5, which is natively monomeric, to induce dimerization. Mutational analysis of this interface showed that homo-dimerization is not required for full RNA binding or translational inhibition by IFIT1. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation measurements demonstrated a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium, suggesting that dimerization is of low affinity and could play a role under physiological concentrations, possibly in regulating IFIT interactome assembly. Finally, conformational changes in IFIT1 that occur upon RNA binding provide insight into how RNA enters its binding site in solution.",

    "abstract": "Formaldehyde crosslinking underpins many of the most commonly used experimental approaches in the chromatin field, especially in capturing site-specific protein-DNA interactions. Extending such assays to assess the stability and binding kinetics of protein-DNA interactions is more challenging, requiring absolute measurements with a relatively high degree of physical precision. We previously described an experimental framework called CLK, which uses time-dependent formaldehyde crosslinking data to extract chromatin binding kinetic parameters. Many aspects of formaldehyde behavior in cells are unknown or undocumented, however, and could potentially impact analyses of CLK data. Here we report biochemical results that better define the properties of formaldehyde crosslinking in budding yeast cells. These results have the potential to inform interpretations of  standard chromatin assays including chromatin immunoprecipitation, and the chemical complexity we uncovered resulted in the development of an improved method for measuring binding kinetics using the CLK approach. Optimum conditions included an increased formaldehyde concentration and more robust glycine quench conditions. Notably, we find that formaldehyde crosslinking rates can vary dramatically for different protein-DNA interactions in vivo. Some interactions were crosslinked much faster than the time scale for macromolecular interaction, making them suitable for kinetic analysis. For other interactions, we find the crosslinking reaction occurred on the same time scale or slower than binding dynamics; for these it was in some cases possible to compute the in vivo equilibrium-binding constant but not on- and off-rates for binding. Selected TATA-binding protein-promoter interactions displayed dynamic behavior on the minute to several minutes time scale.",

However, a general understanding of RNA localization has been hindered by a lack of simple, high-throughput methods for mapping the transcriptomes of subcellular compartments. Here, we develop such a method, termed APEX-RIP, which combines peroxidase-catalyzed, spatially restricted in situ protein biotinylation with RNA-protein chemical crosslinking. We demonstrate that, using a single protocol, APEX-RIP can isolate RNAs from a variety of subcellular compartments, including the mitochondrial matrix, nucleus, bulk cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with higher specificity and coverage than do conventional approaches. We furthermore identify candidate RNAs localized to mitochondria-ER junctions and nuclear lamina, two compartments that are recalcitrant to classical biochemical purification. Since APEX-RIP is simple, versatile, and does not require special instrumentation, we envision its broad application in a variety of biological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological interventions that target human ageing would extend individual healthspan and result in dramatic economic benefits to rapidly ageing societies worldwide. For such interventions to be contemplated they need to comprise drugs that are efficacious when given to adults and for which extensive human safety data are available. Here we show that dramatic lifespan extension can be achieved in C.elegans by targeting multiple, evolutionarily conserved ageing pathways using drugs that are already in human use. By targeting multiple synergistic ageing pathways, we are able to slow ageing rate, double lifespan and improves healthspan while minimize developmental and fitness trade-offs. Moreover, we established that there is no synergistic benefit in a daf-2 or daf-7 background, implying the involvement of the TGF{beta} and IGF pathways in this synergy. Employing lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis we found lipid metabolism to be affected resulting in increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and decrease membrane peroxidation index. Our best drug combination showed a conserved lifespan extension in fruit flies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest lifespan effect ever reported for any adult-onset drug treatment in C. elegans. This drug-repurposing approach, using drugs already approved for humans to target multiple conserved aging pathways simultaneously, could lead to interventions that prevent age-related diseases and overall frailty in a rapidly ageing population.",

The challenges originate from the hierarchical levels of protein abundance data and interactions between clinical study design and experimental design. The non-random missingness of the measurements from a vast amount of information also adds complexity in data analysis. We propose multivariate multilevel models to analyse protein abundances and to handle abundance-dependent missingness within a Bayesian framework. The proposed model enables the variance decomposition at different levels of the data hierarchy and provides shrinkage of protein-level estimates for a group of proteins. A logistic missingness and censored model with informative prior is used to handle incomplete data. Hamiltonian MC/No-U-Turn Sampling and Gibb MCMC algorithms are created to derive the posterior distribution of study parameters; Hamiltonian MC is demonstrated to gain more efficiency for these high-dimensional correlated data. Improvements of the proposed missing data model is compared to the univariate mixed effect model and the multivariate-multilevel model using complete data in a simulated study and a clinical proteomics study. The proposed model framework can be used in other types of data with similar structure and Non Random Missingness mechanism (MNAR).",

Most currently available computational methods based on molecular evidence can only utilize gene expression for repositioning despite a growing interest in the epigenome in human disease. We recently described a novel repositioning method, ksRepo, that enables investigators to move beyond microarray-based gene expression and utilize a variety of other sources of molecular evidence, such as DNA methylation differences.\\n\\nMethodsWe downloaded differential DNA methylation data from two publicly available acute myeloid leukemia (AML) datasets, a cancer with known, extensive epigenomic perturbations. We consolidated CpGs-level to non-directional gene-level differential methylation using Browns correction to Fishers method. We then used ksRepo, which ignores directionality in disease- and gene-drug associations, to mine the resulting prioritized gene lists and and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) for predicted repositioning candidates.\\n\\nResultsWe successfully recovered four compounds that were significant (FDR < 0.05) in two AML datasets: cytarabine, alitretinoin, panobinostat, and progesterone. Cytarabine is the most commonly used frontline therapy for AML and alitretinoin, panobinostat, and progesterone have all been investigated for the treatment of AML.\\n\\nConclusions. Combining a method for consolidating CpG methylation to the gene level with ksRepo provides a pipeline for deriving drug repositioning hypotheses from differential DNA methylation.

We show that centrosomal microtubule nucleation is independent of Golgi activity whereas the converse is not true: nucleation on the Golgi negatively correlates with the number of centrosomes. In addition, depleting AKAP450 in cells lacking centrioles, that abolishes Golgi nucleation activity, leads to microtubule nucleation from numerous cytoplasmic Golgi-unbound acentriolar structures containing Pericentrin, CDK5Rap2 and y-tubulin. Strikingly, centrosome-less cells display twice higher microtubule density than normal cells, suggesting that the centrosome controls the spatial distribution of microtubules, not only by nucleating them, but also by acting as a negative regulator of alternative MTOCs. Collectively, the data reveals a hierarchical control of microtubule nucleation, with the centrosome regulating this process in a more complex manner than usually thought. It also unveils mechanisms that could help understanding MT network reorganization during cell differentiation.",

Due to the strong increase in the number of genome sequences, an overview of the genomic diversity of many natural strains from individual species could be gained.

We designed, generated and validated the markers using the kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) technology and made all 140SNPvCol marker assays publicly available through a service provider. Through the integration of available genomic SNP allele information of 1,135 accessions, we found that 120 of these 140 markers could detect non-reference alleles in 647 accessions and more than 100 markers showed non-reference alleles in 1,094 accessions. We further show that the marker set can be used for the verification or identification of accessions of unknown identity.

    "abstract": "Background: Cyrtotrachelus buqueti is a forest pest that severely damages bamboo shoots. Reducing the population of this insect involves complex mechanisms and is dependent on diverse gene expression influenced by environmental factors.\\n\\nMethods: In this study, samples from two regions of China, Muchuan in Sichuan Province and Chishui in Guizhou Province, were investigated through RNA-seq to explore the causes and molecular mechanisms underlying the population reduction of this species. Environmental factors, such as temperature, heavy metal content, and pH, may affect the reduced population of C. buqueti in Chishui.\\n\\nResults: Approximately 44 million high-quality reads were generated, and 94.2% of the data were mapped to the transcriptome. A total of 15,641 out of the 29,406 identified genes were predicted. Moreover, 348 genes were differentially expressed between the two groups of imagoes and included 77 upregulated and 271 downregulated UniGenes. The functional analysis showed that these genes were significantly enriched in ribosome and metabolic pathway categories. The candidate genes, which contributed to C. Buqueti reduction, included 41 genes involved in the ribosome constitution category, five genes in the one-carbon pool pathway by folate category, and five heat shock protein genes.\\n\\nConclusions: Downregulation of these candidate genes seems to have impaired metabolic processes, such as protein, DNA, RNA, and purine synthesis, as well as carbon and folate metabolism, and finally resulted in the observed reduced population of C. buqueti. Furthermore, temperature, heavy metal content, and pH might influence the population by altering the expressions of genes involved in these metabolic processes.",

    "abstract": "Accurate annotation of all protein-coding sequences (CDSs) is an essential prerequisite to fully exploit the rapidly growing repertoire of completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. However, large discrepancies among the number of CDSs annotated by different resources, missed functional short open reading frames (sORFs), and overprediction of spurious ORFs represent serious limitations.\\n\\nOur strategy towards accurate and complete genome annotation consolidates CDSs from multiple reference annotation resources, ab initio gene prediction algorithms and in silico ORFs in an integrated proteogenomics database (iPtgxDB) that covers the entire protein-coding potential of a prokaryotic genome. By extending the PeptideClassifier concept of unambiguous peptides for prokaryotes, close to 95% of the identifiable peptides imply one distinct protein, largely simplifying downstream analysis. Searching a comprehensive Bartonella henselae proteomics dataset against such an iPtgxDB allowed us to unambiguously identify novel ORFs uniquely predicted by each resource, including lipoproteins, differentially expressed and membrane-localized proteins, novel start sites and wrongly annotated pseudogenes. Most novelties were confirmed by targeted, parallel reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, including unique ORFs and variants identified in a re-sequenced laboratory strain that are not present in its reference genome. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy for genomes with varying GC content and distinct taxonomic origin, and release iPtgxDBs for B. henselae, Bradyrhozibium diazoefficiens and Escherichia coli as well as the software to generate such proteogenomics search databases for any prokaryote.",

The bacterial Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) generates the force needed for protein translocation by the contraction of a long polymer called sheath, which is composed of interconnected VipA/VipB subunits forming a six-start helix. The mechanism of T6SS sheath contraction and the structure of its extended state are unknown. Here we show that elongating the N-terminal VipA linker or eliminating charge of a specific VipB residue abolished sheath contraction and delivery of effectors into target cells. The assembly of the non-contractile sheaths was dependent on the baseplate component TssE and mass-spectrometry analysis identified Hcp, VgrG and other components of the T6SS baseplate specifically associated with stable non-contractile sheaths. The ability to lock T6SS in the pre-firing state opens new possibilities for understanding its mode of action.",

    "abstract": "Animals respond to predators by altering their behavior and physiological states, but the underlying signaling mechanisms are poorly understood. Using the interactions between Caenorhabditis elegans and its predator, Pristionchus pacificus, we show that neuronal perception by C. elegans of a predator-specific molecular signature induces instantaneous escape behavior and a prolonged reduction in oviposition. Chemical analysis revealed this predator-specific signature to consist of a class of sulfolipids, produced by a biochemical pathway required for developing predacious behavior and specifically induced by starvation. These sulfolipids are detected by four pairs of C. elegans amphid sensory neurons that act redundantly and recruit cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) or transient receptor potential (TRP) channels to drive both escape and reduced oviposition. Specific abolishment of predator-evoked C. elegans responses by the anti-anxiety drug sertraline as well as functional homology of the delineated signaling pathways suggests a conserved or convergent strategy for managing predator threats.",

    "abstract": "Fast-rising sensory events evoke a series of functionally heterogeneous event-related potentials (ERPs). Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz is known to induce a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves, which are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality7, provided that they are salient and behaviourally-relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensor)7 components of ERls has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive A {beta} or nociceptive A5 afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralised and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralised sensory waves habituate across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the vertex waves: this decay function is characterised by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralised waves and vertex waves are obligator}7 components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance statementOur results provide a functional characterization of the decay of the different ERP components when identical somatosensory (nociceptive and non-nociceptive) stimuli are repeated at 1Hz. East-rising stimuli elicit ERPs obligator)7 contributed by both early lateralised components and late vertex components, even when stimulus repetition minimizes stimulus relevance. This challenges the view that lateralised waves are not obligatorily elicited by nociceptive stimuli. Furthermore, the lateralised and vertex waves habituate to stimulus repetition following similar decay functions, which are unlikely explained in terms of fatigue or adaptation of skin receptors.",

    "abstract": "The rules by which neurons in neocortex choose their synaptic partners are not fully understood. In sensory cortex, intermingled neurons encode different attributes of sensory inputs and relay them to different long-range targets. While neurons with similar responses to sensory stimuli make connections preferentially, the relationship between synaptic connectivity within an area and long-range projection target remains unclear. We examined the local connectivity and visual responses of primary visual cortex neurons projecting to anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM) higher visual areas in mice. Although the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons projecting to different targets were often similar, they avoided making connections with each other. Thus, projection target acts independently of response similarity to constrain local synaptic connectivity of cortical neurons. We propose that this segregated connectivity rule reduces the crosstalk between different populations of projection neurons, allowing top-down signal to modulate the activity of these output channels independently.",

An important mechanism mediating this neural regulation of brain cancer is activity-dependent cleavage and secretion of the synaptic molecule and glioma mitogen neuroligin-3 (Nlgn3), but the therapeutic potential of targeting Nlgn3 in glioma remains to be defined. We demonstrate a striking dependence of HGG growth on microenvironmental Nlgn3 and determine a targetable mechanism of secretion. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts of pediatric glioblastoma, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and adult glioblastoma fail to grow in Nlgn3 knockout mice. Glioma exposure to Nlgn3 results in numerous signaling consequences, including early focal adhesion kinase activation upstream of PI3K-mTOR. Nlgn3 is cleaved from both neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells via the ADAM10 sheddase. Administration of ADAM10 inhibitors robustly blocks HGG xenograft growth. This work defines the therapeutic potential of and a promising strategy for targeting Nlgn3 secretion in the glioma microenvironment, which could prove transformative for treatment of HGG.",

The morphospace allows us to identify the key variations in healthy fMRI networks in terms of their underlying motifs and we observe that two principal components (PCs) can account for 97% of the motif variability. The first PC corresponds to the small-world axis and correlates strongly with the networks global efficiency. There is also some evidence that PC1 correlates with the average length of the 5% of longest edges in the network. Hence this axis represents the trade-off between the cost of long distance edges and their topological benefits. The second PC correlates with the networks assortativity. Finally, we show that the economical clustering generative model proposed by Vertes et al. can approximately reproduce the motif PC space of the real fMRI brain networks, in contrast to other generative models. Overall, the motif morphospace provides a powerful way to visualise the relationships between network properties and to study the driving forces behind the topology of fMRI brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated uterine contractions at the end of gestation are essential for delivering viable offspring in mammals. Contractions are initiated by an electrical signal at the plasma membrane of uterine muscle cells, leading to voltage-dependent calcium entry, and subsequent activation of the intracellular contractile machinery. In contrast to other visceral smooth muscles, it is not known where excitation within the uterus is initiated, and no defined pacemaking region has hitherto been identified. Using a combination of multi-electrode array recordings and high-resolution computational reconstruction of the three-dimensional micro-structure of late pregnant rat uterus, we demonstrate that electrical potentials are initiated in distinct structures within the placental bed of individual implantation sites. These previously unidentified structures represent modified smooth muscle bundles that are derived from bridges between the longitudinal and circular layers. Coordinated implantation and encapsulation by invading trophoblast give rise to isolated placental/myometrial interface bundles that directly connect to the overlying longitudinal smooth muscle layer. Furthermore, the numerous bridge structures co-localise with the vascular network located between the longitudinal and circular layers. Taken together, these observations imply that the anatomical structure of the uterus, combined with site-specific implantation, gives rise to emergent patterns of electrical activity that drive effective contractility during parturition. The identification of the pacemaking zones of the uterus has important consequences for the treatment of disorders of parturition such as preterm labor, postpartum hemorrhage and uterine dystocia.",

Here, we extend the framework of widely-used estimation methods for C3 plants to build estimation tools by exclusively fitting intensive A/Ci curves (6-8 more sampling points) for C4 using three versions of photosynthesis models with different assumptions about carbonic anhydrase processes and ATP distribution. We use simulation-analysis, out-of-sample tests, existing in vitro measurements and chlorophyll-fluorescence-measurements to validate the new estimation methods. Of the five/six photosynthetic parameters obtained, sensitivity analyses show that maximal-Rubisco-carboxylation-rate, electron-transport-rate, maximal-PEP-carboxylation-rate and carbonic-anhydrase were robust to variation in the input parameters, while day-respiration and mesophyll-conductance varied. Our method provides a way to estimate carbonic anhydrase activity, a new parameter, from A/Ci curves, yet also shows that models that do not explicitly consider carbonic anhydrase yield approximate results. The two photosynthesis models, differing in whether ATP could freely transport between RuBP and PEP regeneration processes yielded consistent results under high light, but they may diverge under low light intensities. Modeling results show selection for Rubisco of low specificity and high catalytic rate, low leakage of bundle sheath and high PEPC affinity, which may further increase C4 efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic electron flow (CEF), one of the major alternative electron transport pathways to the primary linear electron flow (LEF) in chloroplasts has been discovered in the middle of the last century. It is defined as a return of the reductants from the acceptor side of the Photosystem I (PSI) to the pool of its donors via the cytochrome b6f, and has proven essential for photosynthesis. However, despite many efforts aimed at its characterisation, the pathway and regulation of CEF remain equivocal, and its physiological significance remains to be properly defined. Here we use novel spectroscopic approaches to measure CEF in transitory conditions in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that CEF operates at the same maximal rate regardless of the oxygen concentration, and that the latter influences LEF, rather than CEF in vivo, which questions the recent hypotheses about the CEF supercomplex formation. We further reveal that the pathways proposed for CEF in the literature are inconsistent with the kinetic information provided by our measurements. We finally provide cues on the regulation of CEF by light.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis, a manifestation of the bodys inflammatory response to injury and infection, has a mortality rate of between 28%-50% and affects approximately 1 million patients annually in the United States. Currently, there are no therapies targeting the cellular/molecular processes driving sepsis that have demonstrated the ability to control this disease process in the clinical setting. We propose that this is in great part due to the considerable heterogeneity of the clinical trajectories that constitute clinical \\\"sepsis,\\\" and that determining how this system can be controlled back into a state of health requires the application of concepts drawn from the field of dynamical systems. In this work, we consider the human immune system to be a random dynamical system, and investigate its potential controllability using an agent-based model of the innate immune response (the Innate Immune Response ABM or IIRABM) as a surrogate, proxy system. Simulation experiments with the IIRABM provide an explanation as to why single/limited cytokine perturbations at a single, or small number of, time points is unlikely to significantly improve the mortality rate of sepsis. We then use genetic algorithms (GA) to explore and characterize multi-targeted control strategies for the random dynamical immune system that guide it from a persistent, non-recovering inflammatory state (functionally equivalent to the clinical states of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis) to a state of health. We train the GA on a single parameter set with multiple stochastic replicates, and show that while the calculated results show good generalizability, more advanced strategies are needed to achieve the goal of adaptive personalized medicine. This work evaluating the extent of interventions needed to control a simplified surrogate model of sepsis provides insight into the scope of the clinical challenge, and can serve as a guide on the path towards true \\\"precision control\\\" of sepsis.\\n\\nAuthor summarySepsis, characterized by the bodys inflammatory response to injury and infection, has a mortality rate of between 28%-50% and affects approximately 1 million patients annually in the United States. Currently, there are no therapies targeting the cellular/molecular processes driving sepsis that have demonstrated the ability to control this disease process. In this work, we utilize a computational model of the human immune response to infectious injury to offer an explanation as to why previously attempted treatment strategies are inadequate and why the current approach to drug/therapy-development is inadequate. We then use evolutionary computation algorithms to explore drug-intervention space using this same computational model. This allows us to characterize the scale and scope of interventions needed to successfully control sepsis, as well as the types of data needed to derive these interventions. We demonstrate that multi-point and time-dependent varying controls are necessary and able to control the cytokine network dynamics of the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Each individual perceives the world in a unique way, but little is known about the genetic basis of variation in sensory perception. Here we investigated natural variation in the development and function of the color vision system of Drosophila. In the fly eye, the random mosaic of color-detecting R7 photoreceptor subtypes is determined by stochastic expression of the transcription factor Spineless (Ss). Individual R7s randomly choose between SsON or SsOFF fates at a ratio of 65:35, resulting in unique patterns but consistent proportions of cell types across genetically identical retinas. In a genome wide association study, we identified a naturally occurring insertion in a regulatory DNA element in the ss gene that lowers the ratio of SsON to SsOFF cells. This change in photoreceptor fates shifts the innate color preference of flies from green to blue. The genetic variant increases the binding affinity for Klumpfuss (Klu), a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that regulates ss expression. Klu is expressed at intermediate levels to determine the normal ratio of SsON to SsOFF cells. Thus, binding site affinity and transcription factor levels are finely tuned to regulate stochastic on/off gene expression, setting the ratio of alternative cell fates and ultimately determining color preference.",

    "abstract": "Molecular chaperones have evolved to facilitate folding of proteins and RNA in vivo where spontaneous self-assembly is sometimes prohibited. Folding of Tetrahymena ribozyme, assisted by the RNA chaperone CYT-19, surprisingly shows that at physiological Mg2+ ion concentrations, increasing the chaperone concentration reduces the yield of native ribozymes. In contrast, the more extensively investigated protein chaperone GroEL works in exactly the opposite manner--the yield of native substrate increases with the increase in chaperone concentration. Thus, the puzzling observation on the assisted-ribozyme folding seems to contradict the expectation that a molecular chaperone acts as an efficient annealing machine. We suggest a resolution to this apparently paradoxical behavior by developing a minimal stochastic model that captures the essence of the Iterative Annealing Mechanism (IAM), providing a unified description of chaperone mediated-folding of proteins and RNA. Our theory provides a general relation involving the kinetic rates of the system, which quantitatively predicts how the yield of native state depends on chaperone concentration. By carefully analyzing a host of experimental data on Tetrahymena (and its mutants) as well as the protein Rubisco and Malate Dehydrogenase, we show that although the absolute yield of native states decreases in the ribozyme, the rate of native state production increases in both the cases. By utilizing energy from ATP hydrolysis, both CYT-19 and GroEL drive their substrate concentrations far out of equilibrium, in an endeavor to maximize the native yield in a short time. Our findings are consistent with the general expectation that proteins or RNA need to be folded by the cellular machinery on biologically relevant timescales, even if the final yield is lower than what equilibrium thermodynamics would dictate. Besides establishing the IAM as the basis for functions of RNA and protein chaperones, our work shows that cellular copy numbers have been adjusted to optimize the rate of native state production of the folded states of RNA and proteins under physiological conditions.\\n\\nSignificance statementMolecular chaperones have evolved to assist the folding of proteins and RNA, thus avoiding the deleterious consequences of misfolding. Thus, it is expected that increasing chaperone concentration should lead to an enhancement in native yield. While this has been observed in GroEL-mediated protein folding, experiments on Tetrahymena ribozyme folding assisted by CYT-19, surprisingly show the opposite trend. Here, we reconcile these divergent experimental observations by developing a unified stochastic model of chaperone assisted protein and RNA folding. We show that chaperones drive their substrates out of equilibrium, and in the process maximize the rate of native substrate production rather than the absolute yield or the folding rate. In vivo the number of chaperones is regulated to optimize their functions.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma cells steer out of tumours using self-generated lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) gradients. The cells break down LPA, which is present at high levels around the tumours, creating a dynamic gradient that is low in the tumour and high outside. They then also migrate up this gradient, creating a complex and evolving outward chemotactic stimulus. Here we introduce a new assay for self-generated chemotaxis, and show that raising LPA levels causes a delay in migration rather than loss of chemotactic efficiency. Knockdown of the lipid phosphatase LPP3 - but not its homologues LPP1 or LPP2 - diminishes the cells ability to break down LPA. This is specific for chemotactically active LPAs, such as the 18:1 and 20:4 species. Inhibition of autotaxin-mediated LPA production does not diminish outward chemotaxis, but loss of LPP3-mediated LPA breakdown blocks it. Similarly, in both 2D and 3D invasion assays, knockdown of LPP3 diminishes melanoma cells ability to invade. Our results demonstrate that LPP3 is the key enzyme in melanoma cells breakdown of LPA, and confirm the importance of attractant breakdown in LPAmediated cell steering.",

In multiciliated cells (MCCs), apical actin forms a lattice that drives expansion of the cell surface necessary to host hundreds of cilia. The actin lattice also uniformly distributes basal bodies across this surface. This apical actin network is dynamically remodeled, but the molecules that regulate its architecture remain poorly understood. We identify the chromatin modifier, WDR5, as a regulator of apical F-actin in multiciliated cells. Unexpectedly, WDR5 functions independently of chromatin modification in MCCs. Instead, we discover a scaffolding role for WDR5 between the basal body and F-actin. Specifically, WDR5 binds to basal bodies and migrates apically, where F-actin organizes around WDR5. Using a monomer trap for G-actin, we show that WDR5 stabilizes F-actin to maintain apical lattice architecture. In summary, we identify a novel, non-chromatin role for WDR5 in stabilizing F-actin in multiciliated cells.\\n\\nIN BRIEFKulkarni et al discover a chromatin independent function for WDR5 in multiciliated cell formation.

This chordate subphylum contains a particularly diverse range of reproductive methods, regenerative abilities and life-history strategies. Consequently, tunicates provide an extraordinary perspective into the emergence and diversity of chordate traits. To gain further insights into the evolution of the tunicate phylum, we have sequenced the genome of the colonial Stolidobranchian Botrylloides leachii.\\n\\nWe have produced a high-quality (90 % BUSCO genes) 159 Mb assembly, containing 82 % of the predicted total 194 Mb genomic content. The B. leachii genome is much smaller than that of Botryllus schlosseri (725 Mb), but comparable to those of Ciona robusta and Molgula oculata (both 160 Mb). We performed an orthologous clustering between five tunicate genomes that highlights sets of genes specific to some species, including a large group unique to colonial ascidians with gene ontology terms including cell communication and immune response.\\n\\nBy analysing the structure and composition of the conserved gene clusters, we identified many examples of multiple cluster breaks and gene dispersion, suggesting that several lineage-specific genome rearrangements occurred during tunicate evolution. In addition, we investigate lineage-specific gene gain and loss within the Wnt, Notch and retinoic acid pathways. Such examples of genetic change within these highly evolutionary conserved pathways commonly associated with regeneration and development may underlie some of the diverse regenerative abilities observed in the tunicate subphylum. These results supports the widely held view that tunicate genomes are evolving particularly rapidly.",

In this study, we analyzed the impact of providing antibiotic feed additives to feedlot cattle using metagenome sequencing of treated and untreated animals. Our results indicate that use of antibiotic feed additives does not produce discernable changes at the phylum level however treated cattle had reduced the abundance of gram-positive bacteria at the genus level. The abundance of Ruminococcus, Erysipelotrichaceae and Lachanospira in the gut of treated steers was reduced. This may impact the ability of these animals to exclude pathogens from the gut. However, our results did not show any correlation between the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in the gut microbiota and the administration of antibiotic feed additives.",

We discovered that dark onset resulted in 75-95 Hz retinal activity that we call the dark retinal oscillatory potential, occurring with the same latency as the analogous but more broadband (55-195 Hz) oscillatory potential at light onset. Both retinal oscillations coupled with subsequent cortical activity of corresponding bandwidths, but cortical responses for darks indeed occurred earlier than for lights. Darks therefore propagate from retina to cortex more quickly than lights, potentially resulting from a thalamic advantage.

    "abstract": "The brain represents visual objects with topographic cortical patterns. To address how distributed visual representations enable object categorization, we established predictive encoding models based on a deep residual neural network, and trained them to predict cortical responses to natural movies. Using this predictive model, we mapped human cortical representations to 64,000 visual objects from 80 categories with high throughput and accuracy. Such representations covered both the ventral and dorsal pathways, reflected multiple levels of object features, and preserved semantic relationships between categories. In the entire visual cortex, object representations were modularly organized into three categories: biological objects, non-biological objects, and background scenes. In a finer scale specific to each module, object representations revealed sub-modules for further categorization. These findings suggest that increasingly more specific category is represented by cortical patterns in progressively finer spatial scales. Such a nested hierarchy may be a fundamental principle for the brain to categorize visual objects with various levels of specificity, and can be explained and differentiated by object features at different levels.",

    "abstract": "In this study, water deficit stress (WDS)-tolerance in several cultivars of grain amaranth species (Amaranthus hypochondriacus [Ahypo], A. cruentus [Acru] and A. caudatus [Acau]), in addition to A. hybridus (Ahyb), an ancestral amaranth, was examined. Ahypo was the most WDS-tolerant species, whereas Acau and Ahyb were WDS-sensitive. Data revealed that the differential WDS tolerance observed was multifactorial. It involved increased proline and raffinose (Raf) in leaves and/ or roots. Higher foliar Raf coincided with induced Galactinol synthase 1 (AhGolS1) and Raffinose synthase (AhRafS) expression. Unknown compounds, possibly larger RFOs, also accumulated in leaves of WDS-tolerant amaranths, which had high Raf/ Verbascose ratios. Distinct nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) accumulation patterns were observed in tolerant species under WDS and recovery, such as: i) high Hex/ Suc ratios in roots coupled to increased cell wall and vacuolar invertase and sucrose synthase activities; ii) a severer depletion of starch reserves; iii) lower NSC content in leaves, and iv) higher basal hexose levels in roots which further increased under WDS. WDS-marker gene expression patterns proposed a link between amaranths WDS tolerance and abscisic acid-dependent signaling. Results obtained also suggest that AhTRE, AhTPS9, AhTPS11, AhGolS1 and AhRafS are reliable gene markers of WDS tolerance in amaranth.\\n\\nHighlightDifferential water deficit stress tolerance in grain amaranths and their ancestor, Amaranthus hybridus, is a multifactorial process involving various biochemical changes and modified expression patterns of key stress-related genes.",

    "abstract": "The RAS GTPases are among the best-understood oncogenes that promote human cancer. Many have argued that non-mutated, wild-type, RAS also functions as a tumor suppressor. The arguments for RAS tumor suppressor activity often involve data that are claimed to be inconsistent with known principles of RAS biology. RAS tumor suppressor activity is invoked to explain these observations. Here, we consider an alternative hypothesis: these data are actually consistent with RAS biology. We investigate by using our previously developed mathematical model of RAS regulation. We find that three of five arguments for RAS having tumor suppressor activity are based upon data that the model demonstrates are actually consistent with known RAS biology. We also find that the other two types of data interpreted to indicate a tumor suppressor effect can be explained by our model with the additional assumption that RAS protein expression does not vary proportionally with gene dosage. Measurements of RAS protein expression as a function of gene dosage could help resolve whether or not RAS has tumor suppressor activity. Overall, we conclude that the evidence for RAS having tumor suppressor activity is much less strong that it has appeared.",

Herein, we describe a Neurog3-driven FUCCI cell-cycle reporter (Neurog3P2A.FUCCI) derived from a Neurog3 BAC transgenic reporter that functions as a loxed cassette acceptor (LCA). In cycling Sox9+ Neurog3TA.LO progenitors, the majority of cells in S-G2-M phases have undetectable levels of Neurog3 with increased expression of endocrine progenitor markers, while those in G1 have low Neurog3 levels with increased expression of endocrine differentiation markers.

    "abstract": "An emerging realisation of infectious disease is the high incidence of genetic instability resulting from pathogen-induced DNA lesions, often leading to classical hallmarks of cancer such as evasion of apoptosis. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) induces apoptosis in CD4+ T cells but is largely non-cytopathic in macrophages, thereby leading to long-term dissemination of the pathogen specifically by these host cells. Apoptosis is triggered by double-strand breaks (DSBs), such as those induced by integrating retroviruses, and is coordinated by the p53-regulated long noncoding RNA lincRNA-p21, in a complex with its protein binding partners HuR and hnRNP-K. Here, we monitor the cellular response to infection to determine how HIV-1 induces DSBs in macrophages yet evades apoptosis in these cells. We show that the virus does so by securing the pro-survival MAP2K1/ERK2 cascade early upon entry, in a gp120-dependent manner, to orchestrate a complex dysregulation of lincRNA-p21. By sequestering HuR in the nucleus, HIV-1 enables lincRNA-p21 degradation. Simultaneously, the virus permits transcription of pro-survival genes by sequestering hnRNP-K in the cytoplasm via the MAP2K1/ERK2 pathway. Notably, this pro-survival cascade is unavailable for similar viral manipulation in CD4+ T cells. The introduction of MAP2K1, ERK2 or HDM2 inhibitors in HIV-infected macrophages results in apoptosis providing strong evidence that the viral-mediated apoptotic block can be released, specifically by restoring the nuclear interaction of lincRNA-p21 and hnRNP-K. These results reveal pathogenic control of apoptosis and DNA damage via a host long noncoding RNA, and present MAP2K1/ERK2 inhibitors as a novel therapeutic intervention strategy for HIV-1 infection in macrophages.",

The transcriptional regulatory mechanisms required to learn and transition between these strategies are unknown. Here we identified a critical negative regulator of habit learning. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition following instrumental conditioning accelerated habitual control of behavior. HDAC3, a transcriptional repressor, was removed from the promoters of learning-related genes in the dorsal striatum as habits formed with overtraining and with post-training HDAC inhibition. Decreasing HDAC3 function in the DLS accelerated habit formation, while DLS HDAC3 overexpression prevented habit. HDAC3 activity in the DMS was also found to constrain habit formation. These results challenge the strict dissociation between DMS and DLS function in goal-directed v. habitual behavioral control and identify dorsal striatal HDAC3 as a critical molecular substrate of the transition to habit.",

    "abstract": "The RAS proteins (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS) play important roles in multiple diseases. This includes many types of cancer and the developmental syndromes collectively referred to as the RASopathies. There are many different RAS mutants that are found to drive these diseases. Mutant-to-mutant differences pose a challenge for personalized medicine. To investigate this problem, we extend our previously developed model of oncogenic RAS mutants to a total of 16 oncogenic mutants. We also extend our model to RASopathy associated mutants using data for 14 such RAS mutants. The model finds that the known biochemical defects of these mutants are typically sufficient to explain their elevated levels of RAS signaling. In general, our analysis finds that the oncogenic mutants are stronger than the RASopathy mutants. However, the model suggests that RAS signal intensities are spanned by the pathological variants; there does not appear to be a perfect separation between cancer promoting and developmental syndrome promoting mutants. Analysis of the panel also finds that the relative strengths of pathological RAS mutants is not absolute, but rather can vary depending on context. We discuss implications of this finding for personalized cancer medicine and for medical genetics. As genomics permeates clinical medicine, computational models that can resolve mutant specific differences, like the one presented here, may be useful for augmenting clinical thinking with their ability to logically translate biochemical knowledge into system level outputs of perceived clinical relevance.",

To understand how balance between SCPs controls the dynamics of whole cell responses we studied neurite outgrowth in rat primary cortical neurons in culture. We used a combination of dynamical models and experiments to understand the conditions that permitted growth at a specified velocity and when aberrant growth could lead to the formation of dystrophic bulbs. We hypothesized that dystrophic bulb formation is due to quantitative imbalances between SCPs. Simulations predict redundancies between lower level sibling SCPs within each type of high level SCP. In contrast, higher level SCPs, such as vesicle transport and exocytosis or microtubule growth characteristic of each type need to be strictly coordinated with each other and imbalances result in stalling of neurite outgrowth. From these simulations, we predicted the effect of changing the activities of SCPs involved in vesicle exocytosis or microtubule growth could lead to formation of dystrophic bulbs. siRNA ablation experiments verified these predictions. We conclude that whole cell dynamics requires balance between the higher-level SCPs involved and imbalances can terminate whole cell responses such as neurite outgrowth.",

    "abstract": "Socially appropriate behavior involves learning actions that are valued by others and those that have a social cost. Facial expressions are one way that others can signal the social value of our actions. The rewarding or aversive properties of signals such as smiles or frowns also evoke automatic approach or avoidance behaviors in receivers, and a Pavlovian system learns cues that predict rewarding or aversive outcomes. In this study, we examined the computational and neural mechanisms underlying interactions between Pavlovian and Instrumental systems during social reinforcement learning. We found that Pavlovian biases to approach cues predicting social reward and avoid cues predicting social punishment interfered with Instrumental learning from social feedback. While the computations underlying Pavlovian and Instrumental interactions remained the same as when learning from monetary feedback, Pavlovian biases from social outcomes to approach or withdraw were not significantly correlated with biases from money. Trial-by-trial measures of alpha (8-14Hz) EEG power was associated with suppression of Pavlovian bias to social outcomes, while suppression of bias from money was associated with theta (4-7Hz) EEG power. Our findings demonstrate how emotional reactions to feedback from others are balanced with the instrumental value of that feedback to guide social behavior.\\n\\nSignificance statementA smile from another can be a signal to continue what we are doing, while an angry scowl is a sure sign to stop. Feedback from others such as this plays an important role in shapeing social behavior. The rewarding nature of a smile (or the aversive nature of a scowl) can also lead to automatic tendencies to approach (or avoid), and we can learn situations that predict positive or negative social outcomes. In this study, we examined the brain mechanisms that come into play when the instrumental demands of a situation are in conflict with our automatic biases to approach or withdraw, such as when we have to approach someone who is scowling at us or withdraw from someone who is smiling.",

Our results reveal a sequence of separate but overlapping task-related processes spread across frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex. Task exhibited late effects on object processing by selectively enhancing task-relevant object features, with limited impact on the overall pattern of object representations.

This phenomenon has broad ramifications in physiologic function. Recent work has disclosed more cycles in gene transcription, and to the uncovering of these we apply a novel signal processing methodology known as the pencil method and compare it to conventional parametric, nonparametric, and statistical methods. Methods: In order to assess periodicity of gene expression over time, we analyzed a database derived from livers of mice entrained to a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. We also analyzed artificially generated signals to identify differences between the pencil decomposition and other alternative methods.\\n\\nResultsThe pencil decomposition revealed hitherto-unsuspected oscillations in gene transcription with 12-hour periodicity. The pencil method was robust in detecting the 24-hour circadian cycle that was known to exist, as well as confirming the existence of shorter-period oscillations. A key consequence of this approach is that orthogonality of the different oscillatory components can be demonstrated. thus indicating a biological independence of these oscillations, that has been subsequently confirmed empirically by knocking out the gene responsible for the 24-hour clock.\\n\\nConclusionSystem identification techniques can be applied to biological systems and can uncover important characteristics that may elude visual inspection of the data. Significance: The pencil method provides new insights on the essence of gene expression and discloses a wide variety of oscillations in addition to the well-studied circadian pattern. This insight opens the door to the study of novel mechanisms by which oscillatory gene expression signals exert their regulatory effect on cells to influence human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mature dentate granule cells in the hippocampus receive input from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path in precisely arranged lamina, with medial entorhinal axons innervating the middle molecular layer and lateral entorhinal cortex axons innervating the outer molecular layer. Although vastly outnumbered by mature granule cells, adult-generated newborn granule cells play a unique role in hippocampal function, which has largely been attributed to their enhanced excitability and plasticity (Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004; Ge et al., 2007). Inputs from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex carry different informational content, thus the distribution of inputs onto newly integrated granules will affect their function in the circuit. Therefore we examined the functional innervation and synaptic maturation of newly-generated dentate granule cells using retroviral labeling in combination with selective optogenetic activation of medial or lateral entorhinal inputs. Our results indicate that lateral entorhinal inputs provide nearly all the functional innervation of newly integrated granule cells. Despite preferential functional targeting, the dendritic spine density of immature granule cells was not increased in the outer molecular layer compared to the middle molecular layer. However, chronic blockade of neurotransmitter release in medial entorhinal axons with tetanus toxin disrupted normal synapse development from both medial and lateral entorhinal inputs. Our results support a role for preferential lateral perforant path input onto newly generated neurons in mediating pattern separation, but also indicates that medial perforant path input is necessary for normal synaptic development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe formation of episodic memories involves the integration of contextual and spatial information. Newly integrated neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus play a critical role in this process, despite constituting only a minor fraction of total granule cells. Here we demonstrate that these neurons preferentially receive information thought to convey the context of an experience - a unique role that each newly integrated granule cell serves for about a month before reaching maturity.",

    "abstract": "The KRAS oncogene is the most common, activating, oncogenic mutation in human cancer. KRAS has proven difficult to target effectively. Two different strategies have recently been described for covalently targeting the most common activating KRAS mutant in lung cancer, KRAS G12C. Previously, we have developed a computational model of the processes that regulate Ras activation and this model has proven useful for understanding the complex behaviors of Ras signaling. Here, we use this model to perform a computational systems pharmacology analysis of KRAS G12C targeted covalent inhibitors. After updating our model to include Ras protein turnover, we verified the validity of our model for problems in this domain by comparing model behaviors with experimental behaviors. The model naturally reproduces previous experimental data, including several experimental observations that were interpreted as being contrary to conventional wisdom. Overall, this suggests that our model describes the Ras system well, including those areas where conventional wisdom struggles. We then used the model to investigate possible strategies to improve the ability of KRAS G12C inhibitors to inhibit Ras pathway signaling. We identify one, as of yet unexplored mechanism, that, if optimized, could improve the effectiveness of one class of KRAS inhibitor. We also simulated resistance to targeted therapies and found that resistance promoting mutations may reverse which class of KRAS G12C inhibitor inhibits the system better, suggesting that there may be value to pursuing both types of KRAS G12C inhibitors. Overall, this work demonstrates that systems biology approaches can provide insights that inform the drug development process.",
