    "abstract": "The dynamic organization of genes inside the nucleus is an important determinant for their function. Using ultra-fast microscopy in S. cerevisiae cells and improved analysis of mean square displacements, we quantified DNA motion at time scales ranging from 10 milliseconds to minutes and found that following DNA damage, DNA exhibits distinct sub-diffusive regimes. In response to double-strand breaks, chromatin is more mobile at large time scales but, surprisingly, its mobility is dramatically reduced at short time scales. This effect is even more pronounced at the break. Such pattern of dynamics is consistent with a global increase in chromatin persistence length following DNA damage. Scale-dependent nuclear exploration is regulated by the Rad51 repair protein, both at the break and throughout the genome. We propose a model in which stiffening of the damaged ends by the repair complex, combined with global increased stiffness, act like a \\\"needle in a decompacted ball of yarn\\\", enhancing the ability of the break to traverse the chromatin meshwork.",

    "abstract": "Here we report that the recently discovered mammalian DNA modification N6-methyl-2-deoxyadenosine (m6dA) is dynamically regulated in primary cortical neurons, and accumulates along promoters and coding sequences within the genome of activated prefrontal cortical neurons of adult C57/BI6 mice in response to fear extinction learning. The deposition of m6dA is generally associated with increased genome-wide occupancy of the mammalian m6dA methyltransferase, N6amt1, and this correlates with fear extinction learning-induced gene expression. Of particular relevance for fear extinction memory, the accumulation of m6dA is associated with an active chromatin state and the recruitment of transcriptional machinery to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) P4 promoter, which is required for Bdnf exon IV mRNA expression and for the extinction of conditioned fear. These results expand the scope of DNA modifications in the adult brain and highlight changes in m6dA as a novel neuroepigenetic mechanism associated with activity-induced gene expression and the formation of fear extinction memory.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDeleterious alleles have long been proposed to play an important role in patterning phenotypic variation and are central to commonly held ideas explaining the hybrid vigor observed in the offspring by crossing two inbred parents. We test these ideas using evolutionary measures of sequence conservation to ask whether incorporating information about putatively deleterious alleles can inform genomic selection (GS) models and improve phenotypic prediction. We measured a number of agronomic traits in both the inbred parents and hybrids of an elite maize partial diallel population and re-sequenced the parents of the population. Inbred elite maize lines vary for more than 350,000 putatively deleterious sites, but show a lower burden of such sites than a comparable set of traditional landraces. Our modeling reveals widespread evidence for incomplete dominance at these loci, and supports theoretical models that more damaging variants are usually more recessive. We identify haplotype blocks using an identity-by-decent (IBD) analysis and perform genomic prediction analyses in which we weigh blocks on the basis of segregating putatively deleterious variants. Cross-validation results show that incorporating sequence conservation in genomic selection improves prediction accuracy for grain yield and other fitness-related traits as well as heterosis for those traits. Our results provide empirical support for an important role for incomplete dominance of deleterious alleles in explaining heterosis and demonstrate the utility of incorporating functional annotation in phenotypic prediction and plant breeding.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA key long-term goal of biology is understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. Although most new mutations are likely disadvantageous, their prevalence and importance in explaining patterns of phenotypic variation is controversial and not well understood. In this study we combine whole genome-sequencing and field evaluation of a maize mapping population to investigate the contribution of deleterious mutations to phenotype. We show that a priori prediction of deleterious alleles correlates well with effect sizes for grain yield and that variants predicted to be more damaging are on average more recessive. We develop a simple model allowing for variation in the heterozygous effects of deleterious mutations and demonstrate its improved ability to predict both phenotypes and hybrid vigor. Our results help reconcile alternative explanations for hybrid vigor and highlight the use of leveraging evolutionary history to facilitate breeding for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation in collective action dilemmas usually breaks down in the absence of additional incentive mechanisms. This tragedy can be escaped if cooperators have the possibility to invest in reward funds that are shared exclusively among cooperators(prosocial rewarding). Yet, the presence of defectors who do not contribute to the public good but do reward themselves(antisocial rewarding) deters cooperation in the absence of additional countermeasures. A recent simulation study suggests that spatial structure is sufficient to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation. Here we reinvestigate this issue assuming mixed strategies and weak selection on a game-theoretic model of social interactions, which we also validate using individual-based simulations. We show that increasing reward funds facilitates the maintenance of prosocial rewarding but prevents its evolution from rare, and that spatial structure can sometimes select against the evolution of prosocial rewarding. Our results suggest that, even in spatially structured populations, additional mechanisms are required to prevent antisocial rewarding from deterring cooperation in public goods dilemmas.",

We then assessed the lack of editing efficiency in HEK293T cell line for the EMX1 endogenous locus by monitoring the NgAgo protein expression level and the editing efficiency by T7E1 assay and Sanger sequencing. We reported that the NgAgo protein was expressed from 8 hours to a maximum expression at 48 hours post-transfection, confirming the efficient delivery of the plasmid and the gDNA but no evidence of successful editing of EMX1 target in all transfected samples.

These statistics model differences in isoform usage in normal tissues, which have stable regulation of gene splicing. Pathological conditions, such as cancer, can have broken regulation of splicing that increases the heterogeneity of the expression of splice variants. Inferring events with such differential heterogeneity in gene isoform usage requires new statistical approaches.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce Splice Expression Variability Analysis (SEVA) to model increased heterogeneity of splice variant usage between conditions (e.g., tumor and normal samples). SEVA uses a rank-based multivariate statistic that compares the variability of junction expression profiles within one condition to the variability within another. Simulated data show that SEVA is unique in modeling heterogeneity of gene isoform usage, and benchmark SEVAs performance against EBSeq, DiffSplice, and rMATS that model differential isoform usage instead of heterogeneity. We confirm the accuracy of SEVAin identifying known splice variants in head and neck cancer and perform cross-study validation of novel splice variants. A novel comparison of splice variant heterogeneity between subtypes of head and neck cancer demonstrated unanticipated similarity between the heterogeneity of gene isoform usage in HPV-positive and HPV-negative subtypes and anticipated increased heterogeneity among HPV-negative samples with mutations in genes that regulate the splice variant machinery.\\n\\nConclusionThese results show that SEVA accurately models differential heterogeneity of gene isoform usage from RNA-seq data.\\n\\nAvailabilitySEVA is implemented in the R/Bioconductor package GSReg.\\n\\nContactbahman@jhu.edu, favorov@sensi.org, ejfertig@jhmi.edu",

The molecular mechanism involves trapping of lipid acyl chains on the rough surface and segregation of cholesterol from the vicinity of peptides.

The mouse Y chromosome is unique among mammalian Y chromosomes characterized to date in that it is large, gene-rich and euchromatic. Yet little is known about its diversity in natural populations. Here we take advantage of published whole-genome sequencing data to survey the diversity of sequence and copy number of sex-linked genes in three subspecies of house mice. Copy number of genes on the repetitive long arm of both sex chromosomes is highly variable, but sequence diversity in non-repetitive regions is decreased relative to expectations based on autosomes. We use simulations and theory to show that this reduction in sex-linked diversity is incompatible with neutral demographic processes alone, but is consistent with recent positive selection on genes active during spermatogenesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the mouse sex chromosomes are engaged in ongoing intragenomic conflict.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenetic processes demand the coordinated allocation of cells and tissues to their final destination in a spatio-temporal controlled way. Identifying how these morphogenetic movements are directed and implemented is essential for understanding morphogenesis. Topographical and scalar differences in adhesion and contractility within and between cells are essential, yet, the role that membrane remodeling may play remains less clear. To clarify how surface turnover and dynamics may modulate tissue arrangements we studied epiboly in the zebrafish. During epiboly the blastoderm expands as a result of an asymmetry of mechanical tension along the embryo surface. In this scenario, we found that the membrane removal by macropinocytosis of the external yolk cell syncytial layer (E-YSL) ahead of the blastoderm is key for epiboly progression In early zebrafish embryos, the activity of the GTPase Rab5ab was essential for endocytosis, and interference in its expression exclusively in the yolk cell resulted in the reduction of yolk cell actomyosin contractility, the disruption of cortical and internal yolk flows, a disequilibrium in force balance and as a result epiboly impairment. We conclude that regulated membrane remodeling is crucial for directing cell and tissue mechanics and coordinating morphogenetic movements during epiboly.",

We find that all methods have high accuracy (~92% - 99%) when detecting first and second degree relationships, but their accuracy dwindles to less than 43% for seventh degree relationships. However, most IBD segment-based methods inferred seventh degree relatives correct to within one relatedness degree for more than 76% of relative pairs. Overall, the most accurate methods are ERSA and approaches that compute total IBD sharing using the output from GERMLINE and Refined IBD to infer relatedness. Combining information from the most accurate methods provides little accuracy improvement, indicating that novel approaches--such as new methods that leverage relatedness signals from multiple samples--are needed to achieve a sizeable jump in performance.",

Although the positioning of this boundary is critical for leaf morphogenesis, how the boundary is established and how it influences development remains unclear. Using live-imaging and perturbation experiments we show that leaf orientation, morphology and position are pre-patterned by HD-ZIPIII and KAN gene expression in the shoot, leading to a model in which dorsoventral genes coordinate to regulate plant development by localizing auxin response between their expression domains. However we also find that auxin levels feedback on dorsoventral patterning by spatially organizing HD-ZIPIII and KAN expression in the shoot periphery. By demonstrating that the regulation of these genes by auxin also governs their response to wounds, our results also provide a parsimonious explanation for the influence of wounds on leaf dorsoventrality.\\n\\nOnce sentence summaryCell type boundaries regulate plant development",

    "abstract": "Most human genes have multiple transcription start and polyadenylation sites, as well as alternatively spliced exons. Although such transcript isoform diversity contributes to the differentiation between cell types, the importance of contributions from the different isoform generating processes is unclear. To address this question, we used 798 samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to investigate cell type dependent differences in exon usage of over 18,000 protein-coding genes in 23 cell types. We found tissue-dependent isoform usage in about half of expressed genes. Overall, tissue-dependent splicing accounted only for a minority of tissue-dependent exon usage, most of which was consistent with alternative transcription start and termination sites. We verified this result on a second, independent dataset, Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) data from the FANTOM consortium, which confirmed widespread tissue-dependent usage of alternative transcription start sites. Our analysis identifies transcription start and termination sites as the principal drivers of isoform diversity across tissues. Moreover, our results indicate that most tissue-dependent splicing involves untranslated exons and therefore may not have consequences at the proteome level.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian clock is a critical regulator of metabolism and cell division. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that systemic disruption of the circadian clock can promote cancer, whether the clock is disrupted in primary human tumors is unknown. Here we used transcriptome data from mice to define a signature of the mammalian circadian clock based on the co-expression of 12 genes that form the core clock or are directly controlled by the clock. Our approach can be applied to samples that are not labeled with time of day and were not acquired over the entire circadian (24-h) cycle. We validated the clock signature in transcriptome data from healthy human tissues, then developed a metric we call the delta clock correlation distance ({Delta}CCD) to describe the extent to which the signature is perturbed in samples from one condition relative to another. We calculated the {Delta}CCD comparing human tumor and non-tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and eight independent datasets, discovering widespread dysregulation of clock gene co-expression in tumor samples. Subsequent analysis of data from clock gene knockouts in mice suggested that clock dysregulation in human cancer is not caused solely by loss of activity of clock genes. Furthermore, by analyzing a large set of genes previously inferred to be rhythmic in healthy human lung, we found that dysregulation of the clock in human lung cancer is accompanied by dysregulation of broader patterns of circadian co-expression. Our findings suggest that clock dysregulation is a common means by which human cancers achieve unrestrained growth and division, and that restoring clock function could be a viable therapeutic strategy in multiple cancer types. In addition, our approach opens the door to using publicly available transcriptome data to quantify clock disruption in a multitude of human phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Identifying causal effects in non-experimental data is an enduring challenge. One proposed solution that recently gained popularity is the idea to use genes as instrumental variables (i.e. Mendelian Randomization - MR). However, this approach is problematic because many variables of interest are genetically correlated, which implies the possibility that many genes could affect both the exposure and the outcome directly or via unobserved confounding factors. Thus, pleiotropic effects of genes are themselves a source of bias in non-experimental data that would also undermine the ability of MR to correct for endogeneity bias from non-genetic sources. Here, we propose an alternative approach, GIV regression, that provides estimates for the effect of an exposure on an outcome in the presence of pleiotropy. As a valuable byproduct, GIV regression also provides accurate estimates of the chip heritability of the outcome variable. GIV regression uses polygenic scores (PGS) for the outcome of interest which can be constructed from genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. By splitting the GWAS sample for the outcome into non-overlapping subsamples, we obtain multiple indicators of the outcome PGS that can be used as instruments for each other, and, in combination with other methods such as sibling fixed effects, can address endogeneity bias from both pleiotropy and the environment. In two empirical applications, we demonstrate that our approach produces reasonable estimates of the chip heritability of educational attainment (EA) and show that standard regression and MR provide upwardly biased estimates of the effect of body height on EA.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn self-organized systems, the concept of flow hierarchy is a useful way to characterize the movement of information throughout a network. Hierarchical network organizations are shown to arise when there is a cost of maintaining links in the network. A similar constraint exists in metabolic networks, where costs come from reduced efficiency of nonspecific enzymes or from producing unnecessary enzymes. Previous analyses of bacterial metabolic networks have been used to predict the minimal nutrients that a bacterium needs to grow, its mutualistic relationships with other bacteria, and its major ecological niche. Using flow hierarchy, we can also infer the tradeoffs between growth rate and metabolic efficiency that bacteria make given their environmental constraints.\\n\\nResultsUsing a comparative approach on 2,935 bacterial metabolic networks, we show that flow hierarchy in bacterial metabolic networks tracks a fundamental tradeoff between growth rate and biomass production, and reflects a bacteriums realized ecological strategy. Additionally, by inferring the ancestral metabolic networks, we find that hierarchy decreases with distance from the root of the tree, suggesting the important pressure of increased growth rate relative to efficiency in the face of competition.\\n\\nConclusionsJust as hierarchical character is an important structural property in efficiently engineered systems, it also evolves in self-organized bacterial metabolic networks, reflects the life-history strategies of those bacteria, and plays an important role in network organization and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Diverse biological systems utilize gene-expression fluctuations ( noise) to drive lineage-commitment decisions1-5. However, once a commitment is made, noise becomes detrimental to reliable function6,7 and the mechanisms enabling post-commitment noise suppression are unclear. We used time-lapse imaging and mathematical modeling, and found that, after a noise-driven event, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strongly attenuated expression noise through a non-transcriptional negative-feedback circuit. Feedback is established by serial generation of RNAs from post-transcriptional splicing, creating a precursor-product relationship where proteins generated from spliced mRNAs auto-deplete their own precursor un-spliced mRNAs. Strikingly, precursor auto-depletion overcomes the theoretical limits on conventional noise suppression--minimizing noise far better than transcriptional auto-repression--and dramatically stabilizes commitment to the active-replication state. This auto-depletion feedback motif may efficiently suppress noise in other systems ranging from detained introns to non-sense mediated decay.",

For a typical cell line with a doubling time of 12 hours (or longer), a standard cell proliferation assay conducted over 24 hours provides excellent information about the low-density exponential growth rate, but limited information about crowding effects that occur at higher densities. To explore how we can best detect and quantify crowding effects, we present a suite of in silico proliferation assays where cells proliferate according to a generalised logistic growth model. Using approximate Bayesian computation we show that data from a standard cell proliferation assay cannot reliably distinguish between classical logistic growth and more general non-logistic growth models. We then explore, and quantify, the trade-off between increasing the duration of the experiment and the associated decrease in uncertainty in the crowding mechanism.",

The data structure has a single parameter k, is straightforward to implement and is tractable for large genomes with high sequencing depth. It also enables representation of multiple samples simultaneously to facilitate comparison. However, unlike the string graph, a de Bruijn graph does not retain long range information that is inherent in the read data. For this reason, applications that rely on de Bruijn graphs can produce sub-optimal results given their input.\\n\\nResultsWe present a novel assembly graph data structure: the Linked de Bruijn Graph (LdBG). Constructed by adding annotations on top of a de Bruijn graph, it stores long range connectivity information through the graph. We show that with error-free data it is possible to losslessly store and recover sequence from a Linked de Bruijn graph. With assembly simulations we demonstrate that the LdBG data structure outperforms both the de Bruijn graph and the String Graph Assembler (SGA). Finally we apply the LdBG to Klebsiella pneumoniae short read data to make large (12 kbp) variant calls, which we validate using PacBio sequencing data, and to characterise the genomic context of drug-resistance genes.\\n\\nAvailabilityLinked de Bruijn Graphs and associated algorithms are implemented as part of McCortex, available under the MIT license at https://github.com/mcvean/mccortex.\\n\\nContactturner.isaac@gmail.com.",

    "abstract": "The study of molecular host-parasite interactions is essential to understand parasitic infection and adaptation within the host system. As well, prevention and treatment of infectious diseases require clear understanding of the molecular crosstalk between parasites and their hosts. As yet, experimental large-scale identification of host-parasite molecular interactions remains challenging and the use of in silico predictions becomes then necessary. Here, we propose a computational integrative approach to predict host-parasite protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks resulting from the infection of human by 12 different parasites. We used an orthology-based method to transfer high-confidence intra-species interactions obtained from the STRING database to the corresponding inter-species protein pairs in the host-parasite system. To reduce the number of spurious predictions, our approach uses either the parasites predicted secretome and membrane proteins or only the secretome depending on whether they are uni- or multicellular respectively. Besides, the host proteome is filtered for proteins expressed in selected cellular localizations and tissues supporting the parasites growth. We evaluated the inferred interactions by analyzing the enriched biological processes and pathways in the predicted networks and their association to known parasitic invasion and evasion mechanisms. The resulting PPI networks were compared across parasites to identify common mechanisms that may define a global pathogenic hallmark. The predicted PPI networks can be visualized and downloaded at http://orthohpi.jensenlab.org.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is a collection of interactions between proteins from one or more organisms. Host-parasite PPIs are key to understanding the biology of different parasitic diseases, since predicting PPIs enable to know more about the parasite invasion, infection and persist. Our understanding of PPIs between host and parasites is still very limited, as no many systematic experimental studies have so far been performed. Efficacy of treatments for parasitic diseases is limited and in many cases parasites evolve resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs or vaccines for these neglected diseases, and thus interest in the functions and interactions of proteins associated with parasitism processes. Here we developed an in silico method to shed light on the interactome in twelve human parasites by combining an orthology based strategy and integrating, domain-domain interaction data, sub-cellular localization and to give a spatial context, we only took in to account those human tissues that support the parasites tropism. Here we show that is possible to identify relevant interactions across different parasites and their human host and that these interactions are well supported based on the biology of the parasites.",

    "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa is a clinically heterogeneous disease affecting 1.6 million people worldwide. A growing number of identified disease-causing genes are associated with the spliceosome, but the molecular consequences that link defects in splicing factor genes to the aetiology of the disease remain to be elucidated. In this paper, we present a Drosophila model for Retinitis pigmentosa 11, a human disease caused by mutations in the splicing factor PRPF31. Here, we induced mutations in the Drosophila orthologue Prp31. Mutant flies are viable and show a normal eye phenotype when kept under regular light conditions. However, when exposed to constant light, photoreceptors of mutant flies degenerate, thus resembling the human disease phenotype. Degeneration could be shown to be associated with increased oxidative stress. This increase was in agreement with severe dysregulation of genes involved in oxidation/reduction processes, as revealed by high throughput transcriptome sequencing. In fact, light induced photoreceptor cell degeneration could be attenuated by experimentally reducing oxidative stress. A comparable decrease in retinal degeneration was achieved by raising mutant larvae on a vitamin A-depleted medium, thereby reducing rhodopsin levels. Finally, transcriptome data further uncovered an overall retention of introns in mRNAs. Among those, mRNAs of genes involved in synapse assembly, growth and stability were most prominent. These results point to a multifactorial genesis of light induced degeneration in retinae of Prp31 mutant flies, including transcriptional and splicing dysregulation, oxidative stress and defects in vitamin A metabolism.",

MECA may arise de novo or result from oncogenic transformation of a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma (MECA ex-PA). We comprehensively analyzed the molecular alterations in MECA with integrated genomic analyses. We identified a low mutational load (0.5/MB), but a high prevalence of fusion oncogenes (28/40 tumors; 70%). We found FGFR1-PLAG1 in 7 (18%) cases, and the novel TGFBR3-PLAG1 fusion in 6 (15%) cases. TGFBR3-PLAG1 was specific for MECA de novo tumors or the malignant component of MECA ex-PA, was absent in 723 other salivary gland tumors, and promoted a tumorigenic phenotype in vitro. We discovered other novel PLAG1 fusions, including ND4-PLAG1, which is an oncogenic fusion between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. One tumor harbored an MSN-ALK fusion, which was tumorigenic in vitro, and targetable with ALK inhibitors. Certain gene fusions were predicted to result in neoantigens with high MHC binding affinity. A high number of copy number alterations was associated with poorer prognosis. Our findings indicate that MECA is a fusion-driven disease, nominate TGFBR3-PLAG1 as a hallmark of MECA, and provide a framework for future steps of diagnostic and therapeutic research in this lethal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Crosslinking of IgE-bound Fc{varepsilon}RI triggers multiple cellular responses, including degranulation and cytokine production. Signaling is dependent on recruitment of Syk via docking of its dual SH2 domains to phosphorylated tyrosines within the Fc{varepsilon}RI immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. Using single molecule imaging in live cells, we directly visualized and quantified the binding of individual mNeonGreen-tagged Syk molecules as they associated with the plasma membrane after Fc{varepsilon}RI activation. We found that Syk colocalizes transiently to Fc{varepsilon}RI and that Syk-Fc{varepsilon}RI binding dynamics are independent of receptor aggregate size. Substitution of glutamic acid for tyrosine between the Syk SH2 domains (SykY130E) led to an increased Syk-Fc{varepsilon}RI off-rate, loss of site-specific Syk autophosphorylation, and impaired downstream signaling. CRISPR-Cas9 engineered cells expressing only SykY130E were deficient in antigen-stimulated calcium release, degranulation and production of some cytokines (TNF-a, IL-3) but not others (MCP-1, IL-4). We propose that kinetic discrimination along the Fc{varepsilon}RI signaling pathway occurs at the level of Syk-Fc{varepsilon}RI interactions, with key outcomes dependent upon sufficiently long-lived Syk binding events.\\n\\nSummarySchwartz et al. use single molecule imaging to quantify the transient nature of Fc{varepsilon}RI-Syk interactions in live mast cells.

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is caused by the collapse of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the midbrain (MB), while other DA populations remain relatively intact. Common variation influencing susceptibility to sporadic PD has been primarily identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, like many other common genetic diseases, the genes impacted by common PD-associated variation remain to be elucidated. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize DA neuron populations in the mouse brain at embryonic and early postnatal timepoints. These data allow for the unbiased identification of DA neuron subpopulations, including a novel postnatal neuroblast population and SN DA neurons. Comparison of SN DA neurons with other DA neurons populations in the brain reveals a unique transcriptional profile, novel marker genes, and specific gene regulatory networks. By integrating these cell population specific data with published GWAS, we develop a scoring system for prioritizing candidate genes in PD-associated loci. With this, we prioritize candidate genes in all 32 GWAS intervals implicated in sporadic PD risk, the first such systematically generated list. From this we confirm that the prioritized candidate gene CPLX1 disrupts the nigrostriatal pathway when knocked out in mice. Ultimately, this systematic rationale leads to the identification of biologically pertinent candidates and testable hypotheses for sporadic PD that will inform a new era of PD genetic research.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional conformation of genomes is an essential component of their biological activity. The advent of the Hi-C technology enabled an unprecedented progress in our understanding of genome structures. However, Hi-C is subject to systematic biases that can compromise downstream analyses. Several strategies have been proposed to remove those biases, but the issue of abnormal karyotypes received little attention. Many experiments are performed in cancer cell lines, which typically harbor large-scale copy number variations that create visible defects on the raw Hi-C maps. The consequences of these widespread artifacts on the normalized maps are mostly unexplored. We observed that current normalization methods are not robust to the presence of large-scale copy number variations, potentially obscuring biological differences and enhancing batch effects. To address this issue, we developed an alternative approach designed to take into account chromosomal abnormalities. The method, called OneD, increases reproducibility among replicates of Hi-C samples with abnormal karyotype, outperforming previous methods significantly. On normal karyotypes, OneD fared equally well as state-of-the-art methods, making it a safe choice for Hi-C normalization. OneD is fast and scales well in terms of computing resources for resolutions up to 1 kbp. OneD is implemented as an R package available at http://www.github.com/qenvio/dryhic.",

    "abstract": "Rho-GTPases are master regulators of polarity establishment and cell morphology. Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for uni-polar or multi-polar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We derive a \\\"saturation rule\\\" general to all relevant models that governs the timescale of competition, and thereby predicts whether the system will generate uni-polar or multi-polar outcomes. We suggest that the saturation rule is a fundamental property of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism.",

    "abstract": "\\\"This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100032)\\\"\\n\\nThe Neotropical region has experienced a dynamic landscape evolution throughout the Miocene, with the large wetland Pebas occupying western Amazonia until 11-8 my ago and continuous uplift of the Andes mountains along the western edge of South America. Although the complex dynamics between the Andes and Amazonia may have strongly affected the trajectory of Neotropical biodiversity, there is little evidence for such an influence from time-calibrated phylogenies of groups that diversified during this period. Here, we generate one of the most comprehensive time-calibrated molecular phylogenies of a group of Neotropical insects: the butterfly tribe Ithomiini. Our tree includes 340 species (87% of extant species), spanning 26 million years of diversification in the Neotropics. We investigate temporal and spatial patterns of diversification, focusing on the influence of Miocene landscape tranformations on the dynamics of speciation, extinction and biotic interchanges at the Amazonia/Andes interface. We find that Ithomiini likely began diversifying at the interface between the Andes and the Amazonia around 26.4 my ago. Five subtribes with a very low extant diversity started diversifying early in western Amazonia, but a rapid decrease in diversification rate due to increased extinction rate between 20 and 10 my ago suggests a negative impact of the Pebas wetland system on these early lineages. By contrast, the clade containing the five most species-rich subtribes (85% of extant species) was characterized by a high, positive net diversification rate. This clade diversified exclusively in the Central Andes from 20 to 10 my ago. After the demise of the Pebas system (11-8 my ago), we found a sudden increase of interchanges with the Northern Andes and Amazonia, followed by local diversification, which led to a substantial renewal of diversification. In general, ecological turnovers throughout the Miocene strongly determined the dynamics of speciation, and extinction and interchanges, and appear as a key driving force shaping the regions current extraordinary biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Infectious pathogens are major selective forces acting on individuals. The recent advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies now enables to investigate the genetic bases of resistance/susceptibility to infections in non-model organisms. From an evolutionary perspective, the analysis of the genetic diversity observed at these genes in natural populations provides insight into the mechanisms maintaining polymorphism and their epidemiological consequences. We explored these questions in the context of the interactions between Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) and its reservoir host, the bank vole Myodes glareolus. Despite the continuous spatial distribution of M. glareolus in Europe, PUUV distribution is strongly heterogeneous. Different defence strategies might have evolved in bank voles as a result of co-adaptation with PUUV, which may in turn reinforce spatial heterogeneity in PUUV distribution. We performed a genome scan study of six bank vole populations sampled along a North/South transect in Sweden, including PUUV endemic and non-endemic areas. We combined candidate gene analyses (Tlr4, Tlr7, Mx2 genes) and high throughput sequencing of RAD (Restriction-site Associated DNA) markers. We found evidence for outlier loci showing high levels of genetic differentiation. Ten outliers among the 52 that matched to mouse protein-coding genes corresponded to immune related genes and were detected using ecological associations with variations in PUUV prevalence. One third of the enriched pathways concerned immune processes, including platelet activation and TLR pathway. In the future, functional experimentations should enable to confirm the role of these these immune related genes with regard to the interactions between M. glareolus and PUUV.",

Since 2012 the international standard for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based verification in Bos taurus cattle has been the ISAG 100 and 200 SNP panels. While these SNP sets have provided an increased level of parentage accuracy over microsatellite markers (MS), they can validate the wrong parent for an animal at [&le;]1% misconcordance rate levels, indicating that more SNP are needed if a more accurate pedigree is required. With rapidly increasing numbers of cattle being genotyped in Ireland that represent 61 Bos taurus breeds from a wide range of farm types: beef/dairy, AI/pedigree/commercial, purebred/crossbred, and large to small herd size the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) analysed different SNP densities to determine that at a minimum [&ge;]500 SNP are needed to consistently predict only one set of parents at a [&le;]1% misconcordance rate. For parentage validation and prediction ICBF uses 800 SNP selected based on SNP clustering quality, ISAG200 inclusion, call rate (CR), and minor allele frequency (MAF) in the Irish cattle population. Large datasets require sample and SNP quality control (QC). Most publications only deal with SNP QC via CR, MAF, parent-progeny conflicts, and Hardy-Weinberg deviation, but not sample QC. We report here a genomic sample QC pipeline to deal with the unique challenges of >1,000,000 genotypes from a national herd such as SNP genotype errors from mis-tagging of animals, lab errors, farm errors, and multiple other issues that can arise.",

A culture-independent approach based on 16S rRNA analysis indicated a high abundance of Proteobacteria in the sauna sample; and, a large amount of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria in the dishwasher filter. With a culture-dependent approach, we isolated 48 bacterial strains, screened their lipolytic activities on media with tributyrin as the main carbon source, and finally selected five isolates for further characterization. These strains, all of them identified as members of the genus Bacillus, displayed optimum lipolytic peaks at pH 6.5 and with 1-2% NaCl, and the activity proved very robust at a wide range of pH (up to 11.5) and added NaCl concentrations (up to 4%). The thermal, pH and salt robustness of the selected isolates is a valuable attribute for these strains, which are promising as highly tolerant biodetergents. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the isolation from an indoor environment of Bacillus strains with a high potential for industry.",

Despite replicating slower than T. gondii, H. hammondi was resistant to pH-induced tissue cyst formation early after excystation. However, in the absence of stress H. hammondi spontaneously converted to a terminally differentiated tissue cyst stage while T. gondii did not. Cultured H. hammondi could infect new host cells for up to 8 days following excystation, and this period was exploited to generate stably transgenic H. hammondi. Coupled with RNAseq analyses, our data clearly show that H. hammondi zoites grow as stringently regulated life stages that are fundamentally distinct from T. gondii tachyzoites and bradyzoites.",

In the context of speech, existing data suggest an interaction between auditory and speech-motor cortices, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely characterized. We fill a basic gap in our understanding of the sensorimotor processing of speech by examining the synchronization between auditory and speech-motor regions over different speech rates, a fundamental parameter delimiting successful perception. First, using MEG we measure synchronization between auditory and speech-motor regions while participants listen to syllables at various rates. We show, surprisingly, that auditory-motor synchrony is significant only over a restricted range and is enhanced at ~4.5 Hz, a value compatible with the mean syllable rate across languages. Second, neural modeling reveals that this modulated coupling plausibly emerges as a consequence of the underlying neural architecture. The findings suggest that the auditory-motor interaction should be interpreted rather conservatively when considering phase space.",

Overcoming this challenge necessitates a comprehensive account of the relationship between gamma responses and stimulus features. Here we used multivariate pattern analyses on human MEG data to characterize the relationships between gamma responses and one basic stimulus feature, the orientation of contrast edges. Our findings confirmed we could decode orientation information from induced responses in two dominant frequency bands at 24-32 Hz and 50-58 Hz. Decoding was higher for cardinal than oblique orientations, with similar results also obtained for evoked MEG responses. In contrast to multivariate analyses, orientation information was mostly absent in univariate signals: evoked and induced responses in early visual cortex were similar in all orientations, with only exception an inverse oblique effect observed in induced responses, such that cardinal orientations produced weaker oscillatory signals than oblique orientations. Taken together, our results showed multivariate methods are well suited for the analysis of gamma oscillations, with multivariate patterns robustly encoding orientation information and predominantly discriminating cardinal from oblique stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to boost a patients immune response to a tumor. Yet, the design of an effective immunotherapy is complicated by various factors, including a potentially immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, immune-modulating effects of conventional treatments, and therapy-related toxicities. These complexities can be incorporated into mathematical and computational models of cancer immunotherapy that can then be used to aid in rational therapy design. In this review, we survey modeling approaches under the umbrella of the major challenges facing immunotherapy development, which encompass tumor classification, optimal treatment scheduling, and combination therapy design. Although overlapping, each challenge has presented unique opportunities for modelers to make contributions using analytical and numerical analysis of model outcomes, as well as optimization algorithms. We discuss several examples of models that have grown in complexity as more biological information has become available, showcasing how model development is a dynamic process interlinked with the rapid advances in tumor-immune biology. We conclude the review with recommendations for modelers both with respect to methodology and biological direction that might help keep modelers at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy development.",

    "abstract": "The wiring diagram of the neocortex determines how information is processed across dozens of cortical areas. Each area communicates with multiple others via extensive long-range axonal projections 1-6, but the logic of inter-area information transfer is unresolved. Specifically, the extent to which individual neurons send dedicated projections to single cortical targets or distribute their signals across multiple areas remains unclear5,7-20. Distinguishing between these possibilities has been challenging because axonal projections of only a few individual neurons have been reconstructed. Here we map the projection patterns of axonal arbors from 591 individual neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) using two complementary methods: whole-brain fluorescence-based axonal tracing21,22 and high-throughput DNA sequencing of genetically barcoded neurons (MAPseq)23. Although our results confirm the existence of dedicated projections to certain cortical areas, we find these are the exception, and that the majority of V1 neurons broadcast information to multiple cortical targets. Furthermore, broadcasting cells do not project to all targets randomly, but rather comprise subpopulations that either avoid or preferentially innervate specific subsets of cortical areas. Our data argue against a model of dedicated lines of intracortical information transfer via \\\"one neuron - one target area\\\" mapping. Instead, long-range communication between a sensory cortical area and its targets may be based on a principle whereby individual neurons copy information to, and potentially coordinate activity across, specific subsets of cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "Animals must integrate the activity of multiple mechanoreceptors to navigate complex environments. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the general roles of the mechanosensory neurons have been defined, but most studies involve end-point or single-time-point measurements, and thus lack dynamical information. Here, we formulate a set of unbiased quantitative characterizations of the mechanosensory system by using reverse correlation analysis on behavior. We use a custom tracking, selective illumination, and optogenetics platform to compare two mechanosensory systems: the gentle-touch (TRNs) and harsh-touch (PVD) circuits. This method yields characteristic linear filters that allow for prediction of behavioral responses. The resulting filters are consistent with previous findings, and further provide new insights on the dynamics and spatial encoding of the systems. Our results suggest that the tiled network of the gentle-touch neurons has better resolution for spatial encoding than the harsh-touch neurons. Additionally, linear-nonlinear models accurately predict behavioral responses based only on sensory neuron activity. Our results capture the overall dynamics of behavior induced by the activation of sensory neurons, providing simple transformations that quantitatively characterize these systems. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to capture the behavioral dynamics induced by any neuron or other excitable cells in the animal.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimals constantly integrate the activity of neurons throughout their bodies to choose the most appropriate behavior. A key goal in quantitative neuroscience is to characterize and predict how neuronal circuits control and modulate behavior. C. elegans, a nematode with a fully mapped connectome, is an ideal model organism for elucidating the links between neuronal circuits and behavior. However, many studies relating activity in neurons to behavior rely on spontaneous behavior and lack information about their dynamics. In this study, we formulate unbiased quantitative characterizations of sensory neurons in C. elegans using with reverse correlation analysis with a white noise stimulus. We use optogenetics to stimulate body touch sensory neurons in freely moving worms, and provide quantitative descriptions that capture the dynamic transformations between sensory neuron activity and behavioral outputs.

    "abstract": "Cell fate generation can rely on the unequal distribution of molecules during progenitor cell division in the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates. Here we address asymmetric fate determinant localization in the developing Drosophila nervous system, focussing on the control of asymmetric Miranda distribution in larval neuroblasts. We used live imaging of neuroblast polarity reporters at endogenous levels of expression to address Miranda localization during the cell cycle. We reveal that the regulation and dynamics of cortical association of Miranda in interphase and mitosis are different. In interphase Miranda binds directly to the plasma membrane. At the onset of mitosis, Miranda is phosphorylated by aPKC and displaced from the PM. After nuclear envelope breakdown asymmetric localization of Miranda requires actomyosin activity. Therefore, Miranda phosphorylation by aPKC and differential binding to the actomyosin network are required at distinct phases of the cell cycle to polarize fate determinant localization.",

We explore the impact of this class of variants on 13 quantitative traits and 10 diseases using whole-exome sequencing data from 100,296 individuals. Protein truncating variants in genes intolerant to this class of mutations increased risk of autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, ADHD. In individuals without these disorders, there was an association with shorter height, lower education, increased hospitalization and reduced age. Gene sets implicated from GWAS did not show a significant protein truncating variants-burden beyond what captured by established Mendelian genes. In conclusion, we provide the most thorough investigation to date of the impact of rare deleterious coding variants on complex traits, suggesting widespread pleiotropic risk.\\n\\nMain abbreviations",

Here, we sought to better understand the mechanisms of apoptotic regulation in normal and activated B cells. Using intracellular BH3 profiling (iBH3), we defined the Bcl2-dependency of B-cell subsets from human peripheral blood and tonsillar lymphoid tissue as well as mitogen-activated B cells. We found that naive and memory B cells were BCL-2 dependent, while germinal center B cells were MCL-1 dependent and plasma cells were BCL-XL dependent. Proliferating B cells activated by CpG or CD40L/IL-4 became more dependent upon MCL-1 and BCL-XL. As B-cell lymphomas often rely on survival mechanisms derived from normal and activated B cells, these findings offer new insight into potential therapeutic strategies for lymphomas.",

Two brands of retinal prostheses are currently approved for implantation in patients with late stage photoreceptor disease. Clinical experience with these implants has made it apparent that the vision restored by these devices differs substantially from normal sight. To better understand the outcomes of this technology, we developed pulse2percept, an open-source Python implementation of a computational model that predicts the perceptual experience of retinal prosthesis patients across a wide range of implant configurations. A modular and extensible user interface exposes the different building blocks of the software, making it easy for users to simulate novel implants, stimuli, and retinal models.

Different cytometry studies often involve diverse sets of markers. Moreover, the detected values of the same marker are inconsistent between studies due to different experimental designs and cytometer configurations. As a result, the cell subsets identified by existing auto-gating methods cannot be directly compared across studies. We developed MetaCyto for automated meta-analysis of both flow and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. By combining clustering methods with a silhouette scanning method, MetaCyto is able to identify commonly labeled cell subsets across studies, thus enabling meta-analysis. Applying MetaCyto across a set of 10 heterogeneous cytometry studies totaling 2926 samples enabled us to identify multiple cell populations exhibiting differences in abundance between White and Asian adults.

Taking advantage of known connectivity in C. elegans, we identified and studied cell adhesion genes expressed in three interacting neurons in the mating circuits of the adult male. Two interacting pairs of cell surface proteins independently promote fasciculation between sensory neuron HOA and its postsynaptic target interneuron AVG: BAM-2/neurexin-related in HOA binds to CASY-1/calsyntenin in AVG; SAX-7/L1CAM in sensory neuron PHC binds to RIG-6/contactin in AVG. A third, basal pathway results in considerable HOA-AVG fasciculation and synapse formation in the absence of the other two.

    "abstract": "Cytoskeletal motor proteins are essential to the function of a wide range of intracellular mechanosystems. The biophysical characterization of their movement along their filamentous tracks is therefore of large importance. Towards this end, single-molecule, in vitro stepping-motility assays are commonly used to determine motor velocity and run length. However, comparing results from such experiments has proved difficult due to influences from variations in the experimental conditions and the data analysis methods. Here, we investigate the movement of fluorescently-labeled, processive, dimeric motor proteins and propose a unified algorithm to correct the measurements for finite filament length as well as photobleaching. Particular emphasis is put on estimating the statistical errors associated with the proposed evaluation method as knowledge of these values is crucial when comparing measurements from different experiments. Testing our approach with simulated and experimental data from GFP-labeled kinesin-1 motors stepping along immobilized microtubules, we show (i) that velocity distributions should be fitted by a t location-scale probability density function rather than by a norm*al distribution, (ii) that the impossibility to measure events shorter than the image acquisition time needs to be accounted for, (iii) that the interaction time and run length of the motors can be estimated independent of the filament length distribution, and (iv) that the dimeric nature of the motors needs to be considered when correcting for photobleaching. Moreover, our analysis reveals that controlling the temperature during the experiments with a precision below 1 K is of importance. We believe, our method will not only improve the evaluation of experimental data, but will also allow for better statistical comparisons between different populations of motor proteins (e.g. with distinct mutations or linked to different cargos) and filaments (e.g. in distinct nucleotide states or with different posttranslational modifications).",

Here, we develop a quantitative imaging approach to study the protein aggregation process in living mammalian cells with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. We find that sub-diffractive precursor aggregates may form even in untreated cells, and their size distribution is exactly as predicted for a system undergoing a first order phase transition. Practically, this implies that as soon as aggregates reach a critical size (Rc = 162 {+/-} 4 nm untreated cells), they will spontaneously grow into large inclusions. Our data suggest that a previously uncharacterized, RuvBL1 dependent mechanism clears aggregates above the critical size. Our study unveils the existence of sub-diffractive aggregates in living cells; and the strong agreement between cellular data and a nucleation theory, based on first order phase transition, provides insight into regulatory steps in the early stages of aggregate formation in vivo.",

We find differences in maximum net growth rate, temperature optimum and sensitivity, half-saturation constants for light and nitrogen, and density-dependent loss terms across the functional types. We find evidence of very high linear loss rates, suggesting that grazing may be even more important than commonly assumed and differences in density-dependent loss rates across functional types, indicating the presence of strong niche differentiation among functional types. Low half-saturation constants for nitrogen at the functional type level may indicate widespread mixotrophy. At the species level, we find a wide range of density-dependent effects, which may be a signal of diversity in grazing susceptibility or biotic interactions. This approach may be a way to obtain more realistic and better-constrained trait-values for functional types to be used in ecosystem modeling.",

    "abstract": "A core regulatory pathway that directs developmental transitions and cellular asymmetries in Agrobacterium tumefaciens involves two overlapping, integrated phosphorelays. One of these phosphorelays putatively includes four histidine sensor kinase homologues, DivJ, PleC, PdhS1, and PdhS2, and two response regulators, DivK and PleD. In several different alphaproteobacteria, this pathway influences a conserved downstream phosphorelay that ultimately controls the phosphorylation state of the CtrA master response regulator. The PdhS2 sensor kinase reciprocally regulates biofilm formation and swimming motility. In the current study the mechanisms by which the A. tumefaciens sensor kinase PdhS2 directs this regulation are delineated. PdhS2 lacking a key residue for phosphatase activity is markedly deficient in proper control of attachment and motility phenotypes, whereas a kinase-deficient PdhS2 mutant is only modestly affected. A genetic interaction between DivK and PdhS2 is revealed, unmasking one of several connections between PdhS2-dependent phenotypes and transcriptional control by CtrA. Epistasis experiments suggest that PdhS2 can function independently of the CckA sensor kinase, the cognate sensor kinase for CtrA which is inhibited by DivK. PdhS2 dynamically localizes to the daughter cell pole in dividing cells. Global expression analysis of the pdhS2 mutant reveals a restricted regulon, functioning through CtrA to separately control motility and regulate levels of the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (cdGMP), thereby affecting production of adhesive polysaccharides and attachment. We hypothesize that in A. tumefaciens the CtrA regulatory circuit has expanded to include additional inputs through addition of PdhS-type sensor kinases, likely fine-tuning the response of this organism to the soil microenvironment.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBacterial developmental processes, such as morphological transformations and behavioral transitions, are tightly regulated. In many alphaproteobacteria cell division and development are coordinated by a specific suite of conserved histidine kinases and their partnered regulatory proteins. Here we describe how the histidine kinase PdhS2 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens regulates complex phenotypes including biofilm formation and motility. PdhS2 genetically interacts with a single-domain response regulator, DivK, and the intracellular signal cyclic diguanylate monophosphate. PdhS2 dynamically localizes to the new pole of recently divided cells, contributing to the regulatory processes that dictate whether these cells remain motile or initiate biofilm formation. These findings expand our understanding of the complex network that integrates cell division and developmental control in A. tumefaciens and related alphaproteobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Gram-positive bacteria utilize exported peptides to coordinate genetic and physiological processes required for biofilm formation, stress responses and ecological competitiveness. One example is activation of natural genetic competence by ComR and the comX-inducing peptide (XIP) in Streptococcus mutans. Although the competence pathway can be activated by addition of synthetic XIP in defined medium, the hypothesis that XIP is able to function as an intercellular signal molecule has not been rigorously tested. Co-culture model systems were developed that included a \\\"sender\\\" strain that overexpressed the XIP precursor (ComS) and a \\\"responder\\\" strain harboring a GFP reporter fusion to a ComR-activated gene (comX) promoter. The ability of the sender strain to provide a signal to activate GFP expression was monitored at the individual cell and population levels using i) planktonic culture systems, ii) cells suspended in an agarose matrix or iii) cells growing in biofilms. XIP was shown to be freely diffusible and XIP signaling between the S. mutans sender and responder strains did not require cell-to-cell contact. The presence of a sucrose-derived exopolysaccharide matrix diminished the efficiency of XIP signaling in biofilms, possibly by affecting spatial distribution of XIP senders and potential responders. Intercellular signaling was greatly impaired in a strain lacking the primary autolysin, AtlA, and was substantially greater when the sender strain underwent lysis. Collectively, these data provide evidence that S. mutans XIP can indeed function as a peptide signal between cells and highlight the importance of studying signaling with endogenously-produced peptide(s) in populations in various environments and physiologic states.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe comX-inducing peptide (XIP) of Streptococcus mutans is a key regulatory element in the activation of genetic competence, which allows cells to take up extracellular DNA. XIP has been found in cell culture fluids and addition of synthetic XIP to physiologically receptive cells can robustly induce competence gene expression. However, there is a lack of consensus as to whether XIP can function as an intercellular communication signal. Here, we show that XIP indeed signals between cells in S. mutans, but that cell lysis may be a critical factor, as opposed to a dedicated secretion/processing system, in allowing for release of XIP into the environment. The results have important implications in the context of the ecology, virulence and evolution of a ubiquitous human pathogen and related organisms.",

    "abstract": "It is well-established that brain structures and cognitive functions change across the lifespan. A longstanding hypothesis called age differentiation additionally posits that the relations between cognitive functions also change with age. To date however, evidence for age-related differentiation is mixed, and no study has examined differentiation of the relationship between brain and cognition. Here we use multi-group Structural Equation Modeling and SEM Trees to study differences within and between brain and cognition across the adult lifespan (18-88 years) in a large (N>646, closely matched across sexes), population-derived sample of healthy human adults from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (www.cam-can.org). After factor analyses of grey-matter volume (from T1- and T2-weighted MRI) and white-matter organisation (fractional anisotropy from Diffusion-weighted MRI), we found evidence for differentiation of grey and white matter, such that the covariance between brain factors decreased with age. However, we found no evidence for age differentiation between fluid intelligence, language and memory, suggesting a relatively stable covariance pattern between cognitive factors. Finally, we observed a specific pattern of age differentiation between brain and cognitive factors, such that a white matter factor, which loaded most strongly on the hippocampal cingulum, became less correlated with memory performance in later life. These patterns are compatible with reorganization of cognitive functions in the face of neural decline, and/or with the emergence of specific subpopulations in old age.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe theory of age differentiation posits age-related changes in the relationships between brain structures and cognitive domains, either weakening (differentiation) or strengthening (de-differentiation), but evidence for this hypothesis is mixed. Using age-varying covariance models in a large cross-sectional adult lifespan sample, we found age-related reductions in the covariance among both brain measures (neural differentiation), but no covariance change between cognitive factors of fluid intelligence, language and memory. We also observed evidence of uncoupling (differentiation) between a white matter factor and cognitive factors in older age, most strongly for memory. Together, our findings support age-related differentiation as a complex, multifaceted pattern that differs for brain and cognition, and discuss several mechanisms that might explain the changing relationship between brain and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Hypoglycin A (HGA) is a toxin contained in seeds of the sycamore maple tree (Acer pseudoplatanus). Ingestion of this amino acid causes equine atypical myopathy (AM) in Europe. Another variety, A. negundo, is claimed to be present where AM cases were reported in the US. For unknown reasons, occurrence of this disease has increased. It is important to define environmental key factors that may influence toxicity of samaras from Acer species. In addition, the content of HGA in seedlings needs to be determined since AM outbreaks, during autumn period when the seeds fall but also during spring when seeds are germinating. The present study aims to validate a reliable method using high performance thin layer chromatography for determination and comparison of HGA in samaras and seedlings.\\n\\nThe working range of the method was between 20 g HGA to 408 g HGA per ml water, corresponding to 12 - 244 mg/kg fresh weight or 40 - 816 mg/kg dry weight, taking into account of an arbitrary average dry matter content of 30%. Instrumental limit of detection and limit of quantification were of 10 g HGA/ml and 20 g HGA/ml water, respectively. Instrumental precision was 4% (RSD on 20 repeated measurements) while instrumental accuracy ranged between 86% and 121% of expected value. The HGA recovery of the analytical method estimated from spiked samaras and seedlings samples ranged between 63 and 103%. The method was applied to 9 samples of samaras from Acer pseudoplatanus, A. platanoides and A. campestre and 5 seedlings samples from A. pseudoplatanus. The results confirm detection of HGA in samaras from A. pseudoplatanus and the absence of detection in samaras of other tested species. They also suggest that detected levels of HGA are highly variable. This confirmed the suitability of the method for HGA detection in samaras or seedling.",

    "abstract": "Valeriana officinalis is a medicinal herb which produces a suite of compounds in its root tissue useful for treatment of anxiety and insomnia. The sesquiterpene components of the root extract, valerenic acid and valerena-1,10-diene, are thought to contribute to most of the observed anxiolytic of Valerian root preparations. However, valerenic acid and its biosynthetic intermediates are only produced in low quantities in the roots of V. officinalis. Thus, in this report, Escherichia coli was metabolically engineered to produce substantial quantities of valerena-1,10-diene in shake flask fermentations with decane overlay. Expression of the wildtype valerenadiene synthase gene (pZE-wvds) resulted in production of 12 g/mL in LB cultures using endogenous FPP metabolism. Expression of a codon-optimized version of the valerenadiene synthase gene (pZE-cvds) resulted in 3-fold higher titers of valerenadiene (32 g/mL). Co-expression of pZE-cvds with an engineered methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway improved valerenadiene titers 65-fold to 2.09 mg/L valerenadiene. Optimization of the fermentation medium to include glycerol supplementation enhanced yields by another 5.5-fold (11.0 mg/L valerenadiene). The highest production of valerenadiene resulted from engineering the codon-optimized valerenadiene synthase gene under strong Ptrc and PT7 promoters and via co-expression of an exogenous mevalonate (MVA) pathway. These efforts resulted in an E. coli production strain that produced 62.0 mg/L valerenadiene (19.4 mg/L/OD600 specific productivity). This E. coli production platform will serve as the foundation for the synthesis of novel valerenic acid analogues potentially useful for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Phasing, the process of predicting haplotypes from genotype data, is an important undertaking in genetics and an ongoing area of research. Phasing methods, and associated software, designed specifically for pedigrees are urgently needed. Here we present a new method for phasing genotypes from whole genome sequencing data in pedigrees: PULSAR (Phasing Using Lineage Specific Alleles / Rare variants). The method is built upon the idea that alleles that are specific to a single founding chromosome within a pedigree, which we refer to as lineage-specific alleles, are highly informative for identifying haplotypes that are identical-by-decent between individuals within a pedigree. Through extensive simulation we assess the performance of PULSAR in a variety of pedigree sizes and structures, and we explore the effects of genotyping errors and presence of non-sequenced individuals on its performance. If the genotyping error rate is sufficiently low PULSAR can phase > 99.9% of heterozygous genotypes with a switch error rate below 1 x 10-4 in pedigrees where all individuals are sequenced. We demonstrate that the method is highly accurate and consistently outperforms the long-range phasing approach used for comparison in our benchmarking. The method also holds promise for fixing genotype errors or imputing missing genotypes. The software implementation of this method is freely available.",
