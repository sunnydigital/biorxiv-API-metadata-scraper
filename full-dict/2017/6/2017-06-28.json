    "abstract": "In storing and transmitting epigenetic information, organisms must balance the need to maintain information about past conditions with the capacity to respond to information in their current and future environments. Some of this information is encoded by DNA methylation, which can be transmitted with variable fidelity from parent to daughter strand. High fidelity confers strong pattern matching between the strands of individual DNA molecules and thus pattern stability over rounds of DNA replication; lower fidelity confers reduced pattern matching, and thus greater flexibility. * Here, we present a new conceptual framework, Ratio of Concordance Preference (RCP), that uses double-stranded methylation data to quantify the flexibility and stability of the system that gave rise to a given set of patterns. * We find that differentiated mammalian cells operate with high DNA methylation stability, consistent with earlier reports. Stem cells in culture and in embryos, in contrast, operate with reduced, albeit significant, methylation stability. We conclude that preference for concordant DNA methylation is a consistent mode of information transfer, and thus provides epigenetic stability across cell divisions, even in stem cells and those undergoing developmental transitions. Broader application of our RCP framework will permit comparison of epigenetic-information systems across cells, developmental stages, and organisms whose methylation machineries differ substantially or are not yet well understood.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin accessibility, a crucial component of genome regulation, has primarily been studied in homogeneous and simple systems, such as isolated cell populations or early-development models. Whether chromatin accessibility can be assessed in complex, dynamic systems in vivo with high sensitivity remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use ATAC-seq to identify chromatin accessibility changes in a whole animal, the model organism C. elegans, from embryogenesis to adulthood. Chromatin accessibility changes between developmental stages are highly reproducible, recapitulate histone modification changes, and reveal key regulatory aspects of the epigenomic landscape throughout organismal development. We find that over 5,000 distal non-coding regions exhibit dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility between developmental stages, and could thereby represent putative enhancers. When tested in vivo, several of these putative enhancers indeed drive novel cell-type-and temporal-specific patterns of expression. Finally, by integrating transcription factor binding motifs in a machine learning framework, we identify EOR-1 as a unique transcription factor that may regulate chromatin dynamics during development. Our study provides a unique resource for C. elegans, a system in which the prevalence and importance of enhancers remains poorly characterized, and demonstrates the power of using whole organism chromatin accessibility to identify novel regulatory regions in complex systems.",

    "abstract": "Because reproductive isolation often evolves gradually, differentiating lineages may retain the potential for genetic exchange for prolonged periods, providing an opportunity to quantify and understand the fundamental role of gene flow during speciation. Here we delimit taxa, reconstruct the phylogeny and infer gene flow in newts of the Lissotriton vulgaris species complex based on 74 nuclear markers sampled from 127 localities. We demonstrate that distinct lineages along the speciation continuum in newts exchange nontrivial amounts of genes, affecting their evolutionary trajectories. By integrating a wide array of methods, we delimit nine taxa and show that two principle factors have driven their genetic differentiation: time since the last common ancestor determining levels of shared ancestral polymorphism, and shifts in geographic distributions determining the extent of secondary contact. Post-divergence gene flow, indicative of evolutionary non-independence, has been most extensive between sister and non-sister taxa in Central Europe, while four southern European lineages have acquired the population genetic hallmarks of independent species (L. graecus, L. kosswigi, L. lantzi, L. schmidtleri). We obtained strong statistical support for widespread mtDNA introgression, previously suggested by discordance between mtDNA phylogeny and morphology. Our study suggests that long-term evolution in structured populations that may periodically exchange genes may be common: although some of these populations may become extinct or fuse, others will acquire complete reproductive isolation and will carry signatures of this complex history in their genomes.",

    "abstract": "High density linkage maps are an important tool to gain insight into the genetic architecture of traits of evolutionary and economic interest, and provide a resource to characterise variation in recombination landscapes. Here, we used information from the cattle genome and the 50K Cervine Illumina BeadChip to inform and refine a high density linkage map in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We constructed a predicted linkage map of 38,038 SNPs and a skeleton map of 10,835 SNPs across 34 linkage groups. We identified several chromosomal rearrangements in the deer lineage relative to sheep and cattle, including six chromosome fissions, one fusion and two large inversions. Otherwise, our findings showed strong concordance with map orders in the cattle genome. The sex-averaged linkage map length was 2739.7cM and the genome-wide autosomal recombination rate was 1.04cM per Mb. The female autosomal map length was 1.21 longer than that of males (2767.4cM vs 2280.8cM, respectively). Sex differences in map length were driven by high female recombination rates in peri-centromeric regions, a pattern that is unusual relative to other mammal species. This effect was more pronounced in fission chromosomes that would have had to produce new centromeres. We propose two hypotheses to explain this effect: (1) that this mechanism may have evolved to counteract centromeric drive associated with meiotic asymmetry in oocyte production; and/or (2) that sequence and structural characteristics suppressing recombination in close proximity to the centromere may not have yet evolved at neo-centromeres. Our study provides insight into how recombination landscapes vary and evolve in mammals, and will provide a valuable resource for studies of evolution, genetic improvement and population management in red deer and related species.\\n\\nArticle SummaryWe present a high density linkage map (>38,000 markers) in a wild population of Red deer (Cervus elaphus). Our investigation of the recombination landscape showed a marked difference in recombination rates between the sexes in proximity to the centromere, with females showing an unusually elevated rate relative to other mammal species. This effect is most pronounced in chromosomes that would have produced a new centromere in the deer lineage. We propose that the observed effects have evolved to counteract selfish genetic elements associated with asymmetrical female meiosis.",

    "abstract": "Pattern separation is a process that minimizes overlap between patterns of neuronal activity representing similar experiences. Theoretical work suggests that the dentate gyrus (DG) performs this role for memory processing but a direct demonstration is lacking. One limitation is the difficulty to measure DG inputs and outputs simultaneously. To rigorously assess pattern separation by DG circuitry, we used mouse brain slices to stimulate DG afferents and simultaneously record DG granule cells (GCs) and interneurons. Output spiketrains of GCs are more dissimilar than their input spiketrains, demonstrating for the first time temporal pattern separation at the level of single neurons in the DG. Pattern separation is larger in GCs than in fast-spiking interneurons and hilar mossy cells, and is amplified in CA3 pyramidal cells. Analysis of the neural noise and computational modelling suggest that this form of pattern separation is not explained by simple randomness and arises from specific presynaptic dynamics. Overall, by reframing the concept of pattern separation in dynamic terms and by connecting it to the physiology of different types of neurons, our study offers a new window of understanding in how hippocampal networks might support episodic memory.",

    "abstract": "Brain computations depend on how neurons transform inputs to spike outputs. Here, to understand input-output transformations in cortical networks, we recorded spiking responses from visual cortex (V1) of awake mice of either sex while pairing sensory stimuli with optogenetic perturbation of excitatory and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons. We found V1 neurons average responses were primarily additive (linear). We used a recurrent cortical network model to determine if these data, as well as past observations of nonlinearity, could be described by a common circuit architecture. The model showed cortical input-output transformations can be changed from linear to sublinear with moderate ([~]20%) strengthening of connections between inhibitory neurons, but this change depends on the presence of feedforward inhibition. Thus, feedforward inhibition, a common feature of cortical circuitry, enables networks to flexibly change their spiking responses via changes in recurrent connectivity.\\n\\nSignificance statementBrains are made up of neural networks that process information by receiving input activity and transforming those inputs into output activity. We use optogenetic manipulations in awake mice to expose how a transformation in a cortical network depends on internal network activity. Combining numerical simulations with our observations uncovers that transformation depend critically on feedforward inhibition - the fact that inputs to the cortex often make strong connections on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.",

    "abstract": "Microbial N2 fixation (diazotrophy) represents an important nitrogen source to oligotrophic peatland ecosystems, which are important sinks for atmospheric CO2 and susceptible to changing climate. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the active microbial group and type of nitrogenase mediating diazotrophy in a ombrotrophic Sphagnum-dominated peat bog (the S1 peat bog, Marcell Experimental Forest, Minnesota, USA); and (ii) to determine the effect of environmental parameters (light, O2, CO2, CH4) on potential rates of diazotrophy measured by acetylene (C2H2) reduction and 15N2 incorporation. Molecular analysis of metabolically active microbial communities suggested that diazotrophy in surface peat was primarily mediated by Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae). Despite higher dissolved vanadium (V; 11 nM) than molybdenum (Mo; 3 nM) in surface peat, a combination of metagenomic, amplicon sequencing and activity measurements indicated that Mo-containing nitrogenases dominate over the V-containing form. Acetylene reduction was only detected in surface peat exposed to light, with the highest rates observed in peat collected from hollows with the highest water content. Incorporation of15N2 was suppressed 90% by O2 and 55% by C2H2, and was unaffected by CH4 and CO2 amendments. These results suggest that peatland diazotrophy is mediated by a combination of C2H2 - sensitive and C2H2 - insensitive microbes that are more active at low O2 and show similar activity at high and low CH4.\\n\\nImportancePrevious studies indicate that diazotrophy provides an important nitrogen source and is linked to methanotrophy in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands. However, the environmental controls and enzymatic pathways of peatland diazotrophy, as well as the metabolically active microbial populations that catalyze this process remain in question. Our findings indicate that oxygen levels and photosynthetic activity override low nutrient availability in limiting diazotrophy, and that members of the Alphaproteobacteria (Rhizobiales) catalyze this process at the bog surface using the molybdenum - based form of the nitrogenase enzyme.",

    "abstract": "In yeast, DNA breaks are usually repaired by homologous recombination (HR). An early step for HR pathways is formation of a heteroduplex, in which a single-strand from the broken DNA molecule pairs with a strand derived from an intact DNA molecule. If the two strands of DNA are not identical, there will be mismatches within the heteroduplex DNA (hetDNA). In wild-type strains, these mismatches are repaired by the mismatch repair (MMR) system, producing a gene conversion event. In strains lacking MMR, the mismatches persist. Most previous studies involving hetDNA formed during mitotic recombination were restricted to one locus. Below, we present a global mapping of hetDNA formed in the MMR-defective mlh1 strain. We find that many recombination events are associated with repair of double-stranded DNA gaps and/or involve Mlh1-independent mismatch repair. Many of our events are not explicable by the simplest form of the double-strand break repair model of recombination.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing importance of non-targeted metabolomics to answer various life science questions, extracting biochemically relevant information from metabolomics spectral data is still an incompletely solved problem. Most computational tools to identify tandem mass spectra focus on a limited set of molecules of interest. However, such tools are typically constrained by the availability of reference spectra or molecular databases, limiting their applicability to identify unknown metabolites. In contrast, recent advances in the field illustrate the possibility to expose the underlying biochemistry without relying on metabolite identification, in particular via substructure prediction. We describe an automated method for substructure recommendation motivated by association rule mining. Our framework captures potential relationships between spectral features and substructures learned from public spectral libraries. These associations are used to recommend substructures for any unknown mass spectrum. Our method does not require any predefined metabolite candidates, and therefore it can be used for the partial identification of unknown unknowns. The method is called MESSAR (MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender) and is implemented in a free online web service available at messar.biodatamining.be.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMass spectrometry is one of most used techniques to detect and identify metabolites. However, learning metabolite structures directly from mass spectrometry data has always been a challenging task. Thousands of mass spectra from various biological systems still remain unanalyzed simply because no current bioinformatic tools are able to generate structural hypotheses. By manually studying mass spectra of standard compounds, chemists discovered that metabolites that share common substructures can also share spectral features. As data scientists, we believe that such relationships can be unraveled from massive structure and spectra data by machine learning. In this study, we adapted \\\"association rule mining\\\", traditionally used in market basket analysis, to structural and spectral data, allowing us to investigate all spectral features - metabolite substructures relationships. We further collected all statistically sound relationships into a database and used them to assign substructral hypotheses to unexplored spectra. We named our approach MESSAR, MEtabolite SubStructure Auto-Recommender, available to the metabolomics and mass spectrometry community as a free and open web service.",

Only a small fraction of observed Lewy bodies contained predominant proteinaceous filaments, as previously described.

    "abstract": "The anticancer activity of genotoxic agents has been intensively studied, while the mechanisms of action of drugs destabilizing the epigenome are far less understood. We previously found that DNA hypomethylation in the absence of p53 leads to transcriptional desilencing of repetitive DNA elements, such as pericentromeric repeats and endogenous retroelements, which is associated with an interferon type I response, a phenomenon we named TRAIN (Transcription of Repeats Activates INterferon). Here, we report that curaxin, a small molecule anticancer drug candidate, which destabilizes nucleosomes via disruption of histone/DNA interactions, can induce TRAIN independently of the p53 status of a cell. Furthermore, curaxin inhibits oncogene-induced transformation in an interferon-dependent manner, suggesting that cancer prevention by curaxin, previously attributed to its p53-activating and NF-kappaB-inhibiting activities, may also involve the induction of the interferon response to epigenetic derepression of the cellular \\\"repeatome.\\\" Moreover, we observed that another type of drugs decondensing chromatin, histone deacetylase inhibitor, also induces TRAIN. Thus, we proposed that TRAIN may be one of the mechanisms ensuring epigenetic integrity of cells via elimination of cells with desilenced chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Understanding any brain circuit will require a categorization of its constituent neurons. In hippocampal area CA1, at least 23 classes of GABAergic neuron have been proposed to date. However, this list may be incomplete; additionally, it is unclear whether discrete classes are sufficient to describe the diversity of cortical inhibitory neurons, or whether continuous modes of variability are also required. We studied the transcriptomes of 3663 CA1 inhibitory cells, revealing 10 major GABAergic groups that divided into 49 fine-scale clusters. All previously described and several novel cell classes were identified, with three previously-described classes unexpectedly found to be identical. A division into discrete classes however was not sufficient to describe the diversity of these cells, as continuous variation also occurred between and within classes. Latent factor analysis revealed that a single continuous variable could predict the expression levels of several genes, which correlated similarly with it across multiple cell types. Analysis of the genes correlating with this variable suggested it reflects a range from metabolically highly active faster-spiking cells that proximally target pyramidal cells, to slower-spiking cells targeting distal dendrites or interneurons. These results elucidate the complexity of inhibitory neurons in one of the simplest cortical structures, and show that characterizing these cells requires continuous modes of variation as well as discrete cell classes.",

    "abstract": "In recent work, we discovered that the presence of highly substoichiometric amounts (10-8 molar ratio) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria caused fibrinogen clotting to lead to the formation of an amyloid form of fibrin. We here show that the broadly equivalent lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) from two species of Gram-positive bacteria have similarly (if not more) potent effects. Using thioflavin T fluorescence to detect amyloid as before, the addition of low concentrations of free ferric ion is found to have similar effects. Luminescent conjugated oligothiophene dyes (LCOs), marketed under the trade name AmytrackerTM, also stain classical amyloid structures. We here show that they too give very large fluorescence enhancements when clotting is initiated in the presence of the four amyloidogens (LPS, ferric ions and two LTA types). The staining patterns differ significantly as a function of both the amyloidogens and the dyes used to assess them, indicating clearly that the nature of the clots formed is different. This is also the case when clotting is measured viscometrically using thromboelastography. Overall, the data provide further evidence for an important role of bacterial cell wall products in the various coagulopathies that are observable in chronic, inflammatory diseases. The assays may have potential in both diagnostics and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesPre-historic decline in human craniofacial masculinity has been proposed as evidence of selection for elevated sociability and a process of  human self-domestication thought to have promoted complex capacities including language, culture, and cumulative technological development. This follows experimental observation of similar changes in non-human animals under selection for reduced aggression. Two distinct domestication hypotheses posit developmental explanations, involving hypoplasia of embryonic neural crest cells (NCCs), and declining androgen influence, respectively. Here, I assess the operation and potential interactions between these two mechanisms and consider their role in enhanced human adaptation to a cooperative sociocultural niche.\n\nMethodsI provide a review and synthesis of related literature with a focus on physiological mechanisms effecting domesticated reductions in masculinity and sexual dimorphism. Further, I examine pre-historic modes of socio-sexual selection likely to drive human self-domestication via reduced aggression and masculinity.\n\nResultsI find pluripotent NCCs provide progenitors for a wide range of vertebrate masculine features, acting as regular targets for sexually driven evolutionary change; suggesting domesticated hypoplasia of NCC-derived tissues would be sufficient to explain declines in masculine traits and features. However, lineage specific androgen receptor variability likely moderates these NCC-based effects.\n\nConclusionsThese findings extend theorised mechanisms driving noted physiological, morphological, and behavioural changes thought to indicate enhanced sociability and human and self-domestication. Multiple current explanations for human sociability are consistent with physiological domestication under socio-sexual selection favouring dampened masculine physiology and behaviour as adaptations to an enhanced sociocultural niche. The analysis highlights multiple avenues for further investigation.",

Such screenings frequently identified alleles of CPL1 (Carboxyl-terminal Phosphatase-Like 1) regardless of promoters or pathways studied. Expression of the corresponding endogenous genes often shows the minimal difference between wild type and cpl1. Here we show that the LUC coding sequence is responsible for the high expression in cpl1, using a classical RD29a-LUC. Deletion of the LUC 3-UTR did not change hyperactivation of LUC in cpl1. However, a codon-modified LUC (LUC2) produced similar expression levels both in wild type and in cpl1. These results indicate that the coding region of LUC is responsible for the cpl1-specific LUC overexpression uncoupled with the expression of the endogenous counterpart.",

Available biological datasets allow the identification of non-coding regulatory elements with high confidence; furthermore, chromatin conformation data can be used to confirm enhancer-promoter interactions in specific tissue types and developmental stages. We have devised an analysis pipeline that integrates datasets about gene expression, enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, epigenetic marks, and Hi-C contact frequencies in various brain tissues and developmental stages, leading to the identification of eight non-coding elements that might regulate the expression of three genes with important roles in brain development in vertebrates. We have then performed comparative sequence and microsynteny analyses in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the regulatory landscape around these genes; we observe a general pattern of ancient regulatory elements conserved across most vertebrate lineages, together with younger elements that appear to be mammal and primate innovations.

    "abstract": "Due to the large numbers of transcription factors (TFs) and cell types, querying binding profiles of all TF/cell type pairs is not experimentally feasible, owing to constraints in time and resources. To address this issue, we developed a convolutional-recurrent neural network model, called FactorNet, to computationally impute the missing binding data. FactorNet trains on binding data from reference cell types to make accurate predictions on testing cell types by leveraging a variety of features, including genomic sequences, genome annotations, gene expression, and single-nucleotide resolution sequential signals, such as DNase I cleavage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning method to study the rules governing TF binding at such a fine resolution. With FactorNet, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay, such as DNase-seq, on a cell type and computationally impute dozens of TF binding profiles. This is an integral step for reconstructing the complex networks underlying gene regulation. While neural networks can be computationally expensive to train, we introduce several novel strategies to significantly reduce the overhead. By visualizing the neural network models, we can interpret how the model predicts binding which in turn reveals additional insights into regulatory grammar. We also investigate the variables that affect cross-cell type predictive performance to explain why the model performs better on some TF/cell types than others, and offer insights to improve upon this field.

    "abstract": "Socially appropriate behavior involves learning actions that are valued by others and those that have a social cost. Facial expressions are one way that others can signal the social value of our actions. The rewarding or aversive properties of signals such as smiles or frowns also evoke automatic approach or avoidance behaviors in receivers, and a Pavlovian system learns cues that predict rewarding or aversive outcomes. In this study, we examined the computational and neural mechanisms underlying interactions between Pavlovian and Instrumental systems during social reinforcement learning. We found that Pavlovian biases to approach cues predicting social reward and avoid cues predicting social punishment interfered with Instrumental learning from social feedback. While the computations underlying Pavlovian and Instrumental interactions remained the same as when learning from monetary feedback, Pavlovian biases from social outcomes to approach or withdraw were not significantly correlated with biases from money. Trial-by-trial measures of alpha (8-14Hz) EEG power was associated with suppression of Pavlovian bias to social outcomes, while suppression of bias from money was associated with theta (4-7Hz) EEG power. Our findings demonstrate how emotional reactions to feedback from others are balanced with the instrumental value of that feedback to guide social behavior.\\n\\nSignificance statementA smile from another can be a signal to continue what we are doing, while an angry scowl is a sure sign to stop. Feedback from others such as this plays an important role in shapeing social behavior. The rewarding nature of a smile (or the aversive nature of a scowl) can also lead to automatic tendencies to approach (or avoid), and we can learn situations that predict positive or negative social outcomes. In this study, we examined the brain mechanisms that come into play when the instrumental demands of a situation are in conflict with our automatic biases to approach or withdraw, such as when we have to approach someone who is scowling at us or withdraw from someone who is smiling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntibiotic resistance poses a threat to public health and a burden to healthcare systems. Escherichia coli causes more bacteraemia cases in England than any other bacterial species, these infections, in part due to their high incidence, also pose a significant antibiotic resistance burden. The main aim of this study was to estimate the impact of E. coli bacteraemia on patient in-hospital mortality and length of stay. Secondarily, this study also aimed to estimate the effect of antibiotic resistance on these outcomes.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsCase patients were adult E. coli bacteraemia patients infected between July 2011 and June 2012, as reported in an English national mandatory surveillance database, with susceptibility data taken from a national laboratory surveillance database. Control patients were all non-case, adult patients with an English hospital admission record. Case and control patient characteristics and admission information were taken from NHS Digital Datasets.  Resistance was defined as non-susceptible and intermediate isolates, whilst  susceptible was defined as susceptible and non-tested isolates. Time to in-hospital mortality and discharge was investigated through Cox proportional hazards models. To acquire estimates of excess length of stay, multistate models were constructed, with a unit bed day cost applied to estimate cost burden. The total number of case and control hospital spells was 14,051 and 8,919,275 respectively. Acquisition of E. coli bacteraemia was associated with a statistically significant increased daily risk of in-hospital mortality, especially for the first eight days of someones hospital admission [Hazard Ratio = 2.77 (95% confidence interval; 2.61-2.94)]. Antibiotic resistance did not seem to significantly increase this risk further, though did significantly reduce risk of experiencing a discharge event (dead or alive). E.coli bacteraemia was estimated to cost {pound}14,340,900 over the study period (rounded to the nearest {pound}100), with resistance associated with excess costs per infection of {pound}220 - {pound}420 dependent on resistance type, for those where a significant impact was found (rounded to the nearest {pound}10).\\n\\nConclusionsE. coli bacteraemia places a significant burden on patient health and on the hospital sector in England. Resistance is an important factor on length of stay with regards to such infections.",

    "abstract": "Shellfish-transmitted Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections have recently increased from locations with historically low disease incidence, such as the Northeast United States (US). This change coincided with a bacterial population shift towards human pathogenic variants occurring in part through the introduction of several Pacific native lineages (ST36, ST43 and ST636) to near-shore areas off the Atlantic coast of the Northeast US. Concomitantly, ST631 emerged as a major endemic pathogen. Phylogenetic trees of clinical and environmental isolates indicated that two clades diverged from a common ST631 ancestor, and in each of these clades, a human pathogenic variant evolved independently through acquisition of distinct Vibrio pathogenicity islands (VPaI). These VPaI differ from each other and bear little resemblance to hemolysin-containing VPaI from isolates of the pandemic clonal complex. Clade I ST631 isolates either harbored no hemolysins, or contained a chromosome I-inserted island we call VPaI{beta} that encodes a type three secretion system (T3SS2{beta}) typical of Trh hemolysin-producers. The more clinically prevalent and clonal ST631 clade II had an island we call VPaI{gamma} that encodes both tdh and trh and that was inserted in chromosome II. VPaI{gamma} was derived from VPaI{beta} but with some additional acquired elements in common with VPaI carried by pandemic isolates, exemplifying the mosaic nature of pathogenicity islands. Genomics comparisons and amplicon assays identified VPaI{gamma}-type islands containing tdh inserted adjacent to the ure cluster in the three introduced Pacific and most other emergent lineages. that collectively cause 67% of Northeast US infections as of 2016.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe availability of three different hemolysin genotypes in the ST631 lineage provided a unique opportunity to employ genome comparisons to further our understanding of the processes underlying pathogen evolution. The fact that two different pathogenic clades arose in parallel from the same potentially benign lineage by independent VPaI acquisition is surprising considering the historically low prevalence of community members harboring VPaI in waters along the Northeast US Coast that could serve as the source of this material. This illustrates a possible predisposition of some lineages to not only acquire foreign DNA but also to become human pathogens. Whereas the underlying cause for the expansion of V. parahaemolyticus lineages harboring VPaI{gamma} along the US Atlantic coast and spread of this element to multiple lineages that underlies disease emergence is not known, this work underscores the need to define the environment factors that favor bacteria harboring VPaI in locations of emergent disease.",

To gain a proof-of-concept, here we describe a machine learning framework yielding probabilistic estimates of immunogenicity, termed \\\"immunogenicity scores\\\", by utilizing features designed to mimic thermodynamic interactions between peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and TCR repertoire. Immunogenicity score dynamics among observed and computationally simulated single amino acid mutants delineated the landscape of position- and residue-specific mutational impacts, and even quantitatively estimated escaping potentials of known epitopes with remarkable positional specificity.

    "abstract": "Plant distributions can be limited by habitat-biased herbivory, but the proximate causes of such biases are rarely known. Distinguishing plant-centric from herbivore-centric mechanisms driving differential herbivory between habitats is difficult without experimental manipulation of both plants and herbivores. Here we tested alternative hypotheses driving habitat-biased herbivory in bittercress (Cardamine cordifolia), which is more abundant under shade of shrubs and trees (shade) than in nearby meadows (sun) where herbivory is intense from the specialist fly Scaptomyza nigrita. This system has served as a textbook example of habitat-biased herbivory driving a plants distribution across an ecotone, but the proximate mechanisms underlying differential herbivory are still unclear. First, we found that higher S. nigrita herbivory in sun habitats contrasts sharply with their preference to attack plants from shade habitats in laboratory choice experiments. Second, S. nigrita strongly preferred leaves in simulated sun over simulated shade habitats, regardless of plant source habitat. Thus, herbivore preference for brighter, warmer habitats overrides their preference for more palatable shade plants. This promotes the sun-biased herbivore pressure that drives the distribution of bittercress into shade habitats.",

    "abstract": "An important question in cell biology is whether cells are able to measure size, either whole cell size or organelle size. Perhaps cells have an internal chemical representation of size that can be used to precisely regulate growth, or perhaps size is just an accident that emerges due to constraint of nutrients. The eukaryotic flagellum is an ideal model for studying size sensing and control because its linear geometry makes it essentially one-dimensional, greatly simplifying mathematical modeling. The assembly of flagella is regulated by intraflagellar transport (IFT), in which kinesin motors carry cargo adaptors for flagellar proteins along the flagellum and then deposit them at the tip, lengthening the flagellum. The rate at which IFT motors are recruited to begin transport into the flagellum is anticorrelated with the flagellar length, implying some kind of communication between the base and the tip and possibly indicating that cells contain some mechanism for measuring flagellar length. Although it is possible to imagine many complex scenarios in which additional signaling molecules sense length and carry feedback signals to the cell body to control IFT, might the already-known components of the IFT system be sufficient to allow length dependence of IFT? Here, we investigate a model in which the anterograde kinesin motors unbind after cargo delivery, diffuse back to the base, and are subsequently reused to power entry of new IFT trains into the flagellum. By modeling such a system at three different levels of abstraction we are able to show that the diffusion time of the motors can in principle be sufficient to serve as a proxy for length measurement. In all three implementations, we found that the diffusion model can not only achieve a stable steady-state length without the addition of any other signaling molecules or pathways, but also is able to produce the anticorrelation between length and IFT recruitment rate that has been observed in quantitative imaging studies.",

    "abstract": "Raised progesterone during the menstrual cycle is associated with suppressed physiological immune responses, reducing the probability that the immune system will compromise the blastocysts development. The Compensatory Prophylaxis Hypothesis proposes that this progesterone-linked immunosuppression triggers increased disgust responses to pathogen cues, compensating for the reduction in physiological immune responses by minimizing contact with pathogens. Although a popular and influential hypothesis, there is no direct, within-woman evidence for correlated changes in progesterone and pathogen disgust. To address this issue, we used a longitudinal design to test for correlated changes in salivary progesterone and pathogen disgust (measured using the pathogen disgust subscale of the Three Domain Disgust Scale) in a large sample of women (N=375). Our analyses showed no evidence that pathogen disgust tracked changes in progesterone, estradiol, testosterone, or cortisol. Thus, our results provide no support for the Compensatory Prophylaxis Hypothesis of variation in pathogen disgust.",

    "abstract": "The prokaryotic neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus is an established structural model for mammalian NSS counterparts. Here, we investigate the substrate translocation mechanism of LeuT by measuring the solution-phase structural dynamics of the transporter in distinct functional states by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Our HDX-MS data pinpoint LeuT segments involved in substrate transport and reveal for the first time a comprehensive and detailed view of the solution-phase dynamics associated with transition of the transporter between outward- and inwardfacing configurations in a Na+- as well as K+-dependent manner. The results suggest that partial unwinding of transmembrane helices 1/5/6/7 drive LeuT from a substrate-bound, outward-facing occluded conformation towards an inward-facing open state. We thereby envisage that substrate release is facilitated by formation of two distinct solvent pathways, which mediate access to the Na+ and substrate binding sites.\\n\\nThe neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) family includes prokaryotic and eukaryotic integral membrane proteins that harness the energy stored in the Na+ concentration gradient to transport solutes across the cell membrane (1, 2). Mammalian NSS proteins play an important role in terminating the neurotransmission in the central nervous system by rapid uptake of neurotransmitters against their concentration gradient into the presynaptic neuron or neighboring glial cells (3-5). Numerous neuropsychiatric conditions are associated with altered function of NSS transporters or low neurotransmitter concentrations in the synaptic cleft (2). Many NSS proteins therefore represent favorable targets for therapeutic drugs that act as potent transport inhibitors to increase neurotransmitter levels at the synaptic junction (2, 6). Despite the importance of mammalian NSS proteins in neurobiology and pharmacology, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transport function of mammalian NSS family members have proven difficult to elucidate by traditional methods as the target proteins are unstable in detergent-solubilized form (7) and difficult to purify in required quantity and purity.\\n\\nThe prokaryotic NSS protein LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus has emerged as an important structural model to investigate the structure-function relationship of mammalian NSS counterparts (7-9). High-resolution crystal structures of LeuT in distinct functional states (10-13) have established a structural framework and given rise to mechanistic models depicting the substrate transport mechanism (14, 15). LeuT comprises 12 transmembrane segments (TMs) that are interconnected by relatively short extracellular (EL) and intracellular (IL) loops. The first TMs 1-5 share a similar structural repeat with the following TMs 6-10 but are inverted in the membrane plane (10). The specific arrangement of TM domains, also referred to as the  5+5 or LeuT fold (10), has been observed in other NSS proteins (16-18), but also in transporters without sequence homology to LeuT (19, 20), suggesting the possibility of a conserved structural scaffold for many secondary active transporters (8). The primary binding site for the substrate (S1) and residues involved in coordination of two sodium ions (Na1 and Na2) are located approximately halfway across the membrane bilayer in the core of the transporter (10). The characteristic unwound regions of TMs 1 and 6 (providing both TMs with an a- and a b-section) fulfill a dual role in coordinating the sodium ions and forming interactions with the substrate molecule. Individual amino acid residues of TMs 3 and 8 as well as the sodium occupancy in the Na1 site complete the S1 binding pocket.\\n\\nAccording to the widely embraced  alternating access model (21, 22), secondary active transporters isomerize between distinct functional states in a substrate-dependent manner. That is, the substrate binding site is alternatively exposed to either the intracellular or extracellular aqueous environment. X-ray crystallography provided structures of LeuT in  outward-facing open (11, 12),  outward-facing occluded (10), and  inwardfacing open (11) conformations and led to the identification of external and internal gating residues in LeuT and related transporters (23-26). Based on these structural snapshots, it has been hypothesized that local and large-scale structural rearrangements are required to regulate the molecular gates and the outward-to-inward transition of the transporter, respectively (11). Combined evidence from crystallographic, functional, and simulation studies suggest that the underlying allosteric couplings are essential for LeuT to function as a symporter (27). Several key aspects of the transport cycle, in particular the molecular mechanism related to the transition of LeuT to the inward-facing open state, have remained controversial and are the subject of extensive debate (8, 28-30).\\n\\nHere, we have studied the substrate translocation mechanism of LeuT by measuring the structural dynamics of the protein in solution as a function of time and substrate/ion composition (e.g. leucine, Na+, K+, and Cs+) by local hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). The exchange of hydrogen to deuterium (HDX) of backbone amides in a protein is dependent on the presence and stability of hydrogen bonds and thus provides a sensitive probe for higher-order structure and dynamics of the target protein in solution (31, 32). HDX-MS is a non-perturbing technique that allows the collection of structural dynamics data along the entire protein backbone in a coherent manner without the need for sequence alterations or changes to the covalent structure of the protein for labeling (33). Briefly, the target protein is diluted into deuterated buffer and labeled for various time intervals. The isotopic exchange reaction is quenched by lowering pH and temperature to approximately 2.5 and 0 {degrees}C, respectively, and the protein subsequently digested using an acid-stable protease (e.g. pepsin). Chromatographic separation and mass analysis of these peptides, in turn, reveal the shift in mass over time (i.e., deuterium uptake) of individual regions of the target protein, which is commonly referred to as local HDX analysis. A more detailed background on the HDX-MS technique and its applications in protein science can be found in several reviews (34-37).\\n\\nOur HDX-MS measurements provide a detailed map of LeuT regions involved in conformational changes during substrate transport (TMs 1a/1b/2/5/6a/6b/7 and interconnecting loops IL1/EL2/EL3/EL4b) and allow for the first time an unperturbed global view on the structural dynamics associated with the outward-to-inward transition of the wild-type transporter in solution. Of special interest, our acquired HDX data suggest that several helices (TMs 1a/5/6/7 and EL4b) are partially unwound in the course of substrate transport and that these unfolding events are dynamically coupled between individual helices that form the substrate binding site and the cytoplasmic gate. Addition of Na+ or the combination of Na+ and leucine destabilized discrete structural motifs on the extracellular side, stabilized the inner gate of LeuT, and substantially reduced the rate of unfolding in individual TM helices relative to the K+-bound state. We envisage that partial unwinding of TM helices accompanies the outward-to-inward isomerization in LeuT and that the same concept might be relevant to related transporters bearing the LeuT fold, hence extending the general model of NSS transport mechanism. Moreover, we provide additional experimental evidence for a potential role of K+ in the transport cycle as K+ selectively shifted the conformational equilibrium of LeuT in a dose-dependent manner towards an inwardfacing state under physiologically relevant concentrations.",

We show that knockdown of caspase-8 expression in embryoid bodies derived from ES cells markedly enhances retinoic acid (RA)-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis, both of which are dependent on Ripkl and Ripk3. RA treatment obviously enhanced the expression of RA-specific genes having a retinoic acid response element (RARE) to induce cell differentiation, and induced marked expression of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL to stimulate necroptosis. Caspase-8 knockdown induced RA receptor (RAR) to form a complex with RIPK1 and RIPK3 in the nucleus, and RAR interacting with RIPK1 and RIPK3 showed much stronger binding activity to RARE than RAR without RIPK1 or RIPK3. In Caspase-8-deficient mouse embryos, expression of RA-specific genes was obviously enhanced. Thus, caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3 regulate RA-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.",

Tumors which remodel their glycocalyces, by overexpressing bulky glycoproteins like mucins, exhibit a higher predisposition to metastasize, but the role of mucins in oncogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we report that a bulky glycocalyx promotes the expansion of disseminated tumor cells in vivo by fostering integrin adhesion assembly to permit G1 cell cycle progression. We engineered tumor cells to display glycocalyces of various thicknesses by coating them with synthetic mucin-mimetic glycopolymers. Cells adorned with longer glycopolymers showed increased metastatic potential, enhanced cell cycle progression, and greater levels of integrin-FAK mechanosignaling and Akt signaling in a syngeneic mouse model of metastasis. These effects were mirrored by expression of the ectodomain of cancer-associated mucin MUC1. These findings functionally link mucinous proteins with tumor aggression, and offer a new view of the cancer glycocalyx as a major driver of disease progression.",

Due to the traffic jam of multiple trains at the ciliary tip, how IFT trains are remodeled in these turnaround zones cannot be determined by conventional imaging. Using Photogate, we visualized the full range of movement of single IFT trains and motors in Chlamydomonas flagella. Anterograde trains split apart and IFT complexes mix with each other at the tip to assemble retrograde trains. Dynein-1b is carried to the tip by kinesin-II as inactive cargo on anterograde trains. Unlike dynein-1b, kinesin-II detaches from IFT trains at the tip and diffuses in flagella. As the flagellum grows longer, diffusion delays return of kinesin-II to the basal body, depleting kinesin-II available for anterograde transport. Our results suggest that dissociation of kinesin-II from IFT trains serves as a negative feedback mechanism that facilitates flagellar length control in Chlamydomonas.",

    "abstract": "CRISPRi, an adapted CRISPR-Cas9 system, is proposed to act as a strand-specific roadblock to repress transcription in eukaryotic cells using guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) and offers an alternative to genetic interventions for studying pervasive antisense transcription. Here we successfully use click chemistry to construct DNA templates for sgRNA expression and show, rather than acting simply as a roadblock, binding of sgRNA/dCas9 creates an environment that is permissive for transcription initiation and termination, thus generating novel sense and antisense transcripts. At HMS2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, sgRNA/dCas9 targeting to the non-template strand results in antisense transcription termination, premature termination of a proportion of sense transcripts and initiation of a novel antisense transcript downstream of the sgRNA/dCas9 binding site. This redefinition of the transcriptional landscape by CRISPRi demonstrates that it is not strand-specific and highlights the controls and locus understanding required to properly interpret results from CRISPRi interventions.",

Because microbial interactions could influence the accumulation of V. parahaemolyticus in oysters, we investigated the composition of the microbiome in water and oysters at two ecologically unique sites in the Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire using 16s rRNA profiling. We then evaluated correlations between bacteria inhabiting the oyster with V. parahaemolyticus abundance quantified using a most probable number (MPN) analysis. Even though oysters filter-feed, their microbiomes were not a direct snapshot of the bacterial community in overlaying water, suggesting they selectively accumulate some bacterial phyla. The microbiome of individual oysters harvested more centrally in the bay were relatively more similar to each other and had fewer unique phylotypes, but overall more taxonomic and metabolic diversity, than the microbiomes from tributary-harvested oysters that were individually more variable with lower taxonomic and metabolic diversity. Oysters harvested from the same location varied in V. parahaemolyticus abundance, with the highest abundance oysters collected from one location. This study, which to our knowledge is the first of its kind to evaluate associations of V. parahaemolyticus abundance with members of individual oyster microbiomes, implies that sufficient sampling and depth of sequencing may reveal microbiome members that could impact V. parahaemolyticus abundance.",

    "abstract": "Elevated prefrontal cortex activity is often observed in healthy older adults despite declines in their memory and other cognitive functions. According to one view, this activity reflects a compensatory functional posterior-to-anterior shift, which contributes to maintenance of cognitive performance when posterior cortical function is impaired. Alternatively, the increased prefrontal activity may be less efficient or less specific, owing to structural and neurochemical changes accompanying aging. These accounts are difficult to distinguish on the basis of average activity levels within brain regions. Instead, we used a novel model-based multivariate analysis technique, applied to two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets from an adult-lifespan human sample (N=123 and N=115; approximately half female). Standard analysis replicated the age-related increase in average prefrontal activation, but multivariate tests revealed that this activity did not carry additional information. The results contradict the hypothesis of a compensatory posterior-to-anterior shift. Instead, they suggest that the increased prefrontal activation reflects reduced efficiency or specificity, rather than compensation.\\n\\nSignificance statementFunctional brain imaging studies have often shown increased activity in prefrontal brain regions in older adults. This has been proposed to reflect a compensatory shift to greater reliance on prefrontal cortex, helping to maintain cognitive function. Alternatively, activity may become less specific as people age. This is a key question in the neuroscience of aging. In this study, we used novel tests of how different brain regions contribute to long- and short-term memory. We found increased activity in prefrontal cortex in older adults, but this activity carried less information about memory outcomes than activity in visual regions. These findings are relevant for understanding why cognitive abilities decline with age, suggesting that optimal function depends on successful brain maintenance rather than compensation.",

Twenty-seven retrograde tracer injections were made in 19 areas of a 41 area (plus 7 sub-area) parcellation of the mouse neo-, parahippocampal and perirhinal cortex. Flat mounts of the cortex and multiple histological markers enabled detailed counts of labeled neurons in individual areas. A weight index was determined for each area-to-area pathway based on the Fraction of Extrinsically Labeled Neurons (FLNe). Data analysis allowed cross species comparison with the macaque. Estimation of FLNe statistical variability based on repeat injections revealed high consistency across individuals and justifies using a single injection per area to characterize connectivity. The observed lognormal distribution of connections to each cortical area spanned 5 orders of magnitude and revealed a distinct connectivity profile for each area, analogous to that observed in macaque. The resulting graph has a density of 97% (i.e. 97% of connections that can exist do exist), considerably higher than the 66% density reported for the macaque. Our results provide more sharply defined connectivity profiles and a markedly higher graph density than shown in a recent probabilistic mouse connectome.",

Little is known about the neural representation of punishment that is contingent on reward-guided behavior. We modeled this circumstance by using a task where actions were consistently rewarded but probabilistically punished. Spike activity and local field potentials were recorded during this task simultaneously from VTA and mPFC, two reciprocally connected regions implicated in both reward-seeking and aversive behavioral states. At the single unit level, we found that ensembles of VTA and mPFC neurons encode the contingency between action and punishment. At the network level, we found that coherent theta oscillations synchronize the VTA and mPFC in a bottom-up direction, effectively phase-modulating the neuronal spike activity in the two regions during punishment-free actions. This synchrony declined as a function of punishment contingency, suggesting that during reward-seeking actions, risk of punishment diminishes VTA-driven neural synchrony between the two regions.",

However, it is not yet clear whether the physiological and behavioral benefits associated to physical exercise are caused exclusively by changes in cardiovascular fitness. Here, we explore the relation between regular physical exercise and transient electroencephalographic responses to afferent cardiac signals. We find differences in the neural processing of heartbeats between individuals who exercise regularly and their sedentary counterparts. These differences, localised at two distinct spatio-temporal clusters, occur before the presentation of a target stimulus and correlate with behavioral performance only in the high-fit group. We hypothesise that the different neural processing of afferent cardiac activity by physically trained individuals reflects enhanced interoceptive sensitivity, which contributes to improved sustained attention.

    "abstract": "The insular cortex is a heterogeneous and widely connected brain region. It plays a role in autonomic, cognitive, emotional and somatosensory functions. Its complex and unique cytoarchitecture includes a periallocortical agranular, pro-isocortical dysgranular, and isocortical granular sub-regions. In Parkinsons disease (PD), the insula shows -synuclein inclusions in advanced stages of the disease and its atrophy correlates with cognitive deficits. However, little is known regarding its regional neuropathological characteristics and vulnerability in Lewy body diseases. The aim of this study is to assess the distribution pattern of -synuclein pathology in the insular sub-regions and the selective vulnerability of its different cell types in PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Human post-mortem insular tissues from 10 donors with incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD), PD, DLB, and age-matched controls were immunostained for -synuclein and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP). Results showed that a decreasing gradient of -synuclein pathology was present from agranular to granular sub-regions in iLBD, PD and PD with dementia (PDD) donors. The agranular insula was heavily inflicted, revealing various -synuclein immunoreactive morphological structures, predominantly Lewy neurites (LNs), and astroglial synucleinopathy. While dysgranular and granular sub-regions showed a decreasing gradient of inclusions and more Lewy bodies (LBs) in deeper layers. In DLB, this gradient was less pronounced and severe pathology was observed in the granular insula compared to PDD and regardless of disease stage. Protoplasmic astrocytes showed -synuclein inclusions and severe degenerative changes increasing with disease severity. While few von Economo neurons (VENs) in the fronto-insular region revealed inclusions, particularly in PDD patients. Our study reports novel findings on the differential involvement of the insular sub-regions in PD and particular involvement of the agranular sub-region, VENs and astrocytes. Thus, the differential cellular architecture of the insular sub-regions portrays the topographic variation and vulnerability to -synuclein pathology in Lewy body diseases.",

    "abstract": "Tissue ischemia adversely affects the function of mitochondria, which results in impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and compromised recovery of the affected organ. The impact of ischemia on mitochondrial function has been most extensively studied in the heart because of the morbidity and mortality associated with injury to this organ. Because conventional methods to preserve cell viability and function following an ischemic injury are limited in their efficacy, we developed a unique approach to protect the heart by transplanting respiration-competent mitochondria isolated from a non-ischemic tissue to the ischemic region. Our experiments in animals have shown that transplantation of isolated mitochondria to injured heart tissue leads to decreases in cell death, increases in energy production, and improvements in contractile function. We also discovered that exogenously-derived mitochondria injected or perfused into ischemic hearts were readily internalized by cardiac cells through actin-dependent endocytosis. Here, we describe the use of three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to determine the intracellular fate of exogenous mitochondria in non-dividing human iPS-derived cardiomyocytes and dividing primary human cardiac fibroblasts. We show isolated mitochondria are internalised in human cardiac cells within minutes and then transported to endosomes and lysosomes. The majority of exogenous mitochondria escape from these compartments and fuse with the endogenous mitochondrial network, while some organelles are degraded through hydrolysis. Understanding this process may guide the development of treatments directed at replacing or augmenting impaired mitochondria in ischemic tissues and provide new options to rejuvenate dysfunctional mitochondria in a wide range of human diseases and disorders.",

    "abstract": "Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) is a pest of potato throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but little is known about the beetles origins as a pest. To determine the origins of pest populations of CPB, we sampled the beetle from uncultivated Solanum host plants in Mexico, and from pest and non-pest populations in the U.S. We used mtDNA and nuclear loci to examine three hypotheses on the origin of the pest lineages: 1) the pest beetles originated from Mexican populations, 2) the pest beetles descended from hybridization between previously divergent populations, or 3) the pest beetles descended from populations that are native to the Plains states in the United States. We examined patterns of genetic diversity among geographic regions in order to detect invasion-related genetic information. Mitochondrial haplotypes of non-pest populations from Mexico and southern Arizona differed substantially from beetles collected from the southern plains and potato fields in the U. S., indicating that beetles from Mexico and Arizona did not contribute to founding the pest lineages. Similar results were observed for AFLP and microsatellite data. In contrast, non-pest populations from the southern plains of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas were genetically similar to U. S. pest populations, clearly indicating that they contributed to the founding of the pest lineages. Although some pest populations are less genetically diverse (e.g., Washington, Idaho), most of the pest populations do not show a significant reduction in genetic diversity compared to the plains populations in the U. S. In contrast to the colonization patterns typical of exotic pests, our analyses suggests that a large genetically heterogeneous beetle populations expanded onto potato from native Solanum hosts. As an endemic colonization of a novel host plant, this host range expansion may have contributed to the relatively abundant genetic diversity of contemporary populations, perhaps contributing to the rapid evolution of host range and insecticide resistance in this widely successful insect pest.",

    "abstract": "The influence of population size (N) on natural selection acting on alleles that affect fitness has been understood for over half a century1. As N declines, genetic drift overwhelms selection and alleles with direct fitness effects are rendered neutral. Often, though, alleles experience so called indirect selection, meaning they affect not the fitness of an individual but the fitness distribution of its offspring. Some of the best studied examples of indirect selection include alleles that modify aspects of the genetic system such as recombination2 and mutation3 rates. Here we use analytics, simulations and experimental populations of S. cerevisiae to show that modifiers that increase the genomic mutation rate (mutators) are favored by indirect selection in large populations but become disfavored as N declines. This surprising phenomenon of sign inversion in selective effect demonstrates that indirect selection on a mutator exhibits a qualitatively novel dependence on N. Sign inversion may help understand the relatively sporadic distribution of mutators in nature despite their frequent emergence in laboratory populations. More generally, sign inversion may be broadly applicable to other instances of indirect selection, suggesting a previously unappreciated but critical role of population size in evolution.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression variation is extensive in nature, and is hypothesized to play a major role in shaping phenotypic diversity. However, connecting differences in gene expression across individuals to higher-order organismal traits is not trivial. In many cases, gene expression variation may be evolutionarily neutral, and in other cases expression variation may only affect phenotype under specific conditions. To understand connections between gene expression variation and stress defense phenotypes, we have been leveraging extensive natural variation in the gene expression response to acute ethanol in laboratory and wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Previous work found that the genetic architecture underlying these expression differences included dozens of \\\"hotspot\\\" loci that affected many transcripts in trans. In the present study, we provide new evidence that one of these expression QTL hotspot loci is responsible for natural variation in one particular stress defense phenotype--ethanol-induced cross protection against severe doses of H2O2. The causative polymorphism is in the heme-activated transcription factor Hap1p, which we show directly impacts cross protection, but not the basal H2O2 resistance of unstressed cells. This provides further support that distinct cellular mechanisms underlie basal and acquired stress resistance. We also show that the Hap1p-dependent cross protection relies on novel regulation of cytosolic catalase T (Ctt1p) during ethanol stress in wild strains. Because ethanol accumulation precedes aerobic respiration and accompanying reactive oxygen species formation, wild strains with the ability to anticipate impending oxidative stress would likely be at an advantage. This study highlights how strategically chosen traits that better correlate with gene expression changes can improve our power to identify novel connections between gene expression variation and higher-order organismal phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.",

    "abstract": "Normal nervous system function is critically dependent on the balance of water and ions in the extracellular space. Pathological reduction in brain interstitial osmolarity results in osmotically-driven flux of water into cells, causing cellular edema which reduces the extracellular space and increases neuronal excitability and risk of seizures. Astrocytes are widely considered to be particularly susceptible to cellular edema due to selective expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). The apparent resistance of pyramidal neurons to osmotic swelling has been attributed to lack of functional water channels. In this study we report rapid volume changes in CA1 pyramidal cells in hypoosmolar ACSF (hACSF) that are equivalent to volume changes in astrocytes across a variety of conditions. Astrocyte and neuronal swelling was significant within 1 minute of exposure to 17 or 40% hACSF, was rapidly reversible upon return to normosmolar ACSF, and repeatable upon re-exposure to hACSF. Neuronal swelling was not an artifact of patch clamp, occurred deep in tissue, was similar at physiological vs. room temperature, and occurred in both juvenile and adult hippocampal slices. Neuronal swelling was neither inhibited by TTX, nor by antagonists of NMDA or AMPA receptors, suggesting that it was not occurring as a result of excitotoxicity. Surprisingly, genetic deletion of AQP4 did not inhibit, but rather augmented, astrocyte swelling in severe hypoosmolar conditions. Taken together, our results indicate that neurons are not osmoresistant as previously reported, and that osmotic swelling is driven by an AQP4-independent mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Subtelomeric macrosatellite repeats are difficult to sequence using conventional sequencing methods owing to the high similarity among repeat units and high GC content. Sequencing these repetitive regions is challenging, even with recent improvements in sequencing technologies. Among these repeats, a haplotype of the telomeric sequence and shortening of the D4Z4 array on human chromosome 4q35 causes one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy with autosomal-dominant inheritance, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Here, we applied a nanopore-based ultra-long read sequencer to sequence a BAC clone containing 13 D4Z4 repeats and flanking regions. We successfully obtained the whole D4Z4 repeat sequence, including the pathogenic gene DUX4 in the last D4Z4 repeat. The estimated sequence accuracy of the total repeat region was 99.7% based on a comparison with the reference sequence. Errors were typically observed between purine or between pyrimidine bases. Further, we analyzed the D4Z4 sequence from publicly available ultra-long whole human genome sequencing data obtained by nanopore sequencing. This technology may become a new standard for the molecular diagnosis of FSHD in the future and has the potential to widen our understanding of subtelomeric regions.",

However, the genetic variation that contributes to BDR is largely undefined in African Americans with asthma3\\n\\nObjectiveTo identify genetic variants that may contribute to differences in BDR in African Americans with asthma.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a genome-wide association study of BDR in 949 African American children with asthma, genotyped with the Axiom World Array 4 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) followed by imputation using 1000 Genomes phase 3 genotypes. We used linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and genetic ancestry to test for an association between BDR and genotype at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To increase power and distinguish between shared vs. population-specific associations with BDR in children with asthma, we performed a meta-analysis across 949 African Americans and 1,830 Latinos (Total=2,779). Lastly, we performed genome-wide admixture mapping to identify regions whereby local African or European ancestry is associated with BDR in African Americans. Two additional populations of 416 Latinos and 1,325 African Americans were used to replicate significant associations.\\n\\nResultsWe identified a population-specific association with an intergenic SNP on chromosome 9q21 that was significantly associated with BDR (rs73650726, p=7.69 x 10-9).

Morphology of young sheaths suggests the scaffold chains have strong self-adhesion. Evidence from un-encapsulated cells indicates fresh scaffold production through cell walls. Simple diffusion arguments are used to explain the morphology of the sheath structure. We propose a novel cell motility model based on previously published video data, our AFM images of naked cells, and simple flow calculations. The model indicates that motility results from differential shear forces resulting from extrusion of sheath material that passively pushes a filament of connected cells forward as the surrounding sheath material hardens behind the cell train.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal varies according to task performance and region specificity. This ongoing and fluctuating activity reflects the organization of functional brain networks. Peculiar dynamics of BOLD signal are therefore supposed to characterize brain activity in different conditions. Within this framework, we investigated through a multivoxel pattern analysis whether patterns of BOLD variability convey information that may allow an efficient discrimination between task (i.e., painful stimulation) and rest conditions. We therefore identified the most discriminative brain areas between the two conditions, which turned out to be the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, posterior insula, the thalamus, and the periaqueductal gray. Then, on the basis of information theory, we calculated the entropy of their different time series. Entropy was found to distribute differently between these brain areas. The posterior insula was found to be is the smaller contributor to the entropy rate, whereas the system formed by the thalamus and periaqueductal gray was found to be the major contributor. Overall, the brain system reaches a higher level of entropy during the rest condition, which suggests that cerebral activity is characterized by a larger informational space when the brain is at rest than when it is engaged in a specific task. Thus, this study provides evidence that: i) the pattern of BOLD variance allow a good discrimination between the conditions of rest and pain stimulation; ii) the discriminative pattern resembles closely that of the functional network that has been called pain matrix; iii) brain areas with high and low variability are characterized by a different sample entropy; iv) the entropy rate of cerebral regions can be an insightful parameter to better understand the complex dynamics of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that neurons in sensorimotor circuits involved in perceptual decision-making also play a role in decision confidence. In these studies, confidence is often considered to be an optimal readout of the probability that a decision is correct. However, the information leading to decision accuracy and the report of confidence often co-varied, leaving open the possibility that there are actually two dissociable signal types in the brain: signals that correlate with decision accuracy (optimal confidence) and signals that correlate with subjects behavioral reports of confidence (subjective confidence). We recorded neuronal activity from a sensorimotor decision area, the superior colliculus (SC) of monkeys, while they performed two different tasks. In our first task, decision accuracy and confidence co-varied, as in previous studies. In our second task, we implemented a novel motion discrimination task with stimuli that were matched for decision accuracy but produced different levels of confidence as reflected by behavioral reports. We used a multivariate decoder to predict monkeys choices from neuronal population activity. As in previous studies on perceptual decision-making mechanisms, we found that neuronal decoding performance increased as decision accuracy increased. However, when decision accuracy was matched, performance of the decoder was similar between high and low subjective confidence conditions. These results show that the SC likely signals optimal decision confidence similar to previously reported cortical mechanisms, but is unlikely to play a critical role in subjective confidence. The results also motivate future investigations to determine where in the brain signals related to subjective confidence reside.\\n\\nSignificance StatementConfidence is thought to reflect the rational or optimal belief concerning ones choice accuracy. Here, we introduce a novel version of the dot-motion discrimination task with stimulus conditions that produce similar accuracy but different subjective behavioral reports of confidence. We decoded decision performance of this task from neuronal signals in the superior colliculus (SC), a subcortical region involved in decision-making. We found that SC activity signaled a perceptual decision for visual stimuli, with the strength of this activity reflecting decision accuracy, but not the subjective level of confidence as reflected by behavioral reports. These results demonstrate an important role for the SC in perceptual decision-making and challenge current ideas about how to measure subjective confidence in monkeys and humans.",

    "abstract": "Measures of whole-brain activity, from techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, provide a means to observe the brains dynamical operations. However, interpretation of whole-brain dynamics has been stymied by the inherently high-dimensional structure of brain activity. The present research addresses this challenge through a series of scale transformations in the spectral, spatial, and relational domains. Instantaneous multispectral dynamics are first developed from input data via a wavelet filter bank. Voxel-level signals are then projected onto a representative set of spatially independent components. The correlation distance over the instantaneous wavelet-ICA state vectors is a graph that may be embedded onto a lower-dimensional space to assist the interpretation of state-space dynamics. Applying this procedure to a large sample of resting and task data (acquired through the Human Connectome Project), we segment the empirical state space into a continuum of stimulus-dependent brain states. We also demonstrate that resting brain activity includes brain states that are very similar to those adopted during some tasks, as well as brain states that are distinct from experimentally-defined tasks. Back-projection of segmented brain states onto the brains surface reveals the patterns of brain activity that support each experimental state.",

Pseudotemporal ordering of 1023 cellular responses to manipulation of sensory input demonstrates that changes in expression of activity-induced genes both reinforced cell-type identity and contributed to increased transcriptional heterogeneity within each cell type. This is due to cell-type specific biases in the choice of transcriptional states following manipulation of neuronal activity. These results reveal that axonal projection pattern, laminar position, and activity state define significant axes of variation that contribute both to the transcriptional identity of individual neurons and to the transcriptional heterogeneity within each neuronal subtype.",

Here we assessed the causal relationship between fasting insulin and adiposity using publicly-available results from two large-scale genome-wide association studies for body mass index and fasting insulin levels in a two-sample, bidirectional Mendelian Randomized approach. This approach is only valid on the condition that the two instruments are independent of one another. In analysis excluding overlapping loci, there was an increase of 0.20 (0.17, 0.23) log pmol/L fasting insulin per SD increase in BMI (P= 2.80 x 10-36), while there was a null effect of fasting insulin on BMI, with a 0.01 (-0.39, 0.38) SD decrease in BMI per log pmol/L increase in fasting insulin (P= 0.98). Furthermore, a high degree of heterogeneity in the causal estimates was obtained from the insulin-related variants, which may be attributed to varying mechanisms of action of the insulin-associated variants. Results were largely consistent when an Egger regression technique and weighted median and mode estimators were applied. Findings suggest that the positive correlation between adiposity and fasting insulin levels are at least in part explained by the causal effect of adiposity on increasing insulin, rather than vice versa.",

The model estimates both changes in abundances of benthic groups and their compositional turn-over, a type of beta-diversity. We detect compositional turnover across the gradient and use the model to predict the footprint of turbidity impacts from logging. We then apply the model to predict impacts of recent logging activities, finding recent impacts to be small, because recent logging has occurred far from lagoonal reefs. Our model can be used more generally to estimate the footprint of human impacts on ecosystems and evaluate the benefits of conservation actions for ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMyocardial injury, as reflected by elevated cardiac troponin levels in plasma, is common in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but its temporal dynamics and etiology remain unknown. Our aim was to determine the incidence of troponin release in patients with CAP and identify risk factors which may point to underlying etiologic mechanisms.\\n\\nMethodsWe included consecutive patients admitted with severe CAP to two intensive care units in the Netherlands between 2011 and 2015. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I was measured daily during the first week. We used multivariable linear regression to identify variables associated with troponin release on admission, and mixed-effects regression to model the daily rise and fall of troponin levels over time.\\n\\nResultsAmong 200 eligible patients, 179 were included, yielding 792 observation days. A total of 152 (85%) patients developed raised troponin levels >26 ng/L. Baseline factors independently associated with troponin release included coronary artery disease (160% increase, 95% CI 7-529), smoking (304% increase, 95% CI 59-924), and higher APACHE IV score (2% increase, 95% CI 0.7-3.3), whereas Staphylococcus aureus as a causative pathogen was protective (67% reduction, 95% CI 9-88). Time-dependent risk factors independently associated with daily increase in troponin concentrations included reduced platelet count (1.7% increase, 95% CI 0.1-3.4), tachycardia (1.6% increase, 95% CI 0.3-3), hypotension (5.1% increase, 95% CI 1-9.4) and dobutamine use (38.4% increase 95% CI 8.8-76).\\n\\nConclusionsCardiac injury develops in a majority of patients with severe CAP. Myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch and activated coagulation are potential causes of this injury.",

    "abstract": "During outbreaks of deadly emerging pathogens (e.g., Ebola, MERS-CoV) and bioterror threats (e.g., smallpox), actively monitoring potentially infected individuals aims to limit disease transmission and morbidity. Guidance issued by CDC on active monitoring was a cornerstone of its response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak. There are limited data on how to balance the costs and performance of this important public health activity. We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York Citys Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014-2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at \\\"low (but not zero) risk\\\" and \\\"some or high risk\\\": 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods. Active monitoring can save lives but is expensive. Resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure-risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring.",

NK deficiency can result in severe or refractory viral infections. Patients with Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)1 gain of function (GOF) mutations have increased viral susceptibility.\\n\\nObjectiveWe sought to investigate NK cell function in STAT1 GOF patients. Methods: NK cell phenotype and function were determined in 16 STAT1 GOF patients.\\n\\nMethodsNK cell phenotype and function were determined in 16 STAT1 GOF patients.NK cell lines expressing patient mutations were generated with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing. STAT1 GOF NK cells were treated in vitro with ruxolitinib.\\n\\nResultsPeripheral blood NK cells from of STAT1 GOF patients had impaired terminal maturation. Specifically, patients with STAT1 GOF mutations have immature CD56dim NK cells with decreased expression of CD16, perforin, CD57 and impaired cytolytic function. STAT1 phosphorylation was elevated but STAT5 was aberrantly phosphorylated in response to IL-2 stimulation. Upstream inhibition of STAT signaling with the small molecule JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in vitro and in vivo restored perforin expression in CD56dim NK cells and partially restored NK cell cytotoxic function.\\n\\nConclusionsProperly regulated STAT1 signaling is critical for NK cell maturation and function. Modulation of elevated STAT1 phosphorylation with ruxolitinib is an important option for therapeutic intervention in patients with STAT1 GOF mutations.",

    "abstract": "The neurophysiological processes underlying non-invasive brain activity measurements are not well understood. Here, we developed a novel connectome-based brain network model that integrates individual structural and functional data with neural population dynamics to support multi-scale neurophysiological inference. Simulated populations were linked by structural connectivity and, as a novelty, driven by electroencephalography (EEG) source activity. Simulations not only predicted subjects individual resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and spatial network topologies over 20 minutes of activity, but more importantly, they also revealed precise neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie and link six empirical observations from different scales and modalities: (1) slow resting-state fMRI oscillations, (2) spatial topologies of functional connectivity networks, (3) excitation-inhibition balance, (4, 5) pulsed inhibition on short and long time scales, and (6) fMRI power-law scaling. These findings underscore the potential of this new modelling framework for general inference and integration of neurophysiological knowledge to complement empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "Growing concerns about the quality of aggregated biodiversity data are lowering trust in large-scale data networks. Aggregators frequently respond to quality concerns by recommending that biologists work with original data providers to correct errors \\\"at the source\\\". We show that this strategy falls systematically short of a full diagnosis of the underlying causes of distrust. In particular, trust in an aggregator is not just a feature of the data signal quality provided by the sources to the aggregator, but also a consequence of the social design of the aggregation process and the resulting power balance between individual data contributors and aggregators. The latter have created an accountability gap by downplaying the authorship and significance of the taxonomic hierarchies - frequently called \\\"backbones\\\" - they generate, and which are in effect novel classification theories that operate at the core of data-structuring process. The Darwin Core standard for sharing occurrence records plays an under-appreciated role in maintaining the accountability gap, because this standard lacks the syntactic structure needed to preserve the taxonomic coherence of data packages submitted for aggregation, potentially leading to inferences that no individual source would support. Since high-quality data packages can mirror competing and conflicting classifications, i.e., unsettled systematic research, this plurality must be accommodated in the design of biodiversity data integration. Looking forward, a key directive is to develop new technical pathways and social incentives for experts to contribute directly to the validation of taxonomically coherent data packages as part of a greater, trustworthy aggregation process.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIssues of balancing data accessibility with ethical considerations and governance of a genomics research biobank, Generation Scotland, are explored within the evolving policy landscape of the past ten years. During this time data sharing and open data access have become increasingly important topics in biomedical research. Decisions around data access are influenced by local arrangements for governance and practices such as linkage to health records, and the global through policies for biobanking and the sharing of data with large-scale biomedical research data resources and consortia.\\n\\nMethodsWe use a literature review of policy relevant documents which apply to the conduct of biobanks in two areas: support for open access and the protection of data subjects and researchers managing a bioresource. We present examples of decision making within a biobank based upon observations of the Generation Scotland Access Committee. We reflect upon how the drive towards open access raises ethical dilemmas for established biorepositories containing data and samples from human subjects.\\n\\nResultsDespite much discussion in science policy literature about standardisation, the contextual aspects of biobanking are often overlooked. Using our engagement with GS we demonstrate the importance of local arrangements in the creation of a responsive ethical approach to biorepository governance. We argue that governance decisions regarding access to the biobank are intertwined with considerations about maintenance and viability at the local level. We show that in addition to the focus upon ever more universal and standardised practices, the local expertise gained in the management of such repositories must be supported.\\n\\nConclusionsA commitment to open access in genomics research has found almost universal backing in science and health policy circles, but repositories of data and samples from human subjects may have to operate under managed access, to protect privacy, align with participant consent and ensure that the resource can be managed in a sustainable way. Data access committees need to be reflexive and flexible, to cope with changing technology and opportunities and threats from the wider data sharing environment. To understand these interactions also involves nurturing what is particular about the biobank in its local context.",
