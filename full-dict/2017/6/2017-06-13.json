    "abstract": "Cell adhesion molecules are key to axon guidance during development, for example specific cues can instruct axons to terminate in a specific area, or to continue growth. Syndecans are conserved cell-surface receptors that function in multiple developmental contexts. Caenorhabditis elegans with mutations in the single syndecan gene, sdn-1, exhibited errors in anterior-posterior guidance, with axons that stopped short of, or grew past their stereotypical termination point. Syndecan function was cell non-autonomous for GABAergic axon outgrowth during early development, but was likely cell autonomous to inhibit growth later in development. sdn-1 appeared to regulate the inhibitory activity of the egl-20/Wnt ligand. Removing egl-20 from sdn-1 mutants resulted in fewer animals with prematurely terminating axons. The proteoglycan modifying enzymes hse-5 and hst-2, but not hst-6, had similar effects, suggesting specific heparan sulfate modifications regulated EGL-20 axon-terminating activity. sdn-1 functioned with lin-17/Frizzled, bar-1/{beta}-catenin and the egl-5 Hox-like transcription factor in EGL-20-depedent axon outgrowth. bar-1 was required for egl-5 expression in the most posterior GABAergic neurons. sdn-1 mutations did not eliminate egl-5 expression, but over-expression of egl-5 rescued sdn-1 phenotypes. Our results suggest syndecan is a component of Wnt-signaling events that are necessary for axons to recognize appropriate termination points.",

    "abstract": "Species diversity varies greatly across the different taxonomic groups that comprise the Tree of Life (ToL). This imbalance is particularly conspicuous within angiosperms, but is largely unexplained. Seed mass is one trait that may help clarify why some lineages diversify more than others because it confers adaptation to different environments, which can subsequently influence speciation and extinction. The rate at which seed mass changes across the angiosperm phylogeny may also be linked to diversification by increasing reproductive isolation and allowing access to novel ecological niches. However, the magnitude and direction of the association between seed mass and diversification has not been assessed across the angiosperm phylogeny. Here, we show that absolute seed size and the rate of change in seed size are both associated with variation in diversification rates. Based on the largest available angiosperm phylogenetic tree, we found that smaller-seeded plants had higher rates of diversification, possibly due to improved colonisation potential. The rate of phenotypic change in seed size was also strongly positively correlated with speciation rates, providing rare, large-scale evidence that rapid morphological change is associated with species divergence. Our study now reveals that variation in morphological traits and, importantly, the rate at which they evolve can contribute to explaining the extremely uneven distribution of diversity across the ToL.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary history of vertebrates is marked by three ancient whole-genome duplications: two successive rounds in the ancestor of vertebrates, and a third one specific to teleost fishes. Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for specific genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebrafish and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in non-renewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.",

    "abstract": "We use an oligonucleotide library of over 10000 variants together with a synthetic biology approach to identify an insulation mechanism encoded within a subset of {sigma}54 promoters. Insulation manifests itself as dramatically reduced protein expression for a downstream gene that may be expressed by transcriptional read-through. The insulation we observe is strongly associated with the presence of short CT-rich motifs (3-5 bp), positioned within 25 bp upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif of the silenced gene. We hypothesize that insulation is effected by binding of the RBS to the upstream CT-rich motif. We provide evidence to support this hypothesis using mutations to the CT-rich motif and gene expression measurements on multiple sequence variants. Modelling is also consistent with this hypothesis. We show that the strength of the silencing, effected by insulation, depends on the location and number of CT-rich motifs encoded within the promoters. Finally, we show that in E.coli these insulator sequences are preferentially encoded within {sigma}54 promoters as compared to other promoter types, suggesting a regulatory role for these sequences in natural contexts. Our findings suggest that context-related regulatory effects may often be due to sequence-specific interactions encoded sparsely by short motifs that are not easily detected by lower throughput studies. Such short sequence-specific phenomena can be uncovered with a focused OL design that filters out the sequence noise, as exemplified herein.",

    "abstract": "The antimicrobial triclosan is used in a wide range of consumer products ranging from toothpaste, cleansers, socks, and baby toys. A bacteriostatic inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis, triclosan is extremely stable and accumulates in the environment. Approximately 75% of adults in the US have detectable levels of the compound in their urine, with a sizeable fraction of individuals (>10%) having urine concentrations equal to or greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration for Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Previous work has identified connections between defects in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which has been repeatedly associated with antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Based on these data, we hypothesized that triclosan exposure may inadvertently drive bacteria into a state in which they are able to tolerate normally lethal concentrations of antibiotics. Here we report that clinically relevant concentrations of triclosan increased E. coli and MRSA tolerance to bactericidal antibiotics as much as 10,000 fold in vitro and reduced antibiotic efficacy up to 100-fold in a mouse urinary tract infection model. Genetic analysis indicated that triclosan-mediated antibiotic tolerance requires ppGpp synthesis, but is independent of growth. These data highlight an unexpected and certainly unintended consequence of adding high concentrations of antimicrobials in consumer products, supporting an urgent need to reevaluate the costs and benefits of the prophylactic use of triclosan and other bacteriostatic compounds.\\n\\nImportanceAdded as a prophylactic to a wide range of consumer products, the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor triclosan accumulates to high levels in humans and the environment. Based on links between defects in fatty acid synthesis and accumulation of the alarmone ppGpp, we hypothesized that triclosan would render cells tolerant to bactericidal compounds due to ppGpp-mediated inhibition of biosynthetic capacity. Our data indicate that clinically relevant concentrations of triclosan induces higher tolerance of E. coli and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to a panel of bactericidal antibiotics up to 10,000-fold. In a urinary tract infection model, mice exposed to triclosan exhibited bacterial loads ~100-fold higher in the bladder than control animals following ciprofloxacin challenge.

    "abstract": "Marine regions that have seasonal to long-term low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, sometimes called  dead zones, are increasing in number and severity around the globe with deleterious effects on ecology and economics. One of the largest of these coastal dead zones occurs on the continental shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM), which results from eutrophication-enhanced bacterioplankton respiration and strong seasonal stratification. Previous research in this dead zone revealed the presence of multiple cosmopolitan bacterioplankton lineages that have eluded cultivation, and thus their metabolic roles in this ecosystem remain unknown. We used a coupled shotgun metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach to determine the metabolic potential of Marine Group II Euryarchaeota, SAR406, and SAR202. We recovered multiple high-quality, nearly complete genomes from all three groups as well as those belonging to Candidate Phyla usually associated with anoxic environments-Parcubacteria (OD1) and Peregrinibacteria. Two additional groups with putative assignments to ACD39 and PAUC34f supplement the metabolic contributions by uncultivated taxa. Our results indicate active metabolism in all groups, including prevalent aerobic respiration, with concurrent expression of genes for nitrate reduction in SAR406 and SAR202, and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonia and sulfur reduction by SAR406. We also report a variety of active heterotrophic carbon processing mechanisms, including degradation of complex carbohydrate compounds by SAR406, SAR202, ACD39, and PAUC34f. Together, these data help constrain the metabolic contributions from uncultivated groups in the nGOM during periods of low DO and suggest roles for these organisms in the breakdown of complex organic matter.\\n\\nImportanceDead zones receive their name primarily from the reduction of eukaryotic macrobiota (demersal fish, shrimp, etc.) that are also key coastal fisheries. Excess nutrients contributed from anthropogenic activity such as fertilizer runoff result in algal blooms and therefore ample new carbon for aerobic microbial metabolism. Combined with strong stratification, microbial respiration reduces oxygen in shelf bottom waters to levels unfit for many animals (termed hypoxia). The nGOM shelf remains one of the largest eutrophication-driven hypoxic zones in the world, yet despite its potential as a model study system, the microbial metabolisms underlying and resulting from this phenomenon--many of which occur in bacterioplankton from poorly understood lineages--have received only preliminary study. Our work details the metabolic potential and gene expression activity for uncultivated lineages across several low DO sites in the nGOM, improving our understanding of the active biogeochemical cycling mediated by these \\\"microbial dark matter\\\" taxa during hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of SNPs responsible for variation in human quantitative traits. However, genome-wide-significant associations often fail to replicate across independent cohorts, in apparent inconsistency with their apparent strong effects in discovery cohorts. This limited success of replication raises pervasive questions about the utility of the GWAS field. We identify all 332 studies of quantitative traits from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Database with attempted replication. We find that the majority of studies provide insufficient data to evaluate replication rates. The remaining papers replicate significantly worse than expected (p < 10-14), even when adjusting for regression-to-the-mean of effect size between discovery- and replication-cohorts termed the Winners Curse (p < 10-16). We show this is due in part to misreporting replication cohort-size as a maximum number, rather than per-locus one. In 39 studies accurately reporting per-locus cohort-size for attempted replication of 707 loci in samples with similar ancestry, replication rate matched expectation (predicted 458, observed 457, p = 0.94). In contrast, ancestry differences between replication and discovery (13 studies, 385 loci) cause the most highly-powered decile of loci to replicate worse than expected, due to difference in linkage disequilibrium.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe majority of associations between common genetic variation and human traits come from genome-wide association studies, which have analyzed millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in millions of samples. These kinds of studies pose serious statistical challenges to discovering new associations. Finite resources restrict the number of candidate associations that can brought forward into validation samples, introducing the need for a significance threshold. This threshold creates a phenomenon called the Winners Curse, in which candidate associations close to the discovery threshold are more likely to have biased overestimates of the variants true association in the sampled population. We survey all human quantitative trait association studies that validated at least one signal. We find the majority of these studies do not publish sufficient information to actually support their claims of replication. For studies that did, we computationally correct the Winners Curse and evaluate replication performance. While all variants combined replicate significantly less than expected, we find that the subset of studies that (1) perform both discovery and replication in samples of the same ancestry; and (2) report accurate per-variant sample sizes, replicate as expected. This study provides strong, rigorous evidence for the broad reliability of genome-wide association studies. We furthermore provide a model for more efficient selection of variants as candidates for replication, as selecting variants using cursed discovery data enriches for variants with little real evidence for trait association.",

    "abstract": "The repeat region of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a major vaccine antigen because it can be targeted by parasite neutralizing antibodies; however, little is known about this interaction. We used isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis-validated modeling to analyze the binding of a murine neutralizing antibody to Plasmodium falciparum CSP. Strikingly, we found that the repeat region of CSP is bound by multiple antibodies. This repeating pattern allows multiple weak interactions of single FAB domains to accumulate and yield a complex with a dissociation constant in the low nM range. Because the CSP protein can potentially cross-link multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) we hypothesized that the B cell response might be T cell independent. However, while there was a modest response in mice deficient in T cell help, the bulk of the response was T cell dependent. By sequencing the BCRs of CSP-repeat specific B cells in inbred mice we found that these cells underwent somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation indicative of a T-dependent response. Last, we found that the BCR repertoire of responding B cells was limited suggesting that the structural simplicity of the repeat may limit the breadth of the immune response.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryVaccines aim to protect by inducing the immune system to make molecules called antibodies that can recognize molecules on the surface of invading pathogens. In the case of malaria, our most advanced vaccine candidates aim to promote the production of antibodies that recognize the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) molecule on the surface of the invasive parasite stage called the sporozoite. In this report we use X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of CSP-binding antibodies at the atomic level. We use other techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry and structural modeling to examine how this antibody interacts with the CSP molecule. Strikingly, we found that each CSP molecule could bind 6 antibodies. This finding has implications for the immune response and may explain why high titers of antibody are needed for protection. Moreover, because the structure of the CSP repeat is quite simple we determined that the number of different kinds of antibodies that could bind this molecule are quite small. However a high avidity interaction between those antibodies and CSP can result from a process called affinity maturation that allows the body to learn how to make improved antibodies specific for pathogen molecules. These data show that while it is challenging for the immune system to recognize and neutralize CSP, it should be possible to generate viable vaccines targeting this molecule.",

    "abstract": "It is well documented that the tumor microenvironment profoundly impacts the etiology and progression of breast cancer, yet the contribution of the resident microbiome within breast tissue remains poorly understood. Tumor microenvironmental conditions, such as hypoxia and dense tumor stroma, predispose progressive phenotypes and therapy resistance, however the role of bacteria in this interplay remains uncharacterized. We hypothesized that the effect of individual bacterial secreted molecules on breast cancer viability and proliferation would be modulated by these tumor-relevant stressors differentially for cells at varying stages of progression. To test this, we incubated human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF-DCIS.com) and non-malignant breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) with N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), a quorum-sensing molecule from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that regulates bacterial stress responses. This molecule was selected because Pseudomonas was recently characterized as a significant fraction of the breast tissue microbiome and OdDHL is documented to impact mammalian cell viability. After OdDHL treatment, we demonstrated the greatest decrease in viability with the more malignant MDAMB-231 cells and an intermediate MCF-DCIS.com (ductal carcinoma in situ) response. The responses were also culture condition (i.e. microenvironment) dependent. These results contrast the MCF-10A response, which demonstrated no change in viability in any culture condition. We further determined that the observed trends in breast cancer viability were due to modulation of proliferation for both cell types, as well as the induction of necrosis for MDA-MB-231 cells in all conditions. Our results provide evidence that bacterial quorum-sensing molecules interact with the host tissue environment to modulate breast cancer viability and proliferation, and that the effect of OdDHL is dependent on both cell type as well as microenvironment. Understanding the interactions between bacterial signaling molecules and the host tissue environment will allow for future studies that determine the contribution of bacteria to the onset, progression, and therapy response of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "The motor system prepares for movements well in advance of their execution. In the gaze control system, premotor neurons that produce a burst of activity for the movement are also active leading up to the saccade. The dynamics of preparatory neural activity have been well described by stochastic accumulator models, and variability in the accumulation dynamics has been shown to be correlated with reaction times of the eventual saccade, but it is unclear whether this activity is purely preparatory in nature or has features indicative of a hidden movement command. We explicitly tested whether preparatory neural activity in premotor neurons of the primate superior colliculus has \\\"motor potential\\\". We removed inhibition on the saccadic system using reflex blinks, which turn off downstream gating, and found that saccades can be initiated before underlying activity reaches levels seen under normal conditions. Accumulating low-frequency activity was predictive of eye movement dynamics tens of milliseconds in advance of the actual saccade, indicating the presence of a latent movement command. We also show that reaching threshold is not a necessary condition for movement initiation, contrary to the postulates of accumulation-to-threshold models. The results bring into question extant models of saccade generation and support the possibility of a concurrent representation for movement preparation and generation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHow the brain plans for upcoming actions before deciding to initiate them is a central question in neuroscience. Popular theories suggest that movement planning and execution occur in serial stages, separated by a decision boundary in neural activity space (e.g., \\\"threshold\\\"), which needs to be crossed before the movement is executed. By removing inhibitory gating on the motor system, we show here that the activity required to initiate a saccade can be flexibly modulated. We also show that evolving activity during movement planning is a hidden motor command. The results have important implications for our understanding of how movements are generated, in addition to providing useful information for decoding movement intention based on planning-related activity.\\n\\nImpact StatementNon-invasive disinhibition of the oculomotor system shows that ongoing preparatory activity in the superior colliculus has movement-generating potential and need not rise to threshold in order to produce a saccade.",

    "abstract": "Many components of host-parasite interactions have been shown to affect the way virulence (i.e., parasite-induced harm to the host) evolves. However, coevolution of multiple parasite traits is often neglected. We explore how an immunosuppressive mechanism of parasites affects and co-evolves with virulence through multiple infections. Applying the adaptive dynamics framework to epidemiological models with coinfection, we show that immunosuppression is a double-edged-sword for the evolution of virulence. On one hand, it amplifies the adaptive benefit of virulence by increasing the abundance of coinfections through epidemiological feedbacks. On the other hand, immunosuppression hinders host recovery, prolonging the duration of infection and elevating the cost of killing the host. The balance between the cost and benefit of immunosuppression varies across different background mortality rates of hosts. In addition, we find that immunosuppression evolution is influenced considerably by the precise trade-off shape determining the effect of immunosuppression on host recovery and susceptibility to further infection. These results demonstrate that the evolution of virulence is shaped by immunosuppression while highlighting that the evolution of immune evasion mechanisms deserves further research attention.",

    "abstract": "Although our understanding of cellular behavior in response to extracellular biological and mechanical stimuli has greatly advanced using conventional 2D cell culture methods, these techniques lack physiological relevance. We developed the microtissue vacuum-actuated stretcher (MVAS) to probe cellular behavior within a 3D multicellular environment composed of innate matrix protein, and in response to continuous uniaxial stretch. The MVAS consists of an array of fifty self-assembled microtissues bordered by vacuum chambers. When a vacuum is applied, the microtissues stretch in plane allowing live imaging. The MVAS is highly suitable for biomedical research and pharmaceutical discovery due to a high-throughput array format and scalable fabrication steps outlined in this paper. We validated our approach by characterizing the bulk microtissue strain, the microtissue strain field and single cell strain, and by assessing F-actin expression in response to chronic cyclic strain of 10%. The MVAS was shown to be capable of delivering reproducible dynamic bulk strain amplitudes up to 13% and the strain field had local maxima around each of the cantilevers. The strain at the single cell level was found to be 10.4% less than the microtissue axial strain due to cellular rotation. Chronic cyclic strain produced a 35% increase in F-actin expression consistent with previously observed cytoskeletal reinforcement in 2D cell culture. The MVAS may further our understanding of the reciprocity shared between cells and their environment, which is critical to meaningful biomedical research and successful therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Cellular proliferation is antagonistically regulated by canonical and non-canonical Wnt signals; their dysbalance triggers cancers. It is widely believed that the PI3-K[-&gt;] Akt pathway enhances canonical Wnt signals by affecting transcriptional activity and stability of {beta}-catenin. Here we demonstrate that the PI3-K[-&gt;]Akt pathway also enhances non-canonical Wnt signals by compartmentalizing {beta}-catenin. By phosphorylating the phosphoinositide(PI)-binding domain of a multimodular signal transducer, Daple, Akt abolishes Daples ability to bind PI3-P-enriched endosomes that engage dynein motor complex for long-distance trafficking of {beta}-catenin/E-cadherin complexes to pericentriolar recycling endosomes (PCREs). Phosphorylation compartmentalizes Daple/{beta}-catenin/E-cadherin complexes to cell-cell contact sites, enhances non-canonical Wnt signals, and thereby, suppresses colony growth. Dephosphorylation compartmentalizes {beta}-catenin on PCREs, a specialized compartment for prolonged unopposed canonical Wnt signaling, and enhances colony growth. Cancer-associated Daple mutants that are insensitive to Akt mimic a constitutively dephosphorylated state. This work not only identifies Daple as a platform for crosstalk between Akt and the non-canonical Wnt pathway, but also reveals the impact of such crosstalk during cancer initiation and progression.",

However, the conventional approach fails to determine SOC stock in an equivalent volume of mineral-soil, and therefore, SOC stock changes can be under- or overestimates if soils swell or shrink during forest development or degradation. Here, we propose to estimate SOC stock as the product of mineral-soil mass in an equivalent mineral-soil volume and SOC concentration expressed as g C Kg-1 mineral-soil. This method enables researchers to compare SOC stocks across space and time. Our results show an unaccounted SOC accumulation of 2.4 - 10.1 g C m-2 year-1 in the 1m surface mineral-soils in global forests. This unaccounted SOC amounts to an additional C sink of 0.12 - 0.25 Pg C year-1, which equals 30 - 62% of the previously estimated annual SOC accumulation in global forests. This finding suggests that forest soils are stronger C sinks than previously recognized.",

    "abstract": "Development and analysis of Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) populations have been conducted with several crop plants to harness the potential for dissecting the genetic structure of traits and improving breeding populations. We developed a first MAGIC population for cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) from eight founder parents which are genetically diverse and carry many abiotic and biotic stress resistance, seed quality and agronomic traits relevant to cowpea improvement in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where cowpea is vitally important in the human diet and in local economies. The eight parents were inter-crossed using structured matings to ensure the population would have balanced representation from each of the founder parents, followed by single-seed descent, resulting in 365 F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) each carrying a mosaic of genome blocks contributed from all founders. This was confirmed by SNP genotyping with the cowpea Illumina 60K iSelect BeadArray. Following filtering to eliminate duplicates, sister lines and accidental selfing events, a core set of 305 F8 RILs was chosen as the primary population. The F8 lines were on average 99.74% homozygous while also diverse in agronomic traits including flowering time, growth habit, maturity, yield potential and seed characteristics across environments. Trait-associated SNPs were identified for most of the parental traits. Loci with major effects on photoperiod sensitivity and seed size were also verified by genetic mapping in biparental RIL populations. The distribution of recombination frequency varied considerably between chromosomes, with recombination hotspots distributed mostly in the telomeric regions. Due to its broad genetic base, this cowpea MAGIC population promises breakthroughs in genetic gain and high-resolution genetic mapping for gene discovery, enhancement of breeding populations and, for some lines, direct releases as new varieties.",

Here we present high-resolution genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data from early Drosophila melanogaster embryos that allow us to map three-dimensional interactions to 500 base pairs. We observe a complex, nested pattern of regions of chromatin self-association, and use a combination of computational and manual annotation to identify boundaries between these topological associated domains (TADs). We demonstrate that, when mapped at high resolution, boundaries resemble classical insulators: short (500 - 1000 bp) genomic regions that are sensitive to DNase digestion and strongly bound by known insulator proteins. Strikingly, we show that for regions where the banding pattern of polytene chromosomes has been mapped to genomic position at comparably high resolution, there is a perfect correspondence between polytene banding and our chromatin conformation maps, with boundary insulators forming the interband regions that separate compacted bands that correspond to TADs. We propose that this precise, high-resolution relationship between insulators and TADs on the one hand and polytene bands and interbands on the other extends across the genome, and suggest a model in which the decompaction of insulator regions drives the organization of interphase chromosomes by creating stable physical separation between adjacent domains.",

We developed a nested model of within-vector dynamics and malaria epidemiology, which predicted that non-competitive resource exploitation within-vector restricts within-host parasite virulence. To validate our model, we experimentally manipulated mosquito lipid trafficking and gauged within-vector parasite development, within-host infectivity and virulence. We found that mosquito-derived lipids determine within-host parasite virulence by shaping development and metabolic activity of transmissible sporozoites.

    "abstract": "Many terrestrial bacteria are assumed to utilize sulfate transport and metabolism as a means for fulfilling cellular sulfur requirements. As such, many defined minimal media for bacterial growth under laboratory conditions contain sulfate as their sulfur source. Herein, an exception to this assumption is described as sulfate transport capabilities have been lost at least once in a lineage of Luteibacter associated with plants and fungi. However, a representative of this lineage (an endohyphal species, Luteibacter sp. 9143) can grow in minimal media when sulfur is supplemented with organic (cysteine and methionine) or inorganic (thiosulfate) compounds, and when co-cultured with its fungal host. A related strain of Luteibacter (UNC366Tsa5.1, isolated from the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis) potentially possesses more limited sulfur acquisition pathways than Luteibacter sp. 9143. These results highlight the surprising sulfur requirements of Luteibacter, which may be illustrative of close associations between these strains and eukaryotes, as well as a need for caution when inferring auxotrophies in a focal strain based on differential growth in minimal versus rich media.\\n\\nImportanceSulfate is often used as the sulfur source in minimal media. Here we show that some Luteibacter strains cannot utilize sulfate as a sulfur source, likely due to loss of genes encoding transport proteins. As sulfur requirements for Luteibacter can be met through co-culture with their fungal partner, this knowledge could provide a means to engineer better symbiotic relationships between bacteria and fungi that may be relevant for agriculture. Because growth in minimal media can be restored by supplementation with either cysteine or methionine, and in some cases only methionine, this result highlights how unexpected growth requirements could masquerade as auxotrophy for certain strains and conditions.",

    "abstract": "Many terrestrial bacteria are assumed to utilize sulfate transport and metabolism as a means for fulfilling cellular sulfur requirements. As such, many defined minimal media for bacterial growth under laboratory conditions contain sulfate as their sulfur source. Herein, an exception to this assumption is described as sulfate transport capabilities have been lost at least once in a lineage of Luteibacter associated with plants and fungi. However, a representative of this lineage (an endohyphal species, Luteibacter sp. 9143) can grow in minimal media when sulfur is supplemented with organic (cysteine and methionine) or inorganic (thiosulfate) compounds, and when co-cultured with its fungal host. A related strain of Luteibacter (UNC366Tsa5.1, isolated from the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis) potentially possesses more limited sulfur acquisition pathways than Luteibacter sp. 9143. These results highlight the surprising sulfur requirements of Luteibacter, which may be illustrative of close associations between these strains and eukaryotes, as well as a need for caution when inferring auxotrophies in a focal strain based on differential growth in minimal versus rich media.\\n\\nImportanceSulfate is often used as the sulfur source in minimal media. Here we show that some Luteibacter strains cannot utilize sulfate as a sulfur source, likely due to loss of genes encoding transport proteins. As sulfur requirements for Luteibacter can be met through co-culture with their fungal partner, this knowledge could provide a means to engineer better symbiotic relationships between bacteria and fungi that may be relevant for agriculture. Because growth in minimal media can be restored by supplementation with either cysteine or methionine, and in some cases only methionine, this result highlights how unexpected growth requirements could masquerade as auxotrophy for certain strains and conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cytosine methylation of DNA is a widespread modification of DNA that plays numerous critical roles, yet has been lost many times in diverse eukaryotic lineages. In the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, CG methylation occurs in transposon-rich repeats and requires the DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt5. We show that Dnmt5 displays exquisite maintenance-type specificity in vitro and in vivo and utilizes similar in vivo cofactors as the metazoan maintenance methylase Dnmt1. Remarkably, phylogenetic and functional analysis revealed that the ancestral species lost the gene for a de novo methylase, DnmtX, between 50-150 MYA. We examined how methylation has persisted since the ancient loss of DnmtX. Experimental and comparative studies reveal efficient replication of methylation patterns in C. neoformans, rare stochastic methylation loss and gain events, and the action of natural selection. We propose that an epigenome has been propagated for >50 MY through a process analogous to Darwinian evolution of the genome.",

As a result, ambitions to achieve clinically useful tools to assist in the diagnosis and management of mental health and learning disorders are gaining momentum. To this end, it is critical to accrue large-scale multimodal datasets that capture a broad range of commonly encountered clinical psychopathology. The Child Mind Institute has launched the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank of data from 10,000 New York area participants (ages 5-21). The HBN Biobank houses data about psychiatric, behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle phenotypes, as well as multimodal brain imaging (resting and naturalistic viewing fMRI, diffusion MRI, morphometric MRI), electroencephalography, eye-tracking, voice and video recordings, genetics, and actigraphy. Here, we present the rationale, design and implementation of HBN protocols. We describe the first data release (n = 664) and the potential of the biobank to advance related areas (e.g., biophysical modeling, voice analysis).",

    "abstract": "Quantitative genetics experiments aim at understanding and predicting the evolution of phenotypic traits. Running such experiments often bring the same questions: Should I bother with maternal effects? Could I estimate those effects? What is the best crossing scheme to obtain reliable estimates? Can I use molecular markers to spare time in the complex task of keeping track of the experimental pedigree?\\n\\nWe explored those practical issues in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria using morphologic and coloration traits, known to be influenced by maternal effects. We ran quantitative genetic analyses with an experimental dataset and used simulations to explore i) the efficiency of animal models to accurately estimate both heritability and maternal effects, ii) the influence of crossing schemes on the precision of estimates and iii) the performance of a marker-based method compared to the pedigree-based method.\\n\\nThe simulations indicated that maternal effects deeply affect heritability estimates and very large datasets are required to properly distinguish and estimate maternal effects and heritabilities. In particular, ignoring maternal effects in the animal model resulted in overestimation of heritabilities and a high rate of false positives whereas models specifying maternal variance suffer from lack of power. Maternal effects can be estimated more precisely than heritabilities but with low power. To obtain better estimates, bigger datasets are required and, in the presence of maternal effects, increasing the number of families over the number of offspring per families is recommended. Our simulations also showed that, in the desert locust, using relatedness based on available microsatellite markers may allow reasonably reliable estimates while rearing locusts in group.\\n\\nIn the light of the simulation results, our experimental dataset suggested that maternal effects affected various phase traits. However the statistical limitations, revealed by the simulation approach, didnt allow precise variance estimates.

Here we present analyses of the genomes of 134 strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis isolated from around the world, from multiple ecosystems since 1960s.

These lineages can be differentiated by CRISPR cluster arrays, and we show that the lineages are limited with respect to inter-lineage genetic exchange. This restriction of genetic exchange maintains the discrete lineage structure in the population despite co-existence of lineages for thousands of years in multiple countries. Our data highlights how CRISPR can be informative of the evolutionary trajectory of bacterial lineages, and merits further study across bacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNumerous centrality measures have been introduced to identify \\\"central\\\" nodes in large networks. The availability of a wide range of measures for ranking influential nodes leaves the user to decide which measure may best suit the analysis of a given network. The choice of a suitable measure is furthermore complicated by the impact of the network topology on ranking influential nodes by centrality measures. To approach this problem systematically, we examined the centrality profile of nodes of yeast protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) in order to detect which centrality measure is succeeding in predicting influential proteins. We studied how different topological network features are reflected in a large set of commonly used centrality measures.\\n\\nResultsWe used yeast PPINs to compare 27 common of centrality measures. The measures characterize and assort influential nodes of the networks. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering and found that the most informative measures depend on the networks topology. Interestingly, some measures had a high level of contribution in comparison to others in all PPINs, namely Latora closeness, Decay, Lin, Freeman closeness, Diffusion, Residual closeness and Average distance centralities.\\n\\nConclusionsThe choice of a suitable set of centrality measures is crucial for inferring important functional properties of a network. We concluded that undertaking data reduction using unsupervised machine learning methods helps to choose appropriate variables (centrality measures). Hence, we proposed identifying the contribution proportions of the centrality measures with PCA as a prerequisite step of network analysis before inferring functional consequences, e.g., essentiality of a node.",

    "abstract": "Fundamental to biological decision-making is the ability to generate bimodal expression patterns where two alternate expression states simultaneously exist. Here, we use a combination of single-cell analysis and mathematical modeling to examine the sources of bimodality in the transcriptional program controlling HIVs fate decision between active replication and viral latency. We find that the HIV Tat protein manipulates the intrinsic toggling of HIVs promoter, the LTR, to generate bimodal ON-OFF expression, and that transcriptional positive feedback from Tat shifts and expands the regime of LTR bimodality. This result holds for both minimal synthetic viral circuits and full-length virus. Strikingly, computational analysis indicates that the Tat circuits non-cooperative  non-latching feedback architecture is optimized to slow the promoters toggling and generate bimodality by stochastic extinction of Tat. In contrast to the standard Poisson model, theory and experiment show that non-latching positive feedback substantially dampens the inverse noise-mean relationship to maintain stochastic bimodality despite increasing mean-expression levels. Given the rapid evolution of HIV, the presence of a circuit optimized to robustly generate bimodal expression appears consistent with the hypothesis that HIVs decision between active replication and latency provides a viral fitness advantage. More broadly, the results suggest that positive-feedback circuits may have evolved not only for signal amplification but also for robustly generating bimodality by decoupling expression fluctuations (noise) from mean expression levels.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome engineering have resulted in the generation of numerous zebrafish mutant lines. A commonly used method to assess gene expression in the mutants is in situ hybridization (ISH). Because the embryos can be distinguished by genotype after ISH, comparing gene expression between wild type and mutant siblings can be done blinded and in parallel. Such experimental design reduces the technical variation between samples and minimises the risk of bias. This approach, however, requires an efficient method of genomic DNA extraction from post-ISH fixed zebrafish samples to ascribe phenotype to genotype. Here we describe a method to obtain PCR-quality DNA from 95-100% of zebrafish embryos, suitable for genotyping after ISH. In addition, we provide an image analysis protocol for quantifying gene expression of ISH-probed embryos, adaptable for the analysis of different expression patterns. Finally, we show that intensity-based image analysis enables accurate representation of the variability of gene expression detected by ISH and that it can complement quantitative methods like qRT-PCR. By combining genotyping after ISH and computer-based image analysis, we have established a high-confidence, unbiased methodology to assign gene expression levels to specific genotypes, and applied it to the analysis of molecular phenotypes of newly generated lmo4a mutants.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTOur optimized protocol to genotype zebrafish mutant embryos after in situ hybridization and digitally quantify the in situ signal will help to standardize existing experimental designs and methods of analysis.",

However, the therapeutic potential of oxytocin in mental health care suggested by animal research has not been successfully translated into clinical practice, partly due to a poor understanding of the expression and distribution of the oxytocin signaling pathway in the human brain, and its complex interactions with other biological systems. Among the genes involved in the oxytocin signaling pathway, three genes have been frequently implicated in human social behavior: OXT (structural gene for oxytocin), OXTR (oxytocin receptor), and CD38 (central oxytocin secretion). We characterized the distribution of the OXT, OXTR, and CD38 mRNA across the brain, identified putative gene pathway interactions by comparing gene expression patterns across 29131 genes, and assessed associations between gene expression patterns and cognitive states via large-scale fMRI meta-analysis. In line with the animal literature, oxytocin pathway gene expression was enriched in central, temporal, and olfactory regions. Across the brain, there was high co-expression of the oxytocin pathway genes with both dopaminergic (DRD2) and muscarinic acetylcholine (CHRM4) genes, reflecting an anatomical basis for critical gene pathway interactions. Finally, fMRI meta-analysis revealed that oxytocin pathway maps correspond with motivation and emotion processing, demonstrating the value of probing gene expression maps to identify brain functional targets for future pharmacological trials.",

Here we demonstrate that the genome-wide deposition of Inhibitor of growth family member 1 (ING1), which is a central epigenetic regulatory protein, is dynamically regulated in response to activity in primary cortical neurons. ING1 knockdown leads to decreased expression of genes related to synaptic plasticity, including the regulatory subunit of calcineurin, Ppp3r1. In addition, ING1 binding at a site upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of Ppp3r1 depends on yet another group of neuroepigenetic regulatory proteins, the Piwi-like family, which are also involved in DNA repair. These findings provide new insight into a novel mode of activity-induced gene expression, which involves the interaction between different epigenetic regulatory mechanisms traditionally associated with gene repression and DNA repair.\\n\\nAuthor contributionsL.J.L., Q.Z., T.W.B and W.W. designed the experiments.

    "abstract": "Coordinate-based meta-analysis can provide important insights into mind-brain relationships. A popular approach for curated small-scale meta-analysis is activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which identifies brain regions consistently activated across a selected set of experiments, such as within a functional domain or mental disorder. ALE can also be utilized in meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) to identify brain regions consistently co-activated with a seed region. Therefore, ALE aims to find consensus across experiments, treating heterogeneity across experiments as noise. However, heterogeneity within an ALE analysis of a functional domain might indicate the presence of functional sub-domains. Similarly, heterogeneity within a MACM analysis might indicate the involvement of a seed region in multiple co-activation patterns that are dependent on task contexts. Here, we demonstrate the use of the author-topic model to automatically determine if heterogeneities within ALE-type meta-analyses can be robustly explained by a small number of latent patterns. In the first application, the author-topic modeling of experiments involving self-generated thought (N = 179) revealed cognitive components fractionating the default network. In the second application, the author-topic model revealed that the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ) participated in multiple task-dependent co-activation patterns (N = 323). Furthermore, the author-topic model estimates compared favorably with spatial independent component analysis in both simulation and real data. Overall, the results suggest that the author-topic model is a flexible tool for exploring heterogeneity in ALE-type meta-analyses that might arise from functional sub-domains, mental disorder subtypes or task-dependent co-activation patterns. Code for this study is publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/meta-analysis/Ngo2019_AuthorTopic).",

    "abstract": "Information from preceding trials of cognitive tasks can bias performance in the current trial, a phenomenon referred to as interference. Subjects performing visual working memory tasks exhibit interference in their trial-to-trial response correlations: the recalled target location in the current trial is biased in the direction of the target presented on the previous trial. We present modeling work that (a) develops a probabilistic inference model of this history-dependent bias, and (b) links our probabilistic model to computations of a recurrent network wherein short-term facilitation accounts for the dynamics of the observed bias. Network connectivity is reshaped dynamically during each trial, providing a mechanism for generating predictions from prior trial observations. Applying timescale separation methods, we can obtain a low-dimensional description of the trial-to-trial bias based on the history of target locations. The model has response statistics whose mean is centered at the true target location across many trials, typical of such visual working memory tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate task protocols for which the plastic model performs better than a model with static connectivity: repetitively presented targets are better retained in working memory than targets drawn from uncorrelated sequences.",

    "abstract": "The need for generating precisely designed mutations is common in genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Here, I describe a new {lambda} Red recombineering method (Direct and Inverted Repeat stimulated excision; DIRex) for fast and easy generation of single point mutations, small insertions or replacements as well as deletions of any size, in bacterial genes. The method does not leave any resistance marker or scar sequence and requires only one transformation to generate a semi-stable intermediate insertion mutant. Spontaneous excision of the intermediate efficiently and accurately generates the final mutant. In addition, the intermediate is transferable between strains by generalized transductions, enabling transfer of the mutation into multiple strains without repeating the recombineering step. Existing methods that can be used to accomplish similar results are either (i) more complicated to design, (ii) more limited in what mutation types can be made, or (iii) require expression of extrinsic factors in addition to {lambda} Red. I demonstrate the utility of the method by generating several deletions, small insertions/replacements, and single nucleotide exchanges in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, the design parameters that influence the excision frequency and the success rate of generating desired point mutations have been examined to determine design guidelines for optimal efficiency.",

Using RNP granules as an example, we provide evidence for an assembly mechanism of large cellular structures wherein specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions act together with promiscuous interactions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). This synergistic assembly mechanism illuminates RNP granule assembly, and explains why many components of RNP granules, and other large dynamic assemblies, contain IDRs linked to specific protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction modules. We suggest assemblies based on combinations of specific interactions and promiscuous IDRs are common features of eukaryotic cells.",

We show that eIF4As ATPase activity is markedly stimulated in the presence of the PIC, independently of eIF4E*eIF4G, but dependent on subunits i and g of the heteromeric eIF3 complex. Surprisingly, eIF4A accelerated the rate of recruitment of all mRNAs tested, regardless of their degree of structural complexity. Structures in the 5'-UTR and 3' of the start codon synergistically inhibit mRNA recruitment in a manner relieved by eIF4A, indicating that the factor does not act solely to melt hairpins in 5'-UTRs. Our findings that eIF4A functionally interacts with the PIC and plays important roles beyond unwinding 5-UTR structure is consistent with a recent proposal that eIF4A modulates the conformation of the 40S ribosomal subunit to promote mRNA recruitment.",

    "abstract": "In both vertebrates and invertebrates, neurons and glia are generated in a stereotyped order from dedicated progenitors called neural stem cells, but the purpose of invariant lineages is not understood. Here we show that three of the stem cells that produce leg motor neurons in Drosophila also generate a specialized subset of glia, the neuropil glia, which wrap and send processes into the neuropil where motor neuron dendrites arborize. The development of the neuropil glia and leg motor neurons is highly coordinated. However, although individual motor neurons have a stereotyped birth order and transcription factor code, both the number and individual morphologies of the glia born from these lineages are highly plastic, even though the final structure they contribute to is highly stereotyped. We suggest that the shared lineages of these two cell types facilitates the assembly of complex neural circuits, and that the two different birth order strategies - hardwired for motor neurons and flexible for glia - are important for robust nervous system development and homeostasis.",

The COG/NCI TARGET AML initiative assessed cases by whole-genome, targeted DNA, mRNA, miRNA sequencing and CpG methylation profiling. Validated DNA variants revealed diverse, infrequent mutations with fewer than 40 genes mutated in >2% of cases. In contrast, somatic structural variants, including novel gene fusions and focal MBNL1, ZEB2, and ELF1 deletions, were disproportionately prevalent in young as compared to adult patients. Conversely, DNMT3A and TP53 mutations, common in adults, are conspicuously absent from virtually all pediatric cases. Novel GATA2, FLT3, and CBL mutations, recurrent MYC-ITD, NRAS, KRAS, and WT1 mutations are frequent in pediatric AML. Deletions, mutations, and promoter DNA hypermethylation convergently impact Wnt signaling, Polycomb repression, innate immune cell interactions, and a cluster of zinc finger genes associated with KMT2A rearrangements. These results highlight the need for, and facilitate the development of age-tailored targeted therapies for the treatment of pediatric AML.",

Despite the description of bioregions dates back from the origin of biogeography, the processes originating their associated species pools have been seldom studied. Ancient historical events are thought to play a fundamental role in configuring bioregions, but the effects of more recent events on these regional biotas are largely unknown. We use a network approach to identify regional and sub-regional faunas of European Carabus beetles, and analyse the effects of dispersal barriers, niche similarities and phylogenetic history on their configuration. We identify a transition zone matching the limit of the ice sheets at Last Glacial Maximum. While southern species pools are mostly separated by dispersal barriers, in the north species are mainly sorted by their environmental niches. Strikingly, most phylogenetic structuration of Carabus faunas occurred during the Pleistocene. Our results show how extreme recent historical events -such as Pleistocene climate cooling, rather than just deep-time evolutionary processes, can profoundly modify the composition and structure of geographic species pools.",

Does the repeated imitation of an environmental sound gradually give rise to more word-like forms? In what ways do these forms resemble the original sounds that motivated them (i.e., exhibit iconicity)? Participants played a version of the childrens game \\\"Telephone\\\". The first generation of participants imitated recognizable environmental sounds (e.g., glass breaking, water splashing). Subsequent generations imitated the previous generation of imitations for a maximum of 8 generations. The results showed that the imitations became more stable and word-like, and later imitations were easier to learn as category labels. At the same time, even after 8 generations, both spoken imitations and their written transcriptions could be matched above chance to the category of environmental sound that motivated them. These results show how repeated imitation can create progressively more word-like forms while continuing to retain a resemblance to the original sound that motivated them, and speak to the possible role of human vocal imitation in explaining the origins of at least some spoken words.",

DPR is non-parametric in nature, relies on the Dirichlet process to flexibly and adaptively model the effect size distribution, and thus enjoys robust prediction performance across a broad spectrum of genetic architectures. We compare DPR with several commonly used prediction methods with simulations.

One of these, DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency leads to hypermutation and is found in different cancer types. While it is possible to associate mutational signatures extracted from human cancers with possible mutational processes the exact causation is often unknown. Here we use C. elegans genome sequencing of pms-2 and mlh-1 knockouts to reveal the mutational patterns linked to C. elegans MMR deficiency and their dependency on endogenous replication errors and errors caused by deletion of the polymerase {varepsilon} subunit pole-4. Signature extraction from 215 human colorectal and 289 gastric adenocarcinomas revealed three MMR-associated signatures one of which closely resembles the C. elegans MMR spectrum. A characteristic difference between human and worm MMR deficiency is the lack of elevated levels of NCG>NTG mutations in C. elegans, likely caused by the absence of cytosine (CpG) methylation in worms. The other two human MMR signatures may reflect the interaction between MMR deficiency and other mutagenic processes, but their exact cause remains unknown. In summary, combining information from genetically defined models and cancer samples allows for better aligning mutational signatures to causal mutagenic processes.",

Moreover, the cephalic cortex result in local fluctuations in current flow intensity and direction, and animal studies suggest current flow direction relative to cortical columns determines response to tDCS. Here we test this idea by measuring changes in cortico-spinal excitability by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Motor Evoked Potentials (TMS-MEP), following tDCS applied with electrodes aligned orthogonal (across) or parallel to M1 in the central sulcus. Current flow models predicted that the orthogonal electrode montage produces consistently oriented current across the hand region of M1 that flows along cortical columns, while the parallel electrode montage produces none-uniform current directions across the M1 cortical surface. We find that orthogonal, but not parallel, orientated tDCS modulates TMS-MEPs. We also show modulation is sensitive to the orientation of the TMS coil (PA or AP), which is through to select different afferent pathways to M1. Our results are consistent with tDCS producing directionally specific neuromodulation in brain regions in-between electrodes, but shows nuanced changes in excitability that are presumably current direction relative to column and axon pathway specific. We suggest that the direction of current flow through cortical target regions should be considered for targeting and dose-control of tDCS.\\n\\nHighlights O_LIDirection of current flow is important for tDCS after-effects.\\nC_LIO_LItDCS modulates excitability between two electrodes.\\nC_LIO_LItDCS differentially modulates PA and AP inputs into M1.\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nFundingThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",

A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction system, we present evidence how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised machine learning tool, learns the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. As an example, we show how the method reveals a temporally shifted coordination in a thalamo-cortical circuit during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.",

    "abstract": "The human distal limbs have a high spatial acuity for noxious stimuli but a low density of pain-sensing neurites. To elucidate mechanisms underlying the  pain fovea, we sparsely traced non-peptidergic nociceptors across the body using a newly generated MrgprDCreERT2 mouse line. We found that mouse plantar paw skin also has a low density of MrgprD+ neurites, and individual arbors in different locations are comparable in size. Surprisingly, the central arbors of plantar paw and trunk innervating nociceptors have distinct morphologies in the spinal cord. This regional difference is well correlated with a heightened signal transmission for plantar paw circuits, as revealed by both spinal cord slice recordings and behavior assays. Taken together, our results elucidate a novel somatotopic functional organization of the mammalian pain system and suggest that regional central arbor structure could facilitate the magnification of plantar paw regions to contribute to the  pain fovea.",

    "abstract": "Deregulated signal transduction pathways and energy metabolism are hallmarks of cancer and both play a fundamental role in the process of tumorigenesis. While it is increasingly recognised that signalling and metabolism are highly interconnected, the underpinning mechanisms of their co-regulation are still largely unknown. Here we designed and acquired proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics experiments in fumarate hydratase (FH) deficient cells and developed a computational modelling approach to identify putative regulatory phosphorylation-sites of metabolic enzymes. We identified previously reported functionally relevant phosphosites and potentially novel regulatory residues in enzymes of the central carbon metabolism. In particular, we show that pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHA1) enzymatic activity is inhibited by increased phosphorylation in FH-deficient cells. Our work provides a novel approach to investigate how post-translational modifications of enzymes regulate metabolism and could have important implications for understanding the metabolic transformation of FH-deficient cancers.",

    "abstract": "Human COQ8A (ADCK3) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Coq8p (collectively COQ8) are UbiB family proteins essential for mitochondrial coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis. However, the biochemical activity of COQ8 and its direct role in CoQ production remain unclear, in part due to lack of known endogenous regulators of COQ8 function and of effective small molecules for probing its activity in vivo. Here we demonstrate that COQ8 possesses evolutionarily conserved ATPase activity that is activated by binding to membranes containing cardiolipin and by phenolic compounds that resemble CoQ pathway intermediates. We further create an analog-sensitive version of Coq8p and reveal that acute chemical inhibition of its endogenous activity in yeast is sufficient to cause respiratory deficiency concomitant with CoQ depletion. Collectively, this work defines lipid and small molecule modulators of an ancient family of atypical kinase-like proteins and establishes a chemical genetic system for further exploring the mechanistic role of COQ8 in CoQ biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Background: The presence of accelerometers in smartphones has enabled low-cost balance assessment. Smartglasses, which contain an accelerometer similar to that of smartphones, could provide a safe and engaging platform for virtual and augmented reality balance rehabilitation; however, the validity of head-mounted measurement of balance using smartglasses has not been investigated.\\n\\nObjective: To perform preliminary validation of a smartglasses-based balance accelerometry measure (BAM) compared with previously validated waist-based BAM.\\n\\nMethods: 42 healthy individuals (26 male, 16 female; mean age {+/-} SD = 23.8 {+/-} 5.2 years) participated in the study. Following the BAM protocol, each subject performed two trials of six balance stances while accelerometer and gyroscope data were recorded from smartglasses (Google Glass). Test-retest reliability and correlation were determined relative to waist-based BAM as used in the NIH Standing Balance Toolbox.\\n\\nResults: Balance measurements obtained using a head-mounted wearable were highly correlated with those obtained through a waist-mounted accelerometer (Spearmans rank correlation coefficient = 0.85). Test-retest reliability was high (ICC = 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.88), and in good agreement with waist balance measurements (ICC = 0.84, 95% CI 0.80-0.88). Taking into account the total NPL magnitude improved inter-device correlation (0.90) while maintaining test-retest reliability (0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.90). All subjects successfully completed the study, demonstrating the feasibility of using a head-mounted wearable to assess balance in a healthy population.\\n\\nConclusion: Balance measurements derived from the smartglasses-based accelerometer were consistent with those obtained using a waist-mounted accelerometer. Given this and the potential for smartglasses in vestibular rehabilitation, the continued development and validation of balance assessment measurements obtained via smartglasses is warranted.

    "abstract": "Most cells in the liver are polyploid, but the functional role of polyploidy is unknown. Polyploidization normally occurs through cytokinesis failure and endoreduplication around the time of weaning. To interrogate the function of polyploidy while avoiding irreversible manipulations of essential cell cycle genes, we developed multiple orthogonal mouse models to transiently and potently alter liver ploidy. Premature weaning, as well as in vivo knockdown of E2f8 or Anln, allowed us to toggle between diploid and polyploid states. While there was no impact of ploidy alterations on liver function, metabolism, or regeneration, hyperpolyploid mice suppressed and hyperdiploid mice accelerated tumorigenesis in mutagen and high fat induced models. Mechanistically, the diploid state was more susceptible to Cas9-mediated tumor suppressor loss but was similarly susceptible to MYC oncogene activation, indicating that ploidy differentially protected the liver from distinct genomic aberrations. Our work suggests that polyploidy evolved to prevent malignant outcomes of liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in RAS genes are associated with approximately 20% of all human cancers. New targeted therapies show preclinical promise in inhibiting the KRAS G12C variant, however, concerns exist regarding the effectiveness of such therapies in vivo given the possibilities of existing intratumor heterogeneity or de novo mutation leading to treatment resistance. We performed deep sequencing of 27 KRAS G12 positive lung tumors and found no evidence of other oncogenic mutations within KRAS or within commonly mutated downstream genes that could confer resistance at the time of treatment. Furthermore, we estimate the de novo mutation rate in KRAS position 12 and in genes downstream of KRAS. We find that mutations that confer resistance are about as likely to occur downstream of KRAS as within KRAS. Moreover, we present an approach for estimation of the selection intensity for these point mutations that explains their high prevalence in tumors. Our approach predicts that BRAF V600E would provide the highest fitness advantage for de novo resistant subclones. Overall, our findings suggest that resistance to targeted therapy of KRAS G12C positive tumors is unlikely to be present at the time of treatment and, among the de novo mutations likely to confer resistance, mutations in BRAF, a gene with targeted inhibitors presently available, result in subclones with the highest fitness advantage.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMutations conferring resistance to KRAS G12C targeted therapy are unlikely to be present at the time of resection, and the likely mechanisms of evolved resistance are predicted be ones that are responsive to therapies that are in development or that are already available.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton functional types are groupings of many species into a smaller number of types according to their ecological or biogeochemical role. Models describe phytoplankton functional types by a set of traits that determine their growth rates or fitness. Traits for functional types are often determined from observations on a small number of species under laboratory conditions. Functional types can be composed of a large number of species with very different trait values, so the representation of a type by an average trait value may not be appropriate. A potential solution is to estimate trait values from observations of the aggregate biomass of phytoplankton functional types in natural populations. We report on some recent efforts to extract trait values from time-series data using Bayesian statistical models and discuss some challenges of this approach.",

The muSeq protocol marks each initial template molecule with a unique mutation signature that is present in every copy of the template, and in every fragmented copy of a copy. In the sequenced read data, this signature is observed as a unique pattern of C-to-T or G-to-A nucleotide conversions. Clustering reads with the same conversion pattern enables accurate count and long-range assembly of initial template molecules from short-read sequence data. We explore count and low-error sequencing by profiling a 135,000 fragment PstI representation, demonstrating that muSeq improves copy number inference and significantly reduces sporadic sequencer error. We explore long-range assembly in the context of cDNA, generating contiguous transcript clusters greater than 3,000 bp in length. The muSeq assemblies reveal transcriptional diversity not observable from short-read data alone.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites (SMs) critical for defense, virulence, and communication. The metabolic pathways that produce SMs are found in contiguous gene clusters in fungal genomes, an atypical arrangement for metabolic pathways in other eukaryotes. Comparative studies of filamentous fungal species have shown that SM gene clusters are often either highly divergent or uniquely present in one or a handful of species, hampering efforts to determine the genetic basis and evolutionary drivers of SM gene cluster divergence. Here we examined SM variation in 66 cosmopolitan strains of a single species, the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Investigation of genome-wide within-species variation revealed five general types of variation in SM gene clusters: non-functional gene polymorphisms, gene gain and loss polymorphisms, whole cluster gain and loss polymorphisms, allelic polymorphisms where different alleles corresponded to distinct, non-homologous clusters, and location polymorphisms in which a cluster was found to differ in its genomic location across strains. These polymorphisms affect the function of representative A. fumigatus SM gene clusters, such as those involved in the production of gliotoxin, fumigaclavine, and helvolic acid, as well as the function of clusters with undefined products. In addition to enabling the identification of polymorphisms whose detection requires extensive genome-wide synteny conservation (e.g., mobile gene clusters and non-homologous cluster alleles), our approach also implicated multiple underlying genetic drivers, including point mutations, recombination, genomic deletion and insertion events, as well as horizontal gene transfer from distant fungi. Finally, most of the variants that we uncover within A. fumigatus have been previously hypothesized to contribute to SM gene cluster diversity across entire fungal classes and phyla. We suggest that the drivers of genetic diversity operating within a fungal species shown here are sufficient to explain SM cluster macroevolutionary patterns.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery and subsequent availability of a new breakthrough therapeutic or  cure is a compelling example of societal benefit from research advances. These advances are invariably collaborative, involving the contributions of many scientists to a discovery network in which theory and experiment are built upon. To understand such scientific advances, data mining of public and commercial data sources coupled with network analysis can be used as a digital methodology to assemble and analyze component events in the history of a therapeutic. This methodology is extensible beyond the history of therapeutics and its use more generally supports (i) efficiency in exploring the scientific history of a research advance (ii) documenting and understanding collaboration (iii) portfolio analysis, planning and optimization (iv) communication of the societal value of research. As a proof of principle, we have conducted a case study of five anti-cancer therapeutics. We have linked the work of roughly 237,000 authors in 106,000 scientific publications that capture the research crucial for the development of these five therapeutics. We have enriched the content of networks of these therapeutics by annotating them with information on research awards as well as peer review that preceded these awards. Applying retrospective citation discovery, we have identified a core set of publications cited in the networks of all five therapeutics and additional intersections in combinations of networks as well as awards from the National Institutes of Health that supported this research. Lastly, we have mapped these awards to their cognate peer review panels, identifying another layer of collaborative scientific activity that influenced the research represented in these networks.",

    "abstract": "Cellular levels of the versatile second messenger, cyclic-(c)AMP are regulated by the antagonistic actions of the canonical G protein[-&gt;]adenylyl cyclase pathway that is initiated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and by phosphodiesterases (PDEs); dysregulated cAMP signaling drives many diseases, including cancers. Recently, an alternative paradigm for cAMP signaling has emerged, in which growth factor-receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; e.g., EGFR) access and modulate G proteins via cytosolic guanine-nucleotide exchange modulator (GEM), GIV/Girdin; dysregulation of this pathway is frequently encountered in cancers. Here we present a comprehensive network-based compartmental model for the paradigm of GEM-dependent signaling that reveals unforeseen crosstalk and network dynamics between upstream events and the various feedback-loops that fine-tune the GEM action of GIV, and captures the experimentally determined dynamics of cAMP. The model also reveals that GIV acts a tunable control-valve within the RTK[-&gt;]cAMP pathway; hence, it modulates cAMP via mechanisms distinct from the two most-often targeted classes of cAMP modulators, GPCRs and PDEs.",
