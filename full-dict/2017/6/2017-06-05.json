We demonstrate this by recon-structing the cell cycle of Jurkat cells and disease progression in diabetic retinopathy. In further analysis of Jurkat cells, we detect and separate a subpopulation of dead cells in an unsupervised manner and, in classifying discrete cell cycle stages, we reach a 6-fold reduction in error rate compared to a recent approach based on boosting on image features. In contrast to previous methods, deep learning based predictions are fast enough for on-the-fly analysis in an imaging flow cytometer.",

    "abstract": "Pedigree-based analyses of intelligence have reported that genetic differences account for 50-80% of the phenotypic variation. For personality traits these effects are smaller, with 34-48% of the variance being explained by genetic differences. However, molecular genetic studies using unrelated individuals typically report a heritability estimate of around 30% for intelligence and between 0% and 15% for personality variables. Pedigree-based estimates and molecular genetic estimates may differ because current genotyping platforms are poor at tagging causal variants, variants with low minor allele frequency, copy number variants, and structural variants. Using [~]20 000 individuals in the Generation Scotland family cohort genotyped for [~]700 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we exploit the high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) found in members of the same family to quantify the total effect of genetic variants that are not tagged in GWASs of unrelated individuals. In our models, genetic variants in low LD with genotyped SNPs explain over half of the genetic variance in intelligence, education, and neuroticism. By capturing these additional genetic effects our models closely approximate the heritability estimates from twin studies for intelligence and education, but not for neuroticism and extraversion. We then replicated our finding using imputed molecular genetic data from unrelated individuals to show that [~]50% of differences in intelligence, and [~]40% of the differences in education, can be explained by genetic effects when a larger number of rare SNPs are included. From an evolutionary genetic perspective, a substantial contribution of rare genetic variants to individual differences in intelligence and education is consistent with mutation-selection balance.",

Here we devise a universal genetic strategy to precisely control copy number of fluorescently labeled molecules in a cell. This system has a dynamic titration range of >10,000 fold, enabling sparse labeling of proteins expressed at different abundance levels. Combined with photostable labels, this system extends the duration of automated single-molecule tracking by 2 orders of magnitude. We demonstrate long-term imaging of synaptic vesicle dynamics in cultured neurons as well as in intact zebrafish. We found axon initial segment utilizes a  waterfall mechanism gating synaptic vesicle transport polarity by promoting anterograde transport processivity. Long-time observation also reveals that transcription factor hops between clustered binding sites in spatially-restricted sub-nuclear regions, suggesting that topological structures in the nucleus shape local gene activities by a sequestering mechanism. This strategy thus greatly expands the spatiotemporal length scales of live-cell single-molecule measurements, enabling new experiments to quantitatively understand complex control of molecular dynamics in vivo.",

It is assumed that the states of the cells in a group are those that maximizes organismal fitness. In the model it is considered that the groups can grow linearly, forming a chain, or compactly keeping a roughly spherical shape.

The microbes respond to UV excitation (at 395nm) in a bifurcating way one branch corresponding to increase and the other corresponding to diminishing fluorescent emission in the range 590-685nm.The switching between such bifurcating branches can be observed when parameters like concentration, temperature are varied or static magnetic field is applied. Thus switching from amplification to reduction occurs if fluorophore concentration lowered. Again if temperature is lowered a steady quenching (instead of amplification) of fluorescence is observed. However presence of magnetic field of the order of 0.5 T reverts this and once again the systems resumes its fluoresence amplifying state. We propose that aggregation of bacterial porphyrin and regulation of such aggregation by photon excitation may explain this bistablity. Possible ecological implication of the photosynthetic bistability is suggested.",

Our patch-clamp recordings, together with finite-element simulations of acoustic field parameters indicate that Piezo1 channels are activated by continuous wave US at 43 MHz and 50 or 90 W/cm2 through cell membrane stress caused by acoustic streaming. NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism at these intensities, but their kinetics could be accelerated by US-induced heating.",

    "abstract": "Protein glycosylation, or the attachment of sugar moieties (glycans) to proteins, is important for protein stability, activity, and immunogenicity. However, understanding the roles and regulations of site-specific glycosylation events remains a significant challenge due to several technological limitations. These limitations include a lack of available tools for biochemical characterization of enzymes involved in glycosylation. A particular challenge is the synthesis of oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs), which catalyze the attachment of glycans to specific amino acid residues in target proteins. The difficulty arises from the fact that canonical OSTs are large (>70 kDa) and possess multiple transmembrane helices, making them difficult to overexpress in living cells. Here, we address this challenge by establishing a bacterial cell-free protein synthesis platform that enables rapid production of a variety of OSTs in their active conformations. Specifically, by using lipid nanodiscs as cellular membrane mimics, we obtained yields of up to 440 {micro}g/mL for the single-subunit OST enzyme,  Protein glycosylation B (PglB) from Campylobacter jejuni, as well as for three additional PglB homologs from Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter lari, and Desulfovibrio gigas. Importantly, all of these enzymes catalyzed N-glycosylation reactions in vitro with no purification or processing needed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of cell-free synthesized OSTs to glycosylate multiple target proteins with varying N-glycosylation acceptor sequons. We anticipate that this broadly applicable production method will advance glycoengineering efforts by enabling preparative expression of membrane-embedded OSTs from all kingdoms of life.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnalysis of microbiome data involves identifying co-occurring groups of taxa associated with sample features of interest (e.g., disease state). But elucidating key associations is often difficult since microbiome data are compositional, high dimensional, and sparse. Also, the configuration of co-occurring taxa may represent overlapping subcommunities that contribute to, for example, host status. Preserving the configuration of co-occurring microbes rather than detecting specific indicator species is more likely to facilitate biologically meaningful interpretations. In addition, analyses that utilize both taxonomic and predicted functional abundances typically independently characterize the taxonomic and functional profiles before linking them to sample information. This prevents investigators from identifying the specific functional components associate with which subsets of co-occurring taxa.\\n\\nResultsWe provide an approach to explore co-occurring taxa using \\\"topics\\\" generated via a topic model and then link these topics to specific sample classes (e.g., diseased versus healthy). Rather than inferring predicted functional content independently from taxonomic abundances, we instead focus on inference of functional content within topics, which we parse by estimating pathway-topic interactions through a multilevel, fully Bayesian regression model. We apply our methods to two large publically available 16S amplicon sequencing datasets: an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dataset from Gevers et al. and data from the American Gut (AG) project. When applied to the Gevers et al. IBD study, we demonstrate that a topic highly associated with Crohns disease (CD) diagnosis is (1) dominated by a cluster of bacteria known to be linked with CD and (2) uniquely enriched for a subset of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis genes. In the AG data, our approach found that individuals with plant-based diets were enriched with Lachnospiraceae, Roseburia, Blautia, and Ruminococcaceae, as well as fluorobenzoate degradation pathways, whereas pathways involved in LPS biosynthesis were depleted.\\n\\nConclusionsWe introduce an approach for uncovering latent thematic structure in the context of sample features for 16S rRNA surveys. Using our topic-model approach, investigators can (1) capture groups of co-occurring taxa termed topics, (2) uncover within-topic functional potential, and (3) identify gene sets that may guide future inquiry.

    "abstract": "The relatively new field of connectomics provides us with a unique window into nervous system function. In the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, this promise is even greater due to the relatively small number of cells (302) in its nervous system. While the adult C. elegans connectome has been characterized, the emergence of these networks in development has yet to be established. In this paper, we approach this problem using secondary data describing the birth times of terminally-differentiated cells as they appear in the embryo and a connectomics model for nervous system cells in the adult hermaphrodite. By combining these two sources of data, we can better understand patterns that emerge in an incipient connectome. This includes identifying at what point in embryogenesis the cells of a connectome first comes into being, potentially observing some of the earliest neuron-neuron interactions, and making comparisons between the formally-defined connectome and developmental cell lineages. An analysis is also conducted to root terminally-differentiated cells in their developmental cell lineage precursors. This reveals subnetworks with different properties at 300 minutes of embryogenesis. Additional investigations reveal the spatial position of neuronal cells born during pre-hatch development, both within and outside the connectome model, in the context of all developmental cells in the embryo. Overall, these analyses reveal important information about the birth order of specific cells in the connectome, key building blocks of global connectivity, and how these structures correspond to key events in early development.",

    "abstract": "RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its binding protein partner, which is known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not well characterized, especially on the structure point of view. Informative signals hiding and interdependencies between sequence and structure specificities are two challenging problems for both predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure motifs mining.\\n\\nIn this study, we propose a deep learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure, which are appropriate for subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden binding knowledge from the observations, the CNNs are applied to learn the abstract motif features. Considering the close relationship between sequences and predicted structures, we use the BLSTM to capture the long range dependencies between binding sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the learned weighted representations are fed into a classification layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative CLIP-seq datasets, and the results demonstrate that iDeepS can reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage is that iDeepS is able to automatically extract both binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our transparent understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS.",

    "abstract": "In this detailed critique of the study proposing using RNA-seq from tumor-educated platelets (TEP) as a  liquid biopsy source [1], several flawed assumptions leave little biological basis behind the statistical computations. First, there is no supporting evidence provided for the FFPE based classification of METoverexpression and EGFR mutation on tumor-tissues. Considering that raw reads of MET expression in a subset of healthy [N=21, mean=112, sd=77] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=11, sd=12] samples (typically with millions of reads) translates into over-expression in reality, providing the data for such computations is vital for future validation. A similar criticism applies for classifying samples based on EGFR mutations (the study uses only exon 20 and 21 from a wide range of possible mutations) with negligible counts [N=24, mean=3, sd=6]. While Ofner et. al, 2017 faced  major problems associated with FFPE DNA, it is also true that Fassunke, et al., 2015 found concordance in 26 out of 26 samples for EGFR mutations in another FFPE-based study. However, Fassunke, et al., 2015 have been meticulous in describing the EGFR amplicons (exon 18 and 19 are missing in the TEP-study). Any error in initial classification renders downstream computations error-prone. The low counts of MET in the RNA-seq firmly establishes that inclusion of genes with such low counts in the set of 1100 discriminatory genes (Table S4) makes no sense as the \\\"real\\\" counts could vary wildly. Yet, TRAT1 is an example of one discriminator gene with counts of healthy [N=21, mean=164, sd=375] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=53, sd=176]. There are many such genes which should be excluded. Moving on to a discriminator with high counts (F13A1) in both healthy [N=21, mean=28228, sd=48581] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=98336, sd=74574] samples, a bonafide platelet gene that \\\"encodes the coagulation factor XIII A subunit\\\". Platelets do not have a nucleus, and thus the blue-print (chromosomes and related machinery) for making or regulating mRNA. They are boot-strapped with mRNA, like F13A1, during origination and then just go on keep collecting mRNA during circulation (which is the premise of their use in liquid biopsy). The assumption that these genes are differentially spliced in huge numbers is highly speculative without providing experimental proof. The discovery of spliceosomes in anucleate platelets [2] in 2005, 30 years after splicing was discovered in the nucleus by Sharp and Robert, probably indicates that spliceosomes are not dominant in platelets. Zucker, et al., 2017 have shown for another gene F11 that it  is present in platelets as pre-mRNA and is spliced upon platelet activation [3]. Any study using the F13A1 gene as a discriminator ought to show the same two things, followed by differential counts in TEP. Ironically, F11 is not present in the discriminator set. Another blood coagulation related gene (TFPI) shows slight over-expression in NSCLC (moderate counts, healthy [N=21, mean=1352, sd=592] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=1854, sd=846]), agreeing with Iversen, et al., 1998 [4], but in contrast to Fei, et al., 2017 [5], demonstrating that the jury is still out on the levels of many such genes. Thus, circulating mRNA from tumor tissues are not discriminatoryif MET is degraded to such levels in platelets  educated by NSCLC tumors, why not other possible mRNA that might have been picked during the same  class? Furthermore, high count genes can only be bona-fide platelet genes, and have no supporting experimental proof of splicing differences (any one gene would suffice to instill some confidence). In conclusion, looking past the statistical smoke surrounding \\\"surrogate signatures\\\", one finds no biological relevance.",

    "abstract": "1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1, 25 (OH)2 D3) and mechanical stimuli in physiological environment play an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. The effects of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 alone and mechanical stimuli alone on osteoblasts have been widely investigated. This study reports the collective influences of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and flow shear stress (FSS) on biological functions of osteoblasts. 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 were constructed in various kinds of concentration (0, 1, 10, 100 nmmol/L), while physiological fluid shear stress (12 dynes/cm2) were produced by using a parallel-plate fluid flow system. 1, 25 (OH)2 D3 affects the responses of ROBs to FSS, including the inhibition of NO releases and cell proliferation as well as the promotion of PGE2 releases and cell differentiation. These findings provide a possible mechanism by which 1, 25(OH)2 D3 influences osteoblasts responses to FSS and may provide guidance for the selection of 1, 25(OH)2 D3 concentration and mechanical loading in order to in vitro produce functional bone tissues.",

    "abstract": "Recent theory suggests that male coercion could contribute to the maintenance of obligate sex. However, it is unclear how sexually antagonistic coevolution might interact with mate scarcity to influence the probability of invasions of obligately sexual populations by mutants capable of parthenogenetic reproduction. Furthermore, if invasion does occur, it is unclear which factors promote or prevent the complete loss of sex. Using individual-based models, we show that male coercion cannot prevent the invasion of a mutant allele that gives virgin females the ability to reproduce parthenogenetically because mutants always benefit by producing at least some offspring asexually prior to mating. Indeed, the likelihood of invasion generally increases as sexual conflict intensifies, and the effects of sexual conflict and mate scarcity can interact in complex ways to promote invasion. Nonetheless, we find that coercion prevents the complete loss of sex unless linkage disequilibrium can build up between the mutant allele and alleles for effective female resistance. Our findings clarify how costs and limitations of female resistance can promote the maintenance of sexual reproduction, turning sex into an evolutionary trap. At the same time, our results highlight the need to explain why facultative reproductive strategies so rarely evolve in nature.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens have become a serious global human health threat, and conjugative plasmids are important drivers of the rapid spread of resistance to last-resort antibiotics. Whereas antibiotics have been shown to select for adaptation of resistance plasmids to their new bacterial hosts, or vice versa, a general evolutionary mechanism has not yet emerged. Here we conducted an experimental evolution study aimed at determining general patterns of plasmid-bacteria evolution. Specifically, we found that a large conjugative resistance plasmid follows the same evolutionary trajectories as its non-conjugative mini-replicon in the same and other species. Furthermore, within a single host-plasmid pair three distinct patterns of adaptive evolution led to increased plasmid persistence: i) mutations in the replication protein gene (trfA1); ii) the acquisition by the resistance plasmid of a transposon from a co-residing plasmid encoding a putative toxin-antitoxin system; iii) a mutation in the hosts global transcriptional regulator gene fur. Since each of these evolutionary solutions individually have been shown to increase plasmid persistence in other plasmid-host pairs, our work points towards common mechanisms of plasmid stabilization. These could become the targets of future alternative drug therapies to slow down the spread of antibiotic resistance.",

A comprehensive prediction of potential active regulatory regions is necessary to functionally study the roles of the majority of genomic variants in evolution, domestication, and animal production. We developed a computational method to predict regulatory DNA sequences (promoters, enhancers and transcription factor binding sites) in production animals (cows and pigs) and extended its broad applicability to other mammals. The method utilizes human regulatory features identified from thousands of tissues, cell lines, and experimental assays to find homologous regions that are conserved in sequences and genome organization and are enriched for regulatory elements in the genome sequences of other mammalian species. Importantly, we developed a filtering strategy, including a machine learning classification method, to utilize a very small number of species-specific experimental datasets available to select for the likely active regulatory regions. The method finds the optimal combination of sensitivity and accuracy to unbiasedly predict regulatory regions in mammalian species. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of the predicted regulatory datasets in cattle for prioritizing variants associated with multiple production and climate change adaptation traits, and identifying potential genome editing targets.",

    "abstract": "Musical imagery is a human experience of imagining music without actually hearing it. The neural basis of such a mental ability is unclear, especially for musicians capable of accurate and vivid musical imagery due to their musical training. Here, we visualized an 8-min symphony as a silent movie, and used it as real-time cues for musicians to continuously imagine the music for multiple synchronized sessions during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The activations and networks evoked by musical imagery were compared with those when the subjects directly listened to the same music. The musical imagery and perception shared similar responses at bilateral secondary auditory areas and Wernickes area for encoding the musical feature. But the Wernickes area was involved in highly distinct network interactions during musical imagery vs. perception. The former involved positive correlations with a subset of the auditory network and the attention network, but negative correlations with the default mode network; the latter was confined to the intrinsic auditory network in the resting state. Our results highlight the important role of the Wernickes area in forming vivid musical imagery through bilateral and anti-correlated network interactions, challenging the conventional view of segregated and lateralized processing of music vs. language.",

    "abstract": "To study the evolution of several quantitative traits, the classical phylogenetic comparative framework consists of a multivariate random process running along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is sometimes preferred to the simple Brownian Motion (BM) as it models stabilizing selection toward an optimum. The optimum for each trait is likely to be changing over the long periods of time spanned by large modern phylogenies. Our goal is to automatically detect the position of these shifts on a phylogenetic tree, while accounting for correlations between traits, which might exist because of structural or evolutionary constraints. We show that, in the presence shifts, phylogenetic Principal Component Analysis (pPCA) fails to decorrelate traits efficiently, so that any method aiming at finding shift needs to deal with correlation simultaneously. We introduce here a simplification of the full multivariate OU model, named scalar OU (scOU), which allows for noncausal correlations and is still computationally tractable. We extend the equivalence between the OU and a BM on a re-scaled tree to our multivariate framework. We describe an Expectation Maximization algorithm that allows for a maximum likelihood estimation of the shift positions, associated with a new model selection criterion, accounting for the identifiability issues for the shift localization on the tree. The method, freely available as an R-package (PhylogeneticEM) is fast, and can deal with missing values. We demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy compared to another state-of-the-art method ({ell}1ou) on a wide range of simulated scenarios, and use this new framework to re-analyze recently gathered datasets on New World Monkeys and Anolis lizards.",

Starting from 11 tumour types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we obtain three clusters based on transcriptomic correlation profiles. A network-based analysis, integrating gene expression profiles and protein interactions of cancer-related genes, allowed us to define three cluster-specific signatures, with genes belonging to NF-B signaling, chromosomal instability, ubiquitin-proteasome system, DNA metabolism, and apoptosis biological processes. These signatures have been characterized by different approaches based on mutational, pharmacological and clinical evidences, demonstrating the validity of our selection. Moreover, we defined new pharmacological strategies validated by in vitro experiments that showed inhibition of cell growth in two tumour cell lines, with significant synergistic effect. Our study thus provides a list of genes and pathways with the potential to be used, singularly or in combination, for the design of novel treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "In rule-based modeling, molecular interactions are systematically specified in the form of reaction rules that serve as generators of reactions. This provides a way to account for all the potential molecular complexes and interactions among multivalent or multistate molecules. Recently, we introduced rule- based modeling into the Virtual Cell (VCell) modeling framework, permitting graphical specification of rules and merger of networks generated automatically (using the BioNetGen modeling engine) with hand-specified reaction networks. VCell provides a number of ordinary differential equation (ODE) and stochastic numerical solvers for single-compartment simulations of the kinetic systems derived from these networks, and agent-based network-free simulation of the rules. In this work, compartmental and spatial modeling of rule-based models has been implemented within VCell. To enable rule-based deterministic and stochastic spatial simulations and network-free agent-based compartmental simulations, the BioNetGen and NFSim engines were each modified to support compartments. In the new rule-based formalism, every reactant and product pattern and every reaction rule are assigned locations. We also introduce the novel rule-based concept of molecular anchors. This assures that any species that has a molecule anchored to a predefined compartment will remain in this compartment. Importantly, in addition to formulation of compartmental models, this now permits VCell users to seamlessly connect reaction networks derived from rules to explicit geometries to automatically generate a system of reaction-diffusion equations. These may then be simulated using either the VCell partial differential equations (PDE) deterministic solvers or the Smoldyn stochastic simulator.",

Current neural models of face processing suggest a dissociation between the processing of invariant facial aspects such as identity and gender, that engage the fusiform face area (FFA) and the processing of changeable aspects, such as expression and eye gaze, that engage the posterior superior temporal sulcus face area (pSTS-FA). Recent studies report a second dissociation within this network such that the pSTS-FA, but not the FFA, shows much stronger response to dynamic than static faces. The aim of the current study was to test a unified model that accounts for these two major functional characteristics of the neural face network. In an fMRI experiment, we presented static and dynamic faces while subjects judged an invariant (gender) or a changeable facial aspect (expression). We found that the pSTS-FA was more engaged in processing dynamic than static faces and changeable than invariant facial aspects, whereas the OFA and FFA showed similar response across all four conditions. Our results reveal no dissociation between the processing of changeable and invariant facial aspects, but higher sensitivity to the processing of changeable facial aspects by the motion-sensitive face area in the superior temporal sulcus.",

    "abstract": "Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) have been used for many years to measure electrical activity in ensembles of many hundreds of neurons, and are used in research areas as diverse as neuronal connectivity and drug discovery. A high sampling frequency is required to adequately capture action potentials, also known as spikes, the primary electrical event associated with neuronal activity, and the resulting raw data files are large and difficult to visualize with traditional plotting tools. Many common approaches to deal with this issue, such as extracting spikes times and solely performing spike train analysis, significantly reduce data dimensionality. Unbiased data exploration benefits from the use of tools that minimize data transforms and such tools enable the development of heuristic perspective from data prior to any subsequent processing. Here we introduce MEA Viewer, a high-performance interactive application for the direct visualization of multi-channel electrophysiological data. MEA Viewer provides many high-performance visualizations of electrophysiological data, including an easily navigable overview of all recorded extracellular signals overlaid with spike timestamp data and an interactive raster plot. Beyond the fundamental data displays, MEA Viewer can signal average and spatially overlay the extent of action potential propagation within single neurons. This view extracts information below the spike detection threshold to directly visualize the propagation of action potentials across the plane of the MEA. This entirely new method of using MEAs opens up new and novel research applications for medium density arrays.

Influenza A virus (IAV) has a broad host-range, comprises many subtypes, and utilizes different routes of transmission including the fecal-oral route in wild birds2. It has been previously demonstrated that commensal bacteria can interact with the hosts immune system to protect against IAV pathogenesis3,4. However, it is unclear whether bacteria and their products may be interacting directly with IAV to impact virion stability. Herein we show that gastrointestinal (GI) tract bacterial isolates in an in vitro system significantly reduce the thermal stability of IAV. Moreover, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), found on the exterior surfaces of bacteria, was sufficient to significantly decrease the stability of both human and avian viral strains at the physiological temperatures of their respective hosts, as well as in the aquatic environment. Subtype and host-origin of the viruses were shown to affect the extent to which IAV was susceptible to LPS. Furthermore, using a receptor-binding assay and transmission electron microscopy, we observed that LPS binds to and affects the morphology of influenza virions.",

However, whether distinct patterns of activity induce different sets of ARGs is unknown. In genome-scale experiments, we reveal that a neurons activity-pattern history can be predicted from the ARGs it expresses. Surprisingly, brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the ARG program that that corresponds precisely to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. These first-wave genes are distinguished by an open chromatin state, proximity to rapidly activated enhancers, and a requirement for MAPK/ERK signaling for their induction. MAPK/ERK mediates rapid RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters, as well as enhancer RNA induction but not histone acetylation at enhancers. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of ARG induction also enable different sets of genes to be induced by distinct activity patterns.",

Here, we used a multielectrode array, wide field calcium imaging, and two-photon calcium imaging to study focal seizure propagation pathways in an acute rodent neocortical 4-aminopyridine model. Although ictal neuronal bursts did not propagate beyond a 2-3 mm region, they were associated with hemisphere-wide field potential fluctuations and parvalbumin-positive interneuron activity outside the seizure focus. While bicuculline surface application enhanced contiguous seizure propagation, focal bicuculline microinjection at sites distant to the 4-aminopyridine focus resulted in epileptic network formation with maximal activity at the two foci. Our study suggests that both classical and epileptic network propagation can arise from localized inhibition defects, and that the network appearance can arise in the context of normal brain structure without requirement for pathological connectivity changes between sites.",

Enrichment of mono-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) is a major chromatin signature that distinguishes enhancers from gene promoters. Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1, aka KDM1A), an enzyme specific for demethylating H3K4me2/me1, has been shown to \\\"decommission\\\" stem cell enhancers during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). However, the roles of LSD1 in undifferentiated mESC remain obscure. Here, we show that LSD1 occupies a large fraction of enhancers (63%) that are primed with binding of transcription factors (TFs) and H3K4me1 in mESC. In contrast, LSD1 is largely absent at latent enhancers, which are not yet primed by TF binding. Unexpectedly, LSD1 levels at enhancers exhibited a clear positive correlation with its substrate, H3K4me2 and enhancer activity. These enhancers gain additional H3K4 methylation upon the loss of LSD1 in mESC. The aberrant increase in H3K4me at enhancers was accompanied with increases in enhancer H3K27 acetylation and expression of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and their target genes. In post-mitotic neurons, loss of LSD1 resulted in premature activation of enhancers and genes that are normally induced after neuronal activation. These results demonstrate that LSD1 is a versatile suppressor of primed enhancers, and is involved in homeostasis of enhancer activity.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in regulatory genomics. Typically, these networks have a stack of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. In genomics, the same positional patterns are often present across multiple convolutional channels. Therefore, in current state-of-the-art networks, there exists significant redundancy in the representations learned by standard fully connected layers. We present a new separable fully connected layer that learns a weights tensor that is the outer product of positional weights and cross-channel weights, thereby allowing the same positional patterns to be applied across multiple convolutional channels. Decomposing positional and cross-channel weights further enables us to readily impose biologically-inspired constraints on positional weights, such as symmetry. We also propose a novel regularizer and constraint that act on curvature in the positional weights. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo datasets, we show that networks that incorporate our separable fully connected layer outperform conventional models with analogous architectures and the same number of parameters. Additionally, our networks are more robust to hyperparameter tuning, have more informative gradients, and produce importance scores that are more consistent with known biology than conventional deep neural networks.\\n\\nAvailabilityImplementation: https://github.com/kundajelab/keras/tree/keras_1\\n\\nA gist illustrating model setup is at: goo.gl/gYooaa",

    "abstract": "Southern Africa is consistently placed as one of the potential regions for the evolution of Homo sapiens. To examine the regions human prehistory prior to the arrival of migrants from East and West Africa or Eurasia in the last 1,700 years, we generated and analyzed genome sequence data from seven ancient individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Three Stone Age hunter-gatherers date to ~2,000 years ago, and we show that they were related to current-day southern San groups such as the Karretjie People. Four Iron Age farmers (300-500 years old) have genetic signatures similar to present day Bantu-speakers. The genome sequence (13x coverage) of a juvenile boy from Ballito Bay, who lived ~2,000 years ago, demonstrates that southern African Stone Age hunter-gatherers were not impacted by recent admixture; however, we estimate that all modern-day Khoekhoe and San groups have been influenced by 9-22% genetic admixture from East African/Eurasian pastoralist groups arriving >1,000 years ago, including the Ju| hoansi San, previously thought to have very low levels of admixture. Using traditional and new approaches, we estimate the population divergence time between the Ballito Bay boy and other groups to beyond 260,000 years ago. These estimates dramatically increases the deepest divergence amongst modern humans, coincide with the onset of the Middle Stone Age in sub-Saharan Africa, and coincide with anatomical developments of archaic humans into modern humans as represented in the local fossil record. Cumulatively, cross-disciplinary records increasingly point to southern Africa as a potential (not necessarily exclusive)  hot spot for the evolution of our species.",

    "abstract": "We gathered genomic data from grapes (Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera), a clonally propagated perennial crop, to address three ongoing mysteries about plant domestication. The first is the duration of domestication; archaeological evidence suggests that domestication occurs over millennia, but genetic evidence indicates it can occur rapidly. We estimated that our wild and cultivated grape samples diverged ~22,000 years ago and that the cultivated lineage experienced a steady decline in population size (Ne) thereafter. The long decline may reflect low intensity management by humans prior to domestication. The second mystery is the identification of genes that contribute to domestication phenotypes. In cultivated grapes, we identified candidate-selected genes that function in sugar metabolism, flower development and stress responses. In contrast, candidate selected genes in the wild sample were limited to abiotic and biotic stress responses. A genomic region of high divergence corresponded to the sex determination region and included a candidate male sterility factor and additional genes with sex-specific expression. The third mystery concerns the cost of domestication. Annual crops accumulate putatively deleterious variants, in part due to strong domestication bottlenecks. The domestication of perennial crops differs from annuals in several ways, including the intensity of bottlenecks, and it is not yet clear if they accumulate deleterious variants. We found that grape accessions contained 5.2% more deleterious variants than wild individuals, and these were more often in a heterozygous state. Using forward simulations, we confirm that clonal propagation leads to the accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations but without decreasing fitness.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe generated genomic data to estimate the population history of grapes, the most economically important horticultural crop in the world. Domesticated grapes experienced a protracted, 22,000 year population decline prior to domestication; we hypothesize that this decline reflects low intensity cultivation by humans prior to domestication. Domestication altered the mating system of grapes. The sex determination region is detectable as a region of heightened genetic divergence between wild and cultivated accessions. Based on gene expression analyses, we propose new candidate genes that alter sex determination. Finally, grapes contain more deleterious mutations in heterozygous states than their wild ancestors. The accumulation of deleterious mutations is due in part to clonal propagation, which shelters deleterious, recessive mutations.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Individuals with Parkinsons disease (PD) are at increased risk for falls, and exhibit deficits in executive function, including Set Shifting, which can be measured as the difference between parts B and A of the Trailmaking Test. METHODS. We conducted a cross-sectional study using baseline data of PD patients with and without freezing of gait (FOG) (n=69) and community-dwelling neurologically-normal older adults (NON-PD) (n=84) who had volunteered to participate in clinical rehabilitation research. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between Set Shifting, PD, and faller status, as determined by [&ge;]1 self-reported falls in the previous 6 months, after adjusting for demographic and cognitive factors and clinical disease characteristics. RESULTS. Impaired Set Shifting was associated with previous falls after controlling for age, sex, overall cognitive function, PD, FOG, and PD disease duration (OR=1.29 [1.03-1.60]; P=0.02). In models controlling for age, sex, and overall cognitive function, PD was associated with increased fall prevalence among the study sample (OR=4.15 [95% CI 1.65-10.44], P<0.01) and FOG was associated with increased fall prevalence among the PD sample (OR=3.63 [1.22-10.80], P=0.02). Although the strongest associations between Set Shifting and falling were observed among PD without FOG (OR=2.11) compared to HOA (OR=1.14) and PD with FOG (OR=1.46) in a multivariate model that allowed for interaction between set shifting and PD status, there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no interaction. CONCLUSIONS. Set Shifting is associated with previous falls in non-demented older adults with and without PD.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIIndividuals with PD are at increased risk for falls, although causes are unclear.\\nC_LIO_LIImpaired Set Shifting was associated with falls in older adults with and without PD.\\nC_LIO_LIAssociations were strongest among those with PD but without freezing of gait.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Neural responses to repeated presentations of an identical stimulus often show substantial trial-to-trial variability. How the mean firing rate varies in response to different stimuli or during different movements (tuning curves) has been extensively modeled in a wide variety of neural systems. However, the variability of neural responses can also have clear tuning independent of the tuning in the mean firing rate. This suggests that the variability could contain information regarding the stimulus/movement beyond what is encoded in the mean firing rate. Here we demonstrate how taking variability into account can improve neural decoding. In a typical neural coding model spike counts are assumed to be Poisson with the mean response depending on an external variable, such as a stimulus or movement. Bayesian decoding methods then use the probabilities under these Poisson tuning models (the likelihood) to estimate the probability of each stimulus given the spikes on a given trial (the posterior). However, under the Poisson model, spike count variability is always exactly equal to the mean (Fano factor = 1). Here we use two alternative models - the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) model and Negative Binomial (NB) model - to more flexibly characterize how neural variability depends on external stimuli. These models both contain the Poisson distribution as a special case but have an additional parameter that allows the variance to be greater than the mean (Fano factor >1) or, for the CMP model, less than the mean (Fano factor <1). We find that neural responses in primary motor (M1), visual (V1), and auditory (A1) cortices have diverse tuning in both their mean firing rates and response variability. Across cortical areas, we find that Bayesian decoders using the CMP or NB models improve stimulus/movement estimation accuracy by 4-12% compared to the Poisson model. Moreover, the uncertainty of the non-Poisson decoders more accurately reflects the magnitude of estimation errors. In addition to tuning curves that reflect average neural responses, stimulus-dependent response variability may be an important aspect of the neural code. Modeling this structure could, potentially, lead to improvements in brain machine interfaces.",
