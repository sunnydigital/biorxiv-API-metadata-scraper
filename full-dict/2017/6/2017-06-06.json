    "abstract": "Both species and their interactions are affected by changes that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and these changes shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic structure. That said, extant ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host-parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.",

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism is regulated by enzyme complexes within the mitochondrion, the function of which are sensitive to the prevailing temperature. Such thermal sensitivity, coupled with the observation that population frequencies of mitochondrial haplotypes tend to associate with latitude, altitude or climatic regions across species distributions, led to the hypothesis that thermal selection has played a role in shaping standing variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence. This hypothesis, however, remains controversial, and requires evidence that the distribution of haplotypes observed in nature corresponds with the capacity of these haplotypes to confer differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, haplotypes predominating in tropical climates are predicted to encode increased tolerance to heat stress, but decreased tolerance to cold stress. We present direct evidence for these predictions, using mtDNA haplotypes sampled from the Australian distribution of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that the ability of flies to tolerate extreme thermal challenges is affected by sequence variation across mtDNA haplotypes, and that the thermal performance associated with each haplotype corresponds with its latitudinal prevalence. The haplotype that predominates at low (subtropical) latitudes confers greater resilience to heat stress, but lower resilience to cold stress, than haplotypes predominating at higher (temperate) latitudes. We explore molecular mechanisms that might underlie these responses, presenting evidence that the effects are in part regulated by SNPs that do not change the protein sequence. Our findings suggest that standing variation in the mitochondrial genome can be shaped by thermal selection, and could therefore contribute to evolutionary adaptation under climatic stress.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mek1 is a CHK2/Rad53-family kinase that regulates meiotic recombination and progression upon its activation in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The full catalog of direct Mek1 phosphorylation targets remains unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 on threonine 11 (H3 T11ph) is induced by meiotic DSBs in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Molecular genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae confirmed that Mek1 is required for H3 T11ph and revealed that phosphorylation is rapidly reversed when Mek1 kinase is no longer active. Reconstituting histone phosphorylation in vitro with recombinant proteins demonstrated that Mek1 directly catalyzes H3 T11 phosphorylation. Mutating H3 T11 to nonphosphorylatable residues conferred no detectable defects in otherwise unperturbed meiosis, although the mutations modestly reduced spore viability in certain strains where Rad51 is used for strand exchange in place of Dmc1. H3 T11ph is therefore mostly dispensable for Mek1 function. However, H3 T11ph provides an excellent marker of ongoing Mek1 kinase activity in vivo. Anti-H3 T11ph chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing demonstrated that H3 T11ph was highly enriched at presumed sites of attachment of chromatin to chromosome axes, gave a more modest signal along chromatin loops, and was present at still lower levels immediately adjacent to DSB hotspots. These localization patterns closely tracked the distribution of Red1 and Hop1, axis proteins required for Mek1 activation. These findings provide insight into the spatial disposition of Mek1 kinase activity and the higher order organization of recombining meiotic chromosomes.\\n\\nbioRxiv version 2 (June 2017)One major experimental change was incorporated into the revised manuscript: We repeated the anti-H3 T11ph ChIP-seq experiment on larger scale, including two meiotic time points from each of two wild type cultures and one time point from a spo11-Y135F mutant culture. To facilitate comparison of different samples, we used meiotic S. pombe cells as a spike-in control for all samples for both anti-H3 and anti-H3 T11ph ChIP-seq. Most conclusions described in the first bioRxiv submission were confirmed, but the improved datasets allowed us to derive more detailed information in particular about H3 T11ph patterns around DSB sites.\\n\\nbioRxiv version 3 (October 2017)The following experimental changes were incorporated, along with more minor changes in response to reviewer comments: O_LIWe added previously unpublished ChIP-seq data for Red1 protein, generated by Masaru Ito and Kunihiro Ohta, who have been added as coauthors.\\nC_LIO_LIWe repeated key experiments with the H3-T11V single point mutant. No conclusions were changed relative to prior experiments with the H3-S10, T11V mutant.\\nC_LIO_LIWe repeated the analysis of spore viability in a dmc1 rad54-T132A background using a more appropriate isogenic control, and recapitulated the original conclusion that the H3-T11V mutation modestly decreases spore viability in this sensitized background.\\nC_LI",

Here, we use somatic mutation signatures - each representing a mutagenic process - derived from 3056 patients spanning 19 cancer types to quantify the asymmetry of mutational signatures around replication origins and between early and late replicating regions. We observe that 22 out of 29 mutational signatures are significantly impacted by DNA replication. The distinct associations of different signatures with replication timing and direction around origins shed new light on several mutagenic processes, for example suggesting that oxidative damage to the nucleotide pool substantially contributes to the mutational landscape of esophageal adenocarcinoma.

As the brain computes and codes using neuron populations, it is hoped these data will uncover the fundamentals of neural computation. But with hundreds, thousands, or more simultaneously recorded neurons comes the inescapable problems of visualising, describing, and quantifying their interactions. Here I argue that network science provides a set of scalable, analytical tools that already solve these problems. By treating neurons as nodes and their interactions as links, a single network can visualise and describe an arbitrarily large recording. I show that with this description we can quantify the effects of manipulating a neural circuit, track changes in population dynamics over time, and quantitatively define theoretical concepts of neural populations such as cell assemblies. Using network science as a core part of analysing population recordings will thus provide both qualitative and quantitative advances to our understanding of neural computation.",

    "abstract": "Protein superfamilies can be divided into subfamilies of proteins with different functional characteristics. Their sequences can be classified hierarchically, which is part of sequence function assignation. Typically, there are no clear subfamily hallmarks that would allow pattern-based function assignation by which this task is mostly achieved based on the similarity principle. This is hampered by the lack of a score cut-off that is both sensitive and specific.\\n\\nHMMER Cut-off Threshold Tool (HMMERCTTER) adds a reliable cut-off threshold to the popular HMMER. Using a high quality superfamily phylogeny, it clusters a set of training sequences such that the cluster-specific HMMER profiles show 100% precision and recall (P&R), thereby generating a specific threshold as inclusion cut-off. Profiles and threshold are then used as classifiers to screen a target dataset. Iterative inclusion of novel sequences to groups and the corresponding HMMER profiles results in high sensitivity while specificity is maintained by imposing 100% P&R. In three presented case studies of protein superfamilies, classification of large datasets with 100% P&R was achieved with over 95% coverage.

An important step in genome sequence processing is function assignation of the encoded protein sequences, typically based on the similarity principle: The more similar sequences are, the more likely they encode the same function. However, evolution generated many protein superfamilies that consist of various subfamilies with different functional characteristics, such as substrate specificity, optimal activity conditions or the catalyzed reaction. The classification of superfamily sequences to their respective subfamilies can be performed based on similarity but since the different subfamilies also remain similar, it requires a reliable similarity score cut-off.\\n\\nWe present a tool that clusters training sequences and describes them in profiles that identify cluster members with higher similarity scores than non-cluster members, i.e. with 100% precision and recall. This defines a score cut-off threshold. Profiles and thresholds are then used to classify other sequences. Classified sequences are included in the profiles in order to improve sensitivity while maintaining specificity by imposing 100% precision and recall. Results on three case studies show that the tool can correctly classify complex superfamilies with over 95% coverage.\\n\\nHMMERCTTER is meant as a decision support system for the expert biologist rather than the computational biologist.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that breast tumors exhibit different expression patterns that can be used to assign intrinsic subtypes - the PAM50 assay, for example, categorizes tumors into: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and Basal-like - yet tumors are often more complex than categorization can describe. We used 911 sporadic breast tumors to reparameterize expression from the PAM50 genes to five orthogonal tumor dimensions using principal components (PC). Three dimensions captured intrinsic subtype, two dimensions were novel, and all replicated in 945 TCGA tumors. By definition dimensions are independent, an important attribute for inclusion in downstream studies exploring effects of tumor diversity. One application where tumor subtyping has failed to provide impact is susceptibility genetics. Germline genetic heterogeneity reduces power for gene-finding. The identification of heritable tumor characteristics has potential to increase homogeneity. We compared 238 breast tumors from high-risk pedigrees not attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 to 911 sporadic breast tumors. Two PC dimensions were significantly enriched in the pedigrees (intrinsic subtypes were not). We performed proof-of-concept gene-mapping in one enriched pedigree and identified a 0.5 Mb genomewide significant region at 12q15 that segregated to the 8 breast cancer cases with the most extreme PC tumors through 32 meioses (p=2.6x10-8). In conclusion, our study: suggests a new approach to describe tumor diversity; supports the hypothesis that tumor characteristics are heritable providing new avenues for germline studies; and proposes a new breast cancer locus. Reparameterization of expression patterns may similarly inform other studies attempting to model the effects of tumor heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Superfast muscles (SFM) are extremely fast synchronous muscles capable of contraction rates up to 250 Hz, enabling precise motor execution at the millisecond time scale. To allow such speed, the archetypal SFM, found in the toadfish swimbladder, has hallmark structural and kinetic adaptations at each step of the conserved excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) pathway. More recently SFM phenotypes have been discovered in most major vertebrate lineages, but it remains unknown whether all SFM share ECC adaptations for speed, and if SFM arose once, or from independent evolutionary events. Here we use genomic analysis to identify the myosin heavy chain genes expressed in bat and songbird SFM to achieve rapid actomyosin crossbridge kinetics and demonstrate that these are evolutionarily and ontologically distinct. Furthermore, by quantifying cellular morphometry and calcium signal transduction combined with force measurements we show that all known SFM share multiple functional adaptations that minimize ECC transduction times. Our results suggest that SFM evolved independently in sound producing organs in ray-finned fish, birds, and mammals, and that SFM phenotypes operate at a maximum operational speed set by fundamental constraints in synchronous muscle. Consequentially, these constraints set a fundamental limit to the maximum speed of fine motor control.",

NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism at these intensities, but their kinetics could be accelerated by US-induced heating.",

As a follow-up to speaq, a previously released workflow for NMR spectral alignment and quantitation, we present speaq 2.0. This completely revised framework to automatically analyze 1D NMR spectra uses wavelets to efficiently summarize the raw spectra with minimal information loss or user interaction. The tool offers a fast and easy workflow that starts with the common approach of peak-picking, followed by grouping. This yields a matrix consisting of features, samples and peak values that can be conveniently processed either by using included multivariate statistical functions or by using many other recently developed methods for NMR data analysis. speaq 2.0 facilitates robust and high-throughput metabolomics based on 1D NMR but is also compatible with other NMR frameworks or complementary LC-MS workflows. The methods are benchmarked using two publicly available datasets. speaq 2.0 is distributed through the existing speaq R package to provide a complete solution for NMR data processing. The package and the code for the presented case studies are freely available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=speaq) and GitHub (https://github.com/beirnaert/speaq).\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe present speaq 2.0: a user friendly workflow for processing NMR spectra quickly and easily. By limiting the need for user interaction and allowing the construction of workflows by combining R functions, metabolomics data analysis becomes fully reproducible and shareable. Such advances are critical for the future of the metabolomics field as it needs to move towards a fully open-science approach. This is no trivial goal as many researchers are still using black-box commercial software that often requires manually doing several steps, thus hampering reproducibility. To encourage the shift towards open source, we deliberately made our method usable for anyone with the most basic of R experience, something that is easily acquired. speaq 2.0 allows a stand-alone analysis from spectra to statistical analysis. In addition, the package can be combined with existing tools to improve performance, as it provides a superior peak picking method compared to the standard binning approach.",

Here we characterize its genomic diversity by sequencing 134 individuals covering 73 species across all major lineages. Average sequence divergence between species pairs is only 0.1-0.25%. These divergence values overlap diversity within species, with 82% of heterozygosity shared between species. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that diversification initially proceeded by serial branching from a generalist Astatotilapia-like ancestor. However, no single species tree adequately represents all species relationships, with evidence for substantial gene flow at multiple times. Common signatures of selection on visual and oxygen transport genes shared by distantly related deep water species point to both adaptive introgression and independent selection. These findings enhance our understanding of genomic processes underlying rapid species diversification, and provide a platform for future genetic analysis of the Malawi radiation.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: The genomes of 73 cichlid fish species from Lake Malawi uncover evolutionary processes underlying a large adaptive evolutionary radiation.",

Wild-type Canton-S adult flies walked in one direction, counter-clockwise or clockwise, for minutes, whereas white-eyed mutant w1118 changed directions frequently. Locomotion in the circular arena could be classified into four components: counter-clockwise walking, clockwise walking, nondirectional walking and pausing. Genetic analysis revealed that while wild-type genetic background was associated with reduced directional change and reduced numbers of one-way (including counterclockwise and clockwise) and nondirectional walks, the white (w+) locus promoted persistent oneway walking by increasing the maximal duration of one-way episodes. The promoting effect of w+ was further supported by the observations that (1) w+ duplicated to the Y chromosome, (2) four genomic copies of mini-white inserted on the autosomes, and (3) pan-neuronal overexpression of the White protein increased the maximal duration of one-way episodes, and that RNAi knockdown of w+ in the neurons decreased the maximal duration of one-way episodes. These results suggested a pleiotropic function of w+ in promoting persistent one-way walking in the circular arena.",

The ACMG/AMP guidelines recommend complete concordance of predictions among all in silico algorithms used without specifying the number or types of algorithms. The subjective nature of this recommendation contributes to discordance of variant classification among clinical laboratories and prevents definitive classification of variants.\\n\\nResultsUsing 14,819 benign or pathogenic missense variants from the ClinVar database, we compared performance of 25 algorithms across datasets differing in distinct biological and technical variables. There was wide variability in concordance among different combinations of algorithms with particularly low concordance for benign variants. We also identify a previously unreported source of error in variant interpretation where in silico predictions are opposite to the evidence provided by other sources. We identified recently developed algorithms with high predictive power and robust to variables like disease mechanism, gene constraint and mode of inheritance, although poorer performing algorithms are more frequently used based on review of the clinical genetics literature (2011-2017).\\n\\nConclusionsOur analyses identify algorithms with high performance characteristics independent of underlying disease mechanisms. We describe combinations of algorithms with increased concordance that should improve in silico algorithm usage during assessment of clinically relevant variants using the ACMG/AMP guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers enable exquisite spatiotemporal control of gene expression in metazoans. Enrichment of mono-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) is a major chromatin signature that distinguishes enhancers from gene promoters. Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1, aka KDM1A), an enzyme specific for demethylating H3K4me2/me1, has been shown to \\\"decommission\\\" stem cell enhancers during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). However, the roles of LSD1 in undifferentiated mESC remain obscure. Here, we show that LSD1 occupies a large fraction of enhancers (63%) that are primed with binding of transcription factors (TFs) and H3K4me1 in mESC. In contrast, LSD1 is largely absent at latent enhancers, which are not yet primed by TF binding. Unexpectedly, LSD1 levels at enhancers exhibited a clear positive correlation with its substrate, H3K4me2 and enhancer activity. These enhancers gain additional H3K4 methylation upon the loss of LSD1 in mESC. The aberrant increase in H3K4me at enhancers was accompanied with increases in enhancer H3K27 acetylation and expression of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and their target genes. In post-mitotic neurons, loss of LSD1 resulted in premature activation of enhancers and genes that are normally induced after neuronal activation. These results demonstrate that LSD1 is a versatile suppressor of primed enhancers, and is involved in homeostasis of enhancer activity.",

To gain a better understanding of germ cell dysfunction in this condition, we produced XYsry--females via the CRISPR/Cas9 system in C57BL/6 inbred strain mice. Mutant mice showed severe attrition of germ cells during foetal development, resulting in depletion of ovarian germ cells before sexual maturation. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of embryonic day 13.5 primordial germ cells (PGCs) and postnatal day 1 oocytes demonstrated that XYsry--PGCs had already deviated from the developmental process at the mitotic stage. In addition, XYsry--oocytes resulted in meiotic disruption and developmental failure, and the genes related to these processes were significantly changed. This grievous disruption, which caused germ cell deterioration in XYsry--females, was shown to proceed from the germ cells themselves. These results provide novel insight into the germ cell depletion of sex-reversed mice as well as into disorders of sex differentiation in human, such as  Swyer syndrome, wherein patients present as typical females albeit with an XY karyotype and infertile.",

The cassette nests a stable reference FP (large Stokes shift LSSmOrange) within a reporter FP (circularly permuted green FP). GO-Matryoshka yields green and orange fluorescence upon blue excitation. As proof of concept, we converted existing, single-emission biosensors into a series of ratiometric calcium sensors (MatryoshCaMP6s) and ammonium transport activity sensors (AmTryoshka1;3). We additionally identified the internal acid-base equilibrium as a key determinant of the GCaMP dynamic range. Matryoshka technology promises flexibility in the design of a wide spectrum of ratiometric biosensors and expanded in vivo applications.",

Here, we aimed to investigate the endocrine disruption and impact of MGA on zebrafish reproduction. Six-month old reproductive zebrafish were exposed to four nominal concentrations of MGA (1,10, 100 and 200 ng/L) for 15 days. Treatment with MGA reduced the egg production with a significant decrease at 200 ng/L. The circulating concentrations of estradiol and testosterone in female zebrafish or 11-keto testosterone in male zebrafish were significantly diminished compared to the non-exposed control fish. The early embryonic development or hatching rates were unaffected during the MGA exposure. Our results indicated that MGA was a potent endocrine disruptor in fish and the fish reproduction could be impaired even during a short-term exposure to MGA.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a signalling molecule that has direct and indirect regulatory roles in various functional processes in biology, though in plant kingdom its role is relatively unexplored. One reason for this is the fact that sensing of NO is always challenging. There are very few probes that can classify the different NO species. The present paper proposes a simple but straightforward way for sensing different NO species using chlorophyll, the source of inspiration being hemoglobin that serves as a NO sink in most mamalian system. The proposed method is able to classify NO from DETA-NONOate or (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl) amino] diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate, nitrite, nitrate and S-nitrosothiol or SNO. This discrimination is carried out by chlorophyll a (chl a) at nano molar (nM) order of sensitivity and at 293K to 310K. Molecular docking reveals the differential binding behaviour of NO and SNO with chlorophyll, the predicted binding affinity matching with the experimental observation. Additional expreiments with diverse range of cyanobacteria reveals that apart from spectroscopic approach the proposed sensing module can be used in microscopic inspection of NO speices. Binding of NO is sensitive to tempertaure and static magnetic field. This provides additional support to the involvement of the porphyrin ring structure to the NO sensing process. This also broadens the scope of the sensing methods as hinted in the text.",

    "abstract": "The uphill energy transfer in photosystems implies input energy at higher wavelength leading to energy output at lower wavelength. Briefly, energy is uphill transported from photosystem I (PSI) to photosystem II (PSII), the latter having a lower wavelength emission. This uphill energy transport involves absorption of thermal energy from the surroundings. While such cooling effects have been reported in laser systems we report for the first time a white light driven cooling in thylakoid suspension. The cooling of the surrounding medium by appropriate illumination was illustrated using thermal measurements. Again cooling is inhibited by agents like 3-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea,that block the linear electron flow between the photocenters, implying a dependence of the cooling on interplay between such centers. Furthermore, it is possible to modulate the cooling pattern by addition of external agents like nanopaticles, some favoring further cooling (e.g., Ag nanoparticle) and some like Au or chlorophyll nanoparticles, showing insignificant or even reverse trends. Interestingly, the cooling is invariably associated with the 77K spectra of the thylakoid suspension. With reference to the dark control, an agent causing cooling always increases PSII to PSI ratio and vice versa i.e.,the uphill energy transport. Importantly, the cooling effect, apart from its import role in plant physiology can be exploited artificially for energy saving in post-harvest or food preservation.",

    "abstract": "Serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) is a relatively new technique that allows the acquisition of serially sectioned, imaged and digitally aligned ultrastructural data. There is a wealth of information that can be obtained from the resulting image stacks but this presents a new challenge for researchers - how to computationally analyse and make best use of the large data sets produced. One approach is to reconstruct structures and features of interest in 3D. However the software programs can appear overwhelming, time consuming and not intuitive for those new to image analysis. There are a limited number of published articles that provide sufficient detail on how to do this type of reconstruction. Therefore the aim of this paper is to provide a detailed step-by-step protocol, videos and explanation on the types of analysis and programs that can be used. To showcase the programs, skeletal muscle from fetal and adult guinea pigs were used. The tissue was processed using the heavy metal protocol developed specifically for SBFSEM. Trimmed resin blocks were placed into a Zeiss Sigma SEM incorporating the Gatan 3View and the resulting image stacks were analysed in 3 different programs, Fiji, Amira and MIB, using a range of tools available for segmentation. The results from the image analysis comparison show that the analysis tools are often more suited to a type of structure. For example larger structures, such as nuclei and cells, can be segmented using interpolation, which speeds up analysis; single contrast structures, such as the nucleolus, can be segmented using the contrast-based thresholding tools. Knowing the nature of the tissue and its specific structures (complexity, contrast, if there are distinct membranes, size) will help to determine the best method for reconstruction and thus maximising output from valuable tissue.",

In this study, we use three independent experiments on laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster to examine the effects of pre-dispersal adult density, sex of the dispersers and presence of mates on the robustness of DDD patterns. We show that DDD can be greatly affected by both pre-dispersal density and interaction between the sexes. Moreover, the direction of sex-biased dispersal can reverse completely due to an interaction between the pre-dispersal and dispersal densities. We also show that interaction between the sexes can lead to negative DDD at the population level, even if, by themselves, neither sex exhibits DDD. Finally, we discuss potential implications of our results for processes like evolutionary rescue from extinctions and genetic divergence of populations.",

Hyperspectral reflectance data were collected in the visible to near IR region of the spectrum using a robotic tram system that operated along a 300m transects during the snow free growing period between June and August, 2005-09. Interannual patterns of land-surface phenology (NDVI) unexpectedly lacked marked differences under experimental conditions. Measurement of NDVI was, however, compromised for presence of surface water. Land-surface phenology and surface water was negatively correlated, which held when scaled to a 2km by 2km MODIS subset of the study area. This result suggested that published findings of  greening of the Arctic may relate to a  drying of the Arctic i.e. reduced surface water in vegetated high-latitude landscapes where surface water is close to ground level.",

The circadian clock is a molecular timer of metabolism that controls A and stomatal conductance (gs), amongst other processes, in a broad array of plant species. Here, we test whether circadian regulation contributes towards achieving optimal stomatal behaviour. We subjected bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) canopies to fixed, continuous environmental conditions of photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and vapour pressure deficit over 48 hours. We observed a significant and self-sustained circadian oscillation in A and in stomatal conductance (gs) which also led to a circadian oscillation in{lambda} . The lack of constant marginal water cost indicates that circadian regulation does not directly lead to optimal stomatal behaviour. However, the temporal pattern in gas exchange, indicative of either maximizing A or of minimizing E, depending upon time of day, indicates that circadian regulation could contribute towards optimizing stomatal responses. More broadly, our results add to the emerging field of plant circadian ecology and show that molecular controls may partially explain leaf-level patterns observed in the field.",

    "abstract": "The iPSYCH consortium has established a large Danish population-based Case-Cohort sample (iPSYCH2012) aimed at unravelling the genetic and environmental architecture of severe mental disorders. The iPSYCH2012 sample is nested within the entire Danish population born 1981-2005 including 1,472,762 persons. This paper introduces the iPSYCH2012 sample and outlines key future research directions. Cases were identified as persons with schizophrenia (N=3,540), autism (N=16,146), ADHD (N=18,726), and affective disorder (N=26,380), of which 1928 had bipolar affective disorder. Controls were randomly sampled individuals (N=30,000). Within the sample of 86,189 individuals, a total of 57,377 individuals had at least one major mental disorder. DNA was extracted from the neonatal dried blood spot samples obtained from the Danish Neonatal Screening Biobank and genotyped using the Illumina PsychChip. Genotyping was successful for 90% of the sample. The assessments of exome sequencing, methylation profiling, metabolome profiling, vitamin-D, inflammatory and neurotrophic factors are in progress. For each individual, the iPSYCH2012 sample also includes longitudinal information on health, prescribed medicine, social and socioeconomic information and analogous information among relatives. To the best of our knowledge, the iPSYCH2012 sample is the largest and most comprehensive data source for the combined study of genetic and environmental aetiologies of severe mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations show variation in density across cancer genomes. Previous studies have shown that chromatin organization and replication time domains are correlated with and thus predictive of this variation 1,2,3,4,5. Here, we analyse 1,809 whole-genome sequences from nine cancer types 6,7,8 to show that a subset of repetitive DNA sequences called non-B motifs that predict non-canonical secondary structure formation 9,10,11,12 can independently account for variation in mutation density. However, combined with epigenetic factors and replication timing, the variance explained can be improved to 43-76%. Intriguingly, ~2-fold mutation enrichment is observed directly within non-B motifs, is focused on exposed structural components, and is dependent on physical properties that are optimal for secondary structure formation. Therefore, there is mounting evidence that secondary structures arising from non-B motifs are not simply associated with increased mutation density, they are possibly causally implicated. Our results suggest that they are determinants of mutagenesis and increase the likelihood of recurrent mutations in the genome 13,6. This analysis calls for caution in the interpretation of recurrent mutations and highlights the importance of taking non-B motifs, that can simply be inferred from the reference sequence, into consideration in background models of mutability henceforth.",

    "abstract": "Circular DNA such as plasmids and some viruses is the major source of genetic variation in bacteria and thus has the same important evolutionary function as sexual reproduction in eukaryotic species: It allows dissemination of advantageous traits through bacterial populations. Here, we present the largest collection of novel complete extrachromosomal genetic elements to date, and compare the diversity, distribution, and content of circular sequences from 12 rat cecum samples from the pristine Falkland Islands and Danish hospital sewers, two environments with contrasting anthropogenic impact. Using a validated pipeline, we find 1,869 complete, circular, non-redundant sequences, of which only 114 are previously described. While sequences of similar size from the two environments share general features, the size distribution of the elements between environments differs significantly, with hospital sewer samples hosting larger circular elements than Falkland Island samples, a possible consequence of the massive anthropogenic influence in the hospital sewer environment. Several antibiotic resistance genes have been identified with a notably larger diversity in hospital sewer samples than in Falkland Islands samples in concordance with expectations. Our findings suggest that even though sequences of similar length carry similar traits, the mobilome of rat gut bacteria are affected by human activities in that sewer rats have larger elements and more diverse large elements than pristine island rats.

We show that their performance is competitive to that of commonly used techniques, even when the models are used on DWI data unseen at training time. We also show that our models are able to recover high spatial coverage of the ground truth white matter pathways while better controlling the number of false connections.

    "abstract": "A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological \\\"atoms\\\". Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility of in-vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on one of two approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be more homogeneous than four previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured sub-areal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data. Multi-resolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal)",

    "abstract": "Vision research has been shaped by the seminal insight that we can understand the higher-tier visual cortex from the perspective of multiple functional pathways with different goals. In this paper, we try to give a computational account of the functional organization of this system by reasoning from the perspective of multi-task deep neural networks. Machine learning has shown that tasks become easier to solve when they are decomposed into subtasks with their own cost function. We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to vision for action. To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either two related or two unrelated tasks, using an identical stimulus set. Results show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing. We conjecture that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional organization of the visual system and beyond. We predict that the degree to which tasks are related is a good descriptor of the degree to which they share downstream cortical-units.",

Unlike other replicative helicases, eukaryotic CMG encircles duplex DNA at a forked junction and is stopped by a block on the non-tracking (lagging) strand. This report demonstrates that Mcm10, an essential replication protein unique to eukaryotes, binds CMG and enables the replisome to bypass blocks on the non-tracking strand, implying that Mcm10 isomerizes the CMG-DNA complex to position only one strand through the central channel. A similar CMG-DNA isomerization is needed at the origin for head-to-head CMGs to bypass one another during formation of bidirectional replication forks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMost of our knowledge about the remarkable microbial diversity on Earth comes from sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The use of next-generation sequencing methods has increased sample number and sequencing depth, but the read length of the most widely used sequencing platforms today is quite short, requiring the researcher to choose a subset of the gene to sequence (typically 16-33% of the total length). Thus, many bacteria may share the same amplified region and the resolution of profiling is inherently limited. Platforms that offer ultra long read lengths, whole genome shotgun sequencing approaches, and computational frameworks formerly suggested by us and by others, all allow different ways to circumvent this problem yet suffer various shortcomings. There is need for a simple and low cost 16S rRNA gene based profiling approach that harnesses the short read length to provide a much larger coverage of the gene to allow for high resolution, even in harsh conditions of low bacterial biomass and fragmented DNA.\\n\\nResultsThis manuscript suggests Short MUltiple Regions Framework (SMURF), a method to combine sequencing results from different PCR-amplified regions to provide one coherent profiling. The de facto amplicon length is the total length of all amplified regions, thus providing much higher resolution compared to current techniques. Computationally, the method solves a convex optimization problem that allows extremely fast reconstruction and requires only moderate memory. We demonstrate the increase in resolution by in silico simulations and by profiling two mock mixtures and real-world biological samples. Reanalyzing a mock mixture from the Human Microbiome Project achieved about two-fold improvement in resolution when combing two independent regions. Using a custom set of six primer pairs spanning about 1200bp (80%) of the 16S rRNA gene we were able to achieve ~100 fold improvement in resolution compared to a single region, over a mock mixture of common human gut bacterial isolates. Finally, profiling of a Drosophila melanogaster microbiome using the set of six primer pairs provided a ~100 fold increase in resolution, and thus enabling efficient downstream analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsSMURF enables identification of near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences in microbial communities, having resolution superior compared to current techniques. It may be applied to standard sample preparation protocols with very little modifications. SMURF also paves the way to high-resolution profiling of low-biomass and fragmented DNA, e.g., in the case of Formalin-fixed and Paraffin-embedded samples, fossil-derived DNA or DNA exposed to other degrading conditions. The approach is not restricted to combining amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene and may be applied to any set of amplicons, e.g., in Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST).",

    "abstract": "Female sex and pregnancy are associated with reduced risk of melanoma and improved stage specific survival; however, the mechanism underlying this apparent clinical benefit is unknown. We previously discovered that pregnancy-associated 17{beta}-estradiol drives melanocyte differentiation by activating the nonclassical G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). Here, we show that pregnancy inhibits melanoma, and that transient GPER activation induces long-term changes in melanocytes, which are associated with increased cellular differentiation and resistance to melanoma. A selective GPER agonist induced c-Myc protein degradation, slowed tumor growth, and inhibited expression of immune suppressive proteins including PD-L1, suggesting that GPER signaling may render melanoma cells more vulnerable to immunotherapy. Systemically delivered GPER agonist was well tolerated, and cooperated synergistically with PD-1 blockade in melanoma-bearing mice to dramatically extend survival. These results thus define GPER as a target for differentiation-based melanoma therapy.\\n\\nSignificanceImmune checkpoint inhibitors including PD-1 induce durable remissions in only 30% of patients with advanced melanoma. This work demonstrates that PD-1 efficacy is significantly improved by systemic delivery of a selective agonist of the nonclassical estrogen receptor, GPER, which drives melanoma differentiation and renders tumors more vulnerable to the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Much attention has focussed on conversion of human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) to a more naive developmental status. Here we provide a method for resetting via transient histone deacetylase inhibition. The protocol is effective across multiple PSC lines and can proceed without karyotype change. Reset cells can be expanded without feeders with a doubling time of around 24 hours. WNT inhibition stabilises the resetting process. The transcriptome of reset cells diverges markedly from primed PSC and shares features with human inner cell mass (ICM). Reset cells activate expression of primate-specific transposable elements. DNA methylation is globally reduced to the level in the ICM but is non-random, with gain of methylation at specific loci. Methylation imprints are mostly lost, however. Reset cells can be re-primed to undergo tri-lineage differentiation and germline specification. In female reset cells, appearance of bi-allelic X-linked gene transcription indicates re-activation of the silenced X chromosome. On re-conversion to primed status, XIST-induced silencing restores monoallelic gene expression. The facile and robust conversion routine with accompanying data resources will enable widespread utilisation, interrogation, and refinement of candidate naive cells.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary benefits of simultaneous polyandry (female multiple mating within a single reproductive event) remain elusive. One potential benefit could arise if polyandry alters sibship structures and consequent relationships and relatedness among females descendants, and thereby intrinsically reduces future inbreeding risk (the  indirect inbreeding avoidance hypothesis). However such effects have not been quantified in naturally complex reproductive systems that also encompass iteroparity, overlapping generations, sequential polyandry, and polygyny. We used long-term social and genetic pedigree data from song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify cross-generational consequences of simultaneous polyandry for offspring sibship structures and distributions of relationships and relatedness among possible mates. Simultaneous polyandry decreased full-sibships and increased half-sibships on average, but such effects varied among females and were smaller than would occur in the absence of sequential polyandry or polygyny. Further, while simultaneous polyandry decreased the overall frequencies of possible matings among adult full-sibs, it increased the frequencies of possible matings among adult half-sibs and more distant relatives. These results imply that the intrinsic consequences of simultaneous polyandry for inbreeding risk could cause weak indirect selection on polyandry, but the magnitude and direction of such effects will depend on complex interactions with other mating system components and the form of inbreeding depression.",

    "abstract": "Neuroticism is a personality trait that describes the tendency to experience negative emotions. Individual differences in neuroticism are moderately stable across much of the life course1; the trait is heritable2-5, and higher levels are associated with psychiatric disorders6-8, and have been estimated to have an economic burden to society greater than that of substance abuse, mood, or anxiety disorders9. Understanding the genetic architecture of neuroticism therefore has the potential to offer insight into the causes of psychiatric disorders, general wellbeing10, and longevity. The broad trait of neuroticism is composed of narrower traits, or factors. It was recently discovered that, whereas higher scores on the broad trait of neuroticism are associated with earlier death, higher scores on a  worry/vulnerability factor are associated with living longer11. Here, we examine the genetic architectures of two neuroticism factors--worry/vulnerability and anxiety/tension--and how they contrast with the architecture of the general factor of neuroticism. We show that, whereas the polygenic load for general factor of neuroticism is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), major depressive disorder, and poorer self-rated health, the genetic variants associated with high levels of the anxiety/tension and worry/vulnerability factors are associated with affluence, higher cognitive ability, better self-rated health, and longer life. We also identify the first genes associated with factors of neuroticism that are linked with these positive outcomes that show no relationship with the general factor of neuroticism.",

    "abstract": "Accelerating international trade and climate change make pathogen spread an increasing concern. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, the causal agent of ash dieback is one such pathogen, moving across continents and hosts from Asian to European ash. Most European common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) trees are highly susceptible to H. fraxineus although a small minority (~5%) evidently have partial resistance to dieback. We have assembled and annotated a draft of the H. fraxineus genome which approaches chromosome scale. Pathogen genetic diversity across Europe, and in Japan, reveals a tight bottleneck into Europe, though a signal of adaptive diversity remains in key host interaction genes (effectors). We find that the European population was founded by two divergent haploid individuals. Divergence between these haplotypes represents the 'shadow' of a large source population and subsequent introduction would greatly increase adaptive potential and the pathogen's threat. Thus, EU wide biological security measures remain an important part of the strategy to manage this disease.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between neural and vascular signals is essential for interpretation of functional MRI (fMRI) results with respect to underlying neuronal activity. Simultaneously measuring neural activity using electrophysiology with fMRI has been highly valuable in elucidating the neural basis of the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal. However, this approach is also technically challenging due to the electromagnetic interference that is observed in electrophysiological recordings during MRI scanning. Recording optical correlates of neural activity, such as calcium signals, avoids this issue, and has opened a new avenue to simultaneously acquire neural and BOLD signals. The present study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously and repeatedly acquiring calcium and BOLD signals in animals using a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6. This approach was validated with a visual stimulation experiment, during which robust increases of both calcium and BOLD signals in the superior colliculus were observed. In addition, repeated measurement in the same animal demonstrated reproducible calcium and BOLD responses to the same stimuli. Taken together, simultaneous GCaMP6-based fiber photometry and fMRI recording presents a novel, artifact-free approach to simultaneously measuring neural and fMRI signals. Furthermore, given the cell-type specificity of GCaMP6, this approach has the potential to mechanistically dissect the contributions of individual neuron populations with respect to BOLD signal, and ultimately reveal its underlying neural mechanisms.",

Here, we present an integrated analysis of the whole genome, transcriptome and methylation profiles of primary and recurrent anaplastic meningioma. A key finding was the delineation of two distinct molecular subgroups that were associated with diametrically opposed survival outcomes. Relative to lower grade meningiomas, anaplastic tumors harbored frequent driver mutations in SWI/SNF complex genes, which were confined to the poor prognosis subgroup. Our analyses discern two biologically distinct variants of anaplastic meningioma with potential prognostic and therapeutic significance.",
