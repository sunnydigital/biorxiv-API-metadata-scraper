    "abstract": "QuestionsTo assess the feasibility of using visually-estimated cover in rapid assessment of herbivore food species abundance in the grass layer, we asked the following questions: 1) What is the relationship between total graminoid cover and biomass in forests, and does height improve the prediction of biomass from cover? 2) How does total cover relate to biomass in a grassland habitat? 3) How does elephant food species graminoid cover relate to individual species biomass? 4) How well does species diversity of forest understorey grass layer, calculated from cover data, mirror that calculated from biomass data?\\n\\nLocationNagarahole National Park, India.\\n\\nMethodsWe estimated the abundance of graminoids through visual estimation of cover and weighted harvested biomass in forest and grassland plots. In forests, two estimates of total graminoid abundance, total graminoid cover and sum of species covers, were used. In the grassland, only total graminoid abundance was measured. We examined the relationship between cover estimates and biomass, and the additional utility of height in predicting biomass, using multiple regressions and AIC-based model selection. We also assessed similarity in cover- and biomass-based Simpsons and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices using regressions.\\n\\nResultsGraminoid cover explained a large portion of variation in total graminoid biomass in forest and grassland habitats. The sum of species covers was better than total cover in estimating total graminoid biomass in the forest. The benefit of including height to estimate total biomass was moderate in forests but substantial in grassland. Cover estimates were good proxies of food species biomass, and the addition of height did not yield better models for most species. Species diversity indices calculated from cover largely matched those based on biomass.\\n\\nConclusionsVisual estimation of species cover is a good alternative to biomass harvesting for rapid assessment of abundance of graminoids consumed by generalist herbivores, like elephants.",

    "abstract": "Examining how the landscape may influence gene flow is at the forefront of understanding population differentiation and adaptation. Such understanding is crucial in light of ongoing environmental changes and the elevated risk of ecosystems alteration. In particular, knowledge of how humans may influence the structure of populations is imperative to allow for informed decisions in management and conservation as well as to gain a better understanding of anthropogenic impacts on the interplay between gene flow, genetic drift and selection. Here we use genome-wide molecular markers to characterize the population genetic structure and connectivity of Ipomoea purpurea, a noxious invasive weed. We likewise assess the interaction between natural and human-driven influences on genetic differentiation among populations. Our analyses find that human population density is an important predictor of pairwise population differentiation, suggesting that the agricultural and/or horticultural trade may be involved in maintaining some level of connectivity across distant agricultural fields. Climatic variation appears as an additional predictor of genetic connectivity in this species. We discuss the implications of these results and highlight future research needed to disentangle the mechanistic processes underlying population connectivity of weeds.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual experience results from a complex interplay of bottom-up input and prior knowledge about the world, yet the extent to which knowledge affects perception, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects, and the stages of processing at which these two sources of information converge, are still unclear. In several experiments we show that language, in the form of verbal cues, both aids recognition of ambiguous \\\"Mooney\\\" images and improves objective visual discrimination performance in a match/non-match task. We then used electroencephalography (EEG) to better understand the mechanisms of this effect. The improved discrimination of images previously labeled was accompanied by a larger occipital-parietal P1 evoked response to the meaningful versus meaningless target stimuli. Time-frequency analysis of the interval between the cue and the target stimulus revealed increases in the power of posterior alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillations when the meaning of the stimuli to be compared was trained. The magnitude of the pre-target alpha difference and the P1 amplitude difference were positively correlated across individuals. These results suggest that prior knowledge prepares the brain for upcoming perception via the modulation of alpha-band oscillations, and that this preparatory state influences early (~120 ms) stages of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Accurate annotations of genes and their transcripts is a foundation of genomics, but no annotation technique presently combines throughput and accuracy. As a result, reference gene collections remain incomplete: many gene models are fragmentary, while thousands more remain uncatalogued-particularly for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To accelerate lncRNA annotation, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS), combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. We present an experimental re-annotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA population in matched human and mouse tissues, resulting in novel transcript models for 3574 / 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubles the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enable us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter- and gene-structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus CLS removes a longstanding bottleneck of transcriptome annotation, generating manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

We used multi-site recording to look for evidence of local clustering and laminar consistency of linear and angular velocity encoding in multi-neuronal spiking activity (MUA) and in the high-frequency (300-900 Hz) component of the local field potential (HF-LFP), believed to reflect local spiking activity. Rats were trained to run many trials on a large circular platform, either to LED-cued goal locations or as a spatial sequence from memory. Tuning to specific self-motion states was observed consistently, and exhibited distinct cortical depth-invariant coding properties. These patterns of collective local and laminar activation during behavior were reactivated in compressed form during post-experience sleep, and temporally coupled to hippocampal sharp wave ripples. Thus, PC neuron motion encoding is consistent across cortical laminae, and this consistency is maintained during memory reactivation.\\n\\nHighlights O_LIParietal cortex MUA encodes specific movements coherently across laminae.\\nC_LIO_LIThis organizational scheme is maintained during subsequent memory reactivation\\nC_LIO_LIMUA and HF-LFP showed similar self-motion tuning and memory reactivation dynamics\\nC_LIO_LIThis establishes the utility of MUA and HF-LFP for human memory reactivation studies\\nC_LI",

In humans, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI BOLD measurements has emerged as an important approach for studying neural representations. An implicit, untested assumption underlying many PFC MVPA studies is that the base rate of decoding information from PFC BOLD activity patterns is similar to that of other brain regions. Here we estimate these base rates from a meta-analysis of published MVPA studies and show that the PFC has a significantly lower base rate for decoding than visual sensory cortex. Our results have implications for the design and interpretation of MVPA studies of prefrontal cortex, and raise important questions about its functional organization.",

To date, AAnPs have not been identified in the surface ocean that possess the potential for carbon fixation. Using the Tara Oceans metagenomic dataset, we have reconstructed draft genomes of four bacteria that possess the genomic potential for anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, and the oxidation of sulfite and thiosulfate. Forming a monophyletic clade within the Alphaproteobacteria and lacking cultured representatives, the organisms compose minor constituents of local microbial communities (0.1-1.0%), but are globally distributed, present in multiple samples from the North Pacific, Mediterranean Sea, the East Africa Coastal Province, and the South Atlantic. These organisms represent a shift in our understanding of microbially-mediated photoautotrophy in the global oceans and provide a previously undiscovered route of primary productivity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn examining the genomic content of organisms collected during the Tara Oceans expedition, we have identified a novel clade within the Alphaproteobacteria that has the potential for photoautotrophy. Based on genome observations, these organisms have the potential to couple inorganic sulfur compounds as electron donors to fix carbon into biomass. They are globally distributed, present in samples from the North Pacific, Mediterranean Sea, East Africa Coastal Current, and the South Atlantic.

Many de novo assemblers using the de Bruijn graph of a set of the RNA sequences rely on in-memory representation of this graph. However, current methods analyse the complete set of read-derived k-mer sequence at once, resulting in the need for computer hardware with large shared memory.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel approach that clusters k-mers as the first step. The clusters correspond to small sets of gene products, which can be processed quickly to give candidate transcripts. We implement the clustering step using the MapReduce approach for parallelising the analysis of large datasets, which enables the use of compute clusters. The computational task is distributed across the compute system, and no specialised hardware is required. Using this approach, we have re-implemented the Inchworm module from the widely used Trinity pipeline, and tested the method in the context of the full Trinity pipeline. Validation tests on a range of real datasets show large reductions in the runtime and per-node memory requirements, when making use of a compute cluster.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study shows that MapReduce-based clustering has great potential for distributing challenging sequencing problems, without loss of accuracy. Although we have focussed on the Trinity package, we propose that such clustering is a useful initial step for other assembly pipelines.",

    "abstract": "The latent period is a crucial life history trait, particularly for polycyclic plant diseases, because it determines how many complete monocycles could theoretically occur during an epidemic. Many empirical studies have focused on the variation of the latent period with pathogen or host genotype, or changes in response to environmental factors. The focus on these aspects is unsurprising, as these factors classically form the three parts of the epidemiological triangle. Experiments in controlled conditions are generally used to assess pathogenicity and host susceptibility, and also provide the opportunity to measure the distribution of latent periods in epidemiological systems. Once estimated for one or several pairs of host-pathogen genotypes, the mean value of this important trait is usually considered to be fixed and is often used \\\"as is\\\" in epidemiological models. We show here that the latent period can display non-negligible variability over the course of a disease epidemic, and that this variability has multiple sources, some of which have complex, antagonistic impacts. We develop arguments for four sources of variation that challenge the implicit assumption that the latent period remains constant: daily fluctuations in leaf temperature, nature of inoculum, host stage or age of host tissues, intra-population competition and selection for aggressiveness traits. We focus on the wheat fungal disease Septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), making use of empirical datasets collected during the first authors own research projects and a targeted literature review. Such empirical epidemiological knowledge is new and potentially important for modelers. While some studies have demonstrated that the distribution of latent periods around the mean value has consequences for epidemiological dynamics, we show that it might also be important for epidemiological modelers to account for changes in this mean value during an annual epidemic. These results may be of critical importance for improving outbreak forecasting.",

We show that FGF-MAPK signaling maintains multipotency and promotes the pharyngeal muscle fate, whereas signal termination permits the deployment of a pan-cardiac program, shared by the first and second lineages, to define heart identity. In the second heart lineage, a Tbx1/10-Dach pathway actively suppresses the first heart lineage program, conditioning later cell diversity in the beating heart. Finally, cross-species comparisons between Ciona and the mouse evoke the deep evolutionary origins of cardiopharyngeal networks in chordates.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal coherence is thought to constitute a unique substrate for information transmission distinct from firing rate. However, since the spatial scale of extracellular oscillations typically exceeds that of firing rates, it is unclear whether coherence complements or compromises the rate code. We examined responses in the macaque primary visual cortex and found that fluctuations in gamma-band (~40Hz) neuronal coherence correlated more with firing rate than oscillations in the local-field-potential (LFP). Although the spatial extent of LFP rhythms was broader, that of neuronal coherence was indistinguishable from firing rates. To identify the mechanism, we developed a statistical technique to isolate the rhythmic component of the spiking process and found that above results are explained by an activation-dependent increase in neuronal sensitivity to gamma-rhythmic input. Such adaptive changes in sensitivity to rhythmic inputs might constitute a fundamental homeostatic mechanism that prevents globally coherent inputs from undermining spatial resolution of the neural code.",

    "abstract": "Frequency-specific oscillations and phase-coupling of neuronal populations have been proposed as an essential mechanism for the coordination of activity between brain areas during cognitive tasks. To provide an effective substrate for cognitive function, we reasoned that ongoing functional brain networks should also be able to reorganise and coordinate in a similar manner. To test this hypothesis, we use a novel method for identifying repeating patterns of network dynamics, and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states, with spatially distinct power and phase-coupling in specific frequency bands. Brain states were identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks; the latter include a posterior higher-order cognitive network in the alpha range (8-12Hz) and an anterior cognitive network in the delta/theta range (1-7Hz). Both higher-order cognitive networks exhibit especially high power and coherence, and contain brain areas corresponding to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks operate in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales.",

    "abstract": "Hfq is a bacterial RNA-binding protein that plays key roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Like other Sm proteins, Hfq assembles into toroidal discs that bind RNAs with varying affinities and degrees of sequence specificity. By simultaneously binding to a regulatory small RNA (sRNA) and an mRNA target, Hfq hexamers facilitate productive RNA[&#183;&#183;&#183;]RNA interactions; the generic nature of this chaperone-like functionality makes Hfq a hub in many sRNA-based regulatory networks. That Hfq is crucial in diverse cellular pathways--including stress response, quorum sensing and biofilm formation-- has motivated genetic and  RNAomic studies of its function and physiology (in vivo), as well as biochemical and structural analyses of Hfq[&#183;&#183;&#183;]RNA interactions (in vitro). Indeed, crystallographic and bio-physical studies first established Hfq as a member of the phylogenetically-conserved Sm superfamily. Crystallography and other biophysical methodologies enable the RNA-binding properties of Hfq to be elucidated in atomic detail, but such approaches have stringent sample requirements, viz.: reconstituting and characterizing an Hfq*RNA complex requires ample quantities of well-behaved (sufficient purity, homogeneity) specimens of Hfq and RNA (sRNA, mRNA fragments, short oligoribonucleotides, or even single nucleotides). The production of such materials is covered in this Chapter, with a particular focus on recombinant Hfq proteins for crystallization experiments.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nJournal formatMethods in Molecular Biology (Springer Protocols series); this volume is entitled \\\"Bacterial Regulatory RNA: Methods and Protocols\\\"; an author guide is linked at http://www.springer.com/series/7651",

    "abstract": "Cells that proliferate within a confined environment build up mechanical compressive stress. For example, mechanical pressure emerges in the naturally space-limited tumor environment. However, little is known about how cells sense and respond to mechanical compression. We developed microfluidic bioreactors to enable the investigation of the effects of compressive stress on the growth of the genetically tractable model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We used this system to determine that compressive stress is partly partly sensed through a module consisting of the mucin Msb2, and the cell wall protein Sho1, which act together as a sensor module in one of the two major osmosensing pathways in budding yeast. This signal is transmitted via the MAPKKK kinase Ste11. Thus, we term this mechanosensitive pathway the SMuSh pathway, for Ste11 through Mucin / Sho1 pathway. The SMuSh pathway delays cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and improves cell survival in response to growth-induced pressure. We also found that the Cell Wall Integrity (CWI) pathway contributes to the response to mechanical compressive stress. These latter results are confirmed in complimentary experiments in the accompanying manuscript from Mishra et al. When both the SMuSh and the CWI pathways are deleted, cells fail to adapt to compressive stress and all cells lyse at relatively low pressure when grown in confinement. Thus, we define a network that is essential for cell survival during growth under pressure. We term this new mechanosensory system the SCWISh (Survival through the CWI and SMuSh) network.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGrowth in confined environments leads to the build up of compressive mechanical stresses, which are relevant to diverse fields, from cancer to microbiology. In contrast to tensile stress, little is known about the molecular integration of compressive stresses. In this study, we elucidate the SMuSh pathway, which, together with the Cell Wall Integrity pathway, is essential for viability of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae when growing under mechanical pressure. Pressure-sensing requires the transmembrane mucin, Msb2, which is linked to the actin cortex. Our result raises the intriguing question of whether mucins, widely conserved in eukaryotes and frequently misregulated in cancers, might sense compressive stresses in other organisms, including humans.",

    "abstract": "Cytokinesis and other cell shape changes are driven by the actomyosin contractile cytoskeleton. The molecular rearrangements that bring about contractility in non-muscle cells are currently debated. Specifically, both filament sliding by myosin motors, as well as cytoskeletal crosslinking by myosins and non-motor crosslinkers, are thought to promote contractility. Here, we examined how the abundance of motor and non-motor crosslinkers controls the speed of cytokinetic furrowing. We built a minimal model to simulate the contractile dynamics of the C. elegans zygote cytokinetic ring. This model predicted that intermediate levels of non-motor crosslinkers would allow maximal contraction speed, which we found to be the case for the scaffold protein anillin, in vivo. Our model also demonstrated a non-linear relationship between the abundance of motor ensembles and contraction speed. In vivo, thorough depletion of non-muscle myosin II delayed furrow initiation, slowed F-actin alignment, and reduced maximum contraction speed, but partial depletion allowed faster-than-expected kinetics. Thus, both motor and non-motor crosslinkers promote cytokinetic ring closure when present at low levels, but act as a brake when present at higher levels. Together, our findings extend the growing appreciation for the roles of crosslinkers, but reveal that they not only drive but also brake cytoskeletal remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Early childhood growth patterns are associated with adult metabolic health, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We performed genome-wide meta-analyses and follow-up in up to 22,769 European children for six early growth phenotypes derived from longitudinal data: peak height and weight velocities, age and body mass index (BMI) at adiposity peak (AP ~9 months) and rebound (AR ~5-6 years). We identified four associated loci (P< 5x10-8): LEPR/LEPROT with BMI at AP, FTO and TFAP2B with Age at AR and GNPDA2 with BMI at AR. The observed AR-associated SNPs at FTO, TFAP2B and GNPDA2 represent known adult BMI-associated variants. The common BMI at AP associated variant at LEPR/LEPROT was not associated with adult BMI but was associated with LEPROT gene expression levels, especially in subcutaneous fat (P<2x10-51). We identify strong positive genetic correlations between early growth and later adiposity traits, and analysis of the full discovery stage results for Age at AR revealed enrichment for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling and apolipoprotein pathways. This genome-wide association study suggests mechanistic links between early childhood growth and adiposity in later childhood and adulthood, highlighting these early growth phenotypes as potential targets for the prevention of obesity.",

The U1 snRNP, which binds to 5 splice sites, plays an essential role in early steps of the splicing reaction. Here, we show that Arabidopsis LUC7 proteins, which are encoded by a three-member gene family in Arabidopsis, are important for plant development and stress resistance. We show that LUC7 are U1 snRNP accessory proteins by RNA immunoprecipitation experiments and LUC7 protein complex purifications. Transcriptome analyses revealed that LUC7 proteins are not only important for constitutive splicing, but also affects hundreds of alternative splicing events. Interestingly, LUC7 proteins specifically promote splicing of a subset of terminal introns. Splicing of LUC7-dependent introns is a prerequisite for nuclear export and some splicing events are modulated by stress in a LUC7-dependent manner. Taken together our results highlight the importance of the U1 snRNP component LUC7 in splicing regulation and suggest a previously unrecognized role of a U1 snRNP accessory factor in terminal intron splicing.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid incompatibilities are a common correlate of genomic divergence and a potentially important contributor to reproductive isolation. However, we do not yet have a detailed understanding of how hybrid incompatibility loci function and evolve within their native species, or why they are dysfunctional in hybrids. Here, we explore these issues for a well-studied, two-locus hybrid incompatibility between hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) and hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) in the closely related yellow monkeyflower species Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. By performing reciprocal backcrosses with introgression lines, we find evidence for gametic expression of the hms1-hms2 incompatibility. Surprisingly, however, hybrid transmission ratios at hms1 do not reflect this incompatibility, suggesting additional mechanisms counteract the effects of gametic sterility. Indeed, our backcross experiment shows hybrid transmission bias toward M. guttatus through both pollen and ovules, an effect that is particularly strong when hms2 is homozygous for M. nasutus alleles. In contrast, we find little evidence for hms1 transmission bias in crosses within M. guttatus, providing no indication of selfish evolution at this locus. Although we do not yet have sufficient genetic resolution to determine if hybrid sterility and transmission ratio distortion map to the same loci, our preliminary fine-mapping uncovers a genetically independent hybrid lethality system involving at least two loci linked to hms1. This fine-scale dissection of transmission ratio distortion at hms1 and hms2 provides insight into genomic differentiation between closely related Mimulus species and reveals multiple mechanisms of hybrid dysfunction.",

We performed three experiments in which we manipulated stimulus predictability within the attentional blink paradigm, while combining visual psychophysics with electrophysiological recordings. We found that valid stimulus expectations increase the likelihood of conscious access of stimuli. Furthermore, our findings suggest a clear dissociation in the interaction between expectations and consciousness: conscious awareness seems crucial for the implementation of top-down predictions, but not for the bottom-up generation of stimulus-evoked prediction errors. These results constrain and update influential theories about the role of consciousness in the predictive brain.",

    "abstract": "Key determinants in the emergence of complex cellular morphologies and functions are cues in the micro-environment. Primary among these is the presence of neighboring cells as networks form. Therefore, for high-resolution analysis, it is crucial to develop micro-environments that permit exquisite control of network formation. This is especially true in cell science, tissue engineering, and clinical biology. We introduce a new approach for assembling polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic environments that enhances cell network formation and analyses. We report that the combined processes of PDMS solvent-extraction (E-PDMS) and hydrothermal annealing create unique conditions that produce high-strength bonds between E-PDMS and glass - properties not associated with conventional PDMS. Extraction followed by hydrothermal annealing removes unbound oligomers, promotes polymer cross-linking, facilitates covalent bond formation with glass, and retains the highest biocompatibility. Our extraction protocol accelerates oligomer removal from 5 to 2 days. Resulting microfluidic platforms are uniquely suited for cell-network studies owing to high bond strengths, effectively corralling cellular extensions and eliminating harmful oligomers. We demonstrate simple, simultaneous actuation of multiple microfluidic domains for invoking ATP- and glutamate-induced Ca2+ signaling in glial-cell networks. These low-cost, simple E-PMDS modifications and flow manipulations further enable microfluidic technologies for cell-signaling and network studies as well as novel applications.",

    "abstract": "How living systems generate order from disorder is a fundamental question1-5. Metrics and ideas from physical systems have elucidated order-generating collective dynamics of mechanical, motile, and electrical living systems such as bird flocks and neuronal networks6-8. But suitable metrics and principles remain elusive for many networks of cells such as tissues that collectively generate spatial patterns via chemical signals, genetic circuits, and dynamics representable by cellular automata1,9-11. Here we reveal such principles through a statistical mechanics-type framework for cellular automata dynamics in which cells with ubiquitous genetic circuits generate spatial patterns by switching on and off each others genes with diffusing signalling molecules. Lattices of cells behave as particles stochastically rolling down a pseudo-energy landscape - defined by a spin glass-like Hamiltonian - that is shaped by \\\"macrostate\\\" functions and genetic circuits. Decreasing the pseudo-energy increases the spatial patterns orderliness. A new kinetic trapping mechanism - \\\"pathway trapping\\\" - yields metastable spatial patterns by preventing minimization of the particles pseudo-energy. Noise in cellular automata reduces the trapping, thus further increases the spatial order. We generalize our framework to lattices with multiple types of cells and signals. Our work shows that establishing statistical mechanics of computational algorithms can reveal collective dynamics of signal-processing in biological and physical networks.",

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic integration (TI), a powerful formalism for computing the Gibbs free energy, has been implemented for many biophysical processes characterized by one-dimensional order parameters with alchemical schemes that require delicate human efforts to choose/design biasing potentials for sampling the desired biophysical events and to remove their artifactitious consequences afterwards. Theoretically, an alchemical scheme is exact but practically, it causes error amplification. Small relative errors in the interaction parameters can be amplified many times in their propagation into the computed free energy [due to subtraction of similar numbers such as (105 {+/-} 5) - (100 {+/-} 5) = 5 {+/-} 7], which would render the results significantly less accurate than the input interaction parameters. In this paper, we present an unsophisticated implementation of TI in 3n dimensions (3nD) (n=1,2,3...) without alchemy or biasing potentials. In TI3nD, the errors in the interaction parameters will not be amplified and human efforts are not required to design biasing potentials that generate unphysical consequences. Using TI3nD, we computed the standard free energies of three protein complexes: trometamol in Salmonella effector SpvD (n=1), biotin in avidin (n=2), and Colicin E9 endonuclease with cognate immunity protein Im9 (n=3) and the hydration energies of ten biologically relevant compounds (n=1 for water, acetamide, urea, glycerol, trometamol, ammonium and n=2 for erythritol, 1,3-propanediol, xylitol, biotin). The computed results all agree with available experimental data. Each of the 13 computations is accomplishable within two (for a hydration problem) to ten (for the protein-recognition problem) days on an inexpensive workstation (two Xeon E5-2665 2.4GHz CPUs and one nVidia P5000 GPU).",

Within the context of the second D3R Grand Challenge several blinded binding free energies predictions were made for two congeneric series of FXR inhibitors with a semi-automated alchemical free energy calculations workflow featuring the FESetup and SOMD tools. Reasonable performance was observed in retrospective analyses of literature datasets. Nevertheless blinded predictions on the full D3R datasets were poor due to difficulties encountered with the ranking of compounds that vary in their net-charge. Performance increased for predictions that were restricted to subsets of compounds carrying the same net-charge. Disclosure of X-ray crystallography derived binding modes maintained or improved the correlation with experiment in a subsequent rounds of predictions.

Their topography depends on how mutational effects interact-epistasis-and is important for understanding evolutionary processes such as speciation, the rate of adaptation, the advantage of recombination, and predictability versus stochasticity of evolution. The growing amount of empirical data has made it possible to better test landscape models empirically. We argue that this endeavor will benefit from the development and use of meaningful null models against which to compare more complex models. Here we develop statistical and computational methods for fitting fitness data from mutation combinatorial networks to three simple models: additive, multiplicative and stickbreaking. We employ a Bayesian framework for doing model selection. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our methods work and we explore their statistical performance: bias, error, and the power to discriminate among models. We then illustrate our approach and its flexibility by analyzing several previously published datasets.

Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive. Overall, our results suggest that human microbiome composition is dominated by environmental factors rather than by host genetics.",

These are all populations that may not be adequately described by the usual Kingman coalescent. A roadblock to the application of such models has been the lack of effective tools for inferring an appropriate model, which stems from difficulties in evaluating the associated likelihoods. We overcome these difficulties by introducing estimators that are both computationally tractable and statistically efficient. We use these estimators to obtain point estimates and confidence intervals for the parameters of the coalescent models, and p-values for the hypothesis that the population is described by the Kingman coalescent. Our approach is based on the theory of unbiased estimating equations, which is more general than composite likelihood and may be applicable in other areas of statistical genetics. Our main focus is on inference from linked site-frequency spectra using parameterized families of{Lambda} -coalescents. We show that useful inferences may be made from non-singleton data alone if singletons are suspect due to sequencing or data-cleaning errors, although the data requirements are greatly increased.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbsent adaptive, individualized dose-finding in early-phase oncology trials, subsequent registration trials risk suboptimal dosing that compromises statistical power and lowers the probability of technical success (PTS) for the investigational drug. While much methodological progress has been made toward adaptive dose-finding, and quantitative modeling of dose-response relationships, most such work continues to be organized around a concept of  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). But a new methodology, Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), now holds forth the promise of individualized  MTDi dosing. Relative to such individualized dosing, current  one-size-fits-all dosing practices amount to a constraint that imposes costs on society. This paper estimates the magnitude of these costs.\\n\\nMethodsSimulated dose titration as in (Norris 2017) is extended to 1000 subjects, yielding an empirical MTDi distribution to which a gamma density is fitted. Individual-level efficacy, in terms of the probability of achieving remission, is assumed to be an Emax-type function of dose relative to MTDi, scaled (arbitrarily) to identify MTDi with the LD50 of the individuals tumor. (Thus, a criterion 50% of the population achieve remission under individualized dosing in this analysis.) Current practice is modeled such that all patients receive a first-cycle dose at  the MTD, and those for whom MTDi < MTDthe experience a  dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) that aborts subsequent cycles. Therapy thus terminated is assumed to confer no benefit. Individuals for whom MTDi[&ge;] MTDthe tolerate a full treatment course, and achieve remission with probability determined by the Emax curve evaluated at MTDthe/MTDi. A closed-form expression is obtained for the population remission rate, and maximized numerically over MTDthe as a free parameter, thus identifying the best result achievable under one-size-fits-all dosing. A sensitivity analysis is performed, using both a perturbation of the assumed Emax function, and an antipodal alternative specification.\\n\\nResultsSimulated MTDi follow a gamma distribution with shape parameter  {approx} 1.75. The population remission rate under one-size-fits-all dosing at the maximizing value of MTDthe proves to be a function of the shape parameter--and thus the coefficient of variation (CV)--of the gamma distribution of MTDi. Within a plausible range of CV(MTDi), one-size-fits-all dosing wastes approximately half of the drugs population-level efficacy. In the sensitivity analysis, sensitivity to the perturbation proves to be of second order. The alternative exposure-efficacy specification likewise leaves all results intact.\\n\\nConclusionsThe CV of MTDi determines the efficacy lost under one-size-fits-all dosing at  the MTD. Within plausible ranges for this CV, failure to individualize dosing can effectively halve a drugs value to society. In a competitive environment dominated by regulatory hurdles, this may reduce the value of shareholders investment in the drug to zero.\\n\\nEpilogueThe main result on one-size-fits-all dosing is generalized to regimens with several dose levels. Implications for the ongoing ALTA-1L trial are briefly explored; the 2 dose levels in the brigatinib arm of this trial may lend it a competitive advantage over the single-dose crizotinib arm.",

    "abstract": "Little is understood about the fibre type-dependent regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) isoforms by exercise training in humans. The main aim of this study was therefore to assess the impact of a period of repeated exercise sessions on NKA-isoform protein abundance in different skeletal muscle fibre types in men. Post-exercise cold-water immersion (CWI) has been reported to increase oxidative stress, which may be one mechanism underlying increases in NKA-isoform expression. Thus, a second aim was to evaluate the effect of CWI on training-induced modulation of NKA-isoform abundance. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from nineteen men at rest before (Pre) and after (Post) six weeks of intense interval cycling, with training sessions followed by passive rest (CON, n=7) or CWI (10{degrees}C; COLD, n=5). Training increased (p<0.05) the abundance of NKA1 and NKA{beta}3 in both type I and type II fibres, NKA{beta}1 in type II fibres, but was without effect on NKA2 and NKA3 (p>0.05). Furthermore, training decreased FXYD1 protein content in type I fibres, which abolished its fibre type-specific expression detected at Pre (p<0.05). CWI was without impact on the responses to training (p>0.05). These results highlight that NKA isoforms are regulated in a fibre type-dependent fashion in response to intense training in humans. This may partly explain the improvement in muscle Na+/K+ handling after a period of intense training. CWI may be performed without adversely or favourably affecting training-induced changes in NKA-isoform abundance.\\n\\nSummary in key pointsO_LIIt is unclear how Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) isoforms are regulated in different skeletal muscle fibre types by exercise training in humans, and the effect on phospholemman (FXYD1) protein abundance in different fibre types remains to be elucidated. We investigated the impact of six weeks of training on NKA-isoform protein abundance (1-3, {beta}1-3 and FXYD1) in type I and II muscle fibres in men.\\nC_LIO_LIWe show that intense interval training selectively increases the protein content of NKA 1 and {beta}3 in both fibre types, {beta}1 in type II fibres, and decreases FXYD1 in type I fibres.\\nC_LIO_LIThese results suggest the favourable impact of intense training on human muscle Na+/K+ regulation could be attributable, in part, to fibre type-dependent modulation of NKA-isoform abundance.\\nC_LIO_LIGiven that cold exposure has been shown to modulate cellular redox state, which has been linked to increased NKA expression, we also investigated the effect of exercise training plus cold-water immersion (CWI) on the fibre type-specific responses of NKA isoforms and FXYD1.

Here we demonstrate our replication framework, MetaNeighbor, that allows researchers to quantify the degree to which cell types replicate across datasets, and to rapidly identify clusters with high similarity for further testing. We first measure the replicability of neuronal identity by comparing more than 13 thousand individual scRNA-seq transcriptomes, then assess cross-dataset evidence for novel pyramidal neuron and cortical interneuron subtypes identified by scRNA-seq. We find that 24/45 cortical interneuron subtypes and 10/48 pyramidal neuron subtypes have evidence of replication in at least one other study. Identifying these putative replicates allows us to re-analyze the data for differential expression and provide lists of robust candidate marker genes. Across tasks we find that large sets of variably expressed genes can identify replicable cell types and subtypes with high accuracy, indicating many of the transcriptional changes characterizing cell identity are pervasive and easily detected.",

We first analysed DNA using array CGH, which revealed a striking wave pattern suggesting primarily GC-rich cerebellar losses, even against matched frontal cortex DNA, with a similar pattern on a SNP array. The aCGH changes varied with the isolation protocol. Droplet digital PCR of two genes also showed protocol-dependent losses. Whole genome sequencing showed GC-dependent variation in coverage with spin column isolation from cerebellum. We also extracted and sequenced DNA from substantia nigra using salting-out and phenol / chloroform. The mtDNA copy number, assessed by reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome, was higher in substantia nigra when using phenol / chloroform. We thus provide evidence for significant method-dependent bias in DNA isolation from human brain, as reported in rat tissues. This may contribute to array \\\"waves\\\", and could affect copy number determination, particularly if mosaicism is being sought, and sequencing coverage.

The Kappa statistic was an error on my part since I had failed to see another page in Table S1. Please consider this pre-print closed.\\n\\nOriginal abstractThe use of RNA-seq from tumor-educated platelets (TEP) as a  liquid biopsy source [1] has been refuted recently (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/05/146134, not peer-reviewed). The TEP-study also mentioned that mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was  accurately distinguished using surrogate TEP mRNA profiles, which is contested here. It is shown that only 10 out of 24 (a smaller sample set, original study has 60) non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples here has any expression at all. Even there the number of reads (101 bp) are [1, 4, 1, 14, 9, 1, 2, 19, 21, 6], and do not even add up to one complete EGFR gene (about 6000 bp). EGFR mutations have been painstakingly collated in www.mycancergenome.org/content/disease/lung-cancer/egfr. In stark contrast, the TEP study has no specification of the EGFR mutant used. The TEP study found EGFR mutations in 17/21 (81%), and EGFR wild-type in 4/39 (10%) for NSCLC samples (Table S7, reflected in Fig 3, Panel E in percentages). A major flaw is the assumption that a non \\\"EGFR wild-type\\\" is a \\\"EGFR mutant\\\" since cases zero with EGFR reads (which are almost half of the samples) could be either. The application of the Kappa statistic to this data is erroneous for two reasons. First, the Kappa statistic does not handle \\\"unknowns\\\", as is the case for samples with zero expression. Secondly,  interobserver variation can be measured in any situation in which two or more independent observers are evaluating the same thing [2]. The 90% (Fig 3, Panel E) is just the percentage of samples (35/39) that are not \\\"EGFT WT\\\" in one observation. It is not qualified to be in the Kappa matrix, where it translates to 35, leading to a Kappa=0.707, which implies \\\"substantial agreement\\\" [2]. The other observation (looking for EGFR mutation) is in a different set. To summarize, this work reiterates negligible expression of EGFR reads in NSCLC samples, and finds serious shortcomings in the statistical analysis of subsequent mutational analysis from these reads in the TEP-study.",

    "abstract": "Our conscious experience of the world is normally unified. The brain coordinates different processes from the left and right hemispheres into one experience. However, the neural mechanisms underlying interhemispheric coordination remain poorly understood. A mechanistic approach to understanding interhemispheric coordination is \\\"communication through coherence\\\" (Fries, 2005; 2015). Using a recently developed time-resolved psychophysics (Fiebelkorn, Saalmann, & Kastner, 2013; Landau & Fries, 2012; Song, Meng, Chen, Zhou, & Luo, 2014), combined with fMRI decoding method, we investigated the interhemispheric coordination through coherence, by focusing on a quintessential case of hemispheric lateralized brain function: face processing in the left and right fusiform face area (FFA). We observed coherent oscillatory fMRI multi-voxel patterns in the left and right FFA when two stimuli presented successively cross visual fields, either initiating coordination from the left hemisphere or right hemisphere. When interhemispheric coordination started from the dominant right hemisphere, a coherent 44{degrees} phase difference between the left and right FFA in 3-4 Hz was observed; whereas when interhemispheric coordination started from the non-dominant left hemisphere, a coherent -17{degrees} phase difference between the left and right FFA in 5.5-6.5 Hz was observed. These results suggest that different phase coherence might mediate the interhemispheric coordination of face perception, depending on whether the initiating hemisphere is dominant or non-dominant. Our findings provide compelling fMRI evidence for interhemispheric coordination through coherence. The time-resolved fMRI decoding approach would be a useful starting point for a more promising approach for future investigation in interhemispheric dynamic coordination with fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of a session of sprint-interval exercise on the mRNA content of NKA isoforms (1-3, {beta}1-3) and FXYD1 in human skeletal muscle. To explore some of the cellular stressors involved in this regulation, we evaluated the association between these mRNA responses and those of the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and HIF-1. Given cold exposure perturbs muscle redox homeostasis, which may be one mechanism important for increases in NKA-isoform mRNA, we also explored the effect of post-exercise cold-water immersion (CWI) on the mRNA responses. Muscle was sampled from nineteen men before (Pre) and after (+0h, +3h) exercise plus passive rest (CON, n=10) or CWI (10{degrees}C; COLD, n=9). In COLD, exercise increased NKA2 and Sp1 mRNA (+0h, p<0.05). These genes remained unchanged in CON (p>0.05). In both conditions, exercise increased NKA1, NKA{beta}3 and HIF-1 mRNA (+3h; p <0.05), decreased NKA{beta}2 mRNA (+3h; p<0.05), whereas NKA3, NKA{beta}1, FXYD1 and Sp3 mRNA remained unchanged (p>0.05). These human findings highlight 1) sprint-interval exercise increases the mRNA content of NKA 1 and {beta}3, and decreases that of NKA {beta}2, which may relate, in part, to exercise-induced muscle hypoxia, and 2) post-exercise CWI augments NKA2 mRNA, which may be associated with promoted Sp1 activation.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation in natural populations represents the raw material for phenotypic diversity. Species-wide characterization of genetic variants is crucial to have a deeper insight into the genotype-phenotype relationship. With the advent of new sequencing strategies and more recently the release of long-read sequencing platforms, it is now possible to explore the genetic diversity of any non-model organisms, representing a fundamental resource for biological research. In the frame of population genomic surveys, a first step is evidently to obtain the complete sequence and high quality assembly of a reference genome. Here, we completely sequenced and assembled a reference genome of the non-conventional Dekkera bruxellensis yeast. While this species is a major cause of wine spoilage, it paradoxically contributes to the specific flavor profile of some Belgium beers. In addition, an extreme karyotype variability is observed across natural isolates, highlighting that D. bruxellensis genome is very dynamic. The whole genome of the D. bruxellensis UMY321 isolate was sequenced using a combination of Nanopore long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing data. We generated the most complete and contiguous de novo assembly of D. bruxellensis to date and obtained a first glimpse into the genomic variability within this species by comparing the sequences of several isolates. This genome sequence is therefore of high value for population genomic surveys and represents a reference to study genome dynamic in this yeast species.",

    "abstract": "The formin Delphilin binds the glutamate receptor, GluR{delta}2, in dendritic spines of Purkinje cells. Both proteins play a role in learning. To understand how Delphilin functions in neurons, we studied the actin assembly properties of this formin. Formins have a conserved formin homology 2 domain, which nucleates and remains associated with the fast growing end of actin filaments, influencing filament growth with input from the adjacent formin homology 1 domain. The strength of nucleation and elongation varies widely across formins. Additionally, most formins have conserved domains that regulate actin assembly through an intramolecular interaction. Delphilin is distinct from other formins in several ways: its expression is limited to Purkinje cells; it lacks autoinhibitory domains; its formin homology 1 domains has minimal proline-rich sequence. We found that Delphilin is an actin nucleator that does not accelerate elongation, although it binds tightly to the barbed end of filaments. In addition, Delphilin exhibits a preference for actin isoforms, which has not been described or systematically studied in other formins. Finally, Delphilin is the first formin studied that is not regulated by intramolecular interactions. We speculate how the activity we observe is consistent with its localization in the small dendritic spines.\\n\\nAbbreviations: FH1, formin homology 1; FH2, formin homology 2; DID, diaphanous inhibitory domain; DAD, diaphanous autoinhibitory domain; LTD, long term depression; PSD, post synaptic density; PDZ, post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1).",

    "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of cancer is the formation of oncogenic fusion genes as a result of chromosomal translocations. Fusion genes are presumed to occur prior to fusion RNA expression. However, studies have reported the presence of fusion RNAs in individuals who were negative for chromosomal translocations. These observations give rise to \\\"the cart before the horse\\\" hypothesis, in which fusion RNA precedes the fusion gene and guides the genomic rearrangements that ultimately result in gene fusions. Yet RNA-mediated genomic rearrangement in mammalian cells has never been demonstrated. Here we provide evidence that expression of a chimeric RNA drives formation of a specified gene fusion via genomic rearrangement in mammalian cells. The process is (1) specified by the sequence of chimeric RNA involved, (2) facilitated by physiological hormone levels, (3) permissible regardless of intra-chromosomal (TMPRSS2-ERG) or inter-chromosomal (TMPRSS2-ETV1) fusion, and (4) can occur in normal cells prior to malignant transformation. We demonstrate that, contrary to \\\"the cart before the horse\\\" model, it is the antisense rather than sense chimeric RNAs that effectively drive gene fusion, and that this disparity can be explained by transcriptional conflict. Furthermore, we identified an endogenous RNA AZI1 that acts as the  initiator RNA to induce TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. RNA-driven gene fusion demonstrated in this report provides important insight in early disease mechanism, and could have fundamental implications in the biology of mammalian genome stability, as well as gene editing technology via mechanisms native to mammalian cells.",

Compared to full-length MRs, some vertebrate MRs required higher steroid concentrations to activate GAL4-DBD-MR-hinge/LBD constructs. For example, 11-deoxycortisol activated all full-length vertebrate MRs, but did not activate truncated terrestrial vertebrate MRs and was an agonist for truncated zebrafish MR. Progesterone, 19-norProgesterone and spironolactone did not activate full-length and truncated human, alligator and frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs; at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, while retaining activity for truncated zebrafish MRs, evidence that regulation of progestin activation of chicken MR resides in NTD/DBD and of zebrafish MR in hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser810 in human MR, required for its antagonism by progesterone, suggesting novel regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs.
