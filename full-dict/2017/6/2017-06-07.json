    "abstract": "BackgroundSpatial scale is important when studying ecological processes. The Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a large sexually dimorphic tetraonid that is endemic to the sagebrush biome of western North America. The impacts of oil and gas development at individual leks has been well-documented. However, no previous studies have quantified the population-level response.\\n\\nMethodsHierarchical models were used to estimate the effects of the areal disturbance due to well pads as well as climatic variation on individual lek counts and Greater sage-grouse populations (management units) over 32 years. The lek counts were analyzed using General Linear Mixed Models while the management units were analyzed using Gompertz Population Dynamic Models. The models were fitted using frequentist and Bayesian methods. An information-theoretic approach was used to identify the most important spatial scale and time lags. The relative importance of oil and gas and climate at the local and population-level scales was assessed using information-theoretic (Akaikes weights) and estimation (effect size) statistics.\\n\\nResultsAt the local scale, oil and gas was an important negative predictor of the lek count. At the population scale, there was only weak support for oil and gas as a predictor of density changes but the estimated impacts on the long-term carrying capacity were consistent with summation of the local impacts. Regional climatic variation, as indexed by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, was an important positive predictor of density changes at both the local and population-level (particularly in the most recent part of the time series).\\n\\nConclusionsAdditional studies to reduce the uncertainty in the range of possible effects of oil and gas at the population scale are required. Wildlife agencies need to account for the effects of regional climatic variation when managing sage-grouse populations.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation is often studied via 1) multiple common garden experiments comparing performance of genotypes in different environments and 2) sequencing genotypes from multiple locations and characterizing geographic patterns in allele frequency. Both approaches aim to characterize the same pattern (local adaptation), yet the complementary information from each has not yet been coherently integrated. Here, we develop a genome-wide association model of genotype interactions with continuous environmental gradients (GxE), i.e. reaction norms. We present an approach to impute relative fitness, allowing us to coherently synthesize evidence from common garden and genome-environment associations. Our approach identifies loci exhibiting environmental clines where alleles are associated with higher fitness in home environments. Simulations show our approach can increase power to detect loci causing local adaptation. In a case study on Arabidopsis thaliana, most identified SNPs exhibited home allele advantage and fitness tradeoffs along climate gradients, suggesting selective gradients can maintain allelic clines. SNPs exhibiting GxE associations with fitness were enriched in genic regions, putative partial selective sweeps, and associations with an adaptive phenotype (flowering time plasticity). We discuss extensions for situations where only adaptive phenotypes other than fitness are available. Many types of data may point toward the loci underlying GxE and local adaptation; coherent models of diverse data provide a principled basis for synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is one of the defining parameters of an ecological niche. Most organisms thrive within a temperature range that rarely exceeds [~] 30{degrees}C, but the deep subsurface bacterium Kosmotoga olearia can grow over a temperature range of 59{degrees}C (20{degrees}C -79{degrees}C). To identify genes correlated with this flexible phenotype, we compared transcriptomes of K. olearia cultures grown at its optimal 65{degrees}C to those at 30{degrees}C, 40{degrees}C, and 77{degrees}C. The temperature treatments affected expression of 573 of 2,224 K. olearia genes. Notably, this transcriptional response elicits re-modeling of the cellular membrane and changes in metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism at high temperatures and up-regulation of amino acid metabolism at lower temperatures. At sub-optimal temperatures, many transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in mesophilic bacteria at physiologically low temperatures, including up-regulation of typical cold stress genes and ribosomal proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of additional Thermotogae genomes, indicate that one of K. olearia's strategies for low temperature growth is increased copy number of some typical cold response genes through duplication and/or lateral acquisition. At 77{degrees}C one third of the up-regulated genes are of hypothetical function, indicating that many features of high temperature growth are unknown.",

    "abstract": "The interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density, i.e. the selection coefficient per base pair, is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared to what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Persistence and extinction are key processes in infectious disease dynamics that, due to incomplete reporting, are seldom directly observable. For fully-immunizing diseases, reporting probabilities can be readily estimated from demographic records and case reports. Yet reporting probabilities are not sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct disease incidence from case reports. Here, we focus on disease presence (i.e., marginal probability of non-zero incidence), which provides an upper bound on the marginal probability of disease extinction. We examine measles and pertussis in pre-vaccine era U.S. cities, and describe a conserved scaling relationship between population size, reporting probability, and observed presence (i.e., non-zero case reports). We use this relationship to estimate disease presence given perfect reporting, and define cryptic presence as the difference between estimated and observed presence. We estimate that, in early 20th century U.S. cities, pertussis presence was higher than measles presence across a range of population sizes, and that cryptic presence was common in small cities with imperfect reporting. While the methods employed here are specific to fully-immunizing diseases, our results suggest that cryptic incidence deserves careful attention, particularly in diseases with low case counts, poor reporting, and longer infectious periods.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies have transformed our understanding of the genetic and environmental determinants of health outcomes. However, the representativeness of these samples may be limited - either through selection into studies, or by attrition from studies over time. Here we explore the potential impact of this selection bias on results obtained from these studies, from the perspective that this amounts to conditioning on a collider (i.e., a form of collider bias). While it is acknowledged that selection bias will have a strong effect on representativeness and prevalence estimates, it is often assumed that it should not have a strong impact on estimates of associations. We argue that because selection can induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that third variable is conditioned upon), selection can lead to substantially biased estimates of associations. In particular, selection related to phenotypes can bias associations with genetic variants associated with those phenotypes. In simulations, we show that even modest influences on selection into, or attrition from, a study can generate biased and potentially misleading estimates of both phenotypic and genotypic associations. Our results highlight the value of knowing which population your study sample is representative of. If the factors influencing selection and attrition are known, they can be adjusted for. For example, having DNA available on most participants in a birth cohort study offers the possibility of investigating the extent to which polygenic scores predict subsequent participation, which in turn would enable sensitivity analyses of the extent to which bias might distort estimates.\\n\\nKey MessagesSelection bias (including selective attrition) may limit the representativeness of large-scale cross-sectional and cohort studies.\\n\\nThis selection bias may induce collider bias (which occurs when two variables independently influence a third variable, and that variable is conditioned upon).\\n\\nThis may lead to substantially biased estimates of associations, including of genetic associations, even when selection / attrition is relatively modest.",

    "abstract": "Geographic isolation that drives speciation is often assumed to slowly increase over time, for instance through the formation of rivers, the formation of mountains or the movement of tectonic plates. Cyclic changes in connectivity between areas may occur with the advancement and retraction of glaciers, with water level fluctuations in seas between islands or in lakes that have an uneven bathymetry. These habitat dynamics may act as a driver of allopatric speciation and propel local diversity. Here we present a parsimonious model of the interaction between cyclical (but not necessarily periodic) changes in the environment and speciation, and provide an ABC-SMC method to infer the rates of allopatric and sympatric speciation from a phylogenetic tree. We apply our approach to the posterior sample of an updated phylogeny of the Lamprologini, a tribe of cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika where such cyclic changes in water level have occurred. We find that water level changes play a crucial role in driving diversity in Lake Tanganyika. We note that if we apply our analysis to the Most Credible Consensus (MCC) tree, we do not find evidence for water level changes influencing diversity in the Lamprologini, suggesting that the MCC tree is a misleading representation of the true species tree. Furthermore, we note that the signature of habitat dynamics is found in the posterior sample despite the fact that this sample was constructed using a species tree prior that ignores habitat dynamics. However, in other cases this species tree prior might erase this signature. Hence we argue that in order to improve inference of the effect of habitat dynamics on biodiversity, phylogenetic reconstruction methods should include tree priors that explicitly take into account such dynamics.",

    "abstract": "T cell signaling initiates upon binding of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell (APC) to the T cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell. TCR phosphorylation in response to pMHC binding is accompanied by segregation of the transmembrane phosphatase CD45 away from TCR-pMHC complexes. The kinetic segregation hypothesis proposes that CD45 exclusion shifts the local kinase-phosphatase balance to favor TCR phosphorylation. Spatial partitioning may arise from the size difference between the large CD45 extracellular domain and the smaller TCR-pMHC complex, although parsing potential contributions of extracellular protein size, actin activity, and lipid domains is difficult in living cells. Here, we reconstitute segregation of CD45 from bound receptor-ligand pairs using purified proteins on model membranes. Using a model receptor-ligand pair (FRB-FKBP), we first test physical and computational predictions for protein organization at membrane interfaces. We then show that the TCR-pMHC interaction causes partial exclusion of CD45. Comparing two developmentally-regulated isoforms of CD45, the larger RABC variant is excluded more rapidly and efficiently (~50%) than the smaller R0 isoform (~20%), suggesting that CD45 isotypes could regulate signaling thresholds in different T cell subtypes. Similar to the sensitivity of T cell signaling, TCR-pMHC interactions with Kds of [&le;]15 M were needed to exclude CD45. We further show that the co-receptor PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1, immunotherapy targets that inhibit T cell signaling, also exclude CD45. These results demonstrate that the binding energies of physiological receptor-ligand pairs on the T cell are sufficient to create spatial organization at membrane-membrane interfaces.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) results in the formation of biochemically distinct plasma membrane domains that initiate signaling cascades. Here, using biochemical reconstitution and microscopy, we show that the binding energies of the TCRpMHC and PD-1-PD-L1 complexes are sufficient to create spatial organization at a model membrane-membrane interface. We show that spatial organization depends upon receptor-ligand binding affinity and the relative sizes of the extracellular domains. These biophysical parameters may be used to fine-tune signaling cascades in T cells.",

However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity, and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial.

We show that the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensional basis set for the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical planning.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of many animal and plant diseases relies on the behavior of arthropod vectors. In particular, the choice to feed on either infected or uninfected hosts can dramatically affect the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. I develop an epidemiological model to explore the impact of host choice behavior on the dynamics of these diseases and to examine selection acting on vector behavior, but also on pathogen manipulation of this behavior. This model identifies multiple evolutionary conflicts over the control of this behavior and generates testable predictions under different scenarios. In general, the vector should evolve the ability to avoid infected hosts. However, if the vector behavior is under the control of the pathogen, uninfected vectors should prefer infected hosts while infected vectors should seek uninfected hosts. But some mechanistic constraints on pathogen manipulation ability may alter these predictions. These theoretical results are discussed in the light of observed behavioral patterns obtained on a diverse range of vector-borne diseases. These patterns confirm that several pathogens have evolved conditional behavioral manipulation strategies of their vector species. Other pathogens, however, seem unable to evolve such complex conditional strategies. Contrasting the behavior of infected and uninfected vectors may thus help reveal mechanistic constraints acting on the evolution of the manipulation of vector behavior.",

In our current understanding, the perceptual similarity between learning and generalization samples is viewed as one major factor driving aversive generalization. Alternatively, the threat-prediction account proposes that perceptual similarity should lead to generalization to the extent it predicts harmful outcomes. We tested these views using a two-dimensional perceptual continuum of faces. During learning, one face is conditioned to predict a harmful event, whereas the most dissimilar face stays neutral; introducing an adversity gradient defined only along one dimension. Learning changed the way how humans sampled information during viewing of faces. These occurred specifically along the adversity gradient leading to an increased dissimilarity of eye-movement patterns along the threat-related dimension. This provides evidence for the threat-prediction account of generalization, which conceives perceptual factors to be relevant to the extent they predict harmful outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Imaging the dynamic behavior of neuromodulatory neurotransmitters in the extracelluar space arising from individual quantal releases would constitute a major advance in neurochemical imaging. Spatial and temporal resolution of these highly stochastic neuromodulatory events requires concurrent advances in the chemical development of optical nanosensors selective for neuromodulators in concert with advances in imaging methodologies to capture millisecond neurotransmitter release. Herein, we develop and implement a stochastic model to describe dopamine dynamics in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain dorsal striatum. Our model is developed from first principles and simulates release, diffusion, and reuptake of dopamine in a 3D simulation volume of striatal tissue. We find that in vivo imaging of neuromodulation requires simultaneous optimization of dopamine nanosensor reversibility and sensitivity: dopamine imaging in the striatum or nucleus accumbens requires nanosensors with an optimal dopamine dissociation constant (Kd) of 1 M, whereas Kd above 10 M are required for dopamine imaging in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, our model reveals that imaging frame rates of 20 Hz are optimal for imaging temporally-resolved dopamine release events based on the probabilistic nature of dopaminergic terminal activity in the striatum. Our work provides a modeling platform to probe how complex neuromodulatory processes can be studied with fluorescent nanosensors and enables direct evaluation of nanosensor chemistry and imaging hardware parameters. Our stochastic model is generic for evaluating fluorescent neurotransmission probes, and is broadly applicable to the design of other neurotransmitter fluorophores and their optimization for implementation in vivo.",

    "abstract": "An open question in human evolution is the importance of polygenic adaptation: adaptive changes in the mean of a multifactorial trait due to shifts in allele frequencies across many loci. In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability: they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method - which we call PolyGraph - has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been influenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.",

    "abstract": "RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its binding protein partner, which is known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not well characterized, especially on the structure point of view. Informative signals hiding and interdependencies between sequence and structure specificities are two challenging problems for both predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure motifs mining.\\n\\nIn this study, we propose a deep learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure, which are appropriate for subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden binding knowledge from the observations, the CNNs are applied to learn the abstract motif features. Considering the close relationship between sequences and predicted structures, we use the BLSTM to capture the long range dependencies between binding sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the learned weighted representations are fed into a classification layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative CLIP-seq datasets, and the results demonstrate that iDeepS can reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage is that iDeepS is able to automatically extract both binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our transparent understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS.",

A comprehensive prediction of potential active regulatory regions is necessary to functionally study the roles of the majority of genomic variants in evolution, domestication, and animal production. We developed a computational method to predict regulatory DNA sequences (promoters, enhancers and transcription factor binding sites) in production animals (cows and pigs) and extended its broad applicability to other mammals. The method utilizes human regulatory features identified from thousands of tissues, cell lines, and experimental assays to find homologous regions that are conserved in sequences and genome organization and are enriched for regulatory elements in the genome sequences of other mammalian species. Importantly, we developed a filtering strategy, including a machine learning classification method, to utilize a very small number of species-specific experimental datasets available to select for the likely active regulatory regions. The method finds the optimal combination of sensitivity and accuracy to unbiasedly predict regulatory regions in mammalian species. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of the predicted regulatory datasets in cattle for prioritizing variants associated with multiple production and climate change adaptation traits, and identifying potential genome editing targets.",

Hyperspectral reflectance data were collected in the visible to near IR region of the spectrum using a robotic tram system that operated along a 300m transects during the snow free growing period between June and August, 2005-09. Interannual patterns of land-surface phenology (NDVI) unexpectedly lacked marked differences under experimental conditions. Measurement of NDVI was, however, compromised for presence of surface water. Land-surface phenology and surface water was negatively correlated, which held when scaled to a 2km by 2km MODIS subset of the study area. This result suggested that published findings of  greening of the Arctic may relate to a  drying of the Arctic i.e. reduced surface water in vegetated high-latitude landscapes where surface water is close to ground level.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage lambda makes a decision between lysis and lysogeny based on the number of coinfecting phages, namely the multiplicity of infection (MoI): lysis at low MoIs; lysogeny at high MoIs. Here, by evaluating various rationally designed models on their ability a) to make the lytic decision at MoI of 1 and the lysogeny decision at MoI of 2, b) to exhibit bistability at both MoIs, and c) to perform accurately in the presence of noise, it is demonstrated that lambdas lysis/lysogeny decision is based on three features, namely a) mutual repression, b) cooperative positive autoregulation of CI, and c) cooperative binding of the activator protein, not basal expression, triggering positive autoregulatory loop of CI. Cro and CI are sufficient to acquire the first two features. CII is required to acquire the third feature. The quasi-minimal two-protein model for the switch is justified by showing its qualitative equivalence, except for Cro repression of pRM, to the lambdas gene regulatory network responsible for the decision. A three-protein simplified version of the lambdas switch is shown to possess all the three design features. Bistability at MoI of 1 is responsible for lysogen stability, whereas bistability at MoI of 2 imparts stability to lytic development post-infection and especially during prophage induction.",

    "abstract": "Protein homeostasis, namely the ensemble of cellular mechanisms collectively controlling the activity, stability and conformational states of proteins, depends on energy-consuming processes. De novo protein synthesis requires ATP hydrolysis for peptide bond formation. Controlled degradation by the chaperone-gated proteases requires ATP hydrolysis to unfold target proteins and render their peptide bonds accessible to hydrolysis. During and following translation, different classes of molecular chaperones require ATP hydrolysis to control the conformational state of proteins, favor their folding into their active conformation and avoid, under stress, their conversion into potentially harmful aggregates. Furthermore, specific ATP-fueled unfolding chaperones can dynamically revert aggregation itself. We used here various biochemical assays and physical modeling to show that both bacterial chaperones GroEL (HSP60) and DnaK (HSP70) can use the energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis to maintain proteins in their active state even under conditions that do not favor, thermodynamically, the native state. The energy from ATP hydrolysis is thus injected by the chaperones in the system and converted into an enhanced, non-equilibrium steady-state stabilization of the native state of their substrates. Upon ATP consumption, the chaperone substrates spontaneously revert to their equilibrium non-native state.",

We show that upon low-frequency stimulation, a population of fully-releasable vesicles is silenced, leading to full blockage of synaptic transmission. A second population of vesicles, reluctant to release by simple stimuli, is recruited in a millisecond time scale by high-frequency stimulation to support an ultrafast recovery of neurotransmitter release after low-frequency depression.

We transfected the FGF21 into alpaca melanocytes, then detected the melanin contents, protein and mRNA levels of pigmentation-related genes in order to determine the melanogenesis-regulating pathway of FGF21. The results showed that FGF21 overexpression suppressed melanogenesis and decreased the expression of the major target genes termed microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its downstream genes, including tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2). However FGF21 increased the expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-Erk1/2). In contrast, FGF21-siRNA, a small interference RNA mediating FGF21 silencing, abolished the inhibition of melanogenesis. Altogether, FGF21 may decrease melanogenesis in alpaca melanocytes via ERK activation and subsequent MITF downregulation, which is then followed by the suppression of melanogenic enzymes and melanin production.",

To establish the mechanism for this regulation, we employed a transomic strategy to identify mRNAs that not only bind Puf3p, but also are regulated by Puf3p in vivo. The CoQ biosynthesis enzyme Coq5p is a critical Put3p target: Puf3p regulates the level of Coq5p and prevents its toxicity, thereby enabling efficient CoQ production.

    "abstract": "Variability in drug efficacy and adverse effects are observed in clinical practice. While the extent of genetic variability in classical pharmacokinetic genes is rather well understood, the role of genetic variation in drug targets is typically less studied. Based on 60,706 human exomes from the ExAC dataset, we performed an in-depth computational analysis of the prevalence of functional-variants in in 806 drug-related genes, including 628 known drug targets. We find that most genetic variants in these genes are very rare (f < 0.1%) and thus likely not observed in clinical trials. Overall, however, four in five patients are likely to carry a functional-variant in a target for commonly prescribed drugs and many of these might alter drug efficacy. We further computed the likelihood of 1,236 FDA approved drugs to be affected by functional-variants in their targets and show that the patient-risk varies for many drugs with respect to geographic ancestry. A focused analysis of oncological drug targets indicates that the probability of a patient carrying germline variants in oncological drug targets is with 44% high enough to suggest that not only somatic alterations, but also germline variants carried over into the tumor genome should be included in therapeutic decision-making.",

Studies addressing this issue are growing rapidly, but they generally lack empirical data regarding species interactions and local abundances, or cover a narrow range of environmental conditions.\\nC_LIO_LIWe analysed species distribution models and local spatial patterns to isolate the relative importance of key abiotic (aridity) and biotic (facilitation and competition) drivers of plant community assembly in drylands worldwide. We examined the relative importance of these drivers along aridity gradients and used information derived from the niches of species to understand the role that species-specific adaptations to aridity play in modulating the importance of community assembly drivers.\\nC_LIO_LIFacilitation, together with aridity, was the major driver of plant community assembly in global drylands. Due to community specialization, the importance of facilitation as an assembly driver decreased with aridity, and became non significant at the border between arid and semiarid climates. Under the most arid conditions, competition affected species abundances in communities dominated by specialist species. Due to community specialization, the importance of aridity in shaping dryland plant communities peaked at moderate aridity levels.\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: We showed that competition is an important driver of community assembly even under harsh environments, and that the effect of facilitation collapses as driver of species relative abundances under high aridity because of the specialization of the species pool to extremely dry conditions. Our findings pave the way to develop more robust species distribution models aiming to predict the consequences of ongoing climate change on community assembly in drylands, the largest biome on Earth.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The placement of angiosperms and Gnetales in seed plant phylogeny remains one of the most enigmatic problems in plant evolution, with morphological analyses (which have usually included fossils) and molecular analyses pointing to very distinct topologies. Almost all morphology-based phylogenies group angiosperms with Gnetales and certain extinct seed plant lineages, while most molecular phylogenies link Gnetales with conifers. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic signal present in published seed plant morphological datasets. We use parsimony, Bayesian inference, and maximum likelihood approaches, combined with a number of experiments with the data, to address the morphological-molecular conflict. First, we ask whether the lack of association of Gnetales with conifers in morphological analyses is due to an absence of signal or to the presence of competing signals, and second, we compare the performance of parsimony and model based approaches with morphological datasets. Our results imply that the grouping of Gnetales and angiosperms is largely the result of long branch attraction, consistent across a range of methodological approaches. Thus, there is a signal for the grouping of Gnetales with conifers in morphological matrices, but it was swamped by convergence between angiosperms and Gnetales, both situated on long branches. However, this effect becomes weaker in more recent analyses, as a result of addition and critical reassessment of characters. Even when a clade including angiosperms and Gnetales is still weakly supported by parsimony, model-based approaches favor a clade of Gnetales and conifers, presumably because they are more resistant to long branch attraction. Inclusion of fossil taxa weakens rather than strengthens support for a relationship of angiosperms and Gnetales. Our analyses finally reconcile morphology with molecules in favoring a relationship of Gnetales to conifers, and show that morphology may therefore be useful in reconstructing other aspects of the phylogenetic history of the seed plants.",

Moreover, the target of longevity interventions is not mean life span but the entire survival curve. Here we formulate superposition principles that predict the survival curve resulting from a combination of two interventions based on the survival curves of the individual treatments, and quantify epistasis as the deviation from this prediction. We test the method on a published data set comprising survival curves for all combinations of 4 different longevity interventions in Caenorhabditis elegans.

The present study uses long-term, replicated continuous culture bioreactors and meta-omics to investigate the ecophysiology of the involved microbial populations at an unprecedented resolution. We reveal complex trophic networks, in which fermenters and sulfate reducers coexist with nitrate- and oxygen respirers, we indicate strategies and niches of the microbial populations, and describe a novel and widespread, yet uncultured fermentative organism. These insights are crucial to understand fermentation coupled to sulfate reduction and relevant to assess microbial dynamics and community-level responses in coastal ecosystems.\\n\\nFor the anaerobic remineralization of organic matter in marine sediments, sulfate reduction coupled to fermentation plays a key role. Here, we enriched sulfate-reducing/fermentative communities from intertidal sediments under defined conditions in continuous culture. We transiently exposed the cultures to oxygen or nitrate twice daily and investigated the community response. Chemical measurements, provisional genomes and transcriptomic profiles revealed trophic networks of microbial populations. Sulfate reducers coexisted with facultative nitrate reducers or aerobes enabling the community to adjust to nitrate or oxygen pulses. Exposure to oxygen and nitrate impacted the community structure, but did not suppress fermentation or sulfate reduction as community functions, highlighting their stability under dynamic conditions. The most abundant sulfate reducer in all cultures, related to Desulfotignum balticum, appeared to have coupled acetate oxidation to sulfate reduction. We described a novel representative of the widespread uncultured phylum Candidatus Fermentibacteria (formerly candidate division Hyd24-12). For this strictly anaerobic, obligate fermentative bacterium, we propose the name Ca. \\\"Sabulitectum silens\\\" and identify it as a partner of sulfate reducers in marine sediments. Overall, we provide insights into the metabolic network of fermentative and sulfate-reducing microbial populations, their niches, and adaptations to a dynamic environment.",

    "abstract": "In biotechnological work horses like Streptococcus thermophilus and Bacillus subtilis natural competence can be induced, which facilitates genetic manipulation of these microbes. However, in strains of the important dairy starter Lactococcus lactis natural competence has not been established to date. However, in silico analysis of complete genome sequences of 43 L. lactis strains revealed complete late-competence gene-sets in 2 L. lactis subspecies cremoris strains (KW2 and KW10) and 8 L. lactis subspecies lactis strains, including the model strain IL1403 and the plant-derived strain KF147. The remainder of the strains, including all dairy isolates, displayed genomic decay in one or more of the late competence genes. Nisin-controlled expression of the competence regulator comX in L. lactis subsp. lactis KF147 resulted in the induction of expression of the canonical competence regulon, and elicited a state of natural competence in this strain. By contrast, comX expression in L. lactis NZ9000, predicted to encode an incomplete competence gene-set, failed to induce natural competence. Moreover, mutagenesis of the comEA-EC operon in strain KF147, abolished the comX driven natural competence, underpinning the involvement of the competence machinery. Finally, introduction of nisin-inducible comX expression into nisRK-harboring derivatives of strains IL1403 and KW2 allowed the induction of natural competence also in these strains, expanding this phenotype to other L. lactis strains of both subspecies.\\n\\nSignificance statementSpecific bacterial species are able to enter a state of natural competence in which DNA is taken up from the environment, allowing the introduction of novel traits. Strains of the species Lactococcus lactis are very important starter cultures for the fermentation of milk in the cheese production process, where these bacteria contribute to the flavor and texture of the end-product. The activation of natural competence in this industrially relevant organism can accelerate research aiming to understand industrially relevant traits of these bacteria, and can facilitate engineering strategies to harness the natural biodiversity of the species in optimized starter strains.",

We have previously shown that nociceptor-derived BDNF is implicated in inflammatory pain. Microglial-derived BDNF has also been shown to be involved in neuropathic pain. However, the distinct contribution of primary afferent-derived BNDF to chronic pain processing remains undetermined. In this study, we used Advillin-CreERT2 mice to delete Bdnf from all adult peripheral sensory neurons. Conditional BDNF knockouts were healthy with no sensory neuron loss. Behavioural assays and in vivo electrophysiology indicated that spinal excitability was normal. Following formalin inflammation or neuropathy with a modified Chung model, we observed normal development of acute pain behaviour, but a deficit in second phase formalin-induced nocifensive responses and a reversal of neuropathy-induced mechanical hypersensitivity during the later chronic pain phase in conditional BDNF knockout mice. In contrast, we observed normal development of acute and chronic neuropathic pain in the Seltzer model, indicating differences in the contribution of BDNF to distinct models of neuropathy. We further used a model of hyperalgesic priming to examine the contribution of primary afferent-derived BDNF in the transition from acute to chronic pain, and found that primed BDNF knockout mice do not develop prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity. Our data suggest that BDNF derived from sensory neurons plays a critical role in mediating the transition from acute to chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Prediction during language comprehension has increasingly been suggested to play a substantive role in efficient language processing. Emerging models have postulated that predictive mechanisms are enhanced when neural networks fire synchronously, but to date, this relationship has been investigated primarily through oscillatory activity in narrow frequency bands. A recently-developed measure proposed to reflect broadband neural activity - and thereby synchronous neuronal firing - is 1/f neural noise extracted from EEG spectral power. Previous research (Voytek et al., 2015) has indicated that this measure of 1/f neural noise changes across the lifespan, and these neural changes predict age-related behavioral impairments in visual working memory. Using a cross-sectional sample of young and older adults, we examined age-related changes in 1/f neural noise and whether this measure would predict ERP correlates of successful lexical prediction during discourse comprehension. 1/f neural noise across two different language tasks revealed high within-subject correlations, indicating that this measure can provide a reliable index of individualized patterns of neural activation. In addition to age, 1/f noise was a significant predictor of N400 effects of successful lexical prediction, but noise did not mediate age-related declines in other ERP effects. We discuss broader implications of these findings for theories of predictive processing, as well as potential applications of 1/f noise across research populations.",

    "abstract": "The coordinated activity of muscles is produced in part by spinal rhythmogenic neural circuits, termed central pattern generators (CPGs). A classical CPG model, proposed conceptually by T.G. Brown in 1911, is a system of coupled oscillators that transform locomotor drive into coordinated and gait-specific patterns of muscle recruitment. A system of ordinary differential equations with a physiologically-inspired coupling locus of interactions captures the timing relationship for bilateral coordination of limbs in locomotion and is typically solved numerically. Consequently, it is intriguing to have a full analytical description of this plausible CPG architecture to illuminate the functionality within this structure. Here, we provided a closed-form analytical solution contrasted against the previous numerical method. The computational load of the analytical solution was decreased by an order of magnitude when compared to the numerical approach (relative errors, <0.01%). The analytical solution tested and supported the previous finding that the input to the model can be expressed in units of the desired limb locomotor speed. Furthermore, we performed parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of controlling asymmetric locomotion and documented two possible mechanisms associated with either an external drive or intrinsic CPG parameters. The results support the idea that many different combinations of network states, even within the same anatomical CPG structure, may generate the same behavioral outcomes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUsing a simple process of leaky integration, we developed an analytical solution to a robust model of spinal pattern generation. We analyzed the ability of this neural element to exert locomotor control of the signal associated with limb speeds, which represent high-level modality within the motor system. Furthermore, we tested the ability of this simple structure to embed steering control using the velocity signal in the models inputs or within the internal connectivity of its elements. Both mechanisms can produce the same behavioral outcome, pointing to the methodological challenges of modeling central pattern generators and demonstrating the possibility of spinal circuit adaptations to asymmetric short- or long-term conditions in health and disease.",

Whether and how it encodes such information is not understood. Here, we examined this issue in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that intensity-dependent repulsion to chemicals safeguarded flies from harmful, high-intensity vapor exposures. To understand how sensory input changed as the odor valence switched from innocuous to threatening, we recorded from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the fly antenna. Primarily, we observed two response non-linearities: recruitment of non-active ORNs at higher intensities, and abrupt transitions in neural excitability from regular spiking to high-firing oscillatory regime. Although non-linearities observed in any single ORN was not a good indicator, a simple linear combination of firing events from multiple neurons provided robust recognition of threating/repulsive olfactory stimuli. In sum, our results reveal how information necessary to avoid environmental threats may also be encoded in the insect antenna.",

We developed 3DClusterViSu, a method based on 3D Voronoi tessellations that allows local density estimation, segmentation & quantification of 3D SMLM data and visualization of protein clusters within a 3D tool. We show its robust performance on microtubules and histone proteins H2B and CENP-A with distinct spatial distributions. 3DClusterViSu will favor multi-scale and multi-resolution synergies to allow integrating molecular and cellular levels in the analysis of macromolecular complexes.",

    "abstract": "Defining the environmental context in which genes enhance susceptibility can provide insight into the pathogenesis of complex disorders, like schizophrenia. Here we show that the intrauterine and perinatal environment modulates the association of schizophrenia with genomic risk, as measured with polygenic risk scores (PRS) based primarily on GWAS significant variants. Genomic risk interacts with intrauterine and perinatal complications (Early Life Complications, ELCs) in each of three independent samples from USA, Italy and Germany (overall n= 1693, p= 6e-05). In each sample, the liability of schizophrenia explained by PRS is nominally more than five times greater in the presence of a history of ELCs compared with its absence. In each sample, patients with positive ELC histories have higher PRS than patients without ELCs, which is further confirmed in two additional patient samples from Germany and Japan (overall n=2038, p= 1e-04). The gene set based on the schizophrenia loci interacting with ELCs is highly expressed in multiple placental compartments and dynamically regulated in placenta from complicated in comparison with normal pregnancies. The same genes are differentially up-regulated in placentae from male compared with female offspring. The interaction between genomic risk and ELCs is mainly driven by GWAS significant loci enriched for genes highly expressed in the various placenta samples. Molecular pathway analyses based on the genes not driving this interaction reflect previous analyses about schizophrenia risk-genes, while genes highly and differentially expressed in placentae implicate an orthogonal biology involving cellular stress. These results suggest that the most significant genetic variants detected by current schizophrenia GWAS contribute to risk in part by converging on a developmental trajectory sensitive to events affecting placentation, which may underlie the male preponderance of schizophrenia and offer new insights into primary prevention.",

    "abstract": "Microbial diversity on earth is extraordinary, and soils alone harbor thousands of species per gram of soil. Understanding how this diversity is sorted and selected into habitat niches is a major focus of ecology and biotechnology, but remains only vaguely understood. A systems-biology approach was used to mine information from databases to show how it can be used to answer questions related to the core microbiome of habitat-microbe relationships. By making use of the burgeoning growth of information from databases, our tool \\\"COREMIC\\\" meets a great need in the search for understanding niche partitioning and habitat-function relationships. The work is unique, furthermore, because it provides a user-friendly statistically robust web-tool (http://coremic2.appspot.com), developed using Google App Engine, to help in the process of database mining to identify the \\\"core microbiome\\\" associated with a given habitat. A case study is presented using data from 31 switchgrass rhizosphere community habitats across a diverse set of soil and sampling environments. The methodology utilizes an outgroup of 28 non-switchgrass (other grasses and forbs) to identify a core switchgrass microbiome. Even across a diverse set of soils (5 environments), and conservative statistical criteria (presence in more than 90% samples and FDR q-val < 0.05% for Fishers exact test) a core set of bacteria associated with switchgrass was observed. These included, among others, closely related taxa from Lysobacter spp., Mesorhizobium spp, and Chitinophagaceae. These bacteria have been shown to have functions related to the production of bacterial and fungal antibiotics and plant growth promotion. COREMIC can be used as a hypothesis generating or confirmatory tool that shows great potential for identifying taxa that may be important to the functioning of a habitat (e.g. host plant). The case study, in conclusion, shows that COREMIC can identify key habitat-specific microbes across diverse samples, using currently available databases and a unique freely available software.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a direct measure of neuronal current flow; its anatomical resolution is therefore not constrained by physiology but rather by data quality and the models used to explain these data. Recent simulation work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between signals arising in the deep and superficial cortical laminae given accurate knowledge of these surfaces with respect to the MEG sensors. This previous work has focused around a single inversion scheme (multiple sparse priors) and a single global parametric fit metric (free energy). In this paper we use several different source inversion algorithms and both local and global, as well as parametric and non-parametric fit metrics in order to demonstrate the robustness of the discrimination between layers. We find that only algorithms with some sparsity constraint can successfully be used to make laminar discrimination. Importantly, local t-statistics, global cross-validation and free energy all provide robust and mutually corroborating metrics of fit. We show that discrimination accuracy is affected by patch size estimates, cortical surface features, and lead field strength, which suggests several possible future improvements to this technique. This study demonstrates the possibility of determining the laminar origin of MEG sensor activity, and thus directly testing theories of human cognition that involve laminar- and frequency- specific mechanisms. This possibility can now be achieved using recent developments in high precision MEG, most notably the use of subject-specific head-casts, which allow for significant increases in data quality and therefore anatomically precise MEG recordings.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) is a regression based method to study task modulated brain connectivity. Despite its popularity in functional MRI (fMRI) studies, its reliability and reproducibility have not been evaluated. We investigated reproducibility and reliability of PPI effects during a simple visual task, and examined the effect of deconvolution on the PPI results. A large open-access dataset was analyzed (n = 138), where a visual task was scanned twice with repetition times (TRs) of 645 ms and 1400 ms, respectively. We first replicated our previous results by using the left and right middle occipital gyrus as seeds. Then ROI-wise (regions of interest) analysis was performed among twenty visual-related thalamic and cortical regions, and negative PPI effects were found between many ROIs with the posterior fusiform gyrus as a hub region. Both the seed-based and ROI-wise results were similar between the two runs and between the two PPI methods with and without deconvolution. The non-deconvolution method and the short TR run in general had larger effect sizes and greater extents. However, the deconvolution method performed worse in the 645 ms TR run than the 1400 ms TR run in the voxel-wise analysis. Given the general similar results between the two methods and the uncertainty of deconvolution, we suggest that deconvolution may be not necessary for PPI analysis on block-designed data. Lastly, intraclass correlations between the two runs were much lower for the PPI effects than the activation main effects, which raise cautions on performing inter-subject correlations and group comparisons on PPI effects.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain in CRPS has been linked to tactile misperceptions and deficits in somatotopic representation of the affected limb. Here, we identify altered cognitive processing of tactile stimuli in CRPS patients that we propose marks heterogeneity in tactile decision-making mechanisms. In a case-control design, we compared middle and late-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to pseudo-randomised mechanical stimulation of the digits of both hands (including CRPS-affected and non-affected sides) between 13 CRPS patients and 13 matched healthy controls. During a task to discriminate the digit simulated, patients (compared to controls) had significantly lower accuracy and slowed response times but with high between-subject variability. At middle latencies (124-132 ms), tactile processing in patients relative to controls showed decrements in superior parietal lobe and precuneus (that were independent of task demands) but enhanced activity in superior frontal lobe (that were task-dependent). At late latencies, patients showed an augmented P300-like response under task demands that localised to supplementary motor area (SMA). Source activity in SMA correlated with slowed response times, while its scalp representation intriguingly correlated with better functioning of the affected limb, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Future research should investigate the clinical utility of these putative markers of tactile decision-making mechanisms in CRPS.\\n\\nDisclosuresThe research was supported by funding from Cambridge Arthritis Research Endeavour (CARE). The study was sponsored by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and supported by its Rheumatology department. The authors report no conflicts of interest.\\n\\nPerspectiveWe present evidence of altered but highly variable cognitive processing (124 - 268ms latency) in response to mechanical tactile stimuli in patients with CRPS compared to healthy controls. Such mid-to-late latency responses could potentially provide convenient and robust biomarkers of abnormal perceptual decision-making mechanisms in CRPS to aid in clinical detection and treatment.",

    "abstract": "We experimentally and numerically investigate the evolutionary dynamics of four competing strains of E. coli with differing expansion velocities in radially expanding colonies. We compare experimental measurements of the average fraction, correlation functions between strains, and the relative rates of genetic domain wall annihilations and coalescences to simulations modeling the population as a one-dimensional ring of annihilating and coalescing random walkers with deterministic biases due to selection. The simulations reveal that the evolutionary dynamics can be collapsed onto master curves governed by three essential parameters: (1) an expansion length beyond which selection dominates over genetic drift; (2) a characteristic angular correlation describing the size of genetic domains; and (3) a dimensionless constant quantifying the interplay between a colonys curvature at the frontier and its selection length scale. We measure these parameters with a new technique that precisely measures small selective differences between spatially competing strains and show that our simulations accurately predict the dynamics with no additional fitting. Our results suggest that that the random walk model can act as a useful predictive tool when describing the evolutionary dynamics of range expansions composed of an arbitrary number of competing alleles with different fitnesses.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPopulation expansions occur naturally during the spread of invasive species and have played a role in our evolutionary history when many of our ancestors expanded out of Africa. We use a colony of bacteria expanding into unoccupied, nutrient-rich territory on an agar plate as a model system to explore how an expanding populations spatial structure impacts its evolutionary dynamics. Spatial structure is present in expanding microbial colonies because daughter cells migrate only a small distance away from their mothers each generation. Generally, the constituents of expansions occurring in nature and in the lab have different genetic compositions (genotypes, or alleles if a single gene differs), each instilling different fitnesses, which compete to proliferate at the frontier. Here, we show that a random-walk model can accurately predict the dynamics of four expanding strains of E. coli with different fitnesses; each strain represents a competing allele. Our results can be extended to describe any number of competing genotypes with different fitnesses in a naturally occurring expansions. Our model can also be used to precisely measure small selective differences between spatially competing genotypes in controlled laboratory settings.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the key obstacle to malaria elimination in Asia and Latin America, largely attributed to its ability to form resilient hypnozoites (sleeper-cells) in the host liver that escape treatment and cause relapsing infections. The decision to form hypnozoites is made early in the liver infection and may already be set in sporozoites prior to invasion. To better understand these early stages of infection, we undertook a comprehensive transcriptomic and histone epigenetic characterization of P. vivax sporozoites. The salivary-gland sporozoite transcriptome is heavily composed of transcripts associated with functions needed for early infection of the vertebrate host and development within hepatocytes. Through comparisons to recently published proteome data for the P. vivax sporozoite, our study finds that although highly transcribed, these transcripts are not detectable as proteins and may be regulated through translational repression; a finding we test for a small subset of transcripts and proteins through immunofluorescent microscopy of sporozoites and liver stages in humanized mice. We identify differential transcription between the sporozoite and published transcriptomes of asexual blood-stages and mixed versus hypnozoite-enriched liver stages. These comparisons point to multiple layers of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational control that appear active in sporozoites and to a lesser extent hypnozoites, but largely absent in replicating liver schizonts or mixed blood-stages. Common transcripts up-regulated in sporozoites and hypnozoites compared to mixed (i.e., schizont) liver-stages identify genes linked to dormancy/persistence in bacteria, amoebae and plants. We also characterise histone epigenetic modifications in the P. vivax sporozoite and explore their role in regulating transcription. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that the sporozoite as a tightly programmed stage primed to infect the human host and identifies potential mechanisms for hypnozoite-formation that may be further explored in liver stage models.",

    "abstract": "Brain anatomy and physiology support the human ability to navigate a complex space of perceptions and actions. To maneuver across an ever-changing landscape of mental states, the brain invokes cognitive control - a set of dynamic processes that engage and disengage different sets of brain regions to modulate attention, switch between tasks, and inhibit prepotent responses. Current theory suggests that cooperative and competitive interactions between brain areas may mediate processes of network reorganization that support transitions between dynamical states. In this study, we used a quantitative approach to identify distinct topological states of functional interactions and examine how their expression relates to cognitive control processes and behavior. In particular, we acquired fMRI BOLD signal in twenty-eight healthy subjects as they performed two cognitive control tasks - a local-global perception switching task using Navon figures and a Stroop interference task - each with low cognitive control demand and high cognitive control demand conditions. Based on these data, we constructed dynamic functional brain networks and used a parts-based network decomposition technique called non-negative matrix factorization to identify putative cognitive control subgraphs whose temporal expression captured key dynamical states involved in control processes. Our results demonstrate that the temporal expression of these functional subgraphs reflect cognitive demands and are associated with individual differences in task-based performance. These findings offer insight into how coordinated changes in the cooperative and competitive roles of distributed brain networks map trajectories between cognitively demanding brain states.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus, like the neocortex, has a morphological structure that is complex and variable in its folding pattern, especially in the hippocampal head. The current study presents a computational method to unfold hippocampal grey matter, with a particular focus on the hippocampal head where complexity is highest due to medial curving of the structure and the variable presence of digitations. This unfolding was performed on segmentations from high-resolution, T2-weighted 7T MRI data from 12 healthy participants and one surgical patient with epilepsy whose resected hippocampal tissue was used for histological validation. We traced a critical hippocampal component, the hippocampal sulcus and stratum radiatum, lacunosum moleculaire, (SRLM) in these images, then employed user-guided semi-automated techniques to detect and subsequently unfold the surrounding hippocampal grey matter. This unfolding was performed by solving Laplaces equation in three dimensions of interest (long-axis, proximal-distal, and laminar). The resulting  unfolded coordinate space provides an intuitive way of mapping the hippocampal subfields in 2D space (long-axis and proximal-distal), such that similar borders can be applied in the head, body, and tail of the hippocampus independently of variability in folding. This unfolded coordinate space was employed to map intracortical myelin and thickness in relation to subfield borders, which revealed intracortical myelin differences that closely follow the subfield borders used here. Examination of a histological sample from a patient with epilepsy reveals that our unfolded coordinate system shows biological validity, and that subfield segmentations applied in this space are able to capture features not seen in manual tracing protocols.\\n\\nResearch highlightsO_LISRLM in hippocampal head consistently detected with 7T, T2 isotropic MRI\\nC_LIO_LIHippocampal grey matter unfolded using Laplaces equation in 3D\\nC_LIO_LIIntracortical myelin and thickness mapped in unfolded coordinate space\\nC_LIO_LIUnfolded subfields capture critical structural regularities and agree with histology\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have investigated that the synthetic progestins may lead to health issues to the aquatic organisms. Progesterone is a steroidal progestin and has been used as a contraceptive drug, which is detected in the aquatic ecosystem. However, the potential effects of progesterone on the fish reproduction are largely unclear. Here, we tested the effects of progesterone on the fish reproductive and endocrine systems. Adult zebrafish were exposed to progesterone for 10 days at environmental concentrations. The production of eggs was reduced in the exposed fish, and the circulating concentrations of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) in female fish or 11-keto testosterone (11-KT) in male fish were significantly diminished. Our results suggested that progesterone may cause adverse health effects on fish by disrupting the endocrine system, and short-term exposure to progesterone could overt affect the fish reproduction.",

    "abstract": "The fragility of a single-source, geographically concentrated supply of natural rubber, a critical material of the modern economy, has brought guayule (Parthenium argentatum A. Gray) to the forefront as an alternative source of natural rubber. The improvement of guayule for commercial-scale production has been limited by the lack of genomic tools and well-characterized genetic resources required for genomics-assisted breeding. To address this issue, we developed nearly 50,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic markers and genotyped 69 accessions of guayule and its sister taxa mariola (Parthenium incanum Kunth), representing the entire available NALPGRU germplasm collection. We identified multiple interspecific hybrid accessions previously considered guayule, including six guayule-mariola hybrids and non-mariola interspecific hybrid accessions AZ-2 and AZ-3, two commonly used high-yielding cultivars. We dissected genetic diversity within the collection to identify a highly diverse subset of guayule accessions, and showed that wild guayule stands in Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA have the potential to provide hitherto untapped guayule genetic diversity. Together, these results provide the most thorough genetic characterization of guayule germplasm to date and lay the foundation for rapid genetic improvement of commercial guayule germplasm.\\n\\nKey Results O_LISix guayule accessions are guayule-mariola hybrids\\nC_LIO_LIGuayule collections from Big Bend National Park contain novel guayule genotypes not present in collections from Mexico\\nC_LIO_LICommonly cultivated accessions AZ2 and AZ3 contain introgressions from other Parthenium species\\nC_LIO_LIThe triploid accessions 11591, 11646, N576, N565, N565II, and RICHARDSON are generally indistinguishable from each other with respect to genetic background and likely represent the 4265-I source genotype (Johnson, 1950)\\nC_LIO_LIOpen pollinated and purposefully outcrossed tetraploid selections derived from 4265-I incorporate further genetic diversity and form distinct genotypes\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Humans and yeast are separated by a billion years of evolution, yet their conserved core histones retain central roles in gene regulation. Here, we \\\"reset\\\" yeast to use core human nucleosomes in lieu of their own, an exceedingly rare event which initially took twenty days. The cells adapt, however, by acquiring suppressor mutations in cell-division genes, or by acquiring certain aneuploidy states. Robust growth was also restored by converting five histone residues back to their yeast counterparts. We reveal that humanized nucleosomes in yeast are positioned according to endogenous yeast DNA sequence and chromatin-remodeling network, as judged by a yeast-like nucleosome repeat length. However, human nucleosomes have higher DNA occupancy and reduce RNA content. Adaptation to new biological conditions presented a special challenge for these cells due to slower chromatin remodeling. This humanized yeast poses many fundamental new questions about the nature of chromatin and how it is linked to many cell processes, and provides a platform to study histone variants via yeast epigenome reprogramming.\\n\\nHighlights- Only 1 in 107 yeast survive with fully human nucleosomes, but they rapidly evolve\\n- Nucleosome positioning and nucleosome repeat length is not influenced by histone type\\n- Human nucleosomes remodel slowly and delay yeast environmental adaptation\\n- Human core nucleosomes are more repressive and globally reduce transcription in yeast",

    "abstract": "The Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process (TASEP) is a classical stochastic model for describing the transport of interacting particles, such as ribosomes moving along the mRNA during translation. Although this model has been widely studied in the past, the extent of collision between particles and the average distance between a particle to its nearest neighbor have not been quantified explicitly. We provide here a theoretical analysis of such quantities via the distribution of isolated particles. In the classical form of the model in which each particle occupies only a single site, we obtain an exact analytic solution using the Matrix Ansatz. We then employ a refined mean field approach to extend the analysis to a generalized TASEP with particles of an arbitrary size. Our theoretical study has direct applications in mRNA translation and the interpretation of experimental ribosome profiling data. In particular, our analysis of data from S. cerevisiae suggests a potential bias against the detection of nearby ribosomes with gap distance less than ~ 3 codons, which leads to some ambiguity in estimating the initiation rate and protein production flux for a substantial fraction of genes. Despite such ambiguity, however, we demonstrate theoretically that the interference rate associated with collisions can be robustly estimated, and show that approximately 1% of the translating ribosomes get obstructed.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis enters the host in aerosol droplets deposited in lung alveoli where the bacteria first encounter lung-resident alveolar macrophages. We studied the earliest mycobacterium-macrophage interactions in the optically transparent zebrafish. We find that the first-responding resident macrophages can phagocytose and eradicate infecting mycobacteria. So, to establish a successful infection, mycobacteria must escape out of the initial resident macrophage into growth-permissive monocytes. We define a critical role for the membrane phenolic glycolipid (PGL) in engineering this transition to a permissive niche. PGL activates the STING cytosolic sensing pathway, thereby inducing the chemokine CCL2 that recruits permissive peripheral monocytes. The bacteria then transfer from resident macrophage to recruited monocyte via transient fusion of the two immune cells. We show that interrupting this bacterial strategy so as to prolong the mycobacterial sojourn in resident macrophages promotes clearing of infection. Because PGL-dependent CCL2 induction is conserved in human alveolar macrophages, our findings suggest the potential of immunological or pharmacological PGL-blocking interventions to prevent tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "A two-dimensional shadow may encompass more information than its corresponding three-dimensional object. If we rotate the object, we achieve a pool of observed shadows from different angulations, gradients, shapes and variable length contours that make it possible for us to increase our available information. Starting from this simple observation, we show how informational entropies might turn out to be useful in the evaluation of scale-free dynamics in the brain. Indeed, brain activity exhibits a scale-free distribution, which appears as a straight line when plotted in a log power versus log frequency plot. A variation in the scale-free exponent and in the line scaling slope may occur during different functional neurophysiological states. Here we show that modifications in scaling slope are associated with variations in Renyi entropy, a generalization of Shannon informational entropy. From a three-dimensional objects perspective, by changing its orientation (standing for the cortical scale-free exponent), we detect different two-dimensional shadows from different perception angles (standing for Renyi entropy in different brain areas). We perform simulations showing how, starting from known values of Renyi entropy (easily detectable in brain fMRIs or EEG traces), it is feasible to calculate the scaling slope in a given moment and a given brain area. Because changes in scale-free cortical dynamics modify brain activity, suggests the possibility of novel insights in mind reading and description of the forces required for transcranial stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The term brain activity refers to a wide range of mental faculties that can be assessed either on anatomical/functional micro-, meso- and macro-spatiotemporal scales of observation, or on intertwined levels with mutual interactions. Here we show, based on novel topological findings, how every brain activity encompassed in a given anatomical or functional level necessarily displays a counterpart in others. Different brain activities are able to scatter, collide and combine, merging, condensing and stitching together in a testable and quantifiable way. We point out how, despite their local cortical functional differences, all the mental processes, from perception to emotions, from cognition to mind wandering, may be reduced to a single, general brain activity that takes place in dimensions higher than the classical 3D plus time. In physics, the term duality refers to the case where two seemingly different systems turn out to be equivalent. Our framework permits a topological duality among different brain activities and neuro-techniques, because it holds for all the types of spatio-temporal nervous functions, independent of their cortical location, inter- and intra-level relationships, strength, magnitude and boundaries.",

    "abstract": "A programmable optical stimulator for Drosophila eyes is presented. The target application of the stimulator is to induce retinal degeneration in fly photoreceptor cells by exposing them to light in a controlled manner. The goal of this work is to obtain a reproducible system for studying age-related changes in susceptibility to environmental ocular stress. The stimulator uses light emitting diodes and an embedded computer to control illuminance, color (blue or red) and duration in two independent chambers. Further, the stimulator is equipped with per-chamber light and temperature sensors and a fan to monitor light intensity and to control temperature. An ON/OFF temperature control implemented on the embedded computer keeps the temperature from reaching levels that will induce the heat shock stress response in the flies. A custom enclosure was fabricated to house the electronic components of the stimulator. The enclosure provides a light-impermeable environment that allows air flow and lets users easily load and unload fly vials. Characterization results show that the fabricated stimulator can produce light at illuminances ranging from 0 to 16000 lux and power density levels from 0 to 7.2 mW/cm2 for blue light. For red light the maximum illuminance is 8000 lux which corresponds to a power density of 3.54 mW/cm2. The fans and the ON/OFF temperature control are able to keep the temperature inside the chambers below 28.17{degrees}C. Experiments with white-eye male flies were performed to assess the ability of the fabricated simulator to induce blue light-dependent retinal degeneration. Retinal degeneration is observed in flies exposed to 8 hours of blue light at 7949 lux. Flies in a control experiment with no light exposure show no retinal degeneration. Flies exposed to red light for the similar duration and light intensity (8 hours and 7994 lux) do not show retinal degeneration either. Hence, the fabricated stimulator can be used to create environmental ocular stress using blue light.\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15a02b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@681824org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@90692org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e6270org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e0e1d1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_TABLECAPTIONSpecifications table\\n\\nC_TABLECAPTION C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Dynamic control of peroxisome proliferation is integral to the peroxisomes many functions. A breakdown in the ability of cells to form peroxisomes is linked to many human health issues, including defense against infectious agents, cancer, aging, heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and forms the basis of a spectrum of peroxisomal genetic disorders that cause severe neuropathologies. The ER serves as a source for preperoxisomal vesicles (PPVs) that mature into peroxisomes during de novo peroxisome biogenesis and to support growth and division of existing peroxisomes. However, the mechanism of PPV formation and release from the ER remains poorly understood. Here we show that the evolutionarily ancient endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III are peroxisome biogenesis factors that function to cleave PPVs budding from the ER into the cytosol. Using comprehensive morphological and genetic assays of peroxisome formation and function we find that absence of ESCRT-III proteins impedes de novo peroxisome formation and results in an aberrant peroxisome population in vivo. Using a cell-free PPV budding assay we show that ESCRT-III proteins Vps20 and Snf7 are required to release PPVs from the ER. ESCRT-III is therefore a positive effector of membrane scission for vesicles budding both away from and towards the cytosol, a finding that has important implications for the evolutionary timing of emergence of peroxisomes and the rest of the internal membrane architecture of the eukaryotic cell.",
