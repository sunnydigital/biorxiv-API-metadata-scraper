    "abstract": "Mitoproteases are becoming recognized as key regulators of diverse mitochondrial functions, although their direct substrates are often difficult to discern. Through multi-omic profiling of diverse Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitoprotease deletion strains, we predicted numerous associations between mitoproteases and distinct mitochondrial processes. These include a strong association between the mitochondrial matrix octapeptidase Oct1p and coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis--a pathway essential for mitochondrial respiration. Through Edman sequencing, and in vitro and in vivo biochemistry, we demonstrated that Oct1p directly processes the N-terminus of the CoQ-related methyltransferase, Coq5p, which markedly improves its stability. A single mutation to the Oct1p recognition motif in Coq5p disrupted its processing in vivo, leading to CoQ deficiency and respiratory incompetence. This work defines the Oct1p processing of Coq5p as an essential post-translational event for proper CoQ production. Our custom data visualization tool enables efficient exploration of mitoprotease profiles that can serve as the basis for future mechanistic investigations.",

    "abstract": "Insulin secretion from the pancreatic {beta}-cell initiated by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) to trigger Ca2+-mediated insulin vesicle fusion with the {beta}-cell plasma membrane. The firing of VGCC depends on the {beta}-cell membrane potential, which is in turn mediated by the balance of depolarizing (excitatory) and hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) ionic currents1-3. While much attention has focused on inhibitory potassium currents4-10 there is little knowledge about the excitatory currents required to depolarize the {beta}-cell, including the molecular identity of these excitatory currents3. Here we show that SWELL1 (LRRC8a) mediates a swell-activated, depolarizing chloride current (ICl,SWELL) in {beta}-cells. Hypotonic and glucose-stimulated {beta}-cell swelling activates SWELL1-mediated ICl,SWELL and this is required for both glucose-stimulated and hypotonic swell-mediated activation of VGCC-dependent intracellular calcium signaling in {beta}-cells. SWELL1 KO MIN6 cells and {beta}-cell targeted SWELL1 KO murine islets exhibit significantly impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, with preserved insulin content in vitro. Tamoxifen-inducible {beta}-cell targeted SWELL1 KO mice have normal fasting insulin levels but display markedly impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Our results reveal a physiological role for SWELL1 as a glucose sensor - linking glucose-mediated {beta}-cell swelling to SWELL1-dependent activation of VGCC-triggered calcium signaling, and highlights SWELL1-mediated \\\"swell-secretion\\\" coupling as required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative measurement of mRNA levels in single cells is necessary to understand phenotypic variability within an otherwise isogenic population of cells. Single-molecule mRNA Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) has been established as the standard method for this purpose, but current protocols require a long region of mRNA to be targeted by multiple DNA probes. Here, we introduce a new single-probe FISH protocol termed sFISH for budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a single DNA probe labeled with a single fluorophore. In sFISH, we markedly improved probe specificity and signal-to-background ratio by using methanol fixation and inclined laser illumination. We show that sFISH reports mRNA changes that correspond to protein levels and gene copy number. Using this new FISH protocol, we can detect more than 50% of the total target mRNA. We also demonstrate the versatility of sFISH using FRET detection and mRNA isoform profiling as examples. Our FISH protocol with single-fluorophore sensitivity significantly reduces cost and time compared to the conventional FISH protocols and opens up new opportunities to investigate small changes in RNA at the single cell level.",

    "abstract": "Shellfish-transmitted Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections have recently increased from locations with historically low disease incidence, such as the Northeast United States (US). This change coincided with a bacterial population shift towards human pathogenic variants occurring in part through the introduction of several Pacific native lineages (ST36, ST43 and ST636) to near-shore areas off the Atlantic coast of the Northeast US. Concomitantly, ST631 emerged as a major endemic pathogen. Phylogenetic trees of clinical and environmental isolates indicated that two clades diverged from a common ST631 ancestor, and in each of these clades, a human pathogenic variant evolved independently through acquisition of distinct Vibrio pathogenicity islands (VPaI). These VPaI differ from each other and bear little resemblance to hemolysin-containing VPaI from isolates of the pandemic clonal complex. Clade I ST631 isolates either harbored no hemolysins, or contained a chromosome I-inserted island we call VPaI{beta} that encodes a type three secretion system (T3SS2{beta}) typical of Trh hemolysin-producers. The more clinically prevalent and clonal ST631 clade II had an island we call VPaI{gamma} that encodes both tdh and trh and that was inserted in chromosome II. VPaI{gamma} was derived from VPaI{beta} but with some additional acquired elements in common with VPaI carried by pandemic isolates, exemplifying the mosaic nature of pathogenicity islands. Genomics comparisons and amplicon assays identified VPaI{gamma}-type islands containing tdh inserted adjacent to the ure cluster in the three introduced Pacific and most other emergent lineages. that collectively cause 67% of Northeast US infections as of 2016.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe availability of three different hemolysin genotypes in the ST631 lineage provided a unique opportunity to employ genome comparisons to further our understanding of the processes underlying pathogen evolution. The fact that two different pathogenic clades arose in parallel from the same potentially benign lineage by independent VPaI acquisition is surprising considering the historically low prevalence of community members harboring VPaI in waters along the Northeast US Coast that could serve as the source of this material. This illustrates a possible predisposition of some lineages to not only acquire foreign DNA but also to become human pathogens. Whereas the underlying cause for the expansion of V. parahaemolyticus lineages harboring VPaI{gamma} along the US Atlantic coast and spread of this element to multiple lineages that underlies disease emergence is not known, this work underscores the need to define the environment factors that favor bacteria harboring VPaI in locations of emergent disease.",

    "abstract": "Although apoptotic cells (ACs) contain nucleic acids that can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), engulfment of ACs does not initiate inflammation in healthy organisms. To better understand this phenomenon, we identified and characterized macrophage populations that continually engulf ACs in several distinct tissues. These macrophages share characteristics compatible with immunologically silent clearance of ACs, including high expression of AC recognition receptors, low expression of TLR9, and reduced TLR responsiveness to nucleic acids. When removed from tissues these macrophages lose many of these characteristics and generate inflammatory responses to AC-derived nucleic acids, suggesting that cues from the tissue microenvironment are required to program macrophages for silent AC clearance. We show that KLF2 and KLF4 control expression of many genes within this AC clearance program. Coordinated expression of AC receptors with genes that limit responses to nucleic acids may represent a central feature of tissue macrophages that ensures maintenance of homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Preservation of a balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition is critical for normal brain function. A number of homeostatic cellular mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in maintaining this balance, including long-term plasticity of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. Many previous studies have demonstrated a coupling of postsynaptic spiking with modification of perisomatic inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors leads to input-specific long-term potentiation of dendritic inhibition mediated by somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This form of plasticity is expressed postsynaptically and requires both CaMKII and the {beta}2-subunit of the GABA-A receptor. Importantly, this process may function to preserve dendritic inhibition, as in vivo loss of NMDAR signaling results in a selective weakening of dendritic inhibition. Overall, our results reveal a new mechanism for linking excitatory and inhibitory input in neuronal dendrites and provide novel insight into the homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission in cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "Asparagine-linked (N-linked) protein glycosylation is one of the most abundant types of post-translational modification, occurring in all domains of life. The central enzyme in N-linked glycosylation is the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which catalyzes the covalent attachment of preassembled glycans to specific asparagine residues in target proteins. Whereas in higher eukaryotes the OST is comprised of eight different membrane proteins of which the catalytic subunit is STT3, in kinetoplastids and prokaryotes the OST is a monomeric enzyme bearing homology to STT3. Given their relative simplicity, these single-subunit OSTs (ssOSTs) have emerged as important targets for mechanistic dissection of poorly understood aspects of N-glycosylation and at the same time hold great potential for the biosynthesis of custom glycoproteins. To take advantage of this utility, this chapter describes a multipronged approach for studying and engineering ssOSTs that integrates in vivo screening technology with in vitro characterization methods, thereby creating a versatile and readily-adaptable pipeline for virtually any ssOST of interest.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

In order to identify cross-linked peptides from MS data, we need to consider all pairwise combinations of peptides, which is computationally prohibitive when the sequence database is large. To alleviate this problem, some heuristic screening strategies are used to reduce the number of peptide pairs during the identification. However, heuristic screening criteria may ignore true findings.\\n\\nResultsWe directly tackle the combination challenge without using any screening strategies. With the additive scoring function and the data structure of double-ended queue, the proposed algorithm reduces the quadratic time complexity of exhaustive searching down to the linear time complexity. We implement the algorithm in a tool named Xolik, and the running time of Xolik is validated using databases with different number of proteins.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases pose an extraordinary threat to the worlds aging population, yet no disease-modifying therapies are available. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of novel risk loci for neurodegeneration, the mechanisms by which these loci influence disease risk are largely unknown. Indeed, of the many thousands of SNP-trait associations identified by GWAS over the past ~10 years, very few are understood mechanistically. Here, we investigate the association of common genetic variants at the 7p21 locus with risk for the neurodegenerative disease frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We show that variants associated with disease risk correlate with increased brain expression of the 7p21 gene TMEM106B, and no other genes. Furthermore, incremental increases in TMEM106B levels result in incremental increases in lysosomal phenotypes and cell toxicity. We then combine fine-mapping, bioinformatics, and bench-based approaches to functionally characterize all candidate causal variants at this locus. This approach identified a noncoding variant, rs1990620, which differentially recruits CTCF, influencing CTCF-mediated long-range chromatin looping interactions between multiple cis-regulatory elements, including the TMEM106B promoter. Our findings thus provide an in-depth analysis of the 7p21 locus linked by GWAS to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, nominating a causal variant and a causal mechanism for allele-specific expression and disease association at this locus. Finally, we show that genetic variants associated with risk for neurodegenerative diseases beyond frontotemporal lobar degeneration are enriched in brain CTCF-binding sites genome-wide, implicating CTCF-mediated gene regulation in risk for neurodegeneration more generally.",

Although a number of ant genomes have been sequenced to date, their draft quality is an obstacle to sophisticated analyses of epigenetic gene regulation. Using long reads generated with Pacific Biosystem single molecule real time sequencing, we have reassembled de novo high-quality genomes for two ant species: Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator. The long reads allowed us to span large repetitive regions and join sequences previously found in separate scaffolds, leading to comprehensive and accurate protein-coding annotations that facilitated the identification of a Gp-9-like gene as differentially expressed in Harpegnathos castes. The new assemblies also enabled us to annotate long non-coding RNAs for the first time in ants, revealing several that were specifically expressed during Harpegnathos development and in the brains of different castes. These upgraded genomes, along with the new coding and non-coding annotations, will aid future efforts to identify epigenetic mechanisms of phenotypic and behavioral plasticity in ants.",

We sequenced the whole genomes of 103 Salmonella isolates sampled between 1988 and 2003 from wildlife and exotic pet cases that were submitted to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Stillwater, Oklahoma. Among 103 isolates, 50.48% were from wild birds, 0.9% was from fish, 24.27% each were from reptiles and mammals. 50.48% isolates showed resistance to at least one antibiotic. Resistance against the aminoglycoside streptomycin was most common while 9 isolates were found to be multi-drug resistant having resistance against more than three antibiotics. Determination of virulence gene profile revealed that the genes belonging to csg operons, the fim genes that encode for type 1 fimbriae and the genes belonging to type III secretion system were predominant among the isolates. The universal presence of fimbrial genes and the genes encoded by pathogenicity islands 1-2 among the isolates we report here indicates that these isolates could potentially cause disease in humans. Therefore, the genomes we report here could be a valuable reference point for future traceback investigations when wildlife is considered to be the potential source of human Salmonellosis.",

    "abstract": "The modular control hypothesis suggests that motor commands are built from precoded modules whose specific combined recruitment can allow the performance of virtually any motor task. Despite considerable experimental support, this hypothesis remains tentative as classical findings of reduced dimensionality in muscle activity may also result from other constraints (biomechanical couplings, data averaging or low dimensionality of motor tasks). Here we assessed the effectiveness of modularity in describing muscle activity in a comprehensive experiment comprising 72 distinct point-to-point whole-body movements during which the activity of 30 muscles was recorded. To identify invariant modules of a temporal and spatial nature, we used a space-by-time decomposition of muscle activity that has been shown to encompass classical modularity models. To examine the decompositions, we focused not only on the amount of variance they explained but also on whether the task performed on each trial could be decoded from the single-trial activations of modules. For the sake of comparison, we confronted these scores to the scores obtained from alternative non-modular descriptions of the muscle data. We found that the space-by-time decomposition was effective in terms of data approximation and task discrimination at comparable reduction of dimensionality. These findings show that few spatial and temporal modules give a compact yet approximate representation of muscle patterns carrying nearly all task-relevant information for a variety of whole-body reaching movements.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge about the statistical regularities of the world is essential for cognitive and sensorimotor function. In the domain of timing, prior statistics are crucial for optimal prediction, adaptation and planning. Where and how the nervous system encodes temporal statistics, however, is not known. Deriving from physiological and anatomical evidence for cerebellar learning, we develop a computational model that demonstrates how the cerebellum could learn prior distributions of time intervals and support Bayesian temporal estimation. The model shows that salient features observed in human Bayesian time interval estimates can be readily captured by learning in the cerebellar cortex and circuit level computations in the cerebellar deep nuclei.",

    "abstract": "The extinct \\\"New World stilt-legged\\\", or NWSL, equids constitute a perplexing group of Pleistocene horses endemic to North America. Their slender distal limb bones resemble those of Asiatic asses, such as the Persian onager. Previous palaeogenetic studies, however, have suggested a closer relationship to caballine horses than to Asiatic asses. Here, we report complete mitochondrial and partial nuclear genomes from NWSL equids from across their geographic range. Although multiple NWSL equid species have been named, our palaeogenomic and morphometric analyses support the idea that there was only a single species of middle to late Pleistocene NWSL equid, and demonstrate that it falls outside of crown group Equus. We therefore propose a new genus, Haringtonhippus, for the sole species H. francisci. Our combined genomic and phenomic approach to resolving the systematics of extinct megafauna will allow for an improved understanding of the full extent of the terminal Pleistocene extinction event.",

    "abstract": "Cystic echinococcosis is an endemic parasitic infection in Xinjiang, China and is causing serious economic burdens and public health concerns. An experimental murine model in vivo for hepatic cystic echinococcosis was established in C57B/6 mice by injection with human protoscolices via the portal vein of three different concentrations. Mice were followed up 10 months by ultrasound, gross anatomy, pathological and immunological examinations. The protoscolice migration in portal vein, hydatid cyst growth, host immune reaction and hepatic histopathology were examed periodicly. The infection rate of the mice in the high, medium, and low concentration groups were 90%, 100%, and 63.6%, respectively. The protoscolices migrate in the portal vein with blood flow, settle in the liver and develop into orthotopic hepatic hydatid cysts, resembling the natural infection route and course. This study established an improved experimental model of low biohazard risk but stable growing dynamics and immune reaction. It is especially useful for new anti-parasite medication trials agains hydatid disease.\\n\\nSummary statementAn experimental murine model of cystic echinococcosis was set up. This orthotopic model resembles primary infection route and natural infectious course with low biohazard risk and high efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Plants adjust their architecture by modulating organ growth. This ability is largely dependent on phytohormones. While many genes involved in phytohormone pathways have been identified, it remains unclear to which extent and how these pathways are modulated in non-reference strains and whether this is relevant for local adaptation. Here we assess variation of root traits in response to perturbations of the auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid pathways in 192 Arabidopsis accessions. We identify common response patterns, uncover the extent of their modulation by specific genotypes, and find that the Col-0 reference accession is not a good representative of the species in this regard. We conduct GWAS and identify 114 significant associations, most of them relating to ABA treatment. The numerous ABA candidate genes are not enriched for known ABA associated genes indicating that we largely uncovered unknown players. We then study two associated regions in detail and identify the CRF3 gene as a modulator of multiple hormone pathways. Finally, we show that natural variation in root traits is significantly associated with climate parameters relevant for local adaption in Arabidopsis thaliana and that, in particular, ABA regulated lateral root traits are likely to be relevant for adaptation to soil moisture.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe root system is a key component for plant survival and productivity. Apart from anchoring the plant, its architecture determines which parts of the soil are foraged for water and nutrients, and it serves as an interface for interaction with microbes and other soil organisms. Plant hormones play crucial roles in the development of root system architecture and its plasticity. However, while there is substantial natural variation of root architectures, it is not clear to which extent genetic variation in hormone related pathways contribute. Using the model species Arabidopsis thaliana we quantitatively explore the breadth of natural variation in plant hormone responses to three major plant hormones: auxin, cytokinin, and abscisic acid. The Col-0 reference strain can be quite different from a large proportion of the natural accessions of the species, illustrating a severe caveat of relying on a single reference strain in model species and drawing generalizations from it. Using GWAS, we further identify a large number of loci underlying the variation of responses to plant hormones, in particular to abscisic acid, find links between local adaptation and root responses to hormones, and finally using mutants for GWAS candidate genes, identify novel players involved in regulating hormone responses.",
