    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that translation elongation is regulated by multiple factors, but the observed heterogeneity remains only partially explained. To dissect quantitatively the different determinants of elongation speed, we use probabilistic modeling to estimate initiation and local elongation rates from ribosome profiling data. This model-based approach allows us to quantify the extent of interference between ribosomes on the same transcript. We show that neither interference nor the distribution of slow codons is sufficient to explain the observed heterogeneity. Instead, we find that electrostatic interactions between the ribosomal exit tunnel and specific parts of the nascent polypeptide govern the elongation rate variation as the polypeptide makes its initial pass through the tunnel. Once the N-terminus has escaped the tunnel, the hydropathy of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome plays a major role in modulating the speed. We show that our results are consistent with the biophysical properties of the tunnel.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific diversity informs the demographic and evolutionary histories of populations, and should be a main conservation target. Although approaches exist for identifying relevant biological conservation units, attempts to identify priority conservation areas for intraspecific diversity are scarce, especially within a multi-specific framework. We used neutral molecular data on six European freshwater fish species (Squalius cephalus, Phoxinus phoxinus, Barbatula barbatula, Gobio occitaniae, Leuciscus burdigalensis and Parachondrostoma toxostoma) sampled at the riverscape scale (i.e. the Garonne-Dordogne River basin, France) to determine hot- and cold-spots of genetic diversity, and to identify priority conservation areas using a systematic conservation planning approach. We demonstrate that systematic conservation planning is efficient for identifying priority areas representing a predefined part of the total genetic diversity of a whole landscape. With the exception of private allelic richness, classical genetic diversity indices (allelic richness, genetic uniqueness) were poor predictors for identifying priority areas. Moreover, we identified weak surrogacies among conservation solutions found for each species, implying that conservation solutions are highly species-specific. Nonetheless, we showed that priority areas identified using intraspecific genetic data from multiple species provide more effective conservation solutions than areas identified for single species or on the basis of traditional taxonomic criteria.",

This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive transcription generates many unstable non-coding transcripts in budding yeast. The transcription of such noncoding RNAs, in particular antisense RNAs (asRNAs), has been shown in a few examples to repress the expression of the associated mRNAs. Yet, such mechanism is not known to commonly contribute to the regulation of a given class of genes. Using a mutant context that stabilised pervasive transcripts, we observed that the least expressed mRNAs during the exponential phase were associated with high levels of asRNAs. These asRNAs also overlapped their corresponding gene promoters with a much higher frequency than average. Interrupting antisense transcription of a subset of genes corresponding to quiescence-enriched mRNAs restored their expression. The underlying mechanism acts in cis and involves several chromatin modifiers. Our results convey that transcription interference represses up to 30% of the 590 least expressed genes, which includes 163 genes with quiescence-enriched mRNAs. We also found that pervasive transcripts constitute a higher fraction of the transcriptome in quiescence relative to the exponential phase, consistent with gene expression itself playing an important role to suppress pervasive transcription. Accordingly, the HIS1 asRNA, normally only present in quiescence, is expressed in exponential phase upon HIS1 mRNA transcription interruption.",

    "abstract": "Although extinction is ubiquitous throughout the history of life, insight into the factors that drive extinction events are often difficult to decipher. Most studies of extinction focus on inferring causal factors from past extinction events, but these studies are constrained by our inability to observe extinction events as they occur. Here, we use digital evolution to avoid these constraints and study \\\"extinction in action\\\". We focus on the role of genome size in driving population extinction, as previous work both in comparative genomics and digital evolution has shown a correlation between genome size and extinction. We find that extinctions in small populations are caused by large genome size. This relationship between genome size and extinction is due to two genetic mechanisms that increase a populations lethal mutational burden: large genome size leads to both an increased lethal mutation rate and an increased likelihood of stochastic reproduction errors and non-viability. We further show that this increased lethal mutational burden is directly due to genome expansions, as opposed to subsequent adaptation after genome expansion. These findings suggest that large genome size can enhance the extinction likelihood of small populations and may inform which natural populations are at an increased risk of extinction.",

    "abstract": "Plants and fungi display a broad range of interactions in natural and agricultural ecosystems ranging from symbiosis to parasitism. These ecological interactions result in coevolution between genes belonging to different partners. A well-understood example are secreted fungal effector proteins and their host targets, which play an important role in pathogenic interactions. Biotrophic smut fungi (Basidiomycota) are well-suited to investigate the evolution of plant pathogens, because several reference genomes and genetic tools are available for these species. Here, we used the genomes of Sporisorium reilianum f. sp. zeae and S. reilianum f. sp. reilianum, two closely related formae speciales infecting maize and sorghum, respectively, together with the genomes of Ustilago hordei, Ustilago maydis and Sporisorium scitamineum to identify and characterize genes displaying signatures of positive selection. We identified 154 gene families having undergone positive selection during species divergence in at least one lineage, among which 77% were identified in the two investigated formae speciales of S. reilianum. Remarkably, only 29% of positively selected genes encode predicted secreted proteins. We assessed the contribution to virulence of nine of these candidate effector genes in S. reilianum f. sp. zeae by deleting individual genes, including a homologue of the effector gene pit2 previously characterized in U. maydis. Only the pit2 deletion mutant was found to be strongly reduced in virulence. Additional experiments are required to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the selection forces acting on the other candidate effector genes, as well as the large fraction of positively selected genes encoding predicted cytoplasmic proteins.",

    "abstract": "Countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties. Only a few studies have explored how such variations influence how humans navigate or reason about space [1-7]. We predicted that these variations impact human cognition, resulting in an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people, sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-centre clinical trials using cognitive testing.",

    "abstract": "The Colorado potato beetle is one of the most challenging agricultural pests to manage. It has shown a spectacular ability to adapt to a variety of solanaceaeous plants and variable climates during its global invasion, and, notably, to rapidly evolve insecticide resistance. To examine evidence of rapid evolutionary change, and to understand the genetic basis of herbivory and insecticide resistance, we tested for structural and functional genomic changes relative to other arthropod species using genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and community annotation. Two factors that might facilitate rapid evolutionary change include transposable elements, which comprise at least 17% of the genome and are rapidly evolving compared to other Coleoptera, and high levels of nucleotide diversity in rapidly growing pest populations. Adaptations to plant feeding are evident in gene expansions and differential expression of digestive enzymes in gut tissues, as well as expansions of gustatory receptors for bitter tasting. Surprisingly, the suite of genes involved in insecticide resistance is similar to other beetles. Finally, duplications in the RNAi pathway might explain why Leptinotarsa decemlineata has high sensitivity to dsRNA. The L. decemlineata genome provides opportunities to investigate a broad range of phenotypes and to develop sustainable methods to control this widely successful pest.",

    "abstract": "Cell size control requires mechanisms that link cell growth with Cdk1 activity. In fission yeast, the protein kinase Cdr2 forms cortical nodes that include the Cdk1 inhibitor Wee1, along with the Wee1-inhibitory kinase Cdr1. We investigated how nodes inhibit Wee1 during cell growth. Biochemical fractionation revealed that Cdr2 nodes were megadalton structures enriched for activated Cdr2, which increases in level during interphase growth. In live-cell TIRF movies, Cdr2 and Cdr1 remained constant at nodes over time, but Wee1 localized to nodes in short bursts. Recruitment of Wee1 to nodes required Cdr2 kinase activity and the noncatalytic N-terminus of Wee1. Bursts of Wee1 localization to nodes increased 20-fold as cells doubled in size throughout G2. Size-dependent signaling was due in part to the Cdr2 inhibitor Pom1, which suppressed Wee1 node bursts in small cells. Thus, increasing Cdr2 activity during cell growth promotes Wee1 localization to nodes, where inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1 by Cdr1 and Cdr2 kinases promotes mitotic entry.\\n\\nSummaryCells turn off the mitotic inhibitor Wee1 to enter into mitosis. This study shows how cell growth progressively inhibits fission yeast Wee1 through dynamic bursts of localization to cortical node structures that contain Wee1 inhibitory kinases.",

    "abstract": "Gamete size dimorphism between sexes (anisogamy) is predicted to have evolved from an isogamous system in which sexes have equal-sized, monomorphic gametes. Although adaptive explanations for the evolution of anisogamy abound, we lack comparable insights into molecular changes that bring about the transition from monomorphism to dimorphism. The basal fungal clade Allomyces provides unique opportunities to investigate genomic changes that are associated with this transition in closely related species that show either isogamous or anisogamous mating systems. The anisogamous species show sexual dimorphism in gamete size, number, pigmentation and motility. We sequenced transcriptomes of five Allomyces isolates representing the two mating systems, including both male and female phenotypes in the anisogamous species. Maximum likelihood ancestral character state reconstruction performed in MESQUITE using the de-novo assembled transcriptomes indicated that anisogamy likely evolved once in Allomyces, and is a derived character as predicted in theory. We found that sexual stages of Allomyces express homologs of several genes known to be involved in sex determination in model organisms including Drosophila and humans. Furthermore, expression of CatSper homologs in male- and female-biased samples in our analysis support the hypothesis that gamete interaction in the anisogamous species of Allomyces may involve similar molecular events as the egg-sperm interaction in animals, including humans. Although the strains representing either mating system shared much of the transcriptome, supporting recent common ancestry, the analysis of rate of evolution using individual gene trees indicates high substitution rates and divergence between the strains. In summary, we find that anisogamy likely evolved once in Allomyces, using convergent mechanisms to those in other taxa.",

Although NMN-induced cardioprotection was absent in Sirt3-/- hearts (recovery 9{+/-}5%), this was likely due to enhanced baseline injury in Sirt3-/- (recovery 6{+/-}2%), since similar injury levels in WT hearts also blunted the protective efficacy of NMN. Considering alternative cardiac effects of NMN, and the requirement of glycolysis for NAD+, we hypothesized NMN may confer protection via direct stimulation of cardiac glycolysis. In primary cardiomyocytes, NMN induced cytosolic and extracellular acidification and elevated lactate. In addition, [U-13C]glucose tracing in intact hearts revealed that NMN stimulated glycolytic flux. Consistent with a role for glycolysis in NMN-induced protection, hearts perfused without glucose (palmitate as fuel source), or hearts perfused with galactose (no ATP from glycolysis) exhibited no benefit from NMN (recovery 11{+/-}4% and 15{+/-}2% respectively). Acidosis during early reperfusion is known to be cardioprotective (i.e., acid post-conditioning), and we also found that NMN was cardioprotective when delivered acutely at reperfusion (recovery 39{+/-}8%). This effect of NMN was not additive with acidosis, suggesting overlapping mechanisms. We conclude that the acute cardioprotective benefits of NMN are mediated via glycolytic stimulation, with the downstream protective mechanism involving enhanced ATP synthesis during ischemia and/or enhanced acidosis during reperfusion.",

    "abstract": "The ability to quickly and inexpensively describe taxonomic diversity is critical in this era of rapid climate and biodiversity changes. The currently preferred molecular technique, barcoding, has been very successful, but is based on short organelle markers. Recently, an alternative genome-skimming approach has been proposed: low-pass sequencing (100Mb - several Gb per sample) is applied to voucher and/or query samples, and marker genes and/or organelle genomes are recovered computationally. The current practice of genome-skimming discards the vast majority of the data because the low coverage of genome-skims prevents assembling the nuclear genomes. In contrast, we suggest using all unassembled reads directly, but existing methods poorly support this goal. We introduce a new alignment-free tool, Skmer, to estimate genomic distances between the query and each reference genome-skim using the k-mer decomposition of reads. We test Skmer on a large set of insect and bird genomes, sub-sampled to create genome-skims. Skmer shows great accuracy in estimating genomic distances, identifying the closest match in a reference dataset, and inferring the phylogeny. The software is publicly available on https://github.com/shahab-sarmashghi/Skmer.git",

    "abstract": "All known phototrophic metabolisms on Earth are based on one of three energy-converting pigments: chlorophyll-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, and retinal, which is the chromophore in rhodopsins [1]. While the contribution of chlorophylls to global energy flows and marine carbon cycling has been studied for decades, the role of retinal-based phototrophy remains largely unexplored [1,2]. We report the first vertical distributions of the three energy-converting pigments measured along a contrasting nutrient gradient through the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. The highest proteorhodopsin concentrations were observed above the deep chlorophyll-a maxima, and their geographical distribution tended to be inversely related to that of chlorophyll-a. We further show that proteorhodopsins potentially absorb as much or more light energy than chlorophyll-a -based phototrophy and this energy is sufficient to sustain bacterial basal metabolism. Our results suggest that ubiquitous proteorhodopsin-containing heterotrophs are important contributors to the light energy captured in the sea.",

    "abstract": "Fleshy fruit evolved independently multiple times during angiosperm history. Many climacteric fruits utilize the hormone ethylene to regulate ripening. The fruitENCODE project shows there are multiple evolutionary origins of the regulatory circuits that govern climacteric fruit ripening. Eudicot climacteric fruits with recent whole-genome duplications (WGDs) evolved their ripening regulatory systems using the duplicated floral identity genes, while others without WGD utilised carpel senescence genes. The monocot banana uses both leaf senescence and duplicated floral-identity genes, forming two interconnected regulatory circuits. H3K27me3 plays a conserved role in restricting the expression of key ripening regulators and their direct orthologs in both the ancestral dry fruit and non-climacteric fleshy fruit species. Our findings suggest that evolution of climacteric ripening was constrained by limited availability of signalling molecules and genetic and epigenetic materials, and WGD provided new resources for plants to circumvent this limit. Understanding these different ripening mechanisms makes it possible to design tailor-made ripening traits to improve quality, yield and minimize postharvest losses.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe fruitENCODE project discovered three evolutionary origins of the regulatory circuits that govern climacteric fruit ripening.",

    "abstract": "Immunological differences between hosts, such as diverse T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, are widely credited for reducing the risk of pathogen spread and adaptation in a population. Within-host immunological diversity might likewise be important for robust pathogen control, but to what extent naive TCR repertoires differ across different locations in the same host is unclear. T-cell zones (TCZs) in secondary lymphoid organs provide secluded micro-environmental niches. By harboring distinct TCRs, such niches could enhance within-host immunological diversity. On the other hand, rapid T cell migration is expected to dilute such diversity. Here, we combined tissue micro-dissection and deep sequencing of the TCR {beta} chain to examine the extent to which TCR repertoires differ between TCZs in murine spleens. In the absence of antigen, we found little evidence for differences between different TCZs of the same spleen. Yet, three days after immunization with sheep red blood cells, we observed a >10-fold rise in the number of clones that appeared to localize to individual zones. Remarkably, these differences largely disappeared at 4 days after immunization, when hallmarks of an ongoing immune response were still observed. These data suggest that in the absence of antigen, any repertoire differences observed between TCZs of the same host can largely be attributed to random clone distribution. Upon antigen challenge, segregated TCR compartments appear and disappear within days. Such \\\"transient mosaic\\\" dynamics could be an important barrier for pathogen adaptation and spread during an immune response.",

We present a strategy to enhance HDR efficiency by covalently tethering a single-stranded donor oligonucleotide (ssODN) to the Cas9/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex via a fused HUH endonuclease5, thus spatially and temporally co-localizing the DSB machinery and donor DNA. We demonstrate up to an 8-fold enhancement of HDR using several editing assays, including repair of a frameshift and in-frame insertions of protein tags. The improved HDR efficiency is observed in multiple cell types and target loci, and is more pronounced at low RNP concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential micronutrient but in excess is toxic inside cells. Under iron deficiency, the expression of iron uptake genes is increased, but it is not known how the transcriptional response is controlled to avoid uptake of too much iron. The hemerythrin E3 ligases BRUTUS (BTS) and BTS-LIKE (BTSL) have previously been identified as negative regulators of the iron deficiency response. Our phylogenetic analysis indicated that BTSL proteins are present in dicotyledonous plants only and form a separate clade from BTS homologs. BTSL1 and BTSL2 in Arabidopsis thaliana are in a network with nearly all iron uptake genes, whereas BTS is in a shoot-specific network. BTSL1 and BTSL2 are expressed predominantly in the root epidermis and cortex, separate from BTS in the root stele, shoot and embryos. Mutant analysis identified BTSL2 as the dominant paralog of the otherwise redundant BTSL genes. The btsl double mutant had increased protein levels of FIT, the FER-like Iron deficiency-induced Transcription factor, and failed to switch off the transcriptional response upon iron resupply, leading to dramatic iron accumulation in roots and shoots. Protein interaction between the C-terminus of BTSL proteins and FIT indicate that FIT is a direct target for degradation. Taken together, our studies show that BTSL1 and BTSL2 control iron uptake in the epidermis and cortex, upstream of BTS in the vasculature and leaves.",

The vacuole is the biggest plant organelle and its dimension has a role in limiting cell expansion (Lofke et al., 2015; Scheuring et al., 2016). We reveal that the increase in vacuolar occupancy enables cellular elongation with relatively little enlargement of the cytosole. It remains, however, completely unknown how the vacuolar size is coordinated with other growth-relevant processes. Intriguingly, we show that extracellular constraints impact on the intracellular expansion of the vacuole. The underlying cell wall sensing mechanism requires the interaction of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) with the receptor-like kinase Feronia (FER). Our data suggests that LRX links the plasma membrane localised FER with the cell wall, allowing this module to jointly sense and convey extracellular signals to the underlying cell. This mechanism coordinates cell wall acidification/loosening with the increase in vacuolar size, contributing cytosol homeostasis during plant cell expansion.",

These properties have made it difficult to identify the sequence features that define activation domains. For example, although acidic activation domains were discovered 30 years ago, we still do not know what role, if any, acidic residues play in these peptides. To address this question we designed a rational mutagenesis scheme to independently test four sequence features theorized to control the strength of activation domains: acidity (negative charge), hydrophobicity, intrinsic disorder, and short linear motifs. To test enough mutants to deconvolve these four features we developed a method to quantify the activities of thousands of activation domain variants in parallel. Our results with Gcn4, a classic acidic activation domain, suggest that acidic residues in particular regions keep two hydrophobic motifs exposed to solvent. We also found that the specific activity of the Gcn4 activation domain increases during amino acid starvation. Our results suggest that Gcn4 may have evolved to have low activity but high inducibility. Our results also demonstrate that high-throughput rational mutation scans will be powerful tools for unraveling the properties that control how intrinsically disordered proteins function.",

Secreted and cell membrane proteins play a critical role in fungal-host interactions and pathogenesis. Using a computational pipeline integrating data from high-throughput experiments and bioinformatic predictions, we have identified secreted and cell membrane proteins in ten Aspergillus species known to cause aspergillosis. Small secreted and effector-like proteins similar to agents of fungal-plant pathogenesis were also identified within each secretome. A comparison with humans revealed that at least 70% of Aspergillus secretomes has no sequence similarity with the human proteome. An analysis of antigenic qualities of Aspergillus proteins revealed that the secretome is significantly more antigenic than cell membrane proteins or the complete proteome. Finally, overlaying an expression dataset, four A. fumigatus proteins upregulated during infection and with available structures, were found to be structurally similar to known drug target proteins in other organisms, and were able to dock in silico with the respective drug.",

Modern automated microscopes produce vast amounts of images routinely, making manual analysis nearly impossible. Due to their efficiency, machine learning-based analysis software have become essential tools to perform single-cell-level phenotypic analysis of large imaging datasets. However, an important limitation of such methods is that they do not use the information gained from the cellular micro- and macroenvironment: the algorithmic decision is based solely on the local properties of the cell of interest. Here, we present how various microenvironmental features contribute to identifying a cell and how such additional information can improve single-cell-level phenotypic image analysis. The proposed methodology was tested for different sizes of Euclidean and nearest neighbour-based cellular environments both on tissue sections and cell cultures. Our experimental data verify that the microenvironment of a cell largely determines its entity. This effect was found to be especially strong for established tissues, while it was somewhat weaker in the case of cell cultures. Our analysis shows that combining local cellular features with the properties of the cell's microenvironment significantly improves the accuracy of machine learning-based phenotyping.",

    "abstract": "Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies have had major success in treating patients with late-stage cancers, yet the minority of patients benefit [1]. Mutation load and PD-L1 staining are leading biomarkers associated with response, but each is an imperfect predictor. A key challenge to predicting response is modeling the interaction between the tumor and immune system. We begin to address this challenge with a multifactorial model for response to anti-PD-L1 therapy. We train a model to predict immune response in patients after treatment based on 36 clinical, tumor, and circulating features collected prior to treatment. We analyze data from 21 bladder cancer patients [2] using the elastic net high-dimensional regression procedure [3] and, as training set error is a biased and overly optimistic measure of prediction error, we use leave-one-out cross-validation to obtain unbiased estimates of accuracy on held-out patients. In held-out patients, the model explains 79% of the variance in T cell clonal expansion. This predicted immune response is multifactorial, as the variance explained is at most 23% if clinical, tumor, or circulating features are excluded. Moreover, if patients are triaged according to predicted expansion, only 38% of non-durable clinical benefit (DCB) patients need be treated to ensure that 100% of DCB patients are treated. In contrast, using mutation load or PD-L1 staining alone, one must treat at least 77% of non-DCB patients to ensure that all DCB patients receive treatment. Thus, integrative models of immune response may improve our ability to anticipate clinical benefit of immunotherapy.",

Modern experimental procedures show that the proliferation rates of individual cells can vary significantly within the same cell line. However, in the mathematical biology literature, cell proliferation is typically modelled using a classical logistic equation which neglects variations in the proliferation rate. In this work, we consider a discrete mathematical model of cell migration and cell proliferation, modulated by volume exclusion (crowding) effects, with variable rates of proliferation across the total population. We refer to this variability as heterogeneity. Constructing the continuum limit of the discrete model leads to a generalisation of the classical logistic growth model. Comparing numerical solutions of the model to averaged data from discrete simulations shows that the new model captures the key features of the discrete process. Applying the extended logistic model to simulate a proliferation assay using rates from recent experimental literature shows that neglecting the role of heterogeneity can, at times, lead to misleading results.",

    "abstract": "Chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for adult CF patients. Prolonged infections are accompanied by adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the unique conditions of the CF lung environment as well as marked diversification of the pathogen into phenotypically and genetically distinct strains that can coexist for years within a patient. Little is known, however, about the causes of this diversification and its impact on patient health. Here, we show experimentally that, consistent with ecological theory of diversification, the nutritional conditions of the CF airway can cause rapid and extensive diversification of P. aeruginosa. The increased viscosity associated with the thick mucous layer in the CF airway had little impact on within-population diversification but did promote divergence among populations. Notably, in vitro evolution recapitulated patho-adaptive traits thought to be hallmarks of chronic infection, including reduced motility and increased biofilm formation, and the range of phenotypes observed in a collection of clinical isolates. Our results suggest that nutritional complexity and reduced dispersal can drive evolutionary diversification of P. aeruginosa independent of other features of the CF lung such as an active immune system or the presence of competing microbial species. They also underscore the need to obtain diverse samples of P. aeruginosa when developing treatment plans. We suggest that diversification, by generating extensive phenotypic and genetic variation on which selection can act, may be a key first step in the transition from transient to chronic infection.\\n\\nSignificance StatementChronic infection with the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of lung transplant or death in cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa diversifies in the CF lung, although why this happens remains a mystery. We allowed P. aeruginosa to evolve in the laboratory under a range of conditions approximating the CF lung. The diversity of evolved populations was highest, and most closely resembled the range of phenotypes among clinical isolates, in environments resembling the spectrum of nutritional resources available in the CF lung. Our results point to the nutritional complexity of the CF lung as a major driver of diversification and they suggest that diversity could be important in the development of chronic infections.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are often comorbid and likely to share genetic risk factors. Hence, we examine their shared genetic background using a crossdisorder GWAS meta-analysis of 3,495 AN cases, 2,688 OCD cases and 18,013 controls. We confirmed a high genetic correlation between AN and OCD (rg = 0.49 {+/-} 0.13, p = 9.07x10-7) and a sizable SNP heritability (SNP h2 = 0.21 {+/-} 0.02) for the cross-disorder phenotype. Although no individual loci reached genome-wide significance, the cross-disorder phenotype showed strong positive genetic correlations with other psychiatric phenotypes (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, neuroticism) and negative correlations with metabolic phenotypes (e.g., BMI, triglycerides). Follow-up analyses revealed that although AN and OCD overlap heavily in their shared risk with other psychiatric phenotypes, the relationship with metabolic and anthropometric traits is markedly stronger for AN than for OCD. We further tested whether shared genetic risk for AN/OCD was associated with particular tissue or cell-type gene expression patterns and found that the basal ganglia and medium spiny neurons were most enriched for AN/OCD risk, consistent with neurobiological findings for both disorders. Our results confirm and extend genetic epidemiological findings of shared risk between AN and OCD and suggest that larger GWASs are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of the genetic landscape of Ireland have suggested homogeneity, with population substructure undetectable using single-marker methods. Here we have harnessed the haplotype-based method fineSTRUCTURE in an Irish genome-wide SNP dataset, identifying 23 discrete genetic clusters which segregate with geographical provenance. Cluster diversity is pronounced in the west of Ireland but reduced in the east where older structure has been eroded by historical migrations. Accordingly, when populations from the neighbouring island of Britain are included, a west-east cline of Celtic-British ancestry is revealed along with a particularly striking correlation between haplotypes and geography across both islands. A strong relationship is revealed between subsets of Northern Irish and Scottish populations, where discordant genetic and geographic affinities reflect major migrations in recent centuries. Additionally, Irish genetic proximity of all Scottish samples likely reflects older strata of communication across the narrowest inter-island crossing. Using GLOBETROTTER we detected Irish admixture signals from Britain and Europe and estimated dates for events consistent with the historical migrations of the Norse-Vikings, the Anglo-Normans and the British Plantations. The influence of the former is greater than previously estimated from Y chromosome haplotypes. In all, we paint a new picture of the genetic landscape of Ireland, revealing structure which should be considered in the design of studies examining rare genetic variation and its association with traits.\\n\\nAuthor summaryA recent genetic study of the UK (People of the British Isles; PoBI) expanded our understanding of population history of the islands, using newly-developed, powerful techniques that harness the rich information embedded in chunks of genetic code called haplotypes. These methods revealed subtle regional diversity across the UK, and, using genetic data alone, timed key migration events into southeast England and Orkney. We have extended these methods to Ireland, identifying regional differences in genetics across the island that adhere to geography at a resolution not previously reported. Our study reveals relative western diversity and eastern homogeneity in Ireland owing to a history of settlement concentrated on the east coast and longstanding Celtic diversity in the west. We show that Irish Celtic diversity enriches the findings of PoBI; haplotypes mirror geography across Britain and Ireland, with relic Celtic populations contributing greatly to haplotypic diversity. Finally, we used genetic information to date migrations into Ireland from Europe and Britain consistent with historical records of Viking and Norman invasions, demonstrating the signatures of these migrations the on modern Irish genome. Our findings demonstrate that genetic structure exists in even small isolated populations, which has important implications for population-based genetic association studies.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale population based analyses coupled with advances in technology have demonstrated that the human genome is more diverse than originally thought. To date, this diversity has largely been uncovered using short read whole genome sequencing. However, standard short-read approaches, used primarily due to accuracy, throughput and costs, fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify large, balanced structural events, cannot access repetitive regions of the genome and fail to resolve the human genome into its two haplotypes. Here we describe an approach that retains long range information while harnessing the advantages of short reads. Starting from only [~]1ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries. The use of novel informatic approaches allows for the barcoded short reads to be associated with the long molecules of origin producing a novel datatype known as  Linked-Reads. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single Linked-Read library. We have previously demonstrated the utility of whole genome Linked-Reads (lrWGS) for performing diploid, de novo assembly of individual genomes (Weisenfeld et al. 2017). In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short read approaches for reference based analysis. We demonstrate the ability of Linked-Reads to reconstruct megabase scale haplotypes and to recover parts of the genome that are typically inaccessible to short reads, including phenotypically important genes such as STRC, SMN1 and SMN2. We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone.",

    "abstract": "B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) is an important apoptosis regulator during developmental and pathological states, and its overexpression is a key feature of several malignancies. Genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals significant somatic copy number amplification, overexpression, and/or elevated protein activity of BCL2 in 50 % of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) patients. While its canonical role in mitochondria-directed apoptosis is well established, the effect of BCL2 on transcriptional and metabolic networks remains elusive. Using an established lymphocytic pro-B-cell line overexpressing BCL2, we identified dysregulated transcriptional and metabolic networks by transcriptomic profiling arrays. Elevated BCL2 levels affect transcription factor complexes and mitogenic programs of NF-{kappa}B/REL, HIF1A/ARNT, AP1, E2F, and STAT factors. Using stable isotope-assisted metabolic flux measurements we quantify that elevated BCL2 expression increases carbon utilization boosting cellular proliferation. Tumorigenic overexpression of BCL2 significantly increases glycolytic flux, glutaminolysis, and anaplerotic flux into the TCA cycle. At the same time, the mitochondrial acetyl-CoA pool is separated from the glycolytic one by inactivating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex via transcriptional regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK3). As compensatory fuel, mitochondrial TCA cycle metabolism is supported by asparagine synthase (ASNS) and oxidative glutaminolysis creating targets for small molecule inhibition of glutaminase. Lymphoma cells overexpressing BCL2 contained more mitochondrial mass and were more sensitive to L-glutamine deprivation and glutaminase inhibition. Cells overexpressing a mutant BCL2 G145E, which is incapable of binding BH domain members, failed to increase proliferation, glycolysis, or glutaminolysis. Taken together, the oncogene BCL2 has the ability to ramp up a metabolic phenotype supporting proliferation independent of its anti-apoptotic role. The cellular model of BCL2 activation supports NF-KB-positive subtypes of DLBC and identifies metabolic bottlenecks with dependency on anaplerotic flux as an actionable BCL2 effector network in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a striking ability to infer meaning from even the sparsest and most abstract forms of narratives. At the same time, flexibility in the form of a narrative is matched by inherent ambiguity in the interpretation of it. How does the brain represent subtle, idiosyncratic differences in the interpretation of abstract and ambiguous narratives? In this fMRI study, we scanned subjects watching a 7-min original animation that depicts a complex narrative through the movement of simple geometric shapes. We additionally scanned two separate groups listening to concrete verbal descriptions of either the social narrative or the physical properties of the movie. After scanning, all subjects freely recalled their interpretation of the stimulus. Using an intersubject representational similarity analysis, we compared the similarity of narrative interpretation across subjects, as measured using text analysis, with the similarity of neural responses, as measured using intersubject correlation (ISC). We found that the more similar two peoples interpretations of the abstract shape movie were, the more similar their neural responses were in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, these shared responses were modality invariant: despite vast differences in stimulus properties, we found that the shapes movie and the verbal interpretation of the movie elicited shared responses in linguistic areas and a subset of the DMN when subjects shared interpretations. Together, these results suggest that the DMN is not only sensitive to subtle individual differences in narrative interpretation, but also resilient to large differences in the modality of the narrative.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe same narrative can be both communicated in different ways and interpreted in different ways.

Identifying mechanisms that coordinate neural connections within correct layers is thus vital for understanding how neural circuits are assembled. In the medulla of the Drosophila visual system neurons form connections within ten parallel layers. The M3 layer receives input from two neuron types that sequentially innervate M3 during development. Here we show that M3-specific innervation by both neurons is coordinated by Drosophila Fezf (dFezf), a conserved transcription factor that is selectively expressed by the earlier targeting input neuron. In this cell, dFezf instructs layer specificity and activates the expression of a secreted molecule (Netrin) that regulates the layer specificity of the other input neuron. We propose that employment of transcriptional modules that cell-intrinsically target neurons to specific layers, and cell-extrinsically recruit other neurons is a general mechanism for building layered networks of neural connections.",

Here we sought to provide evidence for the reactivation of a particular visual feature - Gabor orientation. Following extensive training on a visual task, we found robust reactivation in human V1 that lasted at least eight minutes. This effect was not present in higher retinotopic areas such as V2, V3, V3A, or V4v, demonstrating that the effects in V1 are not due to top-down processes such as conscious rehearsal.

We have previously shown, that a complete knockout of a vertebrate brain-specific pair of gene paralogs (Ntng1/2) distorts the mouse EF, making behavior less predictable (more variable) via the affected working memory and attention (1). In the current study, conditionally targeting either serotonin transporter (5-HTT) or Emx1-expressing neurons, we show that the cell type-specific ablation of Ntng1 within the excitatory circuits of either cortex or thalamus does not have a profound impact on the EF but rather affects its certain modalities, i.e. impulsivity and/or selective attention, modulated by cognitive demand. Several mice of both conditional genotypes simultaneously occupy either top or bottom parameter-specific behavioral ranks, indicative of a subject-unique antagonistic either proficit or deficit of function within the same behavior. Employing genotype-attributable behavior variability as a phenotypic trait, we deduce, that Ntng1-parsed excitatory pathways contribute but do not fully reconstitute the attention-impulsivity phenotypes, associated with the mouse EF deficit. However, complete knockdown of Ntng1/2, and associated with it behavior variability, explains the deficit of executive function and task learning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene set scoring provides a useful approach for quantifying concordance between sample transcriptomes and selected molecular signatures. Most methods use information from all samples to score an individual sample, leading to unstable scores in small data sets and introducing biases from sample composition across a data set (e.g. varying numbers of samples for different cancer subtypes). To address these issues we have developed a truly single sample scoring method, and associated R/Bioconductor package singscore.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed a rank-based single sample scoring method, implemented as a Bioconductor package. We use multiple cancer data sets to compare it against widely-used scoring methods, including GSVA, z-scores, PLAGE, and ssGSEA. Our approach does not depend upon background samples and thus the scores are stable regardless of the composition and number of samples in the gene expression data set. In contrast, scores obtained by GSVA, z-score, PLAGE and ssGSEA can be unstable when less data are available (nsamples < 25). We show that the computational time for singscore is faster than current implementations of GSVA and ssGSEA, and is comparable with that of z-score and PLAGE. The singscore package also produces visualisations and interactive plots that enable exploration of molecular phenotypes.\\n\\nConclusionsThe single sample scoring method described here is independent of sample composition in gene expression data and thus it provides stable scores that are less likely to be influenced by unwanted variation across samples. These scores can be used for dimensional reduction of transcriptomic data and the phenotypic landscapes obtained by scoring samples against multiple molecular signatures may provide insights for sample stratification.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of molecular phenotypes such as metabolites, lipids, and proteins through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represents a powerful means of highlighting molecular mechanisms relevant to human diseases. However, a major challenge of this approach is to identify the causal gene(s) at the observed QTLs. Here we present a framework for the \\\"Prioritisation of candidate causal Genes at Molecular QTLs\\\" (ProGeM), which incorporates biological domain-specific annotation data alongside genome annotation data from multiple repositories. We assessed the performance of ProGeM using a reference set of 227 previously reported and extensively curated metabolite QTLs. For 98% of these loci, the expert-curated gene was one of the candidate causal genes prioritised by ProGeM. Benchmarking analyses revealed that 69% of the causal candidates were nearest to the sentinel variant at the investigated molecular QTLs, indicating that genomic proximity is the most reliable indicator of \\\"true positive\\\" causal genes. In contrast, cis-gene expression QTL data led to three false positive candidate causal gene assignments for every one true positive assignment. We provide evidence that these conclusions also apply to other molecular phenotypes, suggesting that ProGeM is a powerful and versatile tool for annotating molecular QTLs. ProGeM is freely available via GitHub.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies can rapidly evolve in specific response to antigens. Affinity maturation drives this evolution through cycles of mutation and selection leading to enhanced antibody specificity and affinity. Elucidating the biophysical mechanisms that underlie affinity maturation is fundamental to understanding B-cell immunity. An emergent hypothesis is that affinity maturation reduces the conformational flexibility of the antibodys antigen-binding paratope to minimize entropic losses incurred upon binding. In recent years, computational and experimental approaches have tested this hypothesis on a small number of antibodies, often observing a decrease in the flexibility of the Complementarity Determining Region (CDR) loops that typically comprise the paratope and in particular the CDR-H3 loop, which contributes a plurality of antigen contacts. However, there were a few exceptions, and previous studies were limited to a small handful of cases. Here, we determined the structural flexibility of the CDR-H3 loop for thousands of recently-determined homology models of the human peripheral blood cell antibody repertoire using rigidity theory. We found no clear delineation in the flexibility of naive and antigen-experienced antibodies. To account for possible sources of error, we additionally analyzed hundreds of human and mouse antibodies in the Protein Data Bank through both rigidity theory and B-factor analysis. By both metrics, we observed only a slight decrease in the CDR-H3 loop flexibility when comparing affinity-matured antibodies to naive antibodies, and the decrease was not as drastic as previously reported. Further analysis, incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed a spectrum of changes in flexibility. Our results suggest that rigidification may be just one of many biophysical mechanisms for increasing affinity.",

    "abstract": "In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the Mid-Blastula Transition, MBT. In Drosophila melanogaster embryos, downregulation of Cdk1 activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 inhibited the chromatin association of Rif1, a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 downregulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase, and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase-promoting kinase, Cdc7. Thus, Drosophila Rif1 mediates the MBT extension of S phase and functionally interacts with S phase promoting kinases to introduce a replication-timing program.",

    "abstract": "Galaxias maculatus is a riparian spawning fish that supports an important recreational fishery in New Zealand with spawning habitat requirements strongly structured by salinity gradients at rivermouths. This study reports changes to the spawning habitat following a series of large earthquakes that resulted in widespread deformation of ground surfaces in the vicinity of waterways. Assessments of habitat recovery focussed on two rivers systems, the Avon and Heathcote, with pre-disturbance data available over a 20 year period. Recovery dynamics were assessed by field survey and mapping of spawning habitat prior to and on seven occasions after the disturbance event. Riparian land-use and management patterns were mapped and analysed using overlay methods in GIS. Habitat migration of up to 2 km occurred in comparison to all previous records and several anthropogenic land uses have become threats due to changed patterns of co-occurrence. Incompatible activities now affect more than half of the spawning habitat in both rivers, particularly in areas managed for flood control purposes and recreational use. The results are an example of landscape scale responses to salinity and water level changes driven by tectonic dynamics. These dynamics are not the source of the stress per se, rather, they have increased exposure to pre-existing stressors. The case illustrates important principles for managing subtle, yet widespread, change. Adaptive conservation methods and investments in information are priorities for avoiding management failure following environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus epidemics transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have recently (re)emerged and spread throughout the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and elsewhere. Understanding how environmental conditions affect epidemic dynamics is critical for predicting and responding to the geographic and seasonal spread of disease. Specifically, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how seasonal variation in temperature affects epidemic magnitude and duration. Here, we develop a dynamic disease transmission model for dengue virus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that integrates mechanistic, empirically parameterized, and independently validated mosquito and virus trait thermal responses under seasonally varying temperatures. We examine the influence of seasonal temperature mean, variation, and temperature at the start of the epidemic on disease dynamics. We find that at both constant and seasonally varying temperatures, warmer temperatures at the start of epidemics promote more rapid epidemics due to faster burnout of the susceptible population. By contrast, intermediate temperatures (24-25{degrees}C) at epidemic onset produced the largest epidemics in both constant and seasonally varying temperature regimes. When seasonal temperature variation was low, 25-35{degrees}C annual average temperatures produced the largest epidemics, but this range shifted to cooler temperatures as seasonal temperature variation increased (analogous to previous results for diurnal temperature variation). Tropical and sub-tropical cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Fortaleza, and Salvador, Brazil; Cali, Cartagena, and Barranquilla, Colombia; Delhi, India; Guangzhou, China; and Manila, Philippines have mean annual temperatures and seasonal temperature ranges that produced the largest epidemics. However, more temperate cities like Shanghai, China had high epidemic suitability because large seasonal variation offset moderate annual average temperatures. By accounting for seasonal variation in temperature, the model provides a baseline for mechanistically understanding environmental suitability for virus transmission by Aedes aegypti. Overlaying the impact of human activities and socioeconomic factors onto this mechanistic temperature-dependent framework is critical for understanding likelihood and magnitude of outbreaks.\\n\\nNon-Technical SummaryMosquito-borne viruses like dengue, Zika, and chikungunya have recently caused large epidemics that are partly driven by temperature. Using a mathematical model built from laboratory experimental data for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and dengue virus, we examine the impact of variation in seasonal temperature regimes on epidemic size and duration. At constant temperatures, both low and high temperatures (20{degrees}C and 35{degrees}C) produce small epidemics, while intermediate temperatures like 25{degrees}C and 30{degrees}C produce much larger epidemics. In seasonally varying temperature environments, epidemics peak more rapidly at higher starting temperatures, while intermediate starting temperatures produce the largest epidemics. Seasonal mean temperatures of 25-35{degrees}C are most suitable for large epidemics when seasonality is low, but in more variable seasonal environments epidemic suitability peaks at lower annual average temperatures. Tropical and sub-tropical cities have the highest temperature suitability for epidemics, but more temperate cities with high seasonal variation also have the potential for very large epidemics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAedes aegypti is a primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and urban yellow fever viruses. Indoor, ultra low volume (ULV) space spraying with pyrethroid insecticides is the main approach used for Ae. aegypti emergency control in many countries. Given the widespread use of this method, the lack of large-scale experiments or detailed evaluations of municipal spray programs is problematic.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsTwo experimental evaluations of non-residual, indoor ULV pyrethroid spraying were conducted in Iquitos, Peru. In each, a central sprayed sector was surrounded by an unsprayed buffer sector. In 2013, spray and buffer sectors included 398 and 765 houses, respectively. Spraying reduced the mean number of adults captured per house by ~83 percent relative to the pre-spray baseline survey. In the 2014 experiment, sprayed and buffer sectors included 1,117 and 1,049 houses, respectively. Here, the sprayed sectors number of adults per house was reduced ~64 percent relative to baseline. Parity surveys in the sprayed sector during the 2014 spray period indicated an increase in the proportion of very young females. We also evaluated impacts of a 2014 citywide spray program by the local Ministry of Health, which reduced adult populations by ~60 percent. In all cases, adult densities returned to near-baseline levels within one month.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results demonstrate that densities of adult Ae. aegypti can be reduced by experimental and municipal spraying programs. The finding that adult densities return to approximately pre-spray densities in less than a month is similar to results from previous, smaller scale experiments. Our results demonstrate that ULV spraying is best viewed as having a short-term entomological effect. The epidemiological impact of ULV spraying will need evaluation in future trials that measure capacity of insecticide spraying to reduce disease transmission.",

    "abstract": "Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) is a viral disease that affects cattle and that is endemic to many European countries. It has a markedly negative impact on the economy, through reduced milk production, abortions, and a shorter lifespan of the infected animals. Cows becoming infected during gestation may give birth to Persistently Infected (PI) calves, which remain highly infective throughout their life, due to the lack of immune response to the virus. As a result, they are the key driver of the persistence of the disease both at herd scale, and at the national level. In the latter case, the trade-driven movements of PIs, or gestating cows carrying PIs, are responsible for the spatial dispersion of BVD. Past modeling approaches to BVD transmission have either focused on within-herd or between-herd transmission. A comprehensive portrayal, however, targeting both the generation of PIs within a herd, and their displacement throughout the Country due to trade transactions, is still missing. We overcome this by designing a multiscale metapopulation model of the spatial transmission of BVD, accounting for both within-herd infection dynamics, and its spatial dispersion. We focus on Italy, a country where BVD is endemic and seroprevalence is very high. By integrating simple within-herd dynamics of PI generation, and the highly-resolved cattle movement dataset available, our model requires minimal arbitrary assumptions on its parameterization. Notwithstanding, it accurately captures the dynamics of the BVD epidemic, as demonstrated by the comparison with available prevalence data. We use our model to study the role of the different productive realities of the Italian market, and test possible intervention strategies aimed at prevalence reduction. We find that dairy farms are the main drivers of BVD persistence in Italy, and any control strategy targeting these farms would lead to significantly higher prevalence reduction, with respect to targeting other production compartments. Our multiscale metapopulation model is a simple yet effective tool for studying BVD dispersion and persistence at country level, and is a good instrument for testing targeted strategies aimed at the containment or elimination of this disease. Furthermore, it can readily be applied to any national market for which cattle movement data is available.",

While in some SEA countries the epidemiology of MBVs is spatio-temporally well characterised and understood, in others such as Myanmar our understanding is largely incomplete. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we use a simple mathematical approach to estimate a climate-driven suitability index aiming to better characterise the intrinsic, spatio-temporal potential of MBVs in Myanmar. RESULTS: Results show that the timing and amplitude of the natural oscillations of our suitability index are highly informative for the temporal patterns of DENV case counts at the country level, and a mosquito-abundance measure at a city level. When projected at fine spatial scales, the suitability index suggests that the time period of highest MBV transmission potential is between June and October independently of geographical location. Higher potential is nonetheless found along the middle axis of the country and in particular in the southern corridor of international borders with Thailand. DISCUSSION: This research complements and expands our current understanding of MBV transmission potential in Myanmar, by identifying key spatial heterogeneities and temporal windows of importance for surveillance and control. We discuss our findings in the context of Zika virus given its recent worldwide emergence, public health impact, and current lack of information on its epidemiology and transmission potential in Myanmar. The proposed suitability index here demonstrated is applicable to other regions of the world for which surveillance data is missing, either due to lack of resources or absence of an MBV of interest.",

    "abstract": "In some chikugunya epidemics, deaths are not fully captured by the traditional surveillance system, based on case reports and death reports. This is a time series study to evaluate the excess of mortality associated with epidemic of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Guadeloupe and Martinique, Antilles, 2014. The population (total 784,097 inhabitants) and mortality data estimated by sex and age were accessed at the Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques - France. Age adjusted mortality rates were calculated also in Reunion, Indian Ocean for comparison. Epidemiological data on CHIKV (cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) were obtained in the official epidemiological reports of the Cellule de Institut de Veille Sanitaire - France. The excess of deaths for each month in 2014 and 2015 was the difference between the expected and observed deaths for all age groups, considering the 99% confidence interval threshold. Pearson coefficient of correlation between monthly excess of deaths and reported cases of chikungunya show a strong correlation (R = 0.81, p <0.005), also with a 1-month lag (R = 0.87, p <0.001), and between monthly rates of hospitalization for CHIKV and the excess of deaths with a delay of 1 month (R = 0.87, p <0.0005).The peak of the epidemic occurred in the month with the highest mortality, returning to normal soon after the end of the CHIKV epidemic. The overall mortality estimated by this method (639 deaths) was about 4 times greater than that obtained through death declarations (160 deaths). Excess mortality increased with age. Although etiological diagnosis of all deaths associated with CHIKV infection is not possible, already well-known statistical tools can contribute to an evaluation of the impact of this virus on the mortality and morbidity in the different age groups.",

    "abstract": "Several human pathogens exhibit distinct patterns of seasonality and circulate as pairs of discrete strains. For instance, the activity of the two co-circulating influenza A virus subtypes oscillates and peaks during winter seasons of the worlds temperate climate zones. These periods of increased activity are usually caused by a single dominant subtype. Alternation of dominant strains in successive influenza seasons makes epidemic forecasting a major challenge. From the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic we enrolled influenza A virus infected patients (n = 2,980) in a global prospective clinical study. Complete hemagglutinin (HA) sequences were obtained from 1,078 A/H1N1 and 1,033 A/H3N2 viruses and were linked to patient data. We then used phylodynamics to construct high resolution spatio-temporal phylogenetic HA trees and estimated global influenza A effective reproductive numbers (R) over time (2009-2013). We demonstrate that R, a parameter to define host immunity, oscillates around R = 1 with a clear opposed alternation pattern between phases of the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes. Moreover, we find a similar alternation pattern for the number of global virus migration events between the sampled geographical locations. Both observations suggest a between-strain competition for susceptible hosts on a global level. Extrinsic factors that affect person-to-person transmission are a major driver of influenza seasonality, which forces influenza epidemics to coincide with winter seasons. The data presented here indicate that also cross-reactive host immunity is a key intrinsic driver of global influenza seasonality, which determines the outcome of competition between influenza A virus strains at the onset of each epidemic season.\\n\\nSignificance statementAnnual influenza epidemics coincide with winter seasons in many parts of the world. Environmental factors, such as air humidity variation or temperature change, are commonly believed to drive these seasonality patterns. Interestingly, three out of the four latest pandemics (1918, 1968 and 2009) did not spread in winter initially, but during summer. This questions to what extent other factors could also impact virus spread among humans. We demonstrate that cross-reactive host immunity is a key factor. It drives the well-known seasonal patterns of virus activity oscillation and alternation of the dominant influenza virus subtype in successive seasons. Furthermore, this factor may also explain the efficient spread of pandemic viruses during summer when cross-reactive host immunity is relatively low.",

    "abstract": "Complex multicellularity comprises the most advanced level of organization evolved on Earth. It has evolved only a few times in metazoans, green plants, brown and red algae and fungi. Compared to other lineages, the evolution of multicellularity in fungi follows different principles; both simple and complex multicellularity evolved via unique mechanisms not seen in other lineages. In this article we review ecological, paleontological, developmental and genomic aspects of complex multicellularity in fungi and discuss the general principles of the evolution of complex multicellularity in light of its fungal manifestations. Fungi represent the only lineage in which complex multicellularity shows signatures of convergent evolution: it appears 8-12 distinct fungal lineages, which show a patchy phylogenetic distribution, yet share some of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex multicellular development. To mechanistically explain the patchy distribution of complex multicellularity across the fungal tree of life we identify four key observations that need to be considered: the large number of apparently independent complex multicellular clades; the lack of documented phenotypic homology between these; the universal conservation of gene circuits regulating the onset of complex multicellular development; and the existence of clades in which the evolution of complex multicellularity is coupled with limited gene family diversification. We discuss how these patterns and known genetic aspects of fungal development can be reconciled with the genetic theory of convergent evolution to explain its pervasive occurrence in across the fungal tree of life.",

    "abstract": "Amdoparvoviruses (family Parvoviridae: genus Amdoparvovirus) infect carnivores, and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in farmed animals. In this study, we systematically screened animal genomes to identify PVe disclosing a high degree of similarity to amdoparvoviruses, and investigated their genomic, phylogenetic and protein structural features. We report the first examples of full-length, amdoparvovirus-derived PVe in the genome of the Transcaucasian mole vole (Ellobius lutescens). Furthermore, we identify four further PVe in mammal and reptile genomes that are intermediate between amdoparvoviruses and their sister genus (Protoparvovirus) in terms of their phylogenetic placement and genomic features. In particular, we identify a genome-length PVe in the genome of a pit viper (Protobothrops mucrosquamatus) that is more like a protoparvovirus than an amdoparvovirus in terms of its phylogenetic placement and the structural features of its capsid protein (as revealed by homology modeling), yet exhibits characteristically amdoparvovirus-like genome features including: (i) a putative middle ORF gene; (ii) a capsid gene that lacks a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) domain; (iii) a genome structure consistent with an amdoparvovirus-like mechanism of capsid gene expression. Our findings indicate that amdoparvovirus host range has extended to rodents in the past, and that parvovirus lineages possessing a mixture of proto- and amdoparvovirus-like characteristics have circulated in the past. In addition, we show that PVe in the mole vole and pit viper encode intact, expressible replicase genes that have potentially been co-opted or exapted in these host species.",

This study aimed to investigate in UK Biobank the association between APOE e4 allele presence vs. absence and brain imaging variables that have been associated with worse cognitive abilities; and whether this association varies by cross-sectional age. We used brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic data from a general-population cohort: the UK Biobank (N=8,395). We adjusted for the covariates of age in years, sex, Townsend social deprivation scores, smoking history and cardiometabolic diseases. There was a statistically significant association between APOE e4 genotype and increased (i.e. worse) white matter (WM) hyperintensity volumes (standardised beta = 0.088, 95 confidence intervals = 0.036 to 0.139, P = 0.001), a marker of poorer cerebrovascular health. There were no associations with left or right hippocampal, total grey matter (GM) or WM volumes, or WM tract integrity indexed by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). There were no statistically significant interactions with age.

To address this problem, we developed Epi-Decoder, a Tag-ChIP-Barcode-Seq technology in budding yeast to identify and quantify in an unbiased and systematic manner the proteome of an individual genomic locus. Epi-Decoder is orthogonal to proteomics approaches because it does not rely on mass spectrometry but instead takes advantage of DNA sequencing. Analysis of the proteome of a transcribed locus proximal to an origin of replication revealed more than 400 proteins. Moreover, replication stress induced changes in local chromatin-proteome composition prior to local origin firing, affecting replication proteins as well as transcription proteins. Epi-Decoder will enable the delineation of complex and dynamic protein-DNA interactions across many regions of the genome.",

We found 29 gene associations in peripheral monocytes, and 44 gene associations whose expression or differential splicing in prefrontal cortex is associated with PD. This includes many novel genes but also known associations such as MAPT, for which we found that variation in exon 3 splicing explains the common genetic association. Genes identified in our analyses are more likely to interact physically with known PD genes and belong to the same or related pathways including lysosomal and innate immune function. Overall, our study provides a strong foundation for further mechanistic studies that will elucidate the molecular drivers of PD.",

Here we show that acute exposure to antiseptic treatments elicits rapid but short-term depletion of microbial community diversity and membership. Thirteen subjects were enrolled in a longitudinal treatment study to analyze the effects of topical treatments (ethanol, povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, water) on the skin microbiome at two skin sites of disparate microenvironment: forearm and back. Treatment effects were highly dependent on personalized and body site-specific colonization signatures, which concealed community dynamics at the population level when not accounted for in this analysis. The magnitude of disruption was influenced by the identity and abundance of particular bacterial inhabitants. Lowly abundant members of the skin microbiota were more likely to be displaced, and subsequently replaced by the most abundant taxa prior to treatment. Members of the skin commensal family Propionibactericeae were particularly resilient to treatment, suggesting a distinct competitive advantage in the face of disturbance. These results provide insight into the stability and resilience of the skin microbiome, while establishing the impact of topical antiseptic treatment on skin bacterial dynamics and community ecology.",

MurJ septal localization is dependent on the presence of a complete and active divisome, lipid II synthesis and PBP3/FtsW activities.

We found that the Pandoraviridae exhibit an open pan genome, the enormous size of which is not adequately explained by gene duplications or horizontal transfers.

It is well known that the microorganisms play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of different elements. However, the precise role of bacteria in regulating the concentration of arsenic in Brahmaputra valley has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we report the isolation of arsenic resistant bacterium TA6 with active arsenate reduction efficiency. The isolate was able to grow in arsenate concentration (250 mM) and arsenite (30 mM). Along with resistance to inorganic arsenic, it showed cross-tolerance to other heavy metals like Hg+2, Cd+2, Co+2, Ni+2, Cr+2. The bacterium also had a high siderophore activity (78.7 {+/-} 0.004 mol), which is positively correlated with the resistance aptitude. The biochemical test showed the TA6, a gram-positive bacterium which can hydrolyze starch and casein, produce catalase enzyme and utilizes citrate as a metabolic trait. Molecular and chemotaxonomic identification of TA6 based on 16S rRNA and FMAE analysis showed similarity with members of Staphylococcus genus with significant difference in sequence similarity and fatty acid composition. Based on 16S rRNA and FAME analysis it was identified as Staphylococcus sp. TA6. Rate of biotransformation showed bacterium could reduce ~88.2% of initial 2mM As(V) into As(III).

The brain contains a number of spatially tuned neurons coding for various navigational variables, but current models do not explain how these circuits could implement navigational computations that involve non-trivial spatial reasoning. We show, using a function-first approach, that neural circuits trained to efficiently solve spatial reasoning problems with performance on par with sequential probabilistic strategies reproduce some key properties of hippocampal coding, including heterogeneous tuning, conjunctive tuning, and low-dimensional dynamics. In addition, the models predict the emergence of tuning to key latent variables that are neither present in the input data nor trained as the end result of the task, and exhibit a spontaneous dynamical reconfiguration of tuning across time during a task as the computational demands evolve, reminiscent of some of the more complex dynamics observed in the hippocampus including a switch between location and displacement coding modes.

However, the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in Parkinsons disease (PD) is not directly related to vascular causes, and therefore the role of WMHs in PD remains unclear. If WMH has a higher impact on cognitive decline in PD, vascular pathology should be assessed and treated with a higher priority in this population. Here we investigate whether WMH leads to increased cognitive decline in PD, and if these effects relate to cortical thinning\\n\\nMethodsTo investigate the role of WMHs in PD, it is essential to study recently-diagnosed/non-treated patients. De novo PD patients and age-matched controls (NPD=365,NControl=174) with FLAIR/T2-weighted scans at baseline were selected from Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). WMHs and cortical thickness were measured to analyse the relationship between baseline WMHs and future cognitive decline (follow-up:4.09{+/-}1.14 years) and cortical thinning (follow-up:1.05{+/-}0.10 years).\\n\\nResultsHigh WMH load (WMHL) at baseline in PD was associated with increased cognitive decline, significantly more than i) PDs with low WMHL and ii) controls with high WMHL. Furthermore, PD patients with higher baseline WMHL showed more cortical thinning in right frontal lobe than subjects with low WMHL. Cortical thinning of this region also predicted decline in performance on a cognitive test.\\n\\nInterpretationPresence of WMHs in de novo PD patients predicts greater future cognitive decline and cortical thinning than in normal aging. Recognizing WMHs as a potential predictor of cognitive deficit in PD provides an opportunity for timely interventions.",

    "abstract": "Social information is highly intrinsically relevant for the human species because of its direct link to guiding physiological responses and behavior. Accordingly, extant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data suggest that social content may form a unique stimulus dimension. It remains largely unknown, however, how neural activity underlying social (versus nonsocial) information processing temporally unfolds, and how such social information appraisal may interact with the processing of other stimulus characteristics, particularly emotional meaning. Here, we presented complex visual scenes differing in both social (versus nonsocial) and emotional relevance (positive, negative, neutral) intermixed with scrambled versions of these pictures to N= 24 healthy young adults. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to intact pictures were examined for gaining insight to the dynamics of appraisal of both dimensions, implemented within the brain. Our main finding is an early interaction between social and emotional relevance due to enhanced amplitudes of early ERP components to emotionally positive pictures of social compared to nonsocial content, presumably reflecting rapid allocation of attention and counteracting an overall negativity bias. Importantly, our ERP data show high similarity with previously observed fMRI data using the same stimuli, and source estimations located the ERP effects in overlapping occipito-temporal brain areas. Our new data suggest that relevance detection may occur already as early as around 100 ms after stimulus onset and may combine relevance checks not only examining intrinsic pleasantness/emotional valence, but also social content as a unique, highly relevant stimulus dimension.",

    "abstract": "Grid cells in freely behaving mammals are defined by the strikingly regular periodic spatial distribution of their firing. The standard method of identification calculates the \\\"Gridness\\\" of the spatial firing pattern, with significance being defined relative to the 95th percentile of a null distribution of the Gridness values found after randomly permuting spike times relative to behaviour. We determined the false-positive rate by applying the method to simulated firing with irregular spatially inhomogeneity (i.e. randomly distributed Gaussian patches). We found surprisingly high false positive rates (potentially approaching 20%), which were strongly dependent on the type of Gridness measure used and the number of spatial fields in the synthetic data. This likely reflects the spatial homogeneity of the distributions of spikes after shuffling compared to the inhomogeneous synthetic data. However, false positive rates were reduced (generally below 8%), and less dependent on other factors, when an alternative spatial field shuffling method was used to generate the null Gridness distribution. For comparison, we analysed single unit recordings made using tetrodes implanted into rat medial entorhinal cortex for the purpose of finding grid cells. We found 24% of active neurons were classified as grid cells via spike shuffling and 22% via field shuffling. These results, and the potentially high false-positive rate when classifying cells with patchy but irregular firing as grid cells, indicate that the proportion of cells with regular grid-like firing patterns can be over-estimated by standard methods.",

Using large databases of natural images we trained a deep convolutional generative adversarial network capable of generating gray scale photos, similar to stimUli presented during two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. Using a linear model we learned to predict the generative models latent space from measured brain activity. The objective was to create an image similar to the presented stimulus image through the previously trained generator. Using this approach we were able to reconstruct structural and some semantic features of a proportion of the natural images sets. A behavioral test showed that subjects were capable of identifying a reconstruction of the original stimuhis in 67.2% and 66.4% of the cases in a pairwise comparison for the two natural image datasets respectively. our approach does not require end-to-end training of a large generative model on limited neuroimaging data.

    "abstract": "Human movement and its associated performance are bounded by a hierarchy of constraints operating over certain control variables. One such variable of both physiological and behavioural importance is the mechanical effort exerted by the participating elements. Here, we explored how motor performance is affected by the distribution of work, and consequently the effort.\\n\\nUsing human hand as a model, we employed a visuomotor tracking task to study the associated motor performance when mechanical effort exerted by the fingers are modulated. The subject has to trace a set of ideal paths provided on visual feedback screen to reach a target through a cursor controlled by index and little finger forces. Modulation of these forces allows us to see how the perceived effort requirement affects the tracking performance. In this task demanding two-element coordination, we represent index finger as the independent/dominant element against little finger as the dependent/subjugate counterpart. We study how increasing mechanical effort contribution from the independent element leads to changes in both behaviour and performance.\\n\\nWe found that despite higher mechanical requirements of employing index finger to produce larger absolute force, the movement control system continues to prefer it as against little finger which could have produced smaller absolute force. Moreover, the observation of better tracking performance under larger contributions from the independent component reflects to a plausible hierarchy of constraints employed in the motor control system that operates with more than one objective, energy minimisation per se. At least for the behaviour in study, the improved motor performance suggests that the control system prefers higher independence of the participating elements.",

Administration of the small-molecule GLO1 inhibitor S-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG) decreased alcohol drinking in nondependent mice, suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy. However, the preclinical therapeutic efficacy of pBBG in animal models of alcohol dependence remains to be demonstrated. We tested the effect of pBBG (7.5 and 25 mg/kg) on operant alcohol self-administration in alcohol-dependent and nondependent rats. Wistar rats were trained to self-administer 10% alcohol (v/v) and made dependent by chronic intermittent passive exposure to alcohol vapor for 5 weeks. Pretreatment with pBBG dose-dependently reduced alcohol self-administration in both nondependent and dependent animals, without affecting water self-administration. pBBG treatment was more effective in dependent rats than in nondependent rats. These data extend previous findings that implicated Glo1 in alcohol drinking in nondependent mice by showing even more profound effects in alcohol-dependent rats. These results suggest that the pharmacological inhibition of GLO1 is a relevant therapeutic target for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIAlcohol use disorder (AUD) places an enormous burden on society, and there is an urgent need for new druggable targets.\\nC_LIO_LIGlo1 inhibition by pBBG dose-dependently reduces alcohol self-administration in both nondependent and dependent animals.\\nC_LIO_LIpBBG treatment is more effective in reducing alcohol intake in dependent rats than in nondependent rats.\\nC_LI",

However existing accounts fail to clarify: i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterizing how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modeling revealed that this was due not to weaker prior expectations but to more precise sensory representations.",

This has motivated more detailed computations, using new information about the nature of supernovae and the distances of these events to describe in more detail the sorts of effects that are indicated at the Earth. This short communication/review is designed to describe some of these effects so that they may possibly be related to changes in the biota around these times.\\n\\nSummaryIt has been known for some time that moderately nearby supernovae may have substantial effects on the Earth. Events at {small tilde}150 light years will happen on average every few Myr, but will tend to happen in groups, with long periods between with no events. The effects of cosmic rays from such events appears to be greater than estimated previously. Ozone depletion and the increase of hazardous UVB continues to be important, but new effects come to the fore. Muon irradiation on the ground and hundreds of meters down into the ocean will increase cancer and mutation rates, the differences being most notable in terrestrial megafauna and benthic organisms. Typically larger organisms live long enough to develop cancer; in microorganisms the primary effects would be associated with mutation rates. Atmospheric ionization in the troposphere will greatly increase lightning rates, with a concomitant increase in the rate of wildfires.",

    "abstract": "In quantitative analyses of biological processes, one may use many different scales of models (e.g., spatial or non-spatial, deterministic or stochastic, time-varying or at steady-state) or many different approaches to match models to experimental data (e.g., model fitting or parameter uncertainty/sloppiness quantification with different experiment designs). These different analyses can lead to surprisingly different results, even when applied to the same data and the same model. We use a simplified gene regulation model to illustrate many of these concerns, especially for ODE analyses of deterministic processes, chemical master equation and finite state projection analyses of heterogeneous processes, and stochastic simulations. For each analysis, we employ MO_SCPLOWATLABC_SCPLOW and PO_SCPLOWYTHONC_SCPLOW software to consider a time-dependent input signal (e.g., a kinase nuclear translocation) and several model hypotheses, along with simulated single-cell data. We illustrate different approaches (e.g., deterministic and stochastic) to identify the mechanisms and parameters of the same model from the same simulated data. For each approach, we explore how uncertainty in parameter space varies with respect to the chosen analysis approach or specific experiment design. We conclude with a discussion of how our simulated results relate to the integration of experimental and computational investigations to explore signal-activated gene expression models in yeast [1] and human cells [2]{ddagger}.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.10.+e, 87.15.Aa, 05.10.Gg, 05.40.Ca,02.50.-r\\n\\nSubmitted to: Phys.

To better understand the cell-type specific regulatory landscape of human melanocytes, which give rise to melanoma but account for <5% of typical human skin biopsies, we performed an eQTL analysis in primary melanocyte cultures from 106 newborn males. We identified 597,335 cis-eQTL SNPs prior to LD-pruning and 4,997 eGenes (FDR<0.05), which are higher numbers than in any GTEx tissue type with a similar sample size. Melanocyte eQTLs differed considerably from those identified in the 44 GTEx tissues, including skin. Over a third of melanocyte eGenes, including key genes in melanin synthesis pathways, were not observed to be eGenes in two types of GTEx skin tissues or TCGA melanoma samples. The melanocyte dataset also identified cell-type specific trans-eQTLs with a pigmentation-associated SNP for four genes, likely through its cis-regulation of IRF4, encoding a transcription factor implicated in human pigmentation phenotypes. Melanocyte eQTLs are enriched in cis-regulatory signatures found in melanocytes as well as melanoma-associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Co-localization of melanoma GWAS variants and eQTLs from melanocyte and skin eQTL datasets identified candidate melanoma susceptibility genes for six known GWAS loci including unique genes identified by the melanocyte dataset. Further, a transcriptome-wide association study using published melanoma GWAS data uncovered four new loci, where imputed expression levels of five genes (ZFP90, HEBP1, MSC, CBWD1, and RP11-383H13.1) were associated with melanoma at genome-wide significant P-values. Our data highlight the utility of lineage-specific eQTL resources for annotating GWAS findings and present a robust database for genomic research of melanoma risk and melanocyte biology.",

However, the limitations of inhibitory optogenetic tools impose stringent constraints on experimental paradigms. The high light power requirement of light-driven ion pumps and their effects on intracellular ion homeostasis pose unique challenges, particularly in experiments that demand inhibition of a widespread neuronal population in vivo. Guillardia theta anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (GtACRs) are promising in this regard, due to their high single-channel conductance and favorable photon-ion stoichiometry. However, GtACRs show poor membrane targeting in mammalian cells, and the activity of such channels can cause transient excitation in the axon due to an excitatory chloride reversal potential in this compartment. Here we address both problems by enhancing membrane targeting and subcellular compartmentalization of GtACRs. The resulting GtACR-based optogenetic tools show improved photocurrents, greatly reduced axonal excitation, high light sensitivity and rapid kinetics, allowing highly efficient inhibition of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is one of the most widely used methods to measure gene expression. Despite extensive research in qPCR laboratory protocols, normalization, and statistical analysis, little attention has been given to qPCR non-detects - those reactions failing to produce a minimum amount of signal. While most current software replaces these non-detects with a value representing the limit of detection, recent work suggests that this introduces substantial bias in estimation of both absolute and differential expression. Recently developed single imputation procedures, while better than previously used methods, underestimate residual variance, which can lead to anti-conservative inference. We propose to treat non-detects as non-random missing data, model the missing data mechanism, and use this model to impute missing values or obtain direct estimates of relevant model parameters. To account for the uncertainty inherent in the imputation, we propose a multiple imputation procedure, which provides a set of plausible values for each non-detect. In the proposed modeling framework, there are three sources of uncertainty: parameter estimation, the missing data mechanism, and measurement error. All three sources of variability are incorporated in the multiple imputation and direct estimation algorithms. We demonstrate the applicability of these methods on three real qPCR data sets and perform an extensive simulation study to assess model sensitivity to misspecification of the missing data mechanism, to the number of replicates within the sample, and to the overall size of the data set. The proposed methods result in unbiased estimates of the model parameters; therefore, these approaches may be beneficial when estimating both absolute and differential gene expression. The developed methods are implemented in the R/Bioconductor package nondetects. The statistical methods introduced here reduce discrepancies in gene expression values derived from qPCR experiments, providing more confidence in generating scientific hypotheses and performing downstream analysis.",

    "abstract": "Macromolecular complexes are intrinsically flexible and often challenging to purify for structure determination by single particle cryoEM. Such complexes may be studied in situ using cryo-electron tomography combined with sub-tomogram alignment and classification, which in exceptional cases reaches sub-nanometer resolution, yielding insight into structure-function relationships. All maps currently deposited in the EMDB with resolution < 9 [A] are from macromolecules that form ordered structural arrays, like viral capsids, which greatly simplifies structural determination. Extending this approach to more common specimens that exhibit conformational or compositional heterogeneity, and may be available in limited numbers, remains challenging. We developed emClarity, a GPU-accelerated image processing package, specifically to address fundamental hurdles to this aim, and demonstrate significant improvements in the resolution of maps compared to those generated using current state-of-the-art software. Furthermore, we devise a novel approach to sub-tomogram classification that reveals functional states not previously observed with the same data.\\n\\nThe software is freely available from https://www.github.com/bHimes/emClarity\\n\\nTutorial documentation and videos at https://www.github.com/bHimes/emClarity/wiki",

    "abstract": "Acquired resistance to carboplatin is a major obstacle to the cure of ovarian cancer, but its molecular underpinnings are still poorly understood and often inconsistent between in vitro modeling studies. Using sequential treatment cycles, multiple clones derived from a single ovarian cancer cell reached similar levels of resistance. The resistant clones showed significant transcriptional heterogeneity, with shared repression of cell cycle processes and induction of IFN response signaling, and subsequent pharmacological inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway led to a general increase in carboplatin sensitivity. Gene-expression based virtual synchronization of 26,772 single cells from 2 treatment steps and 4 resistant clones was used to evaluate the activity of Hallmark gene sets in proliferative (P) and quiescent (Q) phases. Two behaviors were associated with resistance: 1) broad repression in the P phase observed in all clones in early resistant steps and 2) prevalent induction in Q phase observed in the late treatment step of one clone. Furthermore, the induction of IFN response in P phase or Wnt-signaling in Q phase were observed in distinct resistant clones. These observations suggest a model of resistance hysteresis, where functional alterations of the P and Q phase states affect the dynamics of the successive transitions between drug exposure and recovery, and prompts for a precise monitoring of single-cell states to develop more effective schedules for, or combination of, chemotherapy treatments.",

    "abstract": "Our goal was to fine map a mouse QTL for lean body mass (Burly1) using information from several populations including newly created congenic mice derived from the B6 (host) and 129 (donor) strains. The results from each mapping population were concordant and showed that Burly1 is likely a single QTL in a 0.8-Mb region at 151.9-152.7 Mb (rs33197365 to rs3700604) on mouse chromosome 2. Results from mice of all the mapping populations we studied including intercrossed, backcrossed, consomic, and congenic strains indicate that lean body mass was increased by the B6-derived allele relative to the 129-derived allele. We determined that the congenic region harboring Burly1 contains 26 protein-coding genes, 11 noncoding RNA elements (e.g., lncRNA), and 4 pseudogenes, with 1949 predicted functional variants. The effect of the Burly1 locus on lean body weight was apparent at all ages measured and did not affect food intake or locomotor activity. However, congenic mice with the B6-allele produced more heat per kilogram of lean body weight than did controls, pointing to a genotype effect on lean mass metabolism. These results show the value of integrating information from several mapping populations to refine the map location of body composition QTLs.",

    "abstract": "Pathology archives with linked clinical data are an invaluable resource for translational research, with the limitation that most cancer samples are formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Therefore, FFPE tissues are an important resource for genomic profiling studies but are under-utilised due to the low amount and quality of extracted nucleic acids. We profiled the copy number landscape of 356 breast cancer patients using DNA extracted FFPE tissues by shallow whole genome sequencing. We generated a total of 491 sequencing libraries from 2 kits and obtained data from 98.4% of libraries with 86.4% being of good quality. We generated libraries from as low as 3.8ng of input DNA and found that the success was independent of input DNA amount and quality, processing site and age of the fixed tissues. Since copy number alterations (CNA) play a major role in breast cancer, it is imperative that we are able to use FFPE archives and we have shown in this study that sWGS is a robust method to do such profiling.",

    "abstract": "Large genomic structural variants (>50bp) are important contributors to disease, yet they remain one of the most difficult types of variation to accurately ascertain, in part because they tend to cluster in duplicated and repetitive regions, but also because the various signals for these events can be challenging to detect with short reads. Clinically, aCGH and karyotype remain the most commonly used assays for genome-wide structural variant (SV) detection, though there is clear potential benefit to an NGS-based assay that accurately detects both SVs and single nucleotide variants. Linked-Read sequencing is a relatively simple, fast, and cost-effective method that is applicable to both genome and targeted assays. Linked-Reads are generated by performing haplotype-level dilution of long input DNA molecules into >1 million barcoded partitions, generating barcoded short reads within those partitions, and then performing short read sequencing in bulk. We performed 30x Linked-Read genome sequencing on a set of 23 samples with known balanced or unbalanced SVs. Twenty-seven of the 29 known events were detected and another event was called as a candidate. Sequence downsampling was performed on a subset to determine the lowest sequence depth required to detect variations. Copy-number variants can be called with as little as 1-2x sequencing depth (5-10Gb) while balanced events require on the order of 10x coverage for variant calls to be made, although specific signal is clearly present at 1-2x sequencing depth. In addition to detecting a full spectrum of variant types with a single test, Linked-Read sequencing provides base-level resolution of breakpoints, enabling complete resolution of even the most complex chromosomal rearrangements.",
