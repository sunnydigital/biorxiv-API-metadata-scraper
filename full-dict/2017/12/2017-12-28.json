    "abstract": "Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) is a widely used research tool in systems and synthetic biology. However, if CFPS is to become a mainstream technology for applications such as point of care manufacturing, we must understand the performance limits and costs of these systems. Toward this question, we used sequence specific constraint based modeling to evaluate the performance of E. coli cell-free protein synthesis. A core E. coli metabolic network, describing glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, energy metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis and degradation was augmented with sequence specific descriptions of transcription and translation and effective models of promoter function. Model parameters were largely taken from literature, thus the constraint based approach coupled the transcription and translation of the protein product, and the regulation of gene expression, with the availability of metabolic resources using only a limited number of adjustable model parameters. We tested this approach by simulating the expression of two model proteins: chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and dual emission green fluorescent protein, for which we have training data sets; we then expanded the simulations to a range of additional proteins. Protein expression simulations were consistent with measurements for a variety of cases. The constraint based simulations confirmed that oxidative phosphorylation was active in the CAT cell-free extract, as without it there was no feasible solution within the experimental constraints of the system. We then compared the metabolism of theoretically optimal and experimentally constrained CFPS reactions, and developed parameter free correlations which could be used to estimate productivity as a function of protein length and promoter type. Lastly, global sensitivity analysis identified the key metabolic processes that controlled CFPS productivity and energy efficiency. In summary, sequence specific constraint based modeling of CFPS offered a novel means to a priori estimate the performance of a cell-free system, using only a limited number of adjustable parameters. While we modeled the production of a single protein in this study, the approach could easily be extended to multi-protein synthetic circuits, RNA circuits or the cell free production of small molecule products.",

    "abstract": "The Ty1 retrotransposons present in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae belong to the large class of mobile genetic elements that replicate via an RNA intermediary and constitute a significant portion of most eukaryotic genomes. The retromobility of Ty1 is regulated by numerous host factors, including several subunits of the Mediator transcriptional co-activator complex. In spite of its known function in the nucleus, previous studies have implicated Mediator in the regulation of post-translational steps in Ty1 retromobility. To resolve this paradox, we systematically examined the effects of deleting nonessential Mediator subunits on the frequency of Ty1 retromobility and levels of retromobility intermediates. Our findings reveal that loss of distinct Mediator subunits alters Ty1 retromobility positively or negatively over a >10,000-fold range by regulating the ratio of an internal transcript, Ty1i, to the genomic Ty1 transcript. Ty1i RNA encodes a dominant negative inhibitor of Ty1 retromobility that blocks virus-like particle maturation and cDNA synthesis. These results resolve the conundrum of Mediator exerting sweeping control of Ty1 retromobility with only minor effects on the levels of Ty1 genomic RNA and the capsid protein, Gag. Since the majority of characterized intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of Ty1 retromobility alter a post-translational step(s), Mediator could play a central role in integrating signals that influence Ty1i expression to modulate retromobility.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRetrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that copy their RNA genomes into DNA and insert the DNA copies into the host genome. These elements contribute to genome instability, control of host gene expression and adaptation to changing environments. Retrotransposons depend on numerous host factors for their own propagation and control. The retrovirus-like retrotransposon, Ty1, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an invaluable model for retrotransposon research, and hundreds of host factors that regulate Ty1 retrotransposition have been identified. Non-essential subunits of the Mediator transcriptional co-activator complex have been identified as one set of host factors implicated in Ty1 regulation. Here, we report a systematic investigation of the effects of loss of these non-essential subunits of Mediator on Ty1 retrotransposition. Our findings reveal a heretofore unknown mechanism by which Mediator influences the balance between transcription from two promoters in Ty1 to modulate expression of an autoinhibitory transcript known as Ty1i RNA. Our results provide new insights into host control of retrotransposon activity via promoter choice and elucidate a novel mechanism by which the Mediator co-activator governs this choice.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal oscillations arise from coordinated activity among distinct populations of neurons and are associated with cognitive functions and behaviors. Although much progress has been made toward identifying the relative contribution of specific neuronal populations in hippocampal oscillations, far less is known about the role of hippocampal area CA2, which is thought to support social aspects of episodic memory. Furthermore, the little existing evidence on the role of CA2 in oscillations has led to conflicting conclusions. Therefore, we sought to identify the specific contribution of CA2 pyramidal neurons to brain oscillations using a controlled experimental system. We used excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs in transgenic mice to acutely and reversibly manipulate CA2 pyramidal cell activity. Here, we report on the role of CA2 in hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network oscillations and social behavior. We found that excitation or inhibition of CA2 pyramidal cells bidirectionally regulated hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma oscillations and inversely modulated hippocampal ripple oscillations. Further, CA2 inhibition impaired social approach behavior. These findings support a role for CA2 in low gamma generation and ripple modulation within the hippocampus and underscore the importance of CA2 neuronal activity in extrahippocampal oscillations and social behavior.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100048). For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) are expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favour individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Here we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge by measuring survival, through mark recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach, as a function of the plasticity of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioural thermal preference and the thermal sensitivity of metabolism in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog Pleurodema thaul. Overall, our results indicate that thermal acclimation in this population is not being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival decreased in individuals with less tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated (probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year) and increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were non-significant.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies and improved therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5  trios of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a new pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Comparison of genomic events in the tumours and matched disease models displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, and genome-wide similarities of copy number changes. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events revealed high variability across tumours and disease models, but also highlighted previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. Our approach and results demonstrate that PDX and PDO recapitulate PDAC tumourigenesis with respect to simple somatic mutations and copy number changes, and capture major SV events that are found in both resected and metastatic tumours.",

    "abstract": "A correct assessment of the quaternary structure of proteins is a fundamental prerequisite to understanding their function, physico-chemical properties and mode of interaction with other proteins. Currently about 90% of structures in the Protein Data Bank are crystal structures, in which the correct quaternary structure is embedded in the crystal lattice among a number of crystal contacts. Computational methods are required to 1) classify all protein-protein contacts in crystal lattices as biologically relevant or crystal contacts and 2) provide an assessment of how the biologically relevant interfaces combine into a biological assembly In our previous work we addressed the first problem with our EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein Protein Interface Classifier) method. Here, we present our solution to the second problem with a new method that combines the interface classification results with symmetry and topology considerations. The new algorithm enumerates all possible valid assemblies within the crystal using a graph representation of the lattice and predicts the most probable biological unit based on the pairwise interface scoring. Our method achieves 85% precision on a new dataset of 1,481 biological assemblies with consensus of PDB annotations. Although almost the same precision is achieved by PISA, currently the most popular quaternary structure assignment method, we show that, due to the fundamentally different approach to the problem, the two methods are complementary and could be combined to improve biological assembly assignments. The software for the automatic assessment of protein assemblies (EPPIC version 3) has been made available through a web server at http://www.eppic-web.org.\\n\\nAuthor summaryX-ray diffraction experiments are the main experimental technique to reveal the detailed atomic 3-dimensional structure of proteins. In these experiments, proteins are packed into crystals, an environment that is far away from their native solution environment. Determining which parts of the structure reflect the proteins state in the cell rather than being artifacts of the crystal environment can be a difficult task. How the different protein subunits assemble together in solution is known as the quaternary structure. Finding the correct quaternary structure is important both to understand protein oligomerization and for the understanding of protein-protein interactions at large. Here we present a new method to automatically determine the quaternary structure of proteins given their crystal structure. We provide a theoretical basis for properties that correct protein assemblies should possess, and provide a systematic evaluation of all possible assemblies according to these properties. The method provides a guidance to the experimental structural biologist as well as to structural bioinformaticians analyzing protein structures in bulk. Assemblies are provided for all proteins in the Protein Data Bank through a public website and database that is updated weekly as new structures are released.",

Recently several families of leucine rich repeat domain containing neuronal adhesion molecules have been characterized, including netrin G-ligands, LRRTMs, and the SALM family proteins. Most of these are expressed at the excitatory glutamatergic synapses, and dysfunctions of these genes are genetically linked with cognitive disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. The SALM family proteins SALM3 and SALM5, similar to SLITRKs, have been shown to bind to the presynaptic receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) family ligands. Here we present the 3 [A] crystal structure of the SALM5 LRR-Ig domain construct, and biophysical studies that verify the crystallographic results. We show that both SALM3 and SALM5 extracellular domains form similar dimeric structures, in which the LRR domains form the dimer interface. Both proteins bind to the RPTP lg-domains with micromolar affinity. SALM3 shows a clear preference for RPTP-ligands with the meB splice insert. This is in accordance with previous results showing that the LRR domain is also required for the ligand binding. Our structural studies and sequence conservation analysis suggests a ligand binding site and mechanism for RPTP binding via the dimeric LRR domain region.",

A web app named ProteomeVis is developed to provide a comprehensive view of protein evolution in the S. cerevisiae and E. coli proteomes. ProteomeVis interactively creates protein chain graphs, where edges between nodes represent structure and sequence similarities within user-defined ranges, to study the long time scale effects of protein structure evolution. The short time scale effects of protein sequence evolution is studied by sequence evolutionary rate (ER) correlation analyses with protein properties that span from the molecular to the organismal level.\\n\\nResultsWe demonstrate the utility and versatility of ProteomeVis by investigating the distribution of edges per node in organismal protein chain universe graphs (oPCUGs) and putative ER determinants. S. cerevisiae and E. coli oPCUGs are scale-free with scaling constants of 1.78 and 1.50, respectively. Both scaling constants can be explained by a previously reported theoretical model describing protein structure evolution (Dokholyan et al., 2002). Protein abundance most strongly correlates with ER among properties in ProteomeVis, with Spearman correlations of -0.51 (p-value<10-10) and -0.46 (p-value<10-10) for S. cerevisiae and E. coli, respectively.

The pathogen expresses a diverse arsenal of proteins that facilitate the breach of physical and biochemical barriers present in skin, evasion of the immune system, and digestion of human hemoglobin, allowing schistosomes to reside in the host for years. However, only a small number of specific interactions between S. mansoni and human proteins have been identified. We present and apply a protocol that generates testable predictions of S. mansoni-human protein interactions.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we first predict S. mansoni-human protein interactions based on similarity to known protein complexes. Putative interactions were then scored and assessed using several contextual filters, including the use of annotation automatically derived from literature using a simple natural language processing methodology.

However, protein-protein interactions have been experimentally characterized that relate to pathogenesis and establishment of infection. As with many pathogens, the understanding of these interactions is a key component for the development of new vaccines.

Our study revealed that the microdomain is selectively permeable, and that each protein in the signaling pathway that activates the cell fate transcription factor CtrA is sequestered and uniformly concentrated within the microdomain or its proximal membrane. Restricted rates of entry into and escape from the microdomain enhance phospho-signaling, leading to a sublinear gradient of CtrA~P along the long axis of the cell.

Here we argue that minerals hold an unrecognized potential for successfully transferring genetic material across environments and timescales to distant organisms and hypothesize that this process has significantly influenced the evolution of life. Our hypothesis is illustrated in the context of the evolution of early microbial life and the oxygenation of the Earths atmosphere and offers an explanation for observed outbursts of evolutionary events caused by horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "Airborne-mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis represent major public health challenges. A direct approach to prevent airborne transmission is inactivation of airborne pathogens, and the airborne antimicrobial potential of UVC ultraviolet light has long been established; however, its widespread use in public settings is limited because conventional UVC light sources are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic. By contrast, we have previously shown that far-UVC light (207-222 nm) efficiently kills bacteria without harm to exposed mammalian skin. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. We show for the first time that far-UVC efficiently kills airborne aerosolized viruses, a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivating >95% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Continuous very low dose-rate far-UVC light in indoor public locations is a promising, safe and inexpensive tool to reduce the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Gene annotation and pathway databases such as Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes are important tools in Gene Set Test (GST) that describe gene biological functions and associated pathways. GST aims to establish an association relationship between a gene set of interest and an annotation. Importantly, GST tests for over-representation of genes in an annotation term. One implicit assumption of GST is that the gene expression platform captures the complete or a very large proportion of the genome. However, this assumption is neither satisfied for the increasingly popular boutique array nor the custom designed gene expression profiling platform. Specifically, conventional GST is no longer appropriate due to the gene set selection bias induced during the construction of these platforms.\\n\\nResults: We propose bcGST, a bias-corrected Gene Set Test by introducing bias correction terms in the contingency table needed for calculating the Fishers Exact Test (FET). The adjustment method works by estimating the proportion of genes captured on the array with respect to the genome in order to assist filtration of annotation terms that would otherwise be falsely included or excluded. We illustrate the practicality of bcGST and its stability through multiple differential gene expression analyses in melanoma and TCGA cancer studies.\\n\\nAvailability: The bcGST method is made available as a Shiny web application at http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/bcGST/\\n\\nContact: kevin.wang@sydney.edu.au",

    "abstract": "Long short-term memory (LSTM) is one of the most attractive deep learning methods to learn time series or contexts of input data. Increasing studies, including biological sequence analyses in bioinformatics, utilize this architecture. Amino acid sequence profiles are widely used for bioinformatics studies, such as sequence similarity searches, multiple alignments, and evolutionary analyses. Currently, many biological sequences are becoming available, and the rapidly increasing amount of sequence data emphasizes the importance of scalable generators of amino acid sequence profiles. We employed the LSTM network and developed a novel profile generator to construct profiles without any assumptions, except for input sequence context. Our method could generate better profiles than existing de novo profile generators, including CSBuild and RPS-BLAST, on the basis of profile-sequence similarity search performance with linear calculation costs against input sequence size. In addition, we analyzed the effects of the memory power of LSTM and found that LSTM had high potential power to detect long-range interactions between amino acids, as in the case of beta-strand formation, which has been a difficult problem in protein bioinformatics using sequence information. We demonstrated the importance of sequence context and the feasibility of LSTM on biological sequence analyses. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of memories in LSTM and showed that our de novo profile generator, SPBuild, achieved higher performance than that of existing methods for profile prediction of beta-strands, where long-range interactions of amino acids are important and are known to be difficult for the existing window-based prediction methods. Our findings will be useful for the development of other prediction methods related to biological sequences by machine learning methods.",

We propose to overcome this limitation and more accurately identify eloquent areas adjacent to brain tumors by independently assessing vasoreactivity using breath-holding and incorporating these data into the BOLD analysis.\\n\\nMethodsLocal vasoreactivity using a breath-holding paradigm with the same timing as the functional motor and language tasks was determined in 16 patients (9 glioblastomas, 1 anaplastic astrocytoma, 5 low grade astrocytomas, and 1 metastasis). We derived a model based on coherence for analyzing BOLD fMRI that takes into account the altered hemodynamics adjacent to brain tumors.\\n\\nResultsActivation maps computed using the coherence model were overall similar to standard activation maps. However, the coherence maps demonstrated clinically meaningful areas of activation that were not seen using the standard method in 12/16 cases. This included localization of language areas adjacent to brain tumors, where the coherence method results were confirmed by intra-operative direct cortical stimulation. Enhanced task response maps based on vasoreactivity mapping demonstrated more robust, anatomically-correct activation, in particular adjacent to tumors as compared to maps obtained without vasoreactivity information.\\n\\nConclusionsThe present preliminary results demonstrate the principle that the neurovascular uncoupling known to affect the accuracy of BOLD fMRI adjacent to brain tumors may be, at least partially, overcome by incorporating an independent measurement of vasoreactivity into the BOLD analysis.",

    "abstract": "Hyperglycaemia causes various intracellular changes resulting in oxidative stress leading to loss of integrity and cell death. While cellular effects of hyperglycaemia have been reported extensively there is no clarity on whether the cellular changes translate into alterations in behaviour. Study of behavioural alterations also provides a sublime top-down approach to dapple the putative systems affected due to hyperglycaemic stress. Hence, this aspect of effect of hyperglycaemia deserves attention as it could be an early indicator of neurodegenerative changes. Caenorhabditis elegans is an excellent model to address these questions since it has a simple nervous system and the ability to respond to various cues.\\n\\nWe have investigated alteration in behaviour which involves various motor and sensory function of the C. elegans nervous system under hyperglycaemia. Exposure of C. elegans to 400 mM glucose for 4hr did not kill the worm but gave rise to decreased number of progeny, exhibiting other aberrant behaviours. This dosage was considered to cause hyperglycaemic stress and used further in the studies. Various assays that quantified behaviour, such as feeding (pharyngeal pumping/min), locomotion (distance travelled by the worms/min), olfactory response towards Butanol (response index) and gustatory response NaCl (response index) were conducted under both normal and hyperglycaemic conditions. The behavioural alterations were validated by scrutinizing changes in level of Acetylchloine which regulates motor behaviour and morphology of chemosensory neurons. Our results indicate that hyperglycaemia alters motor behaviour of the worm which was validated by a reduction in ACh levels. However, chemosensory systems were robust enough to resist reduction in neuronal integrity due to hyperglycaemic assault.",

We apply two methods to estimate richness change which both incorporate models for sampling effects and detection probability. The analysis is repeated for records with specimens deposited in collections, and a subset restricted to spatial grid cells that have been sampled repeatedly across three periods. When fitting non-linear species accumulation curves to species numbers, declines are inferred for bumblebees and at most limited declines for other bees. Capture-recapture analysis applied to species encounter histories infers a constant colonization rate per year and constant (bumblebees) or decreasing (other) local species survival. However, simulations suggest that the method estimates time trends in survival with a negative bias. Species richness trends predicted by the second approach are a 10% reduction in non-Bombus species richness and 29% fewer Bombus species since 1946, comparable to the predictions of the first approach. Neither analysis provides reliable evidence that decelerating declines in species richness occur in these taxa. Therefore we should not infer decelerating declines in pollinator species richness in N-W Europe as previously claimed.",

More specifically, it predicts that there is a single cost function for the offspring (depending on e.g. offspring quality) that maintains honesty and it must be proportional to parents fitness loss. Here we show another interpretation of the cost. We demonstrate that cost, proportional to the fitness gain of the offspring, also results in honest signalling. Since the loss of the parent does not necessarily coincide with the gain of the offspring, it is provable that any linear combination of the two cost functions (one proportional to parents loss, one to offsprings gain) also leads to honest signalling. Our results, applied for a specific model, support the previous general conclusion that signalling games have different cost functions for different equilibria. Consequently, costly signalling theory cannot predict a unique equilibrium cost in signalling games especially in case of parent-offspring conflicts. As an important consequence, any measured equilibrium cost in real cases has to be compared both to the parents fitness loss and to the offsprings fitness gain in order to provide meaningfully interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Accurate species delimitation is essential to properly assess biodiversity, but also for management and conservation purposes. Yet, it is not always trivial to accurately define species boundaries in closely related species due to incomplete lineage sorting. Additional difficulties may be caused by hybridization, now evidenced as a frequent phenomenon. The brittle star cryptic species complex Ophioderma longicauda encompasses six mitochondrial lineages, including broadcast spawners and internal brooders, yet the actual species boundaries are unknown. Here, we combined three methods to delimit species in the Ophioderma longicauda complex and to infer its divergence history: i) unsupervised species discovery based on multilocus genotypes; ii) divergence time estimation using the multi-species coalescent; iii) divergence scenario testing (including gene flow) using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods. 30 sequence markers (transcriptome-based, mitochondrial or non-coding) for 89 O. longicauda and outgroup individuals were used. First, multivariate analyses revealed six genetic clusters, which globally corresponded to the mitochondrial lineages, yet with many exceptions, suggesting ancient hybridization events and challenging traditional mitochondrial barcoding approaches. Second, multi-species coalescent-based analyses confirmed the occurrence of six species and provided divergence time estimates, but the sole use of this method failed to accurately delimit species, highlighting the power of multilocus genotype clustering to delimit recently diverged species. Finally, Approximate Bayesian Computation showed that the most likely scenario involves hybridization between brooders and broadcasters. Our study shows that despite strong incomplete lineage sorting and past hybridization, accurate species delimitation in Ophioderma was possible using a combination of complementary methods. We propose that these methods, especially multilocus genotype clustering, may be useful to resolve other complex speciation histories.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMultivariate analysis was used for species delimitation\\nC_LIO_LISix Ophioderma species were delimited using nuclear and mitochondrial data\\nC_LIO_LIOphioderma speciation history is complex and included hybridization\\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial and nuclear histories differed, challenging barcoding approaches\\nC_LIO_LIWe propose that using multilocus genotypes can resolve complex speciation histories\\nC_LI\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/240218_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (39K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13071d3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@180ebd9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbfe96org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74c35_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Mendelian inheritance errors (MIEs) in parent-offspring trios are commonly attributed to erroneous sequencing calls, as the rate of true de novo mutations is extremely low compared to the incidence of MIEs. Here, we analyzed WGS data from 1,314 trios across diverse human populations with the goal of studying the characteristics of MIEs. We applied filters based on genotype call quality and observed that filtering has a greater impact on frequent MIEs. Our results indicate that MIEs are enriched in repeats and MIE density correlates with short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) density. We also observed clustered MIEs in regions overlapping large deletions. We created population-specific MIE profiles and discovered regions that represent different MIE distributions across populations. Finally, we have provided population-specific MIE tracks that can be loaded in UCSC Genome Browser. These profiles can be used for flagging calls in proximity of clustered MIEs before allele frequency and admixture calculations, annotating candidate de novo mutations, discovering population-specific putative deletions, and for distinguishing between regions that have errors due to sequence quality vs. chromosomal anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or \\\"motor noise\\\" in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of visuomotor adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components which relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (r=0.27; 95%HDI=[0.05 0.50]) and negatively with execution noise (r=-0.41; 95%HDI=[-0.63 -0.16]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from state and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (r = 0.31; 95%HDI = [0.09 0.54]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the \\\"optimal control\\\" framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTOur study shows that the adaptation rate is optimally tuned to planning noise and execution noise across individuals. This suggests that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with \\\"optimal control\\\" approaches to understanding the motor system.

    "abstract": "Visual motion analysis is fundamental to survival across the animal kingdom. In insects, our understanding of the underlying computations has centered on the Hassenstein-Reichardt motion detector, which computes two-point cross-correlation via multiplication; in mammalian cortex, it is postulated that a similar signal is computed by comparing matched squaring operations. Both of these operations are difficult to implement biophysically in a precise fashion; moreover, they fail to detect the more complex multipoint local motion cues present in the visual environment. Here, via single-unit recordings in two visual specialists, dragonfly \\\"(Odonata)\\\" and macaque, and via model simulations, we show that neuronal computations are not simply approximations to idealized behaviors forced by biological constraints, but rather, are signatures of a common computational strategy to capture multiple local motion cues. The similarity of motion computations at the neuronal level in the brains of two extremely dissimilar animals, with evolutionary divergence of over 700 Myr1, suggests convergence on a common computational scheme for detecting visual motion.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty is ubiquitous in cognitive processing, which is why agents require a precise handle on how to deal with the noise inherent in their mental operations. Previous research suggests that people possess a remarkable ability to track and report uncertainty, often in the form of confidence judgments. Here, we argue that humans use uncertainty inherent in their representations of value beliefs to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation. Such uncertainty is reflected in explicit confidence judgments. Using a novel variant of a multi-armed bandit paradigm, we studied how beliefs were formed and how uncertainty in the encoding of these value beliefs (belief confidence) evolved over time. We found that people used uncertainty to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation, reflected in a higher tendency towards exploration when their confidence in their value representations was low. We furthermore found that value uncertainty can be linked to frameworks of metacognition in decision making in two ways. First, belief confidence drives decision confidence--that is peoples evaluation of their own choices. Second, individuals with higher metacognitive insight into their choices were also better at tracing the uncertainty in their environment. Together, these findings argue that such uncertainty representations play a key role in the context of cognitive control.",

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate through neurotransmitter release at specialized synaptic regions known as active zones (AZs). Using transgenic biosensors to image postsynaptic glutamate receptor activation following single vesicle fusion events at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, we analyzed release probability (Pr) maps for a defined connection with ~300 AZs between synaptic partners. Although Pr was very heterogeneous, it represented a stable and unique feature of each AZ. Pr heterogeneity was not abolished in mutants lacking Synaptotagmin 1, suggesting the AZ itself is likely to harbor a key determinant(s). Indeed, AZ Pr was strongly correlated with presynaptic Ca2+ channel density and Ca2+ influx at single release sites. In addition, Pr variability was reflected in the postsynaptic compartment, as high Pr AZs displayed a distinct pattern of glutamate receptor clustering. Developmental analysis suggests that high Pr sites emerge from earlier formed AZs, with a temporal maturation in transmission strength occurring over several days.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning-based analysis of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns has enabled the visualization of perceptual content. However, it has been limited to the reconstruction with low-level image bases (Miyawaki et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2016) or to the matching to exemplars (Naselaris et al., 2009; Nishimoto et al., 2011). Recent work showed that visual cortical activity can be decoded (translated) into hierarchical features of a deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features (Horikawa & Kamitani, 2017). Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed  reconstructs or  generates images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images. Furthermore, human judgment of reconstructions suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance visual quality of generated images. The results suggest that hierarchical visual information in the brain can be effectively combined to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images.",

We find that the radiation dose from the muons will exceed the total present surface dose from all sources at depths up to a kilometer and will persist for at least the lifetime of marine megafauna.

    "abstract": "The eyes of some aquatic animals form images through reflective optics. Shrimp, lobsters, crayfish and prawns possess reflecting superposition compound eyes, composed of thousands of square-faceted eye-units (ommatidia). Mirrors in the upper part of the eye (the distal mirror) reflect light collected from many ommatidia onto the underlying photosensitive elements of the retina, the rhabdoms. A second reflector, the tapetum, underlying the retina, back-scatters dispersed light onto the rhabdoms. Using microCT and cryo-SEM imaging accompanied by in situ micro-X-ray diffraction and micro-Raman spectroscopy, we investigated the hierarchical organization and materials properties of the reflective systems at high resolution and under close to physiological conditions. We show that the distal mirror consists of three or four layers of sparse plate-like nano-crystals. The tapetum is a diffuse reflector composed of hollow nanoparticles constructed from concentric lamellae of crystals. Isoxanthopterin, a pteridine analog of guanine, forms both the reflectors in the distal mirror and in the tapetum. The crystal structure of isoxanthopterin was determined from crystal structure prediction calculations and verified by comparison with experimental X-ray diffraction. The extended hydrogen bonded layers of the molecules results in an extremely high calculated refractive index in the H-bonded plane, n = 1.96, which makes isoxanthopterin crystals an ideal reflecting material. The crystal structure of isoxanthopterin, together with a detailed knowledge of the reflector superstructures, provide a rationalization of the reflective optics of the crustacean eye.\\n\\nSignificanceAquatic animals use reflectors in their eyes either to form images or to increase photon capture. Guanine is the most widespread molecular component of these reflectors. Here we show that crystals of isoxanthopterin, a pteridine analogue of guanine, form both the image-forming  distal mirror and the intensity-enhancing tapetum reflector in the compound eyes of some decapod crustaceans. The crystal structure of isoxanthopterin was determined, providing an explanation for why these crystals are so well suited for efficient reflection. Pteridines were previously known only as pigments and our discovery raises the question of which other organic molecules may be used to form crystals with superior reflective properties either in organisms or in artificial optical devices.",

In this work, we employ QPI to compare the tissue disorder strength between benign and malignant breast tissue histology samples. Our results show that disease progression is marked by a significant increase in the disorder strength.

Here, we show that Plk4 binding to the central coiled-coil (CC) of Ana2 is a conserved event, involving Polo-box 3 and a previously unidentified putative CC located adjacent to the kinase domain. Ana2 binding stimulates Plk4 kinase activity in vitro, and, in turn, is phosphorylated along its length. Previous studies showed that Plk4 phosphorylates the C-terminal STAN domain of Ana2/STIL, triggering binding and recruitment of the cartwheel protein Sas6 to the procentriole assembly site. However, the physiological relevance of N-terminal phosphorylation was unknown. We found that Plk4 first phosphorylates the extreme N-terminus of Ana2 which is critical for subsequent STAN domain modification. Phosphorylation of the central region then breaks the Plk4-Ana2 interaction. This phosphorylation pattern is important for centriole assembly and integrity because replacement of endogenous Ana2 with phospho-Ana2 mutants disrupts distinct steps in Ana2 function and inhibits centriole duplication.",

    "abstract": "Parent-offspring communication remains an unresolved challenge for biologist. The difficulty of the challenge comes from the fact that it is a multifaceted problem with connections to life-history evolution, parent-offspring conflict, kin selection and signalling. Previous efforts mainly focused on modelling resource allocation at the expense of the dynamic interaction during a reproductive season. Here we present a two-stage model of begging where the first stage models the interaction between nestlings and parents within a nest and the second stage models the life-history trade-offs. We show in an asexual population that honest begging results in decreased variance of collected food between siblings, which leads to mean number of surviving offspring. Thus, honest begging can be seen as a special bet-hedging against informational uncertainty, which not just decreases the variance of fitness but also increases the arithmetic mean.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryParent-offspring communication is a fascinating problem that captures the attention of scientist and layman alike. Parent-offspring interaction is the first interaction with non-self in the life of most young birds and mammals. The future life success of such young animals crucially depends on how successful they are in interacting and communicating with their parents. This communication has different functions: it is important for the offspring to solicit food from the parent and it is important for the parent to be informed about the state (hunger level) of the offspring. There is an optimization problem on top of this level: the parent has to  decide what part of the available resources should be allocated to the offspring and what part should she keep for herself. Here we show in a probabilistic model that the honest phenotype -where offspring beg only if they are hungry-has a greater growth rate than a selfish type - which begs regardless of its hunger level. This result holds in asexual populations; here honesty serves as a reduction uncertainty for the parents. The improved decision making of the parents -in turn-increases the survival of the offspring as well.",

B1 B cells are tissue-resident, innate-like B cells. They have many distinct properties, such as the capacity to self-renew and the ability to rapidly respond to a limited repertoire of epitopes. The metabolic pathways that support these functions are unknown. We show that B1 B cells are bioenergetically more active than B2 B cells, with higher rates of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and depend on glycolysis. They acquire exogenous fatty acids, and store lipids in droplet form. Autophagy is differentially activated in B1a B cells, and deletion of the autophagy gene Atg7 leads to a selective loss of B1a B cells due to a failure of self-renewal. Autophagy-deficient B1a B cells downregulate critical metabolic genes and accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria. B1 B cells therefore, have evolved a distinct metabolism adapted to their residence and specific functional properties.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent available treatments for Helicobacter pylori eradication are chosen according to local clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance prevalence. The aim of this study was to estimate, by means of molecular methods, both clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance in gastric mucosa from patients infected with H.pylori.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 191 DNA samples were analyzed. DNA was purified from gastric mucosa obtained from patients who underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at an university hospital from Santiago, Chile, between 2011 and 2014. H.pylori was detected by real-time PCR. A 5exonuclease assay was developed to detect A2142G and A2143G mutations among Hpylori-positive samples. rdxA gene was sequenced in samples harboring A2142G and A2143G mutations in order to detect mutations that potentially confer dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance.\\n\\nResultsNinety-three (93) out of 191 DNA samples obtained from gastric mucosa were H. pylori-positive (48.7%). Clarithromycin-resistance was detected in 29 samples (31.2% [95%CI 22.0%-41.6%]). The sequencing of rdxA gene revealed that two samples harbored truncating mutations in rdxA, one sample had an in-frame deletion, and 11 had amino acid changes that likely cause metronidazole resistance.\\n\\nConclusionsWe estimated a prevalence of clarithomycin-resistance of 31.8% in Santiago, Chile. The proportion of dual clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance could be, at least, 15.0%. Our results require further confirmation. Nevertheless, they are significant as an initial approximation in re-evaluating the guidelines for H.pylori eradication currently used in Chile.",

    "abstract": "The main functions of primary sensory cortical areas are classically considered to be the extraction and representation of stimulus features. In contrast, higher cortical sensory association areas are thought to be responsible for combining these sensory representations with internal motivations and learnt associations. These regions generate appropriate neural responses that are maintained until a motor command is executed. Within this framework, responses of the primary sensory areas during task performance are expected to carry less information about the behavioral meaning of the stimulus than higher sensory, association, motor and frontal cortices. Here we demonstrate instead that the neuronal population responses in the early primary auditory cortex (A1) display many aspects of responses generally associated with higher-level areas. A1 activity was recorded in awake ferrets while they were either passively listening or actively discriminating two periodic click trains of different rates in a Go/No-Go paradigm. By applying population-level dimensionality reduction techniques, we found that task-engagement induced a shift in the nature of the encoding from a sensory-driven representation of the two stimuli to a behaviorally relevant representation of the two categories that specifically enhances the target stimulus. We demonstrate that this shift in encoding relies partly on a novel mechanism of change in spontaneous activity patterns upon engagement in the task. We show that this population-level representation of stimuli in A1 population activity bears strong similarities to responses in the frontal cortex, but appears earlier following stimulus presentation. Analysis of neural activity recorded in various Go/No-Go tasks, with different sounds and reinforcement paradigms, reveals that this striking population-level enhancement of target representation is a general property of task engagement. These findings indicate that primary sensory cortices play a highly flexible role in the processing of incoming stimuli and implement a crucial change in the structure of population activity in order to extract task-relevant information during behavior.",

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate through Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). Neurotransmitter release properties play a key role in defining information flow in circuits and are tuned during multiple forms of plasticity. Despite their central role in determining neurotransmitter release properties, little is known about how Ca2+ channel levels are modulated to calibrate synaptic function. We used CRISPR to tag the Drosophila CaV2 Ca2+ channel Cacophony (Cac) and investigated the regulation of endogenous Ca2+ channels during homeostatic plasticity in males in which all endogenous Cac channels are tagged. We found that heterogeneously distributed Cac is highly predictive of neurotransmitter release probability at individual AZs and differentially regulated during opposing forms of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Specifically, Cac levels at AZ are increased during chronic and acute presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP), and live imaging during acute expression of PHP reveals proportional Ca2+ channel accumulation across heterogeneous AZs. In contrast, endogenous Cac levels do not change during presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD), implying that the reported reduction in Ca2+ influx during PHD is achieved through functional adaptions to pre-existing Ca2+ channels. Thus, distinct mechanisms bi-directionally modulate presynaptic Ca2+ levels to maintain stable synaptic strength in response to diverse challenges, with Ca2+ channel abundance providing a rapidly tunable substrate for potentiating neurotransmitter release over both acute and chronic timescales.",

To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of H2S-induced neurodegeneration we used a broad-spectrum proteomic analysis approach to search for key molecules in H2S-induced neurotoxicity. Mice were subjected to acute whole body exposure of up to750 ppm of H2S. The H2S-treated group showed behavioral motor deficits and developed severe lesions in the inferior colliculus (IC), part of the brainstem. The IC was microdissected for proteomic analysis. Tandem mass tags (TMT) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based quantitative proteomics was applied for protein identification and quantitation. LC-MS/MS was able to identify 598, 562, and 546 altered proteomic changes for day 1 (2 h post H2S exposure), day 2, and day 4 of H2S exposure, respectively. Mass spectrometry data were analyzed by Perseus 1.5.5.3 statistical analysis, and gene ontology heat map clustering. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to confirm some of the H2S-dependent proteomics changes. Taken together, acute exposure to H2S induced behavioral motor deficits along with progressive neurodegeneration including disruption of several biological processes in the IC such as cellular morphology, energy metabolism, and calcium signaling. The obtained broad-spectrum proteomics data may provide important clues to elucidate mechanisms of H2S-induced neurotoxicity.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIMice exposed to H2S recapitulated H2S-induced neurotoxicity manifested in humans.\\nC_LIO_LIThe IC in the mouse brain is the most sensitive to H2S-induced neurodegeneration.\\nC_LIO_LIProteomic expressions of key proteins were validated at transcription level.\\nC_LIO_LISeveral biological pathways were dysregulated by H2S exposure.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMathematical modeling is a powerful tool to analyze, and ultimately design biochemical networks. However, the estimation of the parameters that appear in biochemical models is a significant challenge. Parameter estimation typically involves expensive function evaluations and noisy data, making it difficult to quickly obtain optimal solutions. Further, biochemical models often have many local extrema which further complicates parameter estimation. Toward these challenges, we developed Dynamic Optimization with Particle Swarms (DOPS), a novel hybrid meta-heuristic that combined multi-swarm particle swarm optimization with dynamically dimensioned search (DDS). DOPS uses a multi-swarm particle swarm optimization technique to generate candidate solution vectors, the best of which is then greedily updated using dynamically dimensioned search.\\n\\nResultsWe tested DOPS using classic optimization test functions, biochemical benchmark problems and real-world biochemical models. We performed [Formula] trials with [Formula] function evaluations per trial, and compared the performance of DOPS with other commonly used meta-heuristics such as differential evolution (DE), simulated annealing (SA) and dynamically dimensioned search (DDS). On average, DOPS outperformed other common meta-heuristics on the optimization test functions, benchmark problems and a real-world model of the human coagulation cascade.\\n\\nConclusionsDOPS is a promising meta-heuristic approach for the estimation of biochemical model parameters in relatively few function evaluations.

Here, we demonstrate that activation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) via low dose of chloroquine (CQ) promotes DNA damage clearance, rescues age-related metabolic shift, and extends lifespan in nematodes and mice. Molecularly, ATM phosphorylates SIRT6 deacetylase and thus prevents MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Extra copies of Sirt6 in Atm-/- mice extend lifespan, accompanied with restored metabolic homeostasis. In a progeria mouse model with low ATM protein level and DNA repair capacity, the treatment with CQ ameliorates premature aging features and extends lifespan. Thus, our data highlights a pro-longevity role of ATM, for the first time establishing direct causal links between robust DNA repair machinery and longevity, and providing therapeutic strategy for progeria and age-related metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomes cover most of the genome and are thought to be displaced by transcription factors (TFs) in regions that direct gene expression. However, the modes of interaction between TFs and nucleosomal DNA remain largely unknown. Here, we use nucleosome consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (NCAP-SELEX) to systematically explore interactions between the nucleosome and 220 TFs representing diverse structural families. Consistently with earlier observations, we find that the vast majority of TFs have less access to nucleosomal DNA than to free DNA. The motifs recovered from TFs bound to nucleosomal and free DNA are generally similar; however, steric hindrance and scaffolding by the nucleosome result in specific positioning and orientation of the motifs. Many TFs preferentially bind close to the end of nucleosomal DNA, or to periodic positions at its solvent-exposed side. TFs often also bind nucleosomal DNA in a particular orientation, because the nucleosome breaks the local rotational symmetry of DNA. Some TFs also specifically interact with DNA located at the dyad position where only one DNA gyre is wound, whereas other TFs prefer sites spanning two DNA gyres and bind specifically to each of them. Our work reveals striking differences in TF binding to free and nucleosomal DNA, and uncovers a rich interaction landscape between the TFs and the nucleosome.",

The fish iris has a dual function, both to camouflage the eye and serving as a light barrier. Yet, the mechanism that enables this dual functionality and the benefits of using a reflective iris have remained unclear. Using synchrotron micro-focused diffraction, cryo-SEM imaging and optical analyses on zebrafish at different stages of development, we show that the complex optical response of the iris is facilitated by the development a high-order organization of multilayered guanine-based crystal reflectors and pigments. We further demonstrate how the efficient light reflector is established during development to allow the optical functionality of the eye, already at early developmental stages. These results shed light on the evolutionary drive for developing a compact reflective iris, which is widely used by many animal species.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe fish iris is an exquisite example of natures remarkable engineering where specialized cells, dubbed iridophores, produce an efficient light reflector made of guanine-based crystals. This unique structure of the fish iris serves a dual function: In addition to its role as a light barrier, the iris has a second role of camouflaging the eye by creating a silvery reflectance, which merges with the fish skin.

Using a regulated protein heterodimerization system to lock different cohesin interfaces at specific times in mitosis, we show that the prophase pathway of Cohesin release is not required for cohesion fatigue. By manipulating microtubule stability and Cohesin complex integrity in cell lines with varying sensitivity to cohesion fatigue, we show that rates of cohesion fatigue reflect a dynamic balance between spindle pulling forces and resistance to separation by interchromatid cohesion. Cohesion fatigue that results in complete chromatid separation may be an unrecognized but common source of chromosome instability. Here, we extend the significance of cohesion fatigue by showing that even limited delays at metaphase lead to partial centromere separation and predispose cells to chromosome missegregation.",

Here, we test for several cues in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a species that was previously found to adjust the sex ratio of its offspring in response to the number of females in an isolated population, i.e. a patch. We here investigate whether the offspring sex ratio of T. urticae females changes in response to 1) the current number of females in the same patch, 2) the number of females in the patches of their mothers and 3) their relatedness to their mate. Single females on patches produced similar sex ratios to those of groups of 15 females; their mothers had been in identical conditions of panmixia. The offspring sex ratios of females mated with their brother did not differ from those of females mated with an unrelated male. Females however produced a more female-biased offspring sex ratio if their mothers were alone on a patch compared to 15 other females. Thus, maternal environment is used as a cue for the sex allocation of daughters.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of a bioactive glass based on the 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2MgO-system and its glassceramics containing whitlockite on the remineralization of dentin as a possible treatment to dentin hypersensitivity. For that, 40 third molar human teeth were artificially demineralized and randomly distributed in 4 groups (n = 10): G1 - Negative Control (no treatment), G2 - Positive Control (treated by Bioglass(R) 45S5), G3 - BG (treated by bioactive glass based on 3CaO.P2O5-SiO2-MgOsystem), and G4 - BGC (treated by bioactive whitlockite glass-ceramics). After treatment, the samples were emerged in artificial saliva and stored for 7 days in a controlled temperature of 37{o}C. After that, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to evaluate samples morphology. The analysis confirmed the formation of hydroxyapatite on the surface of all the biomaterials studied, that in the dentine specimens treated by bioactive glass and whitlockite glas-ceramic most of the dentinal tubules were completely occluded.",

    "abstract": "The tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) is a genome-wide instability configuration primarily observed in breast, ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. Here, we stratify TDP tumors by classifying their tandem duplications (TDs) into three span intervals, with modal values of 11 Kb, 231 Kb, and 1.7 Mb. TDPs with prominent ~11 Kb TDs feature the conjoint loss of TP53 and BRCA1. TDPs with ~231 Kb and ~1.7 Mb TDs associate with CCNE1 pathway activation or CDK12 disruptions, in conjunction with TP53 mutations. We prove the driver role of TP53 and BRCA1 abrogation for TDP induction by generating short-span TDP mammary tumors in genetically modified mouse models harboring deleterious mutations in only these two genes. Lastly, heterogeneous combinations of mutations mediated by TDs are selected for and contribute to the oncogenic burden of TDP tumors.",

    "abstract": "The longer cells stay in particular phases of the cell cycle, the longer it will take these cell populations to increase. However, the above qualitative description has very little predictive value, unless it can be codified mathematically. A quantitative relation that defines the population doubling time (Td) as a function of the time eukaryotic cells spend in specific cell cycle phases would be instrumental for estimating rates of cell proliferation and for evaluating introduced perturbations. Here, we show that in human cells the length of the G1 phase (TG1) regressed on Td with a slope of {approx}0.75, while in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the slope was slightly smaller, at {approx}0.60. On the other hand, cell size was not strongly associated with Td or TG1 in cell cultures that were proliferating at different rates. Furthermore, we show that levels of the yeast G1 cyclin Cln3p were positively associated with rates of cell proliferation over a broad range, at least in part through translational control mediated by a short uORF in the CLN3 transcript. Cln3p was also necessary for the proper scaling between TG1 and Td. In contrast, yeast lacking the Whi5p transcriptional repressor maintained the scaling between TG1 and Td. These data reveal fundamental scaling relations between the duration of eukaryotic cell cycle phases and rates of cell proliferation, point to the necessary role of Cln3p in these relations in yeast and provide a mechanistic basis linking Cln3p levels to proliferation rates and the scaling of G1 with doubling time.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic multicellular systems hold promise for understanding natural development of biofilms and higher organisms1,2, as well as for engineering complex multi-component metabolic pathways2,3 and materials4. However, such efforts will require tools to adhere cells into defined morphologies and patterns, and these tools are currently lacking1,5,6. Here we report the first 100% genetically encoded synthetic platform for modular cell-cell adhesion in Escherichia coli, which provides control over multicellular self-assembly. Adhesive selectivity is provided by a library of outer membrane-displayed nanobody7,8 and antigen peptides with orthogonal intra-library specificities, while affinity is controlled by intrinsic adhesin affinity, competitive inhibition, and inducible expression. We demonstrate the resulting capabilities for rational design of well-defined morphologies and patterns through homophilic and heterophilic interactions, lattice-like self-assembly, phase separation, differential adhesion, and sequential layering. This adhesion toolbox, compatible with synthetic biology standards9, will enable construction of high-level multicellular designs and shed light on the evolutionary transition to multicellularity6,10.",
