    "abstract": "Explanations based on low level interacting elements are valuable and powerful since they contribute to identify the key mechanisms of biological functions. However, many dynamic systems based on low level interacting elements with unambiguous, finite and complete information of initial states generate future states that cannot be predicted, implying an increase of complexity and open-ended evolution (oee). Such systems are like Turing machines, that overlap with dynamical systems that cannot halt. We argue that organisms find halting conditions by distorting these mechanisms, creating conditions for a constant creativity that drives evolution. We introduce a modulus of elasticity to measure the changes in these mechanisms in response to changes in the computed environment. We test this concept in a population of predators and predated cells with chemotactic mechanisms and demonstrate how the selection of a given mechanism depends on the entire population. We finally explore this concept in different frameworks and postulate that the identification of predictive mechanisms is only successful with small elasticity modulus.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: The low cost of DNA sequencing has accelerated research in natural product biosynthesis allowing us to rapidly link small molecules to the clusters that produce them. However, the large amount of data means that the number of putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) far exceeds our ability to experimentally characterize them. This necessitates the need for development of further tools to analyze putative BGCs to flag those of interest for further characterization.\\n\\nResults: Clustertools implements a framework to aid in the characterization of putative BGCs. It does this by or-ganizing genomic information on coding sequences in a way that enables directed, hypothesis-driven queries for functional elements in close physical proximity of each other. Genomic sequence databases can be constructed in clusterTools with an interface to the NCBI Genbank and Genomes databases, or from private sequence databases. clusterTools can be used either to identify interesting BGCs from a database of putative BGCs, or on databases of genomic sequences to identify and download regions of interest in the DNA for further processing and annotation in programs such as antiSMASH. We have used clusterTools to identify putative and known biosynthetic gene clus-ters involved in bacterial polyketide alkaoloid and tetronate biosynthesis.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementation: Clustertools is implemented in Python and is available via the AGPL. Stand-alone versions of clusterTools are available for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux upon registration (https://goo.gl/forms/QRKTkpqiA0g31IWp1). The source-code is available at https://www.github.com/emzodls/clusterArch.\\n\\nSupplementary information: A manual describing the Python toolkit that powers clusterTools, as well as the HMMs constructed for the tetronate search is available online.",

    "abstract": "Type II Diabetes (T2DM) negatively alters baseline tendon function, including decreased range of motion and mechanical properties; however, the biological mechanisms that promote diabetic tendinopathy are unknown. To facilitate identification of therapeutic targets we developed a novel murine model of diabetic tendinopathy. Mice fed a High Fat Diet (HFD) developed diet induced obesity and T2DM. Obesity/ T2DM resulted in progressive impairments in tendon gliding function and mechanical properties, relative to mice fed a Low Fat Diet (LFD), as well as a decrease in collagen fibril diameter by transmission electron microscopy. We then determined if restoration of normal metabolic function, by switching mice from HFD to LFD, is sufficient to halt the pathological changes in tendon due to obesity/T2DM. However, switching from a HFD to LFD resulted in greater impairments in tendon gliding function than mice maintained on a HFD. Mechanistically, IR{beta} signaling is decreased in obese/T2DM murine tendons, suggesting altered IR{beta} signaling as a driver of diabetic tendinopathy. However, knock-down of IR{beta} expression in S100a4-lineage cells (IRcKOS100a4) was not sufficient to induce diabetic tendinopathy as no impairments in tendon gliding function or mechanical properties were observed in IRcKOS100a4 relative to WT. Collectively, these data define a murine model of diabetic tendinopathy, and demonstrate that tendon-specific, rather than systemic treatment approaches are needed.",

    "abstract": "The modular control hypothesis suggests that motor commands are built from precoded modules whose specific combined recruitment can allow the performance of virtually any motor task. Despite considerable experimental support, this hypothesis remains tentative as classical findings of reduced dimensionality in muscle activity may also result from other constraints (biomechanical couplings, data averaging or low dimensionality of motor tasks). Here we assessed the effectiveness of modularity in describing muscle activity in a comprehensive experiment comprising 72 distinct point-to-point whole-body movements during which the activity of 30 muscles was recorded. To identify invariant modules of a temporal and spatial nature, we used a space-by-time decomposition of muscle activity that has been shown to encompass classical modularity models. To examine the decompositions, we focused not only on the amount of variance they explained but also on whether the task performed on each trial could be decoded from the single-trial activations of modules. For the sake of comparison, we confronted these scores to the scores obtained from alternative non-modular descriptions of the muscle data. We found that the space-by-time decomposition was effective in terms of data approximation and task discrimination at comparable reduction of dimensionality. These findings show that few spatial and temporal modules give a compact yet approximate representation of muscle patterns carrying nearly all task-relevant information for a variety of whole-body reaching movements.",

    "abstract": "LINE-1 mobile genetic elements have shaped the mammalian genome during evolution. A minority of them have escaped fossilization which, when activated, can threaten genome integrity. We report that LINE-1 are expressed in substantia nigra ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, a class of neurons that degenerate in Parkinson disease. In Engrailed-1 heterozygotes, these neurons show a progressive degeneration that starts at 6 weeks of age, coinciding with an increase in LINE-1 expression. Similarly, DNA damage and cell death, induced by an acute oxidative stress applied to embryonic midbrain neurons in culture or to adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo, are accompanied by enhanced LINE-1 expression. Reduction of LINE-1 activity through (i) direct transcriptional repression by Engrailed, (ii) a siRNA directed against LINE-1, (iii) the nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor stavudine and (iv) viral Piwil1 expression, protects against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. We thus propose that LINE-1 overexpression triggers oxidative stress-induced DNA strand breaks and that an Engrailed adult function is to protect mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons through the repression of LINE-1 expression.",

Recently, Leuenberger et al. developed an elegant experimental approach to measure protein thermal stability at the proteome scale. The collected data allow us to rigorously test the predictions of the misfolding avoidance hypothesis that highly expressed proteins have evolved to be more stable, and that maintaining thermodynamic stability significantly constrains their evolution. Notably, careful re-analysis of the Leuenberger et al. data across four different organisms reveals no substantial correlation between protein stability and protein abundance. Therefore, the key predictions of the misfolding toxicity and related hypotheses are not supported by available empirical data. The data also suggest that, regardless of protein expression, protein stability does not substantially affect the protein molecular clock across organisms.",

    "abstract": "Human experience often involves continuous sensory information that unfolds over time. This is true in particular for speech comprehension, where continuous acoustic signals are processed over seconds or even minutes. We show that brain responses to such continuous stimuli can be investigated in detail, for magnetoencephalography (MEG) data by combining linear kernel estimation with minimum norm source localization. Previous research has shown that the requirement to average data over many trials can be overcome by modeling the brain response as a linear convolution of the stimulus and a kernel, or response function, and estimating a kernel that predicts the response from the stimulus. However, such analysis has been typically restricted to sensor space. Here we demonstrate that this analysis can also be performed in neural source space. We first computed distributed minimum norm current source estimates for continuous MEG recordings, and then computed response functions for the current estimate at each source element, using the boosting algorithm with cross-validation. Permutation tests can then assess the significance of individual predictor variables as well as features of the corresponding spatio-temporal response functions. We demonstrate the viability of this technique by computing spatio-temporal response functions for speech stimuli, using predictor variables reflecting acoustic, lexical and semantic processing. Results indicate that processes related to comprehension of continuous speech can be differentiated anatomically as well as temporally: acoustic information engaged auditory cortex at short latencies, followed by responses over the central sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus, possibly related to somatosensory/motor cortex involvement in speech perception; lexical frequency was associated with a left-lateralized response in auditory cortex and subsequent bilateral frontal activity; and semantic composition was associated with bilateral temporal and frontal brain activity. We conclude that this technique can be used to study the neural processing of continuous stimuli in time and anatomical space with the millisecond temporal resolution of MEG. This suggests new avenues for analyzing neural processing of naturalistic stimuli, without the necessity of averaging over artificially short or truncated stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Bio-macromolecules carry out complicated functions through structural changes. To understand their mechanism of action, the structure of each step has to be characterized. While classical structural biology techniques allow the characterization of a few  structural snapshots along the enzymatic cycle (usually of stable conformations), they do not cover all (and often fast interconverting) structures in the ensemble, where each may play an important functional role. Recently, several groups have demonstrated that structures of different conformations in solution could be solved by measuring multiple distances between different pairs of residues using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and using them as constrains for hybrid/integrative structural modeling. However, this approach is limited in cases where the conformational dynamics is faster than the techniques temporal resolution. In this study, we combine existing tools that elucidate sub-millisecond conformational dynamics together with hybrid/integrative structural modeling to study the conformational states of the transcription bubble in the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP)-promoter open complex (RPo). We measured microsecond alternating laser excitation sALEX)-smFRET of differently labeled lacCONS promoter dsDNA constructs. We used a combination of burst variance analysis (BVA), photon-by-photon hidden Markov modelling (H2MM) and the FRET-restrained positioning and screening (FPS) approach to identify two conformational states for RPo. The experimentally-derived distances of one conformational state match the known crystal structure of bacterial RPo. The experimentally-derived distances of the other conformational state have characteristics of a scrunched RPo. These findings support the hypothesis that sub-millisecond dynamics in the transcription bubble are responsible for transcription start site selection.",

In a previous study, we generated floxed Slc6a8 (Slc6a8flox) mice to create ubiquitous Slc6a8 knockout (Slc6a8-/y) mice. Slc6a8-/y mice lacked whole body Cr and exhibited cognitive deficits. While Slc6a8-/y mice have a similar biochemical phenotype to CTD patients, they also showed a reduction in size and reductions in swim speed that may have contributed to the observed deficits. To address this, we created brain-specific Slc6a8 knockout (bKO) mice by crossing Slc6a8Flox mice with Nestin-cre mice. bKO mice had reduced cerebral Cr levels while maintaining normal Cr levels in peripheral tissue. Interestingly, brain concentrations of the Cr synthesis precursor guanidinoacetic acid were increased in bKO mice. bKO mice had longer latencies and path lengths in the Morris water maze, without reductions in swim speed. In accordance with data from Slc6a8-/y mice, bKO mice showed deficits in novel object recognition as well as contextual and cued fear conditioning. bKO mice were also hyperactive, in contrast with data from the Slc6a8-/y mice. The results demonstrate that the loss of cerebral Cr is responsible for the learning and memory deficits seen in ubiquitous Slc6a8-/y mice.",

Thus, identifying the optimal control policy in response to an emerging disease outbreak is a key challenge for policy-makers. To inform this aim, a common approach is to carry out simulation studies comparing plausible strategies, while accounting for known capacity restrictions. In this study we perform simulations of a previously developed H5N1 influenza transmission model framework, fitted to two separate historical outbreaks, to assess specific control objectives related to the burden or duration of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry farms in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh. In particular, we explore the optimal implementation of ring culling, ring vaccination and active surveillance measures when presuming disease transmission predominately occurs from premises-to-premises, versus a setting requiring the inclusion of external factors. Additionally, we determine the sensitivity of the management actions under consideration to differing levels of capacity constraints and outbreaks with disparate transmission dynamics. While we find that reactive culling and vaccination policies should pay close attention to these factors to ensure intervention targeting is optimised, across multiple settings the top performing control action amongst those under consideration were targeted proactive surveillance schemes. Our findings may advise the type of control measure, plus its intensity, that could potentially be applied in the event of a developing outbreak of H5N1 amongst originally H5N1 virus-free commercially-reared poultry in the Dhaka division of Bangladesh.",

In order to globally characterize activities of TFs in cells, we have developed a novel massively parallel protein activity assay, Active TF Identification (ATI) that measures DNA-binding activity of all TFs from any species or tissue type. In contrast to previous studies based on mRNA expression or protein abundance, we found that a set of TFs binding to only around ten distinct motifs display strong DNA-binding activity in any given cell or tissue type. Mass spectrometric identification of TFs revealed that within these highly active TFs, there were both housekeeping TFs, which were universally found in all cell types, and specific TFs, which were highly enriched in known factors that determine the fate of the analyzed tissue or cell type. The importance of a small subset of TFs for determining the overall accessible chromatin landscape of a cell suggests that gene regulatory logic may be simpler than what has previously been appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Histone modifications play important roles in gene regulation, heredity, imprinting, and many human diseases including diabetes, obesity, and cancer. The histone code is complex and consists of more than 100 marks. Therefore, biologists need computational tools to characterize general signatures representing the distributions of tens of chromatin marks around thousands of regions. To this end, we developed a software tool called HebbPlot, which utilizes a Hebb neural network in learning a general chromatin signature from regions with a common function. Hebb networks can learn the associations between tens of marks and thousands of regions. This is the first application of Hebb networks in the epigenetics field. HebbPlot presents a signature as a digitized image, in which a bright pixel indicates the presence of a mark around a part of the genetic element, and a black pixel indicates the absence of the mark. A row of pixels represents one mark. Similar rows are clustered in the image. We validated HebbPlot on synthetic data and on 111 epigenomes provided by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. HebbPlot was able to retrieve distinct chromatin signatures for promoters, enhancers, and genes active in each of the 111 cell types. Our analysis reveals that active promoters have a directional signature; marks such as H3K79(me1/me2), H3K4(me1,me2,me3), and H3K9ac stretch toward coding regions. The plots of inactive promoters show that H3K27me3 is consistently present around them. Further, the signatures of enhancers that are fully included in repetitive regions are almost identical to those located outside repeats, indicating that transposons have an enhancer-like function in the human genome. Furthermore, the chromatin signature of active elements consists of the presence of H3K79me1 and the absence of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. In sum, HebbPlot is a general tool that can be applied to wide array of studies, facilitating the deciphering of the histone code.\\n\\nAuthor summaryChromatin marks have gained much attention because of their important roles in gene regulation, cell differentiation, Lamarckian inheritance, and imprinting. A chromatin signature of a genetic element, such as genes or enhancers, consists of multiple marks and may differ from a tissue to a tissue. Currently, tens of histone modifications are known. Several marks of more than 100 human cell types have been determined. Many epigenomes of other normal and pathological cell types will be available soon.\\n\\nExtracting a chromatin signature representing the distributions of tens of marks around thousands of regions is a challenging task. Hebb networks are a special type of artificial neural networks known for their ability to learn associations. We developed a software tool called HebbPlot. The tool uses a Hebb network to learn how a mark is distributed around a set of regions that have the same function, e.g. promoters active in the same tissue. HebbPlot produces a pattern representing mark distributions around all of the regions. Mark patterns are clustered based on their similarity to one another. Then a digitized image representing the learned pattern is generated. HebbPlot will help biologist with characterizing and visualizing chromatin signatures in numerous studies.",

    "abstract": "The sensory recruitment hypothesis states that visual short term memory is maintained in the same visual cortical areas that initially encode a stimulus features. Although it is well established that the distance between features in visual cortex determines their visibility, a limitation known as crowding, it is unknown whether short term memory is similarly constrained by the cortical spacing of memory items. Here we investigated whether the cortical spacing between sequentially presented memoranda affects the fidelity of memory in humans (of both sexes). In a first experiment, we varied cortical spacing by taking advantage of the log-scaling of visual cortex with eccentricity, sequentially presenting memoranda in peripheral vision along either the radial or tangential visual axis with respect to the fovea. In a second experiment, we sequentially presented memoranda either within or beyond the critical spacing of visual crowding, a distance within which visual features cannot be perceptually distinguished due to their nearby cortical representations. In both experiments and across multiple measures, we found strong evidence that the ability to maintain visual features in memory is unaffected by cortical spacing. These results indicate that the neural architecture underpinning working memory has properties inconsistent with the known behaviour of sensory neurons in visual cortex. Instead, the dissociation between perceptual and memory representations supports a role of higher cortical areas, such as posterior parietal or prefrontal regions, or may involve an as yet unspecified mechanism in visual cortex in which stimulus features are bound to their temporal order.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAlthough much is known about the resolution with which we can remember visual objects, the cortical representation of items held in short term memory remains contentious. A popular hypothesis suggests that memory of visual features is maintained via the recruitment of the same neural architecture in sensory cortex that encodes stimuli. We investigated this claim by manipulating the spacing in visual cortex between sequentially presented memoranda such that some items shared cortical representations more than others, while preventing perceptual interference between stimuli. We found clear evidence that short term memory is independent of the intra-cortical spacing of memoranda, revealing a dissociation between perceptual and memory representations. Our data indicate that working memory relies on different neural mechanisms from sensory perception.",

It can also be harnessed to control external devices for Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications. While the classic event-related potential (ERP) is appropriate for isolated stimuli, more sophisticated \\\"decoding\\\" strategies are needed to address ongoing stimuli such as speech, music or environmental sounds. Here we describe an approach based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) that finds the optimal transform to apply to both stimulus and response to reveal correlations between the two. Compared to prior methods based on forward or backward models for stimulus-response mapping, CCA finds significantly higher correlation scores, thus providing increased sensitivity to relatively small effects, and supports classifier schemes that yield higher classification scores. CCA strips the brain response of variance unrelated to the stimulus, and the stimulus representation of variance that does not affect the response, and thus improves our observation of the relation between stimulus and response.",

    "abstract": "Human cognition requires the coordination of neural activity across widespread brain networks. Here we describe a new mechanism for large-scale coordination in the human brain: traveling waves of theta and alpha oscillations. Examining direct brain recordings from neurosurgical patients performing a memory task, we found that contiguous clusters of cortex in individual patients showed oscillations at specific frequencies in the range of 2 to 15 Hz. These clusters displayed spatial phase gradients, indicating that individual oscillation cycles moved across the cortex at ~0.25-0.75 m/s. We found that traveling waves were relevant behaviorally because their propagation correlated with task events and was more consistent during good performance. Traveling waves showed a correlation between propagation speed and temporal frequency, which suggests that they propagate across the cortex following principles of phase-coupled oscillatory networks. By demonstrating that theta and alpha traveling waves are widespread and behaviorally relevant, our results suggest a broad role for brain oscillations in supporting cortical connectivity by organizing neural activity across space and time.",

Using simulations and single-molecule RNA counting, we examined how cellular processes influence cell-to-cell variability (noise). The results show that RNA noise is amplified in the cytoplasm compared to the nucleus in ~85% of genes across diverse promoters, genomic loci, and cell types (human and mouse). Surprisingly, measurements show further amplification of RNA noise in the cytoplasm, fitting a model of biphasic mRNA conversion between translation- and degradation-competent states. The multi-state translation-degradation of mRNA also causes substantial noise amplification in protein levels, ultimately accounting for ~74% of intrinsic protein variability in cell populations. Overall, the results demonstrate how transcriptional bursts are intrinsically amplified by mRNA processing and indicate mechanisms through which noise could act as a substrate for evolutionary selection.",

Combining functional imaging and psychophysics, we examined if color from long-range filling-in engages distinct pathways from responses caused by a field of uniform chromaticity. We find that color from filling-in is best classified and best correlated with appearance by two dorsal areas, V3A and V3B/KO. In contrast, a field of uniform chromaticity is best classified by ventral areas hV4 and LO. Dynamic causal modeling revealed feedback modulation from area V3A to areas V1 and LO for filling-in, contrasting with feedback from LO modulating areas V1 and V3A for a matched uniform chromaticity. These results indicate a dorsal stream role in color filling-in via feedback modulation of area V1 coupled with a cross-stream modulation of ventral areas suggesting that local and contextual influences on color appearance engage distinct neural networks.",

Population-based studies suggest a marked decline in incidence, prevalence and deaths, mostly likely due to treatment expansion, in countries in East and Southern Africa. This calls into question the ART efficacy, effectiveness and coverage parameters used by many modelers to project HIV incidence and prevalence.\\n\\nMethodsFor 2015 and 2016 we reviewed global and national mathematical modeling studies regarding ART impact (with or without other HIV prevention interventions) and/or 90-90-90 on either new HIV infections or investment or both. We reviewed these HIV epidemiologic and costing models for their structure and parameterization around ART; we directly compared two models to illustrate differences in outcome.\\n\\nResultsThe nine models published in 2015 or 2016 included parameters for ART effectiveness ranging from 20% to 86% for ART effectiveness. Model 1 limits eligibility for ART initiation to 80% coverage of people living with HIV and with a CD4+ cell count below 350 cells/L, 70% retention, and ART reduces transmission by 80%, with a derived ART effectiveness of 20%. Model 2 assumes 90-90-90 by 2020 (i.e., 73% viral suppression of estimated PLHIV), ART reduces transmission by 96% in those on ART and virally suppressed, and by 88% in those on ART but not virally suppressed with a derived effectiveness of 86% and consequent decline towards ending AIDS and HIV elimination. ART parameter selection and assumptions dominate and low ART effectiveness translates into lower impact.\\n\\nDiscussionUsing more realistic parameters for ART effectiveness suggests that through expanding access and supporting sustainable viral suppression it will be possible to significantly reduce transmission and eliminate HIV in many settings.",

It is well known that the microorganisms play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of different elements. However, the precise role of bacteria in regulating the concentration of arsenic in Brahmaputra valley has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we report the isolation of arsenic resistant bacterium TA6 with active arsenate reduction efficiency. The isolate was able to grow in arsenate concentration (250 mM) and arsenite (30 mM). Along with resistance to inorganic arsenic, it showed cross-tolerance to other heavy metals like Hg+2, Cd+2, Co+2, Ni+2, Cr+2. The bacterium also had a high siderophore activity (78.7 {+/-} 0.004 mol), which is positively correlated with the resistance aptitude. The biochemical test showed the TA6, a gram-positive bacterium which can hydrolyze starch and casein, produce catalase enzyme and utilizes citrate as a metabolic trait. Molecular and chemotaxonomic identification of TA6 based on 16S rRNA and FMAE analysis showed similarity with members of Staphylococcus genus with significant difference in sequence similarity and fatty acid composition. Based on 16S rRNA and FAME analysis it was identified as Staphylococcus sp. TA6. Rate of biotransformation showed bacterium could reduce ~88.2% of initial 2mM As(V) into As(III).

Among sites bearing both SNPs and DNMs, DNMs in controls occurred significantly more frequent than DNMs in ASD at reference allele sites bearing C or G nucleotides, indicating depletion of ASD associated DNMs in known regions of hypermutability or less functional constraints such as CpG sites. We also analyzed the nucleotide compositions of DNMs and the parity (1:1 ratio) of pyrimidines and purines. We found that DNMs in ASD showed overall lower AT content than that in controls. Parity violations and AT bias in DNMs occurred at expected frequency based on chance in both ASD and controls. These results show enrichment of DNMs at positions bearing SNP sites and C or G sites in normal subjects and less so in ASD, which is not expected from the neutral model, and indicate that DNMs are on average more deleterious in ASD than in controls.",

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor, provides a case in point. Despite well-established differences in incidence, and emerging indications of differences in outcome, there are few insights that distinguish male and female GBM at the molecular level, or allow specific targeting of these biological differences. Here, using a quantitative imaging-based measure of response, we found that temozolomide chemotherapy is more effective in female compared to male GBM patients. We then applied a novel computational algorithm to linked GBM transcriptome and outcome data, and identified novel sex-specific molecular subtypes of GBM in which cell cycle and integrin signaling were identified as the critical determinants of survival for male and female patients, respectively. The clinical utility of cell cycle and integrin signaling pathway signatures was further established through correlations between gene expression and in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity in a panel of male and female patient-derived GBM cell lines. Together these results suggest that greater precision in GBM molecular subtyping can be achieved through sex-specific analyses, and that improved outcome for all patients might be accomplished via tailoring treatment to sex differences in molecular mechanisms.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMale and female glioblastoma are biologically distinct and maximal chances for cure may require sex-specific approaches to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Under neutrality, linkage disequilibrium (LD) results from physically linked sites having non-independent coalescent histories. In obligately sexual organisms, meiotic recombination is the dominant force separating linked variants from one another, and thus in determining the decay of LD with physical distance. In facultatively sexual diploid organisms that principally reproduce clonally, mechanisms of mitotic exchange are expected to become relatively more important in shaping LD. Here we outline mathematical and computational models of a facultative-sex coalescent process that includes meiotic and mitotic recombination, via both crossovers and gene conversion, to determine how LD is affected with facultative sex. We demonstrate that the degree to which LD is broken down by meiotic recombination simply scales with the probability of sex if it is sufficiently high (much greater than 1/N for N the population size). However, with very rare sex (occurring with frequency on the order of 1/N), mitotic gene conversion plays a particularly important and complicated role because it both breaks down associations between sites and removes within-individual diversity. Strong population structure under rare sex leads to lower average LD values than in panmictic populations, due to the influence of low-frequency polymorphisms created by allelic sequence divergence acting in individual subpopulations. These analyses provide information on how to interpret observed LD patterns in facultative sexuals, and determine what genomic forces are likely to shape them.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive cancer originating from mature B-cells. Many known driver mutations are over-represented in one of its two molecular subgroups, knowledge of which has aided in the development of therapeutics that target these features. The heterogeneity of DLBCL determined through prior genomic analysis suggests an incomplete understanding of its molecular aetiology, with a limited diversity of genetic events having thus far been attributed to the activated B-cell (ABC) subgroup. Through an integrative genomic analysis we uncovered genes and non-coding loci that are commonly mutated in DLBCL including putative regulatory sequences. We implicate recurrent mutations in the 3UTR of NFKBIZ as a novel mechanism of oncogene deregulation and found small amplifications associated with over-expression of FC-{gamma} receptor genes. These results inform on mechanisms of NF-{kappa}B pathway activation in ABC DLBCL and may reveal a high-risk population of patients that might not benefit from standard therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Genomic scale duplication of genes generates raw genetic material, which may facilitate new adaptations for the organism. Previous studies on eels have reported specific gene duplications, however a species-specific large-scale gene duplication has never before been proposed. In this study, we have assembled a de novo European eel transcriptome and the data show more than a thousand gene duplications that happened, according to a 4dTv analysis, after the teleost specific 3R whole genome duplication (WGD). The European eel has a complex and peculiar life cycle, which involves extensive migration, drastic habitat changes and metamorphoses, all of which could have been facilitated by the genes derived from this large-scale gene duplication.\\n\\nOf the paralogs created, those with a lower genetic distance are mostly found in tandem repeats, indicating that they are young segmental duplications. The older eel paralogs showed a different pattern, with more extensive synteny suggesting that a Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) event may have happened in the eel lineage. Furthermore, an enrichment analysis of eel specific paralogs further revealed GO-terms typically enriched after a WGD. Thus, this study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to present evidence indicating an Anguillidae family specific large-scale gene duplication, which may include a 4R WGD.",

Finally, we developed a machine learning-based prediction tool for 70 sub-tissue cell types, which we used to predict cellular expression differences in IIS/FOXO signaling, stage-specific TGF-b activity, and basal vs. memory-induced CREB transcription.

We developed a multiplexed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay targeting 14 common allergens in order to survey how frequently these precautionary statements indicate allergen contamination and to assess whether variations in precautionary phrasing affect the likelihood of allergen contamination. A survey of 84 foods revealed how scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transition interference derived from complex and heterogeneous sample matrices hinders sensitive analyte detection. As a solution, we developed MAtrix-Dependent Interference Correction (MADIC), an approach to sensitively detect trace peptide quantities through interference identification and stringent peptide quality control criteria. Applying this method, we find frequent contamination of soy in breads and corn flour, and observe additional instances of food contamination with tree nuts, wheat, milk, and egg. In some of these cases, the food had no precautionary labeling for the offending allergen. We also find that only 10% of warning labels are indicative of contamination, and that products with \\\"same facility\\\" precautionary labeling are not necessarily less likely to contain trace amounts of allergens than products labeled \\\"may contain.\\\"",

    "abstract": "The influence of cortical cell spiking activity on nearby cells has been studied extensively in vitro. Less is known, however, about the impact of single cell firing on local cortical networks in vivo. In a pioneering study, Kwan et al. (Kwan et al., 2012) reported that in mouse layer 2/3 (L2/3), under anesthesia, stimulating a single pyramidal cell recruits ~1.7% of neighboring pyramidal units. Here we employ two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with single-cell patch clamp stimulation, to probe, in both the awake and lightly anesthetized states, how i) activating single L2/3 pyramidal neurons recruits neighboring units within L2/3 and from layer 4 (L4) to L2/3, and whether ii) activating single pyramidal neurons changes population activity in local circuit. To do this, it was essential to develop an algorithm capable of quantifying how sensitive the calcium signal is at detecting effectively recruited units (\\\"followers\\\"). This algorithm allowed us to estimate the chance of detecting a follower as a function of the probability that an epoch of stimulation elicits one extra action potential (AP) in the follower cell. Using this approach, we found only a small fraction (<0.75%) of L2/3 cells to be significantly activated within a radius of ~200 m from a stimulated neighboring L2/3 pyramidal cell. This fraction did not change significantly in the awake versus the lightly anesthetized state, nor when stimulating L2/3 versus underlying L4 pyramidal neurons. These numbers are in general agreement with, though lower than, the percentage of neighboring cells (2.1%) reported by Kwan et al. to be activated upon stimulating single L2/3 pyramidal neurons under anesthesia (Kwan et al., 2012). Interestingly, despite the small number of individual units found to be reliably driven, we did observe a modest but significant elevation in aggregate population responses compared to sham stimulation. This underscores the distributed impact that single cell stimulation has on neighboring microcircuit responses, revealing only a small minority of relatively strongly connected partners.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPatch-clamp stimulation in conjunction with 2-photon imaging shows that activating single layer-2/3 or layer-4 pyramidal neurons produces few (<1% of local units) reliable singlecell followers in L2/3 of mouse area V1, either under light anesthesia or in quiet wakefulness: instead, single cell stimulation was found to elevate aggregate population activity in a weak but highly distributed fashion.",

    "abstract": "Improvement of crop drought resistance and water use efficiency (WUE) has been a major endeavor in agriculture. ERECTA is the first identified major effector of water use efficiency. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we report a genetic pathway, composed of EDT1/HDG11, ERECTA, and E2Fa loci, which regulates water use efficiency by modulating stomatal density. The HD-START transcription factor EDT1/HDG11 transcriptionally activates ERECTA expression by binding to an HD cis-element in the ERECTA promoter. ERECTA in turn relies on E2Fa to control the expression of cell-cycle related genes and the transition from mitosis to endocycle, which leads to increased nuclear DNA content in leaf cells, and therefore increased cell size and decreased stomatal density. The decreased stomatal density improves plant WUE. Our study demonstrates the EDT1/HDG11-ERECTA-E2Fa genetic pathway that reduces stomatal density by increasing cell size, providing a new avenue to improve WUE of crops.",

    "abstract": "Thrombin-derived C-terminal peptides (TCP) of about 2 kDa are present in wounds, where they exert anti-endotoxic functions. In an effort to elucidate the structural and molecular aspects of these functions, we here employ a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), ellipsometry, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) measurements, and in silico multiscale modeling to define interactions and the bound conformation of a TCP generated by neutrophil elastase, HVF18 (HVFRLKKWIQKVIDQFGE) in complex with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast to the disordered state of HVF18 in aqueous solution, its binding to LPS leads to a structural transition, wherein the N- terminus of the peptide forms a unique {beta}-turn whilst the C-terminus becomes helical. In silico modelling and simulations demonstrated that HVF18, as well as related peptides, target the LPS-binding site of CD14, and this interaction was experimentally supported using microscale thermophoresis. Collectively, the results demonstrate the role of structural transitions in LPS complex formation as well as in CD 14 interaction, and provide a molecular explanation for the previously observed therapeutic effects of TCPs in experimental models of bacterial sepsis and endotoxin shock.\\n\\nSignificanceThrombin-derived C-terminal peptides (TCPs) of various sizes are present in human wounds, where they bind bacteria as well as \\\"free\\\" lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and thereby reduce inflammation. In this work, employing a combination of cellular, biophysical and structural studies, combined with in silico multiscale modeling, we present the molecular structure of a TCP in association with LPS, and define a previously undisclosed interaction between TCPs and CD14. Further, we show that TCPs exhibit relatively weak but specific affinities, all in the M range, to both LPS and CD14. These novel structural insights into the function of this class of host-defense molecules will facilitate rational design of novel \\\"dual function\\\" anti-infectives, which target both bacteria and inflammatory signaling.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, the germband forms directly on the egg surface and solely consists of embryonic tissue. In contrast, most insect embryos undergo a complicated set of tissue rearrangements to generate a condensed, multi-layered germband. The ventral side of the germband is embryonic, while the dorsal side is thought to be an extraembryonic tissue called the amnion. While this tissue organisation has been accepted for decades, and has been widely reported in insects, its accuracy has not been directly tested in any species. Using live cell tracking and differential cell labelling in the short germ beetle Tribolium castaneum, I show that most of the cells previously thought to be amnion actually give rise to large parts of the embryo. This process occurs via the dorsal-to-ventral flow of cells and contributes to germband extension. In addition, I show that true  amnion cells in Tribolium originate from a small region of the blastoderm. Together, my findings show that development in the short germ embryos of Tribolium and the long germ embryos of Drosophila is more similar than previously proposed. Dorsal-to-ventral cell flow also occurs in Drosophila during germband extension, and I argue that the flow is driven by a conserved set of underlying morphogenetic events in both species. Furthermore, the revised Tribolium fatemap that I present is far more similar to that of Drosophila than the classic Tribolium fatemap. Lastly, my findings show that there is no qualitative difference between the tissue structure of the cellularised blastoderm and the short/intermediate germ germband. As such, the same tissue patterning mechanisms could function continuously throughout the cellularised blastoderm and germband stages, and easily shift between them over evolutionary time.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn many animals, certain groups of cells in the embryo do not directly contribute to adult structures. Instead, these cells generate so-called  extra-embryonic tissues that support and facilitate development, but degenerate prior to birth/hatching. In most insect species, embryos are described as having two major extra-embryonic tissues; the serosa, which encapsulates the entire embryo and yolk, and the amnion, which covers one side of the embryo. This tissue structure has been widely reported for over a century, but detailed studies on the amnion are lacking. Working in the beetle Tribolium castaneum, I used long-term fluorescent live imaging, cell tracking and differential cell labelling to investigate amnion development. In contrast to our current understanding, I show that most cells previously thought to be amnion actually form large parts of the embryo. In addition, I show how these cells  flow as a whole tissue and contribute to elongation of the embryo, and how only a relatively small number of cells form the actual amnion. Lastly, I describe how my findings show that despite exhibiting substantial differences in overall structure, embryos of Tribolium and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, utilise a conserved set of morphogenetic processes.",

Small outbreaks of invasive wound mucormycosis (IWM) have already been reported in burn units without extensive microbiological investigations. We faced an outbreak of IWM in our center and investigated the clinical isolates with whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis.\\n\\nWe analyzed M. circinelloides isolates from patients in our burn unit (BU1) together with non-outbreak isolates from burn unit 2 (BU2, Paris area) and from France over a two-year period (2013-2015). For each isolate, WGS and a de novo genome assembly was performed from read data extracted from the aligned contig sequences of the reference genome (1006PhL).\\n\\nA total of 21 isolates were sequenced including 14 isolates from six BU1 patients. Phylogenetic classification showed that the clinical isolates clustered in four highly divergent clades. Clade1 contained at least one of the strains from the six epidemiologically-linked BU1 patients. The clinical isolates seemed specific to each patient. Two patients were infected with more than two strains from different clades suggesting that an environmental reservoir of clonally unrelated isolates was the source of contamination. Only two patients shared one strain in BU1, suggesting direct transmission or contamination with the same environmental source.\\n\\nWGS coupled with precise epidemiological data and analysis of several isolates per patients revealed in our study a complex situation with both potential cross-transmission and multiple contaminations with a heterogeneous pool of strains from a cryptic environmental reservoir.\\n\\nImportanceInvasive wound mucormycosis (IWM) is a severe infection due to the environmental molds belonging to the order Mucorales. Severely burned patients are particularly at risk for IWM. Here, we used Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis to resolve an outbreak of IWM due to Mucor circinelloides that occurred in our hospital (BU1). We sequenced 21 clinical isolates, including 14 from BU1 and 7 unrelated isolates, and compared them to the reference genome (1006PhL). This analysis revealed that the outbreak was mainly due to multiple strains that seemed patient-specific, suggesting that the patients were more likely infected from a pool of diverse strains from the environment rather than from direct transmission between the patients. This study revealed the complexity of a Mucorales outbreak in the settings of IWM in burn patients, which has been highlighted based on whole genome sequencing and careful sampling.",

Pain ratings were significantly reduced after mobilization, and mobility of the trunk was significantly increased. Concomitantly, a significant increase in ADCall values was observed. The greatest ADCall changes were observed at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels and were mainly explained by changes in ADCant and ADCpost. The simultaneous reduction in pain and increase of water diffusion within nucleus pulposus has has been previously observed in subjects with chronic conditions and exists in the acute phase of the disease.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic variation has been associated with a wide range of adaptive phenotypes in plants, but there exist few direct means for exploiting this variation. RNAi suppression of the plant-specific gene, MutS HOMOLOG1 (MSH1), in multiple plant species produces a range of developmental changes accompanied by modulation of defense, phytohormone, and abiotic stress response pathways. This msh1-conditioned developmental reprogramming is retained independent of transgene segregation, giving rise to transgene-null  memory effects. An isogenic memory line crossed to wild type produces progeny families displaying increased variation in adaptive traits that respond to selection. This study investigates amenability of the MSH1 system for inducing epigenetic variation in soybean that may be of value agronomically. We developed epi-line populations by crossing with msh1-acquired soybean memory lines. Derived soybean epi-lines showed increase in variance for multiple yield-related traits including pods per plant, seed weight, and maturity time in both greenhouse and field trials. Selected epi-F2:4 and epi-F2:5 lines showed an increase in seed yield over wild type. By epi-F2:6, we observed a return of MSH1-derived enhanced growth back to wild type levels. Epi-populations also showed evidence of reduced epitype-by-environment (e x E) interaction, indicating higher yield stability. Transcript profiling of the soybean epi-lines identified putative signatures of enhanced growth behavior across generations. Genes related to cell cycle, abscisic acid biosynthesis, and auxin-response, particularly SMALL AUXIN UP RNAs (SAURs), were differentially expressed in epi-F2:4 lines that showed increased yield when compared to epi-F2:6. These data support the potential of msh1-derived epigenetic variation in plant breeding for enhanced yield and yield stability.",

    "abstract": "Incubation represents a life stage of crucial importance for the optimal development of avian embryos. For most birds, incubation poses a trade-off between investing in self-maintenance and offspring care. Furthermore, incubation is affected by environmental temperatures and, therefore, will be likely impacted by climate change. Despite its relevance and readily available temperature logging methods, avian incubation research is hindered by recognised limitations in available software. In this paper, a new quantitative approach to analyse incubation behaviour is presented. This new approach is embedded in a free R package, incR. The flexibility of the R environment eases the analysis, validation and visualisation of incubation temperature data. The core algorithm in incR is validated here and it is shown that the method extracts accurate metrics of incubation behaviour (e.g. number and duration of incubation bouts). This paper also presents a suggested workflow along with detailed R code to aid the practical implementation of incR.",

    "abstract": "In the first longitudinal study of bat microbiomes, we find that unlike the pattern described in humans and other mammals, the prominent dynamics in Egyptian fruit bats fur microbiomes are those of change over time at the level of the colony as a whole. Thus, on average, a pair of fur microbiome samples from different individuals in the same colony collected on the same date are more similar to one another than a pair of samples from the same individual collected at different time points. This pattern suggests that the whole colony may be the appropriate biological unit for understanding some of the roles of the host microbiome in social bats ecology and evolution. This pattern of synchronized colony changes over time is also reflected in the profile of volatile compounds in the bats fur, but differs from the more individualized pattern found in the bats gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation among orthologous proteins can cause cryptic phenotypic properties that only manifest in changing environments. Such variation may also impact the evolutionary potential of proteins, but the molecular basis for this remains unclear. Here we perform comparative directed evolution in which four orthologous metallo-{beta}-lactamases were evolved toward a new function. We found that genetic variation between these enzymes resulted in distinct evolutionary outcomes. The ortholog with the lower initial activity reached a 20-fold higher fitness plateau exclusively via increasing catalytic activity. By contrast, the ortholog with the highest initial activity evolved to a less-optimal and phenotypically distinct outcome through changes in expression, oligomerization and activity. We show that the cryptic molecular properties and conformational variation of residues in the initial genotypes cause epistasis, thereby constraining evolutionary outcomes. Our work highlights that understanding the molecular details relating genetic variation to protein functions is essential to predicting the evolution of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Mitosis encompasses key molecular changes including chromatin condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and reduced transcription levels. Immediately after mitosis, the interphase chromatin structure is reestablished and transcription resumes. The reestablishment of the interphase chromatin is probably achieved by  bookmarking, i.e., the retention of at least partial information during mitosis. Yet, while recent studies demonstrate that chromatin accessibility is generally preserved during mitosis and is only locally modulated, the exact details of the bookmarking process and its components are still unclear. To gain a deeper understanding of the mitotic bookmarking process, we merged proteomics, immunofluorescence, and ChIP-seq approaches to study the mitotic and interphase genomic organization of human cells. We focused on key histone modifications and employed HeLa-S3 cells as a model system. Generally, we observed a global concordance between the genomic organization of histone modifications in interphase and mitosis, yet the abundance of the two types of modifications we investigated was different. Whereas histone methylation patterns remain highly similar, histone acetylation patterns show a general reduction while maintaining their genomic organization. These results demonstrate that the epigenomic landscape can serve as a major component of the mitotic bookmarking process. Next, to further investigate mitosis-associated chromatin changes, we followed up on previous studies that showed that nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) become occupied by a nucleosome during mitosis. Surprisingly, we observed that the nucleosome introduced into the NDR during mitosis encompasses a distinctive set of histone modifications, differentiating it from the surrounding nucleosomes. We show that the nucleosomes near the NDR appear to both shift into the NDR during mitosis and adopt a unique modification pattern. HDAC inhibition by the small molecule TSA reverts this pattern. These results provide evidence for a mitotic deposition and change in the modifications of the nucleosomes surrounding the NDR. Altogether, by merging multiple approaches, our study provides evidence to support a model where mitotic bookmarking is achieved by histone modifications and uncovers new insights into the deposition of nucleosomes during mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Gut bacteria can affect key aspects of host fitness, such as development, fecundity, and lifespan, while the host in turn shapes the gut microbiome. Microbiomes co-evolve with their hosts and have been implicated in host speciation. However, it is unclear to what extent individual species versus community interactions within the microbiome are linked to host fitness. Here we combinatorially dissect the natural microbiome of Drosophila melanogaster and reveal that interactions between bacteria shape host fitness through life history tradeoffs. We find that the same microbial interactions that shape host fitness also shape microbiome abundances, suggesting a potential evolutionary mechanism by which microbiome communities (rather than just individual species) may be intertwined in co-selection with their hosts. Empirically, we made germ-free flies colonized with each possible combination of the five core species of fly gut bacteria. We measured the resulting bacterial community abundances and fly fitness traits including development, reproduction, and lifespan. The fly gut promoted bacterial diversity, which in turn accelerated development, reproduction, and aging: flies that reproduced more died sooner. From these measurements we calculated the impact of bacterial interactions on fly fitness by adapting the mathematics of genetic epistasis to the microbiome. Host physiology phenotypes were highly dependent on interactions between bacterial species. Higher-order interactions (involving 3, 4, and 5 species) were widely prevalent and impacted both host physiology and the maintenance of gut diversity. The parallel impacts of bacterial interactions on the microbiome and on host fitness suggest that microbiome interactions may be key drivers of evolution.\\n\\nSignificanceAll animals have associated microbial communities called microbiomes that can influence the physiology and fitness of their host. It is unclear to what extent individual microbial species versus ecology of the microbiome influences fitness of the host. Here we mapped all the possible interactions between individual species of bacteria with each other and with the hosts physiology. Our approach revealed that the same bacterial interactions that shape microbiome abundances also shape host fitness traits. This relationship provides a feedback that may favor the emergence of co-evolving microbiome-host units.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin and derivatives are commonly used as chemotherapeutic agents. Although the cytotoxic action of cisplatin on cancer cells is very efficient, clinical oncologists need to deal with two major difficulties: (i) the onset of resistance to the drug, and (ii) the cytotoxic effect in patients. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate factors influencing the response to cisplatin in multicellular organisms. In this hermaphroditic model organism, we observed that sperm failure is a major cause in cisplatin-induced infertility. RNA-seq data indicate that cisplatin triggers a systemic stress response in which DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/Nrf2, two conserved transcription factors, are key regulators. We determined that inhibition of the DNA-damage induced apoptotic pathway does not confer cisplatin protection to the animal. However, mutants for the pro-apoptotic BH3-only gene ced-13 are sensitive to cisplatin, suggesting a protective role of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Finally, we demonstrate that our system can also be used to identify mutations providing resistance to cisplatin and therefore potential biomarkers of innate cisplatin-refractory patients. We show that mutants for the redox regulator trxr-1, ortholog of the mammalian Thioredoxin-Reductase-1 TrxR1, display cisplatin resistance and that such resistance relies on a single selenocysteine residue.",

After adjusting for age and research domain, the predicted probability of funding success in traditional programs was 0.9 percentage points higher for male than for female principal investigators (OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.854-1.022).

We present the somatic mutation landscape of 70 cancer genes from cfDNA deep-sequencing analysis of 21,807 patients with treated, late-stage cancers across >50 cancer types. Patterns and prevalence of cfDNA alterations in major driver genes for non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancer largely recapitulated those from tumor tissue sequencing compendia (TCGA and COSMIC), with the principle differences in alteration prevalence being due to patient treatment. This highly sensitive cfDNA sequencing assay revealed numerous subclonal tumor-derived alterations, expected as a result of clonal evolution, but leading to an apparent departure from mutual exclusivity in treatment-naive tumors. To facilitate interpretation of this added complexity, we developed methods to identify cfDNA copy-number driver alterations and cfDNA clonality. Upon applying these methods, robust mutual exclusivity was observed among predicted truncal driver cfDNA alterations, in effect distinguishing tumor-initiating alterations from secondary alterations. Treatment-associated resistance, including both novel alterations and parallel evolution, was common in the cfDNA cohort and was enriched in patients with targetable driver alterations. Together these retrospective analyses of a large set of cfDNA deep-sequencing data reveal subclonal structures and emerging resistance in advanced solid tumors.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, copy number (CN) variation has emerged as a new and significant source of genetic polymorphisms contributing to the phenotypic diversity of populations. CN variants are defined as genetic loci that, due to duplication and deletion, vary in their number of copies across individuals in a population. CN variants range in size from 50 base pairs to whole chromosomes, can influence gene activity, and are associated with a wide range of phenotypes in diverse organisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this review, we introduce CN variation, discuss the genetic and molecular mechanisms implicated in its generation, how they can contribute to genetic and phenotypic diversity in fungal populations, and consider how CN variants may influence wine yeast adaptation in fermentation-related processes. In particular, we focus on reviewing recent work investigating the contribution of changes in CN of fermentation-related genes associated with the adaptation and domestication of yeast wine strains and offer notable illustrations of such changes, including the high levels of CN variation among the CUP genes, which confer resistance to copper, and the preferential deletion and duplication of the MALI and MAL3 loci, respectively, which are responsible for metabolizing maltose and sucrose. Based on the available data, we propose that CN variation is a substantial dimension of yeast genetic diversity that occurs largely independent of single nucleotide polymorphisms. As such, CN variation harbors considerable potential for understanding and manipulating yeast strains in the wine fermentation environment and beyond.",

    "abstract": "In sexually reproducing organisms, speciation involves the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms that decrease gene flow. Premating reproductive isolation, often the result of mate choice, is a major obstacle to gene flow between species because it acts earlier in the life cycle than other isolating barriers. While female choice is often considered the default mode in animal species, research in the butterfly genus Heliconius, a frequent subject of speciation studies, has focused on male mate choice. We studied mate choice by H. cydno females by pairing them with either conspecific males or males of the closely related species H. pachinus. Significantly more intraspecific trials than interspecific trials resulted in mating. Because male courtship rates did not differ between the species when we excluded males that never courted, we attribute this difference to female choice. Females also performed more acceptance behaviours towards conspecific males. Premating isolation between these two species thus entails both male and female mate choice, and female choice may be an important factor in the origin of Heliconius species.",

In this study we aimed to identify miRNAs and their downstream targets involved in regeneration of islet beta cells following partial pancreatectomy in mice.\\n\\nMethodsRNA from laser capture microdissected (LCM) islets of partially pancreatectomized and sham-operated mice were profiled with microarrays to identify putative miRNAs implicated in control of beta cell regeneration. Altered expression of selected miRNAs, including miR-132, was verified by RT-PCR. Potential targets of miR-132 were seleced through bioinformatic data mining. Predicted miR-132 targets were validated for their changed RNA and protein expression levels and signaling upon miR-132 knockdown or overexpression in MIN6 cells. The ability of miR-132 to foster beta cell proliferation in vivo was further assessed in pancreatectomized miR-132-/- and control mice.\\n\\nResultsPartial pancreatectomy significantly increased the number of BrdU+/insulin+ positive islet cells. Microarray profiling revealed 14 miRNAs, including miR-132 and -141, to be significantly upregulated in LCM islets of partially pancreatectomized compared to LCM islets of control mice. In the same comparison miR-760 was the only miRNA found to be downregulated. Changed expression of these miRNAs in islets of partially pancreatectomized mice was confirmed by RT-PCR only in the case of miR-132 and -141. Based on previous knowledge of its function, we chose to focus our attention on miR-132. Downregulation of miR-132 in MIN6 cells reduced proliferation while enhancing the expression of proapoptic genes, which was instead reduced in miR-132 overexpression MIN6 cells. Microarray profiling, RT-PCR and immunoblotting of miR-132 overexpressing MIN6 cells revealed their downregulated expression of Pten, with concomitant increased levels of pro-proliferative factors phospho-Akt and phospho-Creb as well as inactivation of pro-apoptotic Foxo3 via its phosphorylation. Finally, we show that regeneration of beta cells following partial pancreatectomy was reduced in miR-132-/- mice compared to control mice.\\n\\nConclusions/InterpretationsOur study provides compelling evidence for upregulation of miR-132 being critical for regeneration of mouse islet beta cells in vivo through downregulation of its target Pten.

Our method predicted 7 out of the 10 previously known cross-species interactions.\\n\\nConclusionsSeveral predictions that warrant experimental follow-up were presented and discussed, including interactions involving potential vaccine candidate antigens, protease inhibition, and immune evasion. The application framework provides an integrated methodology for investigation of host-pathogen interactions and an extensive source of orthogonal data for experimental analysis. We have made the predictions available online for community perusal.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe S. mansoni parasite is the etiological agent of the disease Schistomiasis. However, protein-protein interactions have been experimentally characterized that relate to pathogenesis and establishment of infection. As with many pathogens, the understanding of these interactions is a key component for the development of new vaccines. In this project, we have applied a computational whole-genome comparative approach to aid in the prediction of interactions between S. mansoni and human proteins and to identify important proteins involved in infection. The results of applying this method recapitulate several previously characterized interactions, as well as suggest additional ones as potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral cortex has expanded in size and complexity in primates, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are obscure. We generated cortical organoids from human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus pluripotent stem cells and sequenced their transcriptomes at weekly time points for comparative analysis. We used transcript structure and expression conservation to discover thousands of expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Of 2,975 human, multi-exonic lncRNAs, 2,143 were structurally conserved to chimpanzee, 1,731 to orangutan, and 1,290 to rhesus. 386 human lncRNAs were transiently expressed (TrEx) and a similar expression pattern was often observed in great apes (46%) and rhesus (31%). Many TrEx lncRNAs were associated with neuroepithelium, radial glia, or Cajal-Retzius cells by single cell RNA-sequencing. 3/8 tested by ectopic expression showed [&ge;]2-fold effects on neural genes. This rich resource of primate expression data in early cortical development provides a framework for identifying new, potentially functional lncRNAs.",
