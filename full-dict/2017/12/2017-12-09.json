    "abstract": "Understanding how multi-drug resistant pathogens evolve is key to identifying means of curtailing their further emergence and dissemination. Fitness costs imposed on bacteria by resistance mechanisms are believed to hamper their dissemination in an antibiotic free environment, however, some have been reported to have little or no cost, which suggests there are few barriers preventing their global spread. One such apparently cost-free resistance mechanism acquired by the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is to the clinically important antibiotic mupirocin, which is mediated by mutation of the highly-conserved and essential isoleucyl-tRNA synthethase (ileS) gene. In Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) on two genetically and geographically distinct MRSA lineages we have found this mutation to be associated with changes in bacterial virulence, driven through epistatic interactions with other loci. Given the potential dual effect of this mutation on both antibiotic resistance and virulence we adopted a proteomic approach and observed pleiotropic effects. This analysis revealed that the activity of the secretory apparatus of the PSM family of cytolytic toxins, the Pmt system, is affected in the mupirocin resistant mutant, which explains why it is less toxic. As an energetically costly activity, this reduction in toxicity masks the fitness costs associated with this resistance mutation, a cost that becomes apparent when toxin production is required. Given the widespread use of this antibiotic, and that this resistance often results from a single nucleotide substitution in the ileS gene, these hidden fitness costs provide an explanation for why this resistance mechanism is not more prevalent. This work also demonstrates how population-based genomic analysis of virulence and antibiotic resistance can contribute to uncovering hidden features of the biology of microbial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Power considerations for trials evaluating vaccines against infectious diseases are complicated by indirect protective effects of vaccination. While cluster-randomized trials (cRCTs) are less statistically efficient than individually randomized trials (iRCT), a cRCTs ability to measure direct and indirect vaccine effects may mitigate the loss of efficiency due to clustering. Within cRCTs, the number and size of clusters affects three determinants of power: the effect size being measured, disease incidence, and intra-cluster correlation. We simulate trials conducted in a collection of small communities to assess how indirect protection and clustering affect the power of cRCTs and iRCTs during an emerging epidemic. Across diverse parameters, we find that within the same trial population, cRCTs are never more powerful than iRCTs, although the difference can be small. We also identify two effects that attenuate the loss of cRCT power traditionally associated with increased cluster size. First, if enrollment of fewer, larger clusters is performed to achieve higher vaccine coverage within vaccinated communities, this increases the effect to be measured and, consequently, power. Second, the greater rate of imported transmission in larger communities may increase the attack rate and similarly mitigate loss of power relative to a trial in many, smaller communities.",

    "abstract": "Cells adapt to shifts in their environment by remodeling transcription. Measuring changes in transcription at the genome scale is now routine, but defining the functional significance of individual genes within large gene expression datasets remains a major challenge. We applied a network-based algorithm to interrogate publicly available transcription data to predict genes that serve major functional roles in Caulobacter crescentus stress survival. This approach identified GsrN, a conserved small RNA that is directly controlled by the general stress sigma factor, {sigma}{tau}, and functions as a potent post-transcriptional regulator of survival under multiple stress conditions. GsrN expression is both necessary and sufficient to protect cells from hydrogen peroxide, where it functions by base pairing with the leader of katG mRNA and promoting catalase/peroxidase expression. We conclude that GsrN convenes a post-transcriptional layer of gene expression that serves a central functional role in stress physiology.",

    "abstract": "Declines in energy metabolism and associated mitochondrial enzymes are linked to the progression of Alzheimers disease (AD). Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (dld) and two of its enzyme complexes namely, pyruvate dehydrogenase and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase are associated with AD and have a significant role in energy metabolism. Interestingly, dld gene variants are genetically linked to late-onset AD; and reduced activity of DLD-containing enzyme complexes has been observed in AD patients. To understand how energy metabolism influences AD progression, we suppressed the dld-1 gene in C. elegans expressing the human A{beta} peptide. dld-1 gene suppression improved many aspects of vitality and function directly affected by A{beta} pathology in C. elegans. This includes protection against paralysis, improved fecundity and improved egg hatching rates. Suppression of the dld-1 gene restores normal sensitivity to aldicarb, levamisole and serotonin, and improves chemotaxis. Suppression of dld-1 does not decrease levels of the A{beta} peptide, but does reduce the formation of toxic A{beta} oligomers. The mitochondrial uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) acts synergistically with A{beta} to overcome the protective effect of dld-1 gene suppression. Another metabolic toxin, phosphine, acted additively with A{beta}. Our work supports the hypothesis that lowering energy metabolism may protect against A{beta} pathogenicity, but that this may increase susceptibility to other metabolic disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective way to lose weight and reverse type 2 diabetes. We profiled the metabolome of 18 obese patients (nine euglycemic and nine diabetics) that underwent RYGB surgery and seven lean subjects. Plasma samples from the obese patients were collected before the surgery and one week and three months after the surgery. We analyzed the metabolome in association to five hormones (Adiponectin, Insulin, Ghrelin, Leptin, and Resistin), four peptide hormones (GIP, Glucagon, GLP1, and PYY), and two cytokines (IL-6 and TNF). PCA showed samples cluster by surgery time and many microbially driven metabolites (indoles in particular) correlated with the three months after the surgery. Network analysis of metabolites revealed a connection between carbohydrate (mannosamine and glucosamine) and glyoxylate and confirms glyoxylate association to diabetes. Only leptin and IL-6 had a significant association with the measured metabolites. Leptin decreased immediately after RYGB (before significant weight loss), whereas IL-6 showed no consistent response to RYGB. Moreover, leptin associated with tryptophan in support of the possible role of leptin in the regulation of serotonin synthesis pathways in the gut. These results suggest a potential link between gastric leptin and microbial-derived metabolites in the context of obesity and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "All known phototrophic metabolisms on Earth are based on one of three energy-converting pigments: chlorophyll-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, and retinal, which is the chromophore in rhodopsins [1]. While the contribution of chlorophylls to global energy flows and marine carbon cycling has been studied for decades, the role of retinal-based phototrophy remains largely unexplored [1,2]. We report the first vertical distributions of the three energy-converting pigments measured along a contrasting nutrient gradient through the Mediterranean Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean. The highest proteorhodopsin concentrations were observed above the deep chlorophyll-a maxima, and their geographical distribution tended to be inversely related to that of chlorophyll-a. We further show that proteorhodopsins potentially absorb as much or more light energy than chlorophyll-a -based phototrophy and this energy is sufficient to sustain bacterial basal metabolism. Our results suggest that ubiquitous proteorhodopsin-containing heterotrophs are important contributors to the light energy captured in the sea.",

How these interactions are orchestrated at any given location and under changing cellular conditions is largely unknown because systematically measuring protein-DNA interactions at a specific locus in the genome is challenging. To address this problem, we developed Epi-Decoder, a Tag-ChIP-Barcode-Seq technology in budding yeast to identify and quantify in an unbiased and systematic manner the proteome of an individual genomic locus. Epi-Decoder is orthogonal to proteomics approaches because it does not rely on mass spectrometry but instead takes advantage of DNA sequencing. Analysis of the proteome of a transcribed locus proximal to an origin of replication revealed more than 400 proteins. Moreover, replication stress induced changes in local chromatin-proteome composition prior to local origin firing, affecting replication proteins as well as transcription proteins. Epi-Decoder will enable the delineation of complex and dynamic protein-DNA interactions across many regions of the genome.",

    "abstract": "The presence of arsenic in sediments, carbonaceous rocks are geogenic, while its entry into the aquifers is mediated by several factors including microorganisms. It is well known that the microorganisms play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of different elements. However, the precise role of bacteria in regulating the concentration of arsenic in Brahmaputra valley has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we report the isolation of arsenic resistant bacterium TA6 with active arsenate reduction efficiency. The isolate was able to grow in arsenate concentration (250 mM) and arsenite (30 mM). Along with resistance to inorganic arsenic, it showed cross-tolerance to other heavy metals like Hg+2, Cd+2, Co+2, Ni+2, Cr+2. The bacterium also had a high siderophore activity (78.7 {+/-} 0.004 mol), which is positively correlated with the resistance aptitude. The biochemical test showed the TA6, a gram-positive bacterium which can hydrolyze starch and casein, produce catalase enzyme and utilizes citrate as a metabolic trait. Molecular and chemotaxonomic identification of TA6 based on 16S rRNA and FMAE analysis showed similarity with members of Staphylococcus genus with significant difference in sequence similarity and fatty acid composition. Based on 16S rRNA and FAME analysis it was identified as Staphylococcus sp. TA6. Rate of biotransformation showed bacterium could reduce ~88.2% of initial 2mM As(V) into As(III). The characterization of arsenate reductase enzyme with NADPH coupled assay showed the highest activity at pH 5.5 and temperature 50{degrees}C.",

    "abstract": "Wildlife-vehicle collisions are an important cause of mortality for many species, and the number of collisions is expected to grow rapidly as the global road network quickly expands over the next few decades. Wildlife-vehicle collisions also have the potential to be extremely detrimental to small wildlife populations, such as the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus), with only 43 individuals remaining in the wild. We assessed the spatial distribution of road mortalities between 2004 and 2016 to identify roadkill hotspots involving Asiatic cheetahs in Iran using network kernel density estimation. A total of sixteen cheetah fatalities due to wildlife-vehicle collisions were recorded, and we identified six road fragments as roadkill hotspots. Efforts to reduce wildlife-cheetah collisions should be targeted in the densest hotspots. We review the options available to achieve this, and we recommend a strategic shift away from the ineffective warning signage currently used, and instead suggest adopting an evidence-based approach focusing on installing wildlife crossing structures in conjunction with fencing in roadkill hotspots. These measures will help to enhance the conservation status of the Asiatic cheetah, as the current high level of mortality of Asiatic cheetahs on Irans roads could have potentially dramatic impacts on this critically endangered subspecies.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial function is critical for energy homeostasis and should shape how genetic variation in metabolism is transmitted through levels of biological organization to generate stability in organismal performance. Mitochondrial function is encoded by genes in two distinct and separately inherited genomes - the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome - and selection is expected to maintain functional mito-nuclear interactions. Nevertheless, high levels of polymorphism in genes involved in these mito-nuclear interactions and variation for mitochondrial function are nevertheless frequently observed, demanding an explanation for how and why variability in such a fundamental trait is maintained. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is a New Zealand freshwater snail with coexisting sexual and asexual individuals and, accordingly, contrasting systems of separate vs. co-inheritance of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. As such, this snail provides a powerful means to dissect the evolutionary and functional consequences of mito-nuclear variation. The lakes inhabited by P. antipodarum span wide environmental gradients, with substantial across-lake genetic structure and mito-nuclear discordance. This situation allows us to use comparisons across reproductive modes and lakes to partition variation in cellular respiration across genetic and environmental axes. Here, we integrated cellular, physiological, and behavioral approaches to quantify variation in mitochondrial function across a diverse set of wild P. antipodarum lineages. We found extensive across-lake variation in organismal oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and behavioral response to heat stress, but few global effects of reproductive mode or sex. Taken together, our data set the stage for applying this important model system for sexual reproduction and polyploidy to dissecting the complex relationships between mito-nuclear variation, performance, plasticity, and fitness in natural populations.",

Striking evolutionary conservation and pulmonary abundance implicate them in antibacterial host defense, yet their roles in protection against clinically significant pathogens are unknown. Murine Legionella infection induced MR1-dependent MAIT cell activation and rapid pulmonary accumulation of MAIT cells associated with immune protection detectable in fully immunocompetent host animals. MAIT cell protection was more evident in mice lacking CD4+ cells, whilst profoundly immunodeficient RAG2-/-{gamma}C-/- mice were substantially rescued from uniformly lethal Legionella infection by adoptively-transferred MAIT cells. This protection was dependent on MR1, IFN-{gamma} and GM-CSF, but not IL-17, TNF- or perforin. Protection was enhanced and observed earlier post-infection in mice that were Ag-primed to boost MAIT cells before infection. Our findings define a significant role for MAIT cells in protection against a major human pathogen and indicate a potential role for vaccination to enhance MAIT cell immunity.",

    "abstract": "In most animals, the brain makes behavioral decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how these neurons control an insects movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a population of descending neurons, we found, that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.",
