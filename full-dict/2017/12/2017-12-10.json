    "abstract": "The outcomes of many species interactions are conditional on the environments in which they occur. A common pattern is that outcomes grade from being more positive under stressful conditions to more antagonistic or neutral under benign conditions. The evolutionary implications of conditionality in interactions have received much less attention than the documentation of conditionality itself, with a few notable exceptions. Here, we predict patterns of adaptation and co-adaptation between partners along abiotic gradients, positing that when interactions become more positive in stressful environments, fitness outcomes for mutations affecting interactions align across partners and selection should favor greater mutualistic adap-tation and co-adaptation between interacting species. As a corollary, in benign environments, if interactions are strongly antagonistic, we predict antagonistic co-adaptation resulting in Red Queen or arms-race dynamics, or reduction of antagonism through character displacement and niche partitioning. We predict no adaptation if interactions are more neutral. We call this the CoCoA hypothesis: (Co)-adaptation and Conditionality across Abiotic gradients. We describe experimental designs and statistical models that allow testing predictions of CoCoA, with a focus on positive interactions. While only one study has included all the elements to test CoCoA, we briefly review the literature and summarize study findings relevant to CoCoA and highlight opportunities to test CoCoA further.",

    "abstract": "Human hookworm Necator Americanus (NA) causes iron deficiency anemia, as the parasite ingests blood from the gastrointestinal tract of its human host. This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

    "abstract": "Cortical sensory systems often activate in parallel, even when stimulation is experienced through a single sensory modality1-3. Critically, the functional relationship between coactivated cortical systems is unclear: Co-activations may reflect the interactive coupling between information-linked cortical systems or merely parallel but independent sensory processing. Here, we report causal evidence that human somatosensory cortex (S1), which co-activates with auditory cortex during the processing of vibrations and textures4-9, interactively couples to cortical systems that support auditory perception. Acute manipulation of S1 activity using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) impairs auditory frequency perception when subjects simultaneously attend to auditory and tactile frequency, but not when attention is directed to audition alone. Auditory frequency perception is unaffected by TMS over visual cortex thus confirming the privileged coupling between the somatosensory and auditory cortical systems in temporal frequency processing10-13. Our results provide a key demonstration that selective attention can enhance the functional coupling between cortical systems that support different sensory modalities. The gating of crossmodal coupling by selective attention may critically support multisensory interactions and feature-specific perception.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsS.C. and J.M.Y. designed the study and wrote the manuscript.

A comparative analysis of Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) distances was accomplished using sequence divergences of Cobitoidea to calculate intra and interspecific in superfamily, family and genus taxa. The average intraspecific K2P genetic distances of Choman loaches species was 0.005 whereas this value was 0.016 for the Cobitoidea superfamily. Molecular phylogenetic relationships were assessed using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Dendrograms obtained by these methods revealed all four Choman loaches species as distinct species among other reported Nemacheilidae Spp. These species were clustered with Oxynoemacheilus and Turcinoemacheilus genera within other species in the Nemacheilidae family. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that Cobitoidea superfamily consists of nine families ((Gyrinocheilidae + Botiidae) + ((Catostomidae + Vaillentellidae) + ((Nemacheilidae + Cobitidae) + ((Ellopostomidae + Gastromyzontidae) + Balitoridae)))) and indicated Nemacheilidae is a valid and distinct family from Balitoridae.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in human KCNQ1 are responsible for susceptibility to a life-threatening heart rhythm disorder, the congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Hundreds of KCNQ1 mutations have been identified, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for impaired function are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of 51 KCNQ1 variants located within the voltage sensor domain (VSD), with an emphasis on elucidating effects on cell surface expression, protein folding and structure. For each variant, the efficiency of trafficking to the plasma membrane, the impact of proteasome inhibition, and protein stability were assayed. The results of these experiments, combined with channel functional data, provided the basis for classifying each mutation into one of 6 mechanistic categories. More than half of the KCNQ1 LOF mutations destabilize the structure of the VSD, resulting in mistrafficking and degradation by the proteasome, an observation that underscores the growing appreciation that mutation-induced destabilization of membrane proteins may be a common human disease mechanism. Finally, we observed that 5 of the folding-defective LQTS mutants are located in the VSD S0 helix, where they interact with a number of other LOF mutation sites in other segments of the VSD. These observations reveal a critical role for the S0 helix as a central scaffold to help organize and stabilize the KCNQ1 VSD and, most likely, the corresponding domain of many other ion channels.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryLong QT syndrome-associated mutations in KCNQ1 most often destabilize the protein, leading to mistrafficking and degradation.",

    "abstract": "Biophysical aspects of in vivo tissue microenvironments include microscale mechanical properties, fibrillar alignment, and architecture or topography of the extracellular matrix (ECM). These aspects act in concert with chemical signals from a myriad of diverse ECM proteins to provide cues that drive cellular responses. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to build fibrillar architecture into 3D amorphous hydrogels using magnetic-field driven assembly of paramagnetic colloidal particles functionalized with three types of human ECM proteins found in vivo. We investigated if cells cultured in matrices comprised of fibrils of the same size and arranged in similar geometries will show similar behavior for each of the ECM proteins tested. We were able to resolve spatial heterogeneities in microscale mechanical properties near aligned fibers that were not observed in bulk tissue mechanics. We then used this platform to examine factors contributing to cell alignment in response to topographical cues in 3D laminin-rich matrices. Multiple human cell lines extended protrusions preferentially in directions parallel or perpendicular to aligned fibers independently of the ECM coating. Focal adhesion proteins, as measured by paxillin localization, were mainly diffuse in the cytoplasm, with few puncta localized at the protrusions. Integrin {beta}1 and fascin regulated protrusion extension but not protrusion alignment. Myosin II inhibition did not reduce observed protrusion length. Instead, cells with reduced myosin II activity generated protrusions in random orientations when cultured in hydrogels with aligned fibers. Similarly, myosin II dependence was observed in vivo, where cells no longer aligned along the abluminal surfaces of blood vessels upon treatment with blebbistatin. These data suggest that myosin II can regulate sensing of topography in 3D engineered matrices for both normal and transformed cells.",

    "abstract": "Mechanotransduction is likely to be an important mechanism of signalling in thin, elongated cells like neurons. Maintenance of pre-stress or rest tension may facilitate mechanotransduction in these cells. In recent years, functional roles for mechanical tension in neuronal development and physiology are beginning to emerge but the cellular mechanisms regulating neurite tension remain poorly understood. Active contraction of neurites is a potential mechanism of tension regulation. In this study, we have explored cytoskeletal mechanisms mediating active contractility of neuronal axons. We have developed a simple assay where we evaluate contraction of curved axons upon trypsin-mediated detachment. We show that curved axons undergo contraction and straighten upon de-adhesion. Axonal straightening was found to be actively driven by actomyosin contractility, while microtubules may subserve a secondary role. We find that while axons show a monotonous decrease in length upon contraction, subcellularly, the cytoskeleton shows a heterogeneous contractile response. Further, using an assay for spontaneous development of tension without trypsin-induced de-adhesion, we show that axons are intrinsically contractile. These experiments, using novel experimental approaches, implicate the axonal cytoskeleton in tension homeostasis. Our data suggest that while globally the axon behaves as a mechanical continuum, locally the cytoskeleton is remodelled heterogeneously.",

Here we show that T cells adhering via the TCR-complex respond to environmental stiffness in an unusual biphasic fashion. As the stiffness increases, adhesion and spreading first increase, then decrease, attaining their maximal values on an optimally stiff surface, with stiffness comparable to certain antigen presenting cells. Remarkably, in presence of additional ligands for the integrin LFA-1, spreading increases monotonously with stiffness up to a saturation value. Using a mesoscopic semi-analytical model linking spreading to molecular characteristics of bonds, we identify force sensitivity of the off-rate and the effective bond stiffness as the crucial parameters that determine monotonic or biphasic mechanosensitive behavior.",

Such heterogeneities lead to demixing of lipid constituents and formation of distinct liquid domains in the membrane. We study lateral heterogeneities in terms of topological rearrangements of lipids to identify the liquid-liquid phase coexistence in model membranes. By quantifying the degree of non-affine deformation associated with individual lipid, we are able to characterize the liquid ordered (Lo) and liquid disordered (Ld) phases in model lipid bilayers, without any prior knowledge about the chemical identity of the lipids. We explore the usage of this method on all atom and coarse-grained lipid bilayer trajectories. This method is helpful in defining the instantaneous Lo-Ld domain boundaries in complex multi-component bilayer systems.\\n\\nThe characterization is also used to highlight the effect of line-active molecules on the phase boundaries and domain mixing.

They are a hallmark of eukaryotes and are deeply rooted in the evolutionary origin of cellular compartmentalization. NPCs have an elaborate architecture that has been well studied in vertebrates. Whether this architecture is unique or varies significantly in other eukaryotic kingdoms remains unknown, predominantly due to missing in situ structural data. Here, we report the architecture of the algal NPC from the early branching eukaryote Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and compare it to the human NPC. We find that the inner ring of the Chlamydomonas NPC has an unexpectedly large diameter, and the outer rings exhibit an asymmetric oligomeric state that is unprecedented compared to all previously proposed models of NPC architecture. Our study provides evidence that the NPC is subject to substantial structural variation between species. The divergent and conserved features of NPC architecture provide insights into the evolution of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery.",

Atovaquone (ATO) is a safe and potent antimalarial drug that acts on cytochrome b (cyt. b) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC) in Plasmodium falciparum, yet treatment failures result in resistance-conferring SNPs in cyt. b. Herein we report that rather than the expected de novo selection of resistance, previously unknown mitochondrial diversity is the genetic mechanism responsible for resistance to ATO, and potentially other cyt. b targeted drugs. We found that P. falciparum harbors cryptic cyt. b. Y268S alleles in the multicopy ([~]22 copies) mitochondrial genome prior to drug treatment, a phenomenon known as mitochondrial heteroplasmy. Parasites with cryptic Y268S alleles readily evolve into highly resistant parasites with >95% Y268S copies under in vitro ATO selection. Further we uncovered high mitochondrial diversity in a global collection of 1279 genomes in which heteroplasmic polymorphisms were >3-fold more prevalent than homoplasmic SNPs. Moreover, significantly higher mitochondrial genome copy number was found in Asia (e.g., Cambodia) versus Africa (e.g., Ghana). Similarly, ATO drug selections in vitro induced >3-fold mitochondrial copy number increases in ATO resistant lines. Hidden mitochondrial diversity is a previously unknown mechanism of antimalarial drug resistance and characterization of mitochondrial heteroplasmy will be of paramount importance in combatting resistance to antimalarials targeting the electron transport chain.",

Experimental models provide a means to understand how the cell dynamics themselves influence the outcomes of these infections. Mathematical approaches are needed to improve quantification and theoretical advancement of these complex systems. Here, we develop a general ecology-inspired model for stratified epithelial dynamics, which allows us to simulate infections and to estimate parameters that are difficult to measure with organotypic cell cultures. To explore how epithelial cell dynamics affect infection dynamics, we focus on two contrasting pathogens of the cervicovaginal epithelium: Chlamydia trachomatis and Human papillomaviruses. We find that key infection symptoms stem from differential interactions with the layers, while clearance and pathogen burden are bottom-up processes. Cell protective responses to infections (e.g. increased cell proliferation) generally lowered pathogen load but there were specific effects based on infection strategies. These generic responses by the epithelium, then, will have varying results depending on the pathogens infection strategy. Our modeling approach opens new perspectives for 3D tissue culture experimental systems of infections and, more generally, for developing and testing hypotheses related to infections of stratified epithelia.",

In addition to the canonical Gq effector phospholipase C{beta}, the small GTPase Rho was recently identified as a conserved effector of Gq. To identify additional molecules important for Gq signaling in neurons, we performed a forward genetic screen in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans for suppressors of the hyperactivity and exaggerated waveform of an activated Gq mutant. We isolated two mutations affecting the MAP kinase scaffold protein KSR-1 and found that KSR-1 modulates locomotion downstream of or in parallel to the Gq-Rho pathway. Through epistasis experiments, we found that the core ERK MAPK cascade is required for Gq-Rho regulation of locomotion, but that the canonical ERK activator LET-60/Ras may not be required. Through neuron-specific rescue experiments, we found that the ERK pathway functions in head acetylcholine neurons to control Gq-dependent locomotion. Additionally, expression of activated LIN-45/Raf in head acetylcholine neurons is sufficient to cause an exaggerated waveform phenotype and hypersensitivity to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb, similar to an activated Gq mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that the ERK MAPK pathway modulates the output of Gq-Rho signaling to control locomotion behavior in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional protein localization intricately determines the functional coordination of cellular processes. The complex spatial context of protein landscape has been assessed by multiplexed immunofluorescent staining1-3 or mass spectrometry4, applied to 2D cell culture with limited physiological relevance5 or tissue sections. Here, we present 3D SPECS, an automated technology for 3D Spatial characterization of Protein Expression Changes by microscopic Screening. This workflow encompasses iterative antibody staining of proteins, high-content imaging, and machine learning based classification of mitotic states. This is followed by mapping of spatial protein localization into a spherical, cellular coordinate system, the basis used for model-based prediction of spatially resolved affinities of various mitotic proteins. As a proof-of-concept, we mapped twelve epitopes in 3D cultured epithelial breast spheroids and investigated the network effects of mitotic cancer drugs with known limited success in clinical trials6-8. Our approach reveals novel insights into spindle fragility and global chromatin stress, and predicts unknown interactions between proteins in specific mitotic pathways. 3D SPECSs ability to map potential drug targets by multiplexed immunofluorescence in 3D cell cultured models combined with our automized high content assay will inspire future functional protein expression and drug assays.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of toxoplasmosis is higher in schizophrenics than in the general population. It has been suggested that certain symptoms of schizophrenia, including changes in olfactory functions, are in fact symptoms of toxoplasmosis that can be easily detected in schizophrenics only due to the increased prevalence of toxoplasmosis in this population. Schizophrenics have impaired identification of odors and lower sensitivity of odor detection. Here we searched for differences in olfactory functions between 62 infected and 61 noninfected non-schizophrenic subjects. The infected men scored better in the standard odor-identification test. The infected women rated all smells as more intensive while the infected men rated nearly all smells as less intensive. Infected women rated the pleasantness of the smell of undiluted cat urine as higher than the non-infected women and the opposite was true for the men (the opposite direction shifts in men and women were described earlier for highly diluted cat urine). Toxoplasmosis had no effect on the rated pleasantness of the smell of other stimuli. Our results suggest that latent toxoplasmosis is associated with changes in the olfactory functions in humans; however, the observed changes differ from those observed in schizophrenics.\\n\\nKey findingsO_LIInfected men but not women show better odor identification ability than the non-infected controls.\\nC_LIO_LIThe infected women rated all smells as more and men as less intensive than the controls.\\nC_LIO_LIThe infected women rated smell of cat urine as more and men as less pleasurable than the controls.\\nC_LIO_LIToxoplasmosis had no effect on the rated pleasantness of the smell of other stimuli.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found no new evidence for the toxoplasmosis hypothesis of schizophrenia.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental and computational studies have shown the influence of internal friction in protein folding dynamics. However, uncertainty remains over its molecular origin. -spectrin experimental results indicate that R15 domain folds three orders of magnitude faster than its homologous R16 and R17. Such anomalous observations are usually attributed to the influence of internal friction on protein folding rates. To study this phenomenon, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with structure-based C models, in which the folding process of -spectrin domains was investigated by adding non-native interactions. The simulations take into account the hydrophobic and the electrostatic contributions separately. The folding time results have shown a qualitative agreement with experimental data. We have also investigated mutations in R16 and R17, and the simulation folding time results correlate with the observed experimental ones. We suggest that the origin of the internal friction emerges from a cooperativity effect of these non-native interactions.",

    "abstract": "Many microbes induce striking behavioral changes in their animal hosts, but how they achieve this is poorly understood, especially at the molecular level. Mechanistic understanding has been largely constrained by the lack of a model system with advanced tools for molecular manipulation. We recently discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae infecting wild Drosophila, and established methods to infect D. melanogaster in the lab. Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection: hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides and affix in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the fly nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. Given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster, we believe this new system will enable rapid progress in understanding the mechanistic basis of E. muscaes behavioral manipulation in the fly.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial insects live in teeming societies with thousands of their kin. In this crowded environment, workers combat disease by removing or burying their dead or diseased nestmates. For honey bees, we found that hygienic brood-removal behavior is triggered by two odorants - {beta}-ocimene and oleic acid - which are released from brood upon freeze-killing. {beta}-ocimene is a co-opted pheromone that normally signals larval food-begging, whereas oleic acid is a conserved necromone across arthropod taxa. Interestingly, the odorant blend can induce hygienic behavior more consistently than either odorant alone. We suggest that the volatile {beta}-ocimene flags hygienic workers attention, while oleic acid is the death cue, triggering removal. Bees with high hygienicity detect and remove brood with these odorants faster than bees with low hygienicity, and both molecules are strong ligands for hygienic behavior-associated odorant binding proteins (OBP16 and OBP18). Odorants that induce low levels of hygienic behavior, however, are weak ligands for these OBPs. We are therefore beginning to paint a picture of the molecular mechanism behind this complex behavior, using odorants associated with freeze-killed brood as a model.",

    "abstract": "In the tissue microenvironment, stem cell functions are modulated by extrinsic signaling cues such as peptide hormones and dietary nutrients. These signaling cues maintain the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of its resident stem cells. The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is implicated to play an important role in regulating this balance, although its downstream effectors in stem cells have been elusive. We have recently shown that the PASK protein kinase phosphorylates Wdr5 to stimulate muscle stem cell differentiation by epigenetically activating the Myogenin promoter. Here, we show that the PASK-Wdr5 signaling pathway is a nutrient-sensitive downstream target of mTORC1 in muscle stem cells. We show that phosphorylation of PASK, and in turn of Wdr5, by mTORC1 is required for the activation of Myogenin transcription, exit from the self-renewal and induction of the myogenesis program. Thus, mTOR connects the diverse extrinsic signaling cues to a central epigenetic process to regulate the muscle stem cell fate between self-renewal and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "T follicular helper (Tfh) and regulatory (Tfr) cells regulate B cell activation and ultimately antibody production. While concordant results show that Tfh cells are specific for the immunizing antigens, limited and even controversial results have been reported regarding the specificity of Tfr cells. Here we used high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to address this issue. We observed that although the Tfh- and Tfr-cell repertoires are less diverse than those of effector (Teff) and regulatory T (Treg) cells, they still represent thousands of clonotypes after immunization with a single antigen. T-cell receptor beta variable (TRBV) gene usage distinguishes both follicular T cells (Tfol) from non-Tfol cells, as well as helper (Teff and Tfh) vs. regulatory (Treg and Tfr) cells. Analysis of the sharing of clonotypes between samples revealed that a specific response to the immunizing antigen can only be detected in Tfh cells immunized with a non-self-antigen and Tfr cells immunized with a self-antigen. Finally, the Tfr TCR repertoire is more similar to that of Tregs than to that of Tfh or Teff cells. Altogether, our results highlight a bystander Tfol-cell activation during antigenic response in the germinal centres and support the Treg cell origin of Tfr cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFollicular helper T (Tfh) cells promote high-affinity antibody production by B cells while follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells represses it. The question of the specificity of follicular T (Tfol) cells is of utmost importance in the understanding of the antibody response specificity and our work is the first to analysed the global Tfol TCR repertoire in wild type mice. This allowed us not only to portray the overall global structure of these repertoires, but also to substantiate the fact that Tfr cells respond to self-antigen while Tfh cells respond to non self-antigen, a still controversial issue. Importantly, our work revealed an unexpected bystander activation of Tfol cells. We think and discuss that it has a general significance in immune responses and possibly immunopathologies.",

    "abstract": "The marine mollusc, Pleurobranchaea californica varies daily in whether it swims and this correlates with whether serotonin (5-HT) enhances the strength of synapses made by the swim central pattern generator neuron, C2. Another species, Tritonia diomedea, reliably swims and does not vary in serotonergic neuromodulation. A third species, Hermissenda crassicornis, never produces this behavior and lacks the neuromodulation. We found that expression of particular 5-HT receptor genes in C2 correlates with swimming. Seven 5-HT receptor subtype genes were identified from whole-brain transcriptomes. We isolated individual C2 neurons and sequenced their RNA or measured 5-HT receptor gene expression using quantitative PCR. C2 neurons isolated from Pleurobranchaea individuals that produced a swim motor pattern just prior to isolation expressed the 5-HT2a and 5-HT7 receptor genes, as did the Tritonia samples. These subtypes were absent from C2 neurons isolated from Pleurobranchaea individuals that did not swim that day and from Hermissenda C2 neurons. Expression of other receptors did not correlate with swimming. This suggests that 5-HT2a and 5-HT7 receptors mediate the modulation of C2 synaptic strength and play an important role in swimming. Furthermore, the results suggest that regulation of receptor expression might underlie daily changes in behavior as well as behavioral evolution.",
