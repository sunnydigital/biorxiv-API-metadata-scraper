    "abstract": "Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal \\\"virtual laboratory\\\" for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the \\\"stage\\\") and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the \\\"players\\\" upon the stage).\\n\\nPhysiCell--physics-based multicellular simulator--is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility \\\"out of the box.\\\" The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes.\\n\\nWe demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a \\\"cellular cargo delivery\\\" system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThis paper introduces PhysiCell: an open source, agent-based modeling framework for 3-D multicellular simulations. It includes a standard library of sub-models for cell fluid and solid volume changes, cycle progression, apoptosis, necrosis, mechanics, and motility. PhysiCell is directly coupled to a biotransport solver to simulate many diffusing substrates and cell-secreted signals. Each cell can dynamically update its phenotype based on its microenvironmental conditions. Users can customize or replace the included sub-models.\\n\\nPhysiCell runs on a variety of platforms (Linux, OSX, and Windows) with few software dependencies. Its computational cost scales linearly in the number of cells. It is feasible to simulate 500,000 cells on quad-core desktop workstations, and millions of cells on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on hanging drop tumor spheroids (HDS) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate contact- and chemokine-based interactions among multiple cell types with examples in synthetic multicellular bioengineering, cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology.\\n\\nWe developed PhysiCell to help the scientific community tackle multicellular systems biology problems involving many interacting cells in multi-substrate microenvironments. PhysiCell is also an independent, cross-platform codebase for replicating results from other simulators.",

    "abstract": "To stand straight and upright along their growth, plants needs to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observation of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed (tilted) coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. This relationship appears to be critical to the postural control of the organ, and indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.",

    "abstract": "The shaping of a multicellular body and repair of adult tissues require fine-tuning of cell adhesion, cell mechanics and intercellular transmission of mechanical load. Adherens junctions (AJs) are the major intercellular junctions by which cells sense and exert mechanical force on each other. However, how AJs adapt to mechanical stress and how this adaptation contributes to cell-cell cohesion and eventually to tissue-scale dynamics and mechanics remains largely unknown. Here, by analyzing the tension-dependent recruitment of vinculin, -catenin and F-actin as a function of stiffness, as well as the dynamics of GFP-tagged wild-type and mutated -catenins, altered for their binding capability to vinculin, we demonstrate that the force-dependent binding of vinculin stabilizes -catenin and is responsible for AJ adaptation to force. Challenging cadherin complexes mechanical coupling with magnetic tweezers, and cell-cell cohesion during collective cell movements, further highlight that tension-dependent adaptation of AJs regulates cell-cell contact dynamics and coordinated collective cell migration. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the force-dependent -catenin/vinculin interaction, manipulated here by mutagenesis and mechanical control, is a core regulator of AJ mechanics and long-range cell-cell interactions.\\n\\nSummary statementCombining cell biology and biomechanical analysis, we show here that the coupling between cadherin complexes and actin trough tension-dependent -catenin/vinculin association is regulating AJ stability and dynamics as well as tissue-scale mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated many low-penetrance loci in schizophrenia. However, its pathological mechanisms are poorly understood, which in turn hampers the development of novel pharmacological treatments. Pathway and gene set analyses carry the potential to generate hypotheses about disease mechanisms and have provided biological context to genome-wide data of schizophrenia. We aimed to examine which biological processes are likely candidates to underlie schizophrenia by integrating novel and powerful pathway analysis tools using data from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia GWAS (N = 79 845) and the most recent 2018 schizophrenia GWAS (N = 105 318). By applying a primary unbiased analysis (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation; MAGMA) to weigh the role of biological processes from the MSigDB database, we identified enrichment of common variants in synaptic plasticity and neuron differentiation gene sets. We supported these findings using MAGMA, Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA) and Interval Enrichment Analysis (INRICH) on detailed synaptic signaling pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and found enrichment in mainly the dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses. Moreover, shared genes involved in these neurotransmitter systems had a large contribution to the observed enrichment, protein products of top genes in these pathways showed more direct and indirect interactions than expected by chance, and expression profiles of these genes were largely similar among brain tissues. In conclusion, we provide strong and consistent genetics and protein-interaction informed evidence for the role of postsynaptic signaling processes in schizophrenia, opening avenues for future translational and psychopharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "Genome architecture is important in transcriptional regulation and study of its features is a critical part of fully understanding cell identity. Altering cell identity is possible through overexpression of transcription factors (TFs); for example, fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into muscle cells by introducing MYOD1. How TFs dynamically orchestrate genome architecture and transcription as a cell adopts a new identity during reprogramming is not well understood. Here we show that MYOD1-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts into the myogenic lineage undergoes a critical transition, which we refer to as a bifurcation point, where cell identity definitively changes. By integrating knowledge of genome-wide dynamical architecture and transcription, we found significant chromatin reorganization prior to transcriptional changes that marked activation of the myogenic program. We also found that the local architectural and transcriptional dynamics of endogenous MYOD1 and MYOG reflected the global genomic bifurcation event. These TFs additionally participate in entrainment of biological rhythms. Understanding the system-level genome dynamics underlying a cell fate decision is a step toward devising more sophisticated reprogramming strategies that could be used in cell therapies.",

Findings across these studies have been mixed, potentially because each study tested only small samples of women (Ns = 43, 33, and 14). Here we report results from a much larger (N = 375) longitudinal study of hormonal correlates of young adult womens general sexual desire and their desire for uncommitted sexual relationships. Our analyses suggest that within-woman changes in general sexual desire are negatively related to progesterone, but are not related to testosterone or cortisol. We observed some positive relationships for estradiol, but these were generally only significant for solitary sexual desire. By contrast with our results for general sexual desire, analyses showed no evidence that changes in womens desire for uncommitted sexual relationships are related to their hormonal status. Together, these results suggest that changes in hormonal status contribute to changes in womens general sexual desire, but do not influence womens desire for uncommitted sexual relationships.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe protean chemical properties of mercury have long made it attractive for diverse applications, but its toxicity requires great care in its use, disposal, and recycling. Mercury occurs in multiple chemical forms, and the molecular basis for the distinct toxicity of its various forms is only partly understood. Global transcriptomics applied over time can reveal how a cell recognizes a toxicant and what cellular subsystems it marshals to repair and recover from the damage. The longitudinal effects on the transcriptome of exponential phase E. coli were compared during sub-acute exposure to mercuric chloride (HgCl2) or to phenylmercuric acetate (PMA) using RNA-Seq.\\n\\nResultsDifferential gene expression revealed common and distinct responses to the mercurials throughout recovery. Cultures exhibited growth stasis immediately after each mercurial exposure but returned to normal growth more quickly after PMA exposure than after HgCl2 exposure. Correspondingly, PMA rapidly elicited up-regulation of a large number of genes which continued for 30 min, whereas fewer genes were up-regulated early after HgCl2 exposure only some of which overlapped with PMA up-regulated genes. By 60 min gene expression in PMA-exposed cells was almost indistinguishable from unexposed cells, but HgCl2 exposed cells still had many differentially expressed genes. Relative expression of energy production and most metabolite uptake pathways declined with both compounds, but nearly all stress response systems were up-regulated by one or the other mercurial during recovery.\\n\\nConclusionsSub-acute exposure influenced expression of ~45% of all genes with many distinct responses for each compound, reflecting differential biochemical damage by each mercurial and the corresponding resources available for repair. This study is the first global, high-resolution view of the transcriptional responses to any common toxicant in a prokaryotic model system from exposure to recovery of active growth. The responses provoked by these two mercurials in this model bacterium also provide insights about how higher organisms may respond to these ubiquitous metal toxicants.",

    "abstract": "The synthetic cathinone -pyrrolidinopentiophenone (-PVP) has been associated with violent and/or bizarre public behavior in users. Association of such behavior with extended binges of drug use motivates additional investigation, particularly since a prior study found that half of male rats experience a binge of exceptionally high intake, followed by sustained lower levels of self-administration during the acquisition of intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of a closely related drug, 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone. The binge-like acquisition pattern appeared to be novel for rat IVSA, thus the present study was designed to determine if this effect generalizes to IVSA of -PVP in female rats. Female Wistar rats were trained in IVSA of -PVP (0.05 mg/kg/inf) in experimental chambers that contained an activity wheel. Groups of animals were trained with the wheels fixed (No-Wheel group), fixed for the initial 5 days of acquisition or free to move throughout acquisition (Wheel group). The groups were next subjected to a wheel-access switch and then all animals to dose-substitution (0.0125-0.3 mg/kg/inf) with the wheels alternately fixed and free to move. Approximately half of the rats initiated their IVSA pattern with a binge day of exceptionally high levels of drug intake, independent of wheel access condition. Wheel activity was much lower in the No-Wheel group in the wheel switch post-acquisition. Dose-effect curves were similar for wheel-access training groups, for binge/no binge phenotypic subgroups and were not altered with wheel access during the dose-substitution. This confirms the high reinforcer efficacy of -PVP in female rats and the accompanying devaluation of wheel activity as a naturalistic reward.",

Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to FAIR guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework (https://osf.io/zm97b/) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the BioCompute framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. The BioCompute paradigm and the resulting BioCompute Objects (BCO) offer that standard, and are freely accessible as a GitHub organization (https://github.com/biocompute-objects) following the \\\"Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development\\\".

This assay allows assessing a much broader range of misincorporation events compared to current, very sensitive but also very specific enzyme reporter assays. Our assay uncovers a remarkably rich pool of error products for a model protein expressed in E. coli, which depend quantitatively on codon usage in the expression construct. This codon usage dependence can be explained in part as a function of the composition of the tRNA pool in this organism. We further show that codon-dependent differences in error levels correlate with measurable changes in specific protein activity. In contrast to E. coli, error levels are lower, and appear not to be codon usage dependent, when the same model protein is expressed in S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "High throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS) of conserved DNA regions is a powerful technique to characterize microbial communities. Recently, spike-in mock communities have been used to measure accuracy of sequencing platforms and data analysis pipelines. To assess the ability of sequencing platforms and data processing pipelines using fungal ITS amplicons, we created two ITS spike-in control mock communities composed of cloned DNA in plasmids: a biological mock community (BioMock), consisting of ITS sequences from fungal taxa, and a synthetic mock community (SynMock), consisting of non-biological ITS-like sequences. Using these spike-in controls we show that: 1) a non-biological synthetic control (e.g., SynMock) is the best solution for parameterizing bioinformatics pipelines, 2) pre-clustering steps for variable length amplicons are critically important, 3) a major source of bias is attributed to initial PCR reactions and thus HTAS read abundances are typically not representative of starting values. We developed AMPtk, a versatile software solution equipped to deal with variable length amplicons and quality filter HTAS data based on spike-in controls. While we describe herein a non-biological synthetic mock community for ITS sequences, the concept and AMPtk software can be widely applied to any HTAS dataset to improve data quality.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementation - AMPtk is publically available at https://github.com/nextgenusfs/amptk.

We show the utility of this approach in predicting several structures of interest from the same static 3D brightfield image, and show that the same tool can prospectively be used to predict the spatiotemporal position of these structures from a bright-field time series. This approach could also be useful in a variety of application areas, such as cross-modal image registration, quantification of live cell imaging, and determination of cell state changes.",

    "abstract": "Lateral heterogeneities in biomembranes play a crucial role in various physiological functions of the cell. Such heterogeneities lead to demixing of lipid constituents and formation of distinct liquid domains in the membrane. We study lateral heterogeneities in terms of topological rearrangements of lipids to identify the liquid-liquid phase coexistence in model membranes. By quantifying the degree of non-affine deformation associated with individual lipid, we are able to characterize the liquid ordered (Lo) and liquid disordered (Ld) phases in model lipid bilayers, without any prior knowledge about the chemical identity of the lipids. We explore the usage of this method on all atom and coarse-grained lipid bilayer trajectories. This method is helpful in defining the instantaneous Lo-Ld domain boundaries in complex multi-component bilayer systems.\\n\\nThe characterization is also used to highlight the effect of line-active molecules on the phase boundaries and domain mixing. Overall, we propose a framework to explore the molecular origin of spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in biomembrane systems, which can be exploited not only in computer simulations but also in experiments.",

Here, we combined transcriptional profiling, reaction-diffusion modeling, and single-molecule tracking to study signal exchange in and out of a microdomain at the cell pole of the asymmetrically dividing bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Our study revealed that the microdomain is selectively permeable, and that each protein in the signaling pathway that activates the cell fate transcription factor CtrA is sequestered and uniformly concentrated within the microdomain or its proximal membrane. Restricted rates of entry into and escape from the microdomain enhance phospho-signaling, leading to a sublinear gradient of CtrA~P along the long axis of the cell. The spatial patterning of CtrA~P creates a gradient of transcriptional activation that serves to prime asymmetric development of the two daughter cells.",

We describe a method based on DNA strand displacement that can be used to quickly and easily perform the labeling and removal of the fluorophores during each sequence. Site-specific tags are conjugated with unique and orthogonal single stranded DNA. Labeling for a particular structure is achieved by hybridization of antibody-bound DNA with a complimentary dye-labeled strand. After imaging, the dye is removed using toehold-mediated strand displacement, in which an invader strand competes off the dye-labeled strand than can be subsequently washed away. Labeling and removal of each DNA-species requires only a few minutes. We demonstrate the concept using sequential dSTORM super-resolution for multiplex imaging of subcellular structures.",

    "abstract": "The proper folding of most secreted and membrane proteins involves interaction with endoplasmic reticulum-resident, glycan-binding chaperones. Some of these chaperones, such as Calreticulin and Calnexin, are nearly ubiquitous, while others are found only in specific cell types, presumably reflecting a role in biosynthesis of proteins specific to those cells. Herein, I have identified Calmegin (Clgn), a chaperone required for fertile spermatogenesis, as a marker of mature neurons in the olfactory system. CLGN was expressed by olfactory marker protein (OMP)-positive neurons in both the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) and the vomeronasal organ (VNO). CLGN was detected both in the perinuclear ER network and in axons. Finally expression of Atf5, a transcription factor required for OSN and VSN development, was both required and sufficient for robust CLGN expression in OSNs and VSNs. Together these findings establish that an ER chaperone required for sperm fertility is developmentally regulated in olfactory neurons, provide a novel marker of mature olfactory neurons, and suggest common mechanisms of secretory protein biogenesis in these cell types.",

The high fidelity of this process is not obviously encoded in the primary spreading reaction. To resolve origins of stable inheritance of repression, we probed the intrinsic fidelity of spreading events in fission yeast using a system that quantitatively describes the spreading reaction in live single cells. We show that spreading from RNAi-nucleated elements is stochastic, multimodal, and fluctuates dynamically across time. In contrast, a second form of spreading, nucleated by the cis-acting element REIII, is deterministic, has high memory capacity and acts as the source of locus fidelity. REIII enables fidelity in part by endowing the locus with resistance to perturbations. Together, our results suggest that epigenetic capacity may not be intrinsically encoded in the spreading reaction, but rather requires collaboration with specialized memory elements.",

A single immune-mediator can differentially contribute to these mechanisms in distinct contexts, confounding our understanding of protection to different pathogens. For example, the NADPH-dependent phagocyte oxidase complex (Phox) produces anti-microbial superoxides and protects from tuberculosis in humans. However, Phox-deficient mice do not display the expected defect in resistance to M. tuberculosis leaving the role of this complex unclear. We re-examined the mechanisms by which Phox contributes to protection from TB and found that mice lacking the Cybb subunit of Phox suffered from a specific defect in tolerance, which was due to unregulated Caspase1 activation, IL-1{beta} production, and neutrophil influx into the lung. These studies demonstrate that Phox-derived superoxide protect against TB by promoting tolerance to persistent infection, and highlight a central role for Caspase1 in regulating TB disease progression.",

BCM is structurally characterized by a core cyclo(L-Ile-L-Leu) 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) that is extensively oxidized. Here, we identify the BCM biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows that the core of BCM is biosynthesised by a cyclodipeptide synthase and the oxidative modifications are introduced by five 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The discovery of the gene cluster enabled the identification of BCM pathways encoded in the genomes of hundreds of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates distributed globally, and heterologous expression of the pathway from P. aeruginosa SCV20265 demonstrated that the product is chemically identical to BCM produced by S. cinnamoneus. Overall, putative BCM gene clusters have been found in at least seven genera spanning Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-). This represents a rare example of horizontal gene transfer of an intact biosynthetic gene cluster across such distantly related bacteria, and we show that these gene clusters are almost always associated with mobile genetic elements.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBicyclomycin is the only natural product antibiotic that selectively inhibits the transcription termination factor Rho. This mechanism of action, combined with its proven biological safety and its activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, makes it a very promising antibiotic candidate. Here, we report the identification of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the known producing organism Streptomyces cinnamoneus, which will enable the engineered production of new bicyclomycin derivatives. The identification of this gene cluster also led to the discovery of hundreds of bicyclomycin pathways encoded in highly diverse bacteria, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This wide distribution of a complex biosynthetic pathway is very unusual, and provides an insight into how a pathway for an antibiotic can be transferred between diverse bacteria.",

Some of these actions involve a division of labor, where phenotypically specialized clonal subpopulations, or genetically distinct lineages cooperate with each other by performing complementary tasks. Here, we combine experimental and computational approaches to investigate potential benefits arising from division of labor during biofilm matrix production. We show that both phenotypic and genetic strategies for a division of labor can promote collective biofilm formation in the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In this species, biofilm matrix consists of two major components; EPS and TasA. We observed that clonal groups of B. subtilis phenotypically segregate into three subpopulations composed of matrix non-producers, EPS-producers, and generalists, which produce both EPS and TasA. This incomplete phenotypic specialization was outperformed by a genetic division of labor, where two mutants, engineered as specialists, complemented each other by exchanging EPS and TasA. The relative fitness of the two mutants displayed a negative frequency dependence both in vitro and on plant roots, with strain frequency reaching a stable equilibrium at 30% TasA-producers, corresponding exactly to the population composition where group productivity is maximized. Using individual-based modelling, we show that asymmetries in strain ratio can arise due to differences in the relative benefits that matrix compounds generate for the collective; and that genetic division of labor can be favored when it breaks metabolic constraints associated with the simultaneous production of two matrix components.\\n\\nHighlights- matrix components EPS and TasA are costly public goods in B. subtilis biofilms\\n\\n- genetic division of labor using {Delta}eps and {Delta}tasA fosters maximal biofilm productivity\\n\\n- {Delta}eps and {Delta}tasA cooperation is evolutionary stable in laboratory and ecological systems\\n\\n- costly metabolic coupling of public goods favors genetic division of labor",

To reveal the mechanism of this interaction, we used computational simulation-based docking studies and identified that the carboxyl tail of 15d-PGJ2 could stabilize the binding of 15d-PGJ2 to eIF4A through arginine 295 of eIF4A, which is the first suggestion that the 15d-PGJ2 tail play a physiological role. Interestingly, the putative 15d-PGJ2 binding site on eiF4A is conserved across many species, suggesting a biological role. Our data propose that studying 15d-PGJ2 and its targets will may uncover new therapeutic approaches in anti-inflammatory drug discovery.",

Single-cell transcriptomics provide a unique opportunity to collect this information. Here we present an initial analysis of thousands of individual cells from Drosophila midbrain, that were acquired using Drop-Seq. A number of approaches permitted the assignment of transcriptional profiles to several major brain regions and cell-types. Expression of biosynthetic enzymes and reuptake mechanisms allows all the neurons to be typed according to the neurotransmitter or neuromodulator that they produce and presumably release. Some neuropeptides are preferentially co-expressed in neurons using a particular fast-acting transmitter, or monoamine. Neuromodulatory and neurotransmitter receptor subunit expression illustrates the potential of these molecules in generating complexity in neural circuit function. This cell atlas dataset provides an important resource to link molecular operations to brain regions and complex neural processes.",

    "abstract": "In the past two decades, a substantial amount of work characterized the odorant receptors, neuroanatomy and odorant response properties of the early olfactory system of Drosophila melanogaster. Yet many odorant receptors remain only partially characterized and, the odorant transduction process and the axon hillock spiking mechanism of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have yet to be fully determined.\\n\\nIdentity and concentration, two key aspects of olfactory coding, originate in the odorant transduction process. Detailed molecular models of the odorant transduction process are, however, scarce for fruit flies. To address these challenges we advance a comprehensive model of fruit fly OSNs as a cascade consisting of an odorant transduction process (OTP) and a biophysical spike generator (BSG). We model identity and concentration in OTP using an odorant-receptor binding rate tensor, modulated by the odorant concentration profile, and an odorant-receptor dissociation rate tensor, and quantitatively describe the ligand binding/dissociation process. We model the BSG as a Connor-Stevens point neuron.\\n\\nThe resulting combinatorial encoding model of the Drosophila antenna provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the neural code of both odorant identity and odorant concentration and advances the state-of-the-art in a number of ways. First, it quantifies on the molecular level the combinatorial complexity of the transformation taking place in the antennae. The concentration-dependent combinatorial code determines the complexity of the input space driving olfactory processing in the downstream neuropils, such as odorant recognition and olfactory associative learning. Second, the model is biologically validated using multiple electrophysiology recordings. Third, the model demonstrates that the currently available data for odorant-receptor responses only enable the estimation of the affinity of the odorant-receptor pairs. The odorant-dissociation rate is only available for a few odorant-receptor pairs. Finally, our model calls for new experiments for massively identifying the odorant-receptor dissociation rates of relevance to flies.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing can characterise this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinders meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce a novel analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. Moreover, we introduce a new and robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronisation of the translational machinery in immune cells upon activation. Additionally, our approach identifies new patterns of variability across CD4+ T cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Lichenized fungi are evolutionarily diverse and ecologically important, but little is known about the processes driving diversification and genetic differentiation in these lineages. Though few studies have examined population genetic patterns in lichens, their geographic distributions are often assumed to be wholly shaped by ecological requirements rather than dispersal limitations. Furthermore, while their reproductive structures are observable, the lack of information about recombination mechanisms and rates can make inferences about reproductive strategies difficult. Here we investigate the population genomics of Cetradonia linearis, an endangered lichen narrowly endemic to the southern Appalachians of eastern North America, to test the relative contributions of environmental factors and geographic distance in shaping genetic structure, and to gain insights into the demography and reproductive biology of range restricted fungi. Analysis of genome-wide SNP data indicated strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for strong isolation by distance, but did not support isolation by environment. Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity also suggested that C. linearis had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, consistent with previous findings in other southern Appalachian taxa. These results contribute to our understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic factors shaping genetic diversity and biogeographic patterns in C. linearis, and more broadly, in rare and endangered fungi.",

We applied TAB-seq and oxBS-seq to selectively detect 5hmC and 5mC, respectively, at base resolution in the mouse cortex, olfactory bulb and cerebellum tissues. We found that majority of the called 5hmC CpG sites frequently had 5mC modification simultaneously and enriched in gene body regions of neuron development related genes in brain tissues. These results supported a prominent role of oxidizing 5mC to 5hmC as new epigenetic mark. Strikingly, by a systematic search of regions that show highly coordinated methylation and hydroxymethylation (MHBs and hMHBs), we found that MHBs significantly overlapped with hMHBs in gene body regions which further supported that oxidized 5mC to 5hmC co-ordinately in a subset of cells within heterogeneous brain tissues. Consistently, using a metric called methylation haplotype load, we defined a subset of 1,361 tissue-specific MHBs and 3,818 shared MHBs which were predominantly regulatory elements, and aids in deconvolution of heterogeneous brain tissues. Our results provide new insights into the role of co-ordinately oxidized 5mC to 5hmC as distal regulatory elements may involve in regulating tissue identity.",

The genetic risk component is high with heritability estimates of 518-70%9. Here we report the first genome-wide significant risk locus for cannabis use disorder (CUD, P=9.31x10-12) that replicates in an independent population (Preplication=3.27x10-3, Pmetaanalysis=9.09x10-12). The finding is based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2,387 cases and 48,985 controls followed by replication in 5,501 cases and 301,041 controls. The index SNP (rs56372821) is a strong eQTL for CHRNA2 and analyses of the genetic regulated gene expressions identified significant association of CHRNA2 expression in cerebellum with CUD. This indicates a potential therapeutic use in CUD of compounds with agonistic effect on the neuronal acetylcholine receptor alpha-2 subunit encoded by CHRNA2.

VnaSSP4.2 was recently discovered as a V. nonalfalfae virulence effector protein in the xylem sap of infected hop. Here, we expanded our search for candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) in the V. nonalfalfae predicted secretome using a bioinformatic pipeline built on V. nonalfalfae genome data, RNA-Seq and proteomic studies of the interaction with hop.\\n\\nResultsThe secretome, rich in carbohydrate active enzymes, proteases, redox proteins and proteins involved in secondary metabolism, cellular processing and signaling, includes 263 CSEPs. Several homologs of known fungal effectors (LysM, NLPs, Hce2, Cerato-platanins, Cyanovirin-N lectins, hydrophobins and CFEM domain containing proteins) and avirulence determinants in the PHI database (Avr-Pita1 and MgSM1) were found. The majority of CSEPs were non-annotated and were narrowed down to 44 top priority candidates based on their likelihood of being effectors. These were examined by spatio-temporal gene expression profiling of infected hop. Among the highest in planta expressed CSEPs, five deletion mutants were tested in pathogenicity assays. A deletion mutant of VnaUn.279, a lethal pathotype specific gene with sequence similarity to SAM-dependent methyltransferase (LaeA), had lower infectivity and showed highly reduced virulence, but no changes in morphology, fungal growth or conidiation were observed.\\n\\nConclusionsSeveral putative secreted effector proteins that probably contribute to V. nonalfalfae colonization of hop were identified in this study. Among them, LaeA gene homolog was found to act as a potential novel virulence effector of V. nonalfalfae.

Previously, we identified a striatin-like protein Fsr1 that plays an important role in stalk rot. To further characterize transcriptome networks downstream of Fsr1, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate relative read abundance and also to infer co-expression networks utilizing the preprocessed expression data through partial correlation. We used a probabilistic pathway activity inference strategy to identify functional subnetwork modules likely involved in virulence. Each subnetwork modules consisted of multiple correlated genes with coordinated expression patterns, but the collective activation levels were significantly different in F. verticillioides wild type versus the mutant. We also identified putative hub genes from predicted subnetworks for functional validation and network robustness studies through mutagenesis, virulence and qPCR studies. Our results suggest that these genes are important virulence genes that regulate the expression of closely correlated genes, demonstrating that these are important hubs of their respective subnetworks. Lastly, we used key F. verticillioides virulence genes to computationally predict a subnetwork of maize genes that potentially respond to fungal genes by applying cointegration-correlation-expression strategy.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in children with epilepsy and can have devastating effects on their quality of life and that of their family. Early identification of CI is a priority to improve outcomes, but the current gold standard of detection with psychometric assessment is resource intensive and not always available. This paper proposes a novel technique of network analysis using routine clinical electroencephalography (EEG) to help identify CI in children with early-onset epilepsy (CWEOE) (0-5 y.o.).\\n\\nMethods: We analyzed functional networks from routinely acquired EEGs of 51 newly diagnosed CWEOE from a prospective population-based study. Combinations of connectivity metrics (e.g. phase-slope index (PSI)) with sub-network analysis (e.g. cluster-span threshold (CST)) identified significant correlations between network properties and cognition scores via rank correlation analysis with Kendalls{tau} . Predictive properties were investigated using a 5-fold cross-validated K-Nearest Neighbor classification model with normal cognition, mild/moderate CI and severe CI classes.\\n\\nResults: Phase-dependent connectivity metrics had higher sensitivity to cognition scores, with sub-networks identifying significant functional network changes over a broad range of spectral frequencies. Approximately 70.5% of all children were appropriately classified as normal cognition, mild/moderate CI or severe CI using CST network features. CST classification predicted CI classes 55% better than chance, and reduced misclassification penalties by half.\\n\\nConclusions: CI in CWEOE can be detected with sensitivity at 85% (with respect to identifying either mild/moderate or severe CI) and specificity of 84%, by EEG network analysis.\\n\\nSignificance: This study outlines a data-driven methodology for identifying candidate biomarkers of CI in CWEOE from network features. Following additional replication, the proposed method and its use of routinely acquired EEG forms an attractive proposition for supporting clinical assessment of CI.",

    "abstract": "Fireflies are among the best-studied of the bioluminescent organisms. Despite longterm interest in the biochemistry, neurobiology, and evolution of firefly flash signals and the widespread biotechnological applications of firefly luciferase, only a limited set of genes related to this complex trait have been described. To investigate the genetic basis of firefly bioluminescence, we generated a high-quality reference genome for the Big Dipper firefly Photinus pyralis, from which the first laboratory luciferase was cloned, using long-read (PacBio), short-read (Illumina), and Hi-C sequencing technologies. To facilitate comparative genomics, we also generated short-read genome assemblies for a Japanese firefly Aquatica lateralis and a bioluminescent click beetle, Ignelater luminosus. Analyses of these genomic datasets supports at least two independent gains of luminescence in beetles, and provides new insights into the evolution of beetle bioluminescence and chemical defenses that likely co-evolved over their 100 million years of evolution.",

Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 systems have been used to confer interference against eukaryotic viruses. Here, we engineered Nicotiana benthamiana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants with the CRISPR/Cas9 system to confer immunity against the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV). Targeting the TYLCV genome with Cas9-single guide RNA at the sequences encoding the coat protein (CP) or replicase (Rep) resulted in efficient virus interference, as evidenced by low accumulation of the TYLCV DNA genome in the transgenic plants. The CRISPR/Cas9-based immunity remained active across multiple generations in the N. benthamiana and tomato plants. Together, our results confirmed the efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for stable engineering of TYLCV resistance in N. benthamiana and tomato, and opens the possibilities of engineering virus resistance against single and multiple infectious viruses in other crops.",

    "abstract": "Standardized DNA assembly strategies facilitate the generation of multigene constructs from collections of building blocks in plant synthetic biology. A common syntax for hierarchical DNA assembly following the Golden Gate principle employing Type IIs restriction endonucleases was recently developed, and underlies the Modular Cloning and GoldenBraid systems. In these systems, transcriptional units and/or multigene constructs are assembled from libraries of standardized building blocks, also referred to as phytobricks, in several hierarchical levels and by iterative Golden Gate reactions. This combinatorial assembly strategy meets the increasingly complex demands in biotechnology and bioengineering, and also represents a cost-efficient and versatile alternative to previous molecular cloning techniques. For Modular Cloning, a collection of commonly used Plant Parts was previously released together with the Modular Cloning toolkit itself, which largely facilitated the adoption of this cloning system in the research community. Here, a collection of approximately 80 additional phytobricks is provided. These phytobricks comprise e.g. modules for inducible expression systems, different promoters or epitope tags, which will increase the versatility of Modular Cloning-based DNA assemblies. Furthermore, first instances of a \\\"peripheral infrastructure\\\" around Modular Cloning are presented: While available toolkits are designed for the assembly of plant transformation constructs, vectors were created to also use coding sequence-containing phytobricks directly in yeast two hybrid interaction or bacterial infection assays. Additionally, DNA modules and assembly strategies for connecting Modular Cloning with Gateway Cloning are presented, which may serve as an interface between available resources and newly adopted hierarchical assembly strategies. The presented material will be provided as a toolkit to the plant research community and will further enhance the usefulness and versatility of Modular Cloning.",

Models based on the analysis of large cell line collections have shown potential for investigating drug efficacy in a clinically-meaningful, cost-effective manner. Using data from thousands of cancer cell lines and drug response experiments, we propose a drug sensitivity prediction system based on a 47-gene expression profile, which was derived from an unbiased transcriptomic network analysis approach. The profile reflects the molecular activity of a diverse range of cancer-relevant processes and pathways. We validated our model using independent datasets and comparisons with published models. A high concordance between predicted and observed drug sensitivities was obtained, including additional validated predictions for four glioblastoma cell lines and four drugs.

    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most common techniques in the analysis of biological data sets, but applying PCA raises two challenges. First, one must determine the number of significant principal components (PCs). Second, because each PC is a linear combination of genes, it rarely has a biological interpretation. Existing methods to determine the number of PCs are either subjective or computationally extensive. We review several methods and describe a new R package, PCDimension, that implements additional methods, the most important being an algorithm that extends and automates a graphical Bayesian method. Using simulations, we compared the methods. Our newly automated procedure performs best when considering both accuracy and speed. We applied the method to a proteomics data set from acute myeloid leukemia patients. Proteins in the apoptosis pathway could be explained using six PCs. By clustering the proteins in PC space, we were able to replace the PCs by six \\\"biological components\\\", three of which could be immediately interpreted from the current literature. We expect this approach combining PCA with clustering to be widely applicable.",

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular simulation models can provide significant insight into the complex behavior of protein systems, but suffer from an inherently distorted description of dynamical properties. We recently demonstrated that, for a heptapeptide of alanine residues, the structural and kinetic properties of a simulation model are linked in a rather simple way, given a certain level of physics present in the model. In this work, we extend these findings to a longer peptide, for which the representation of configuration space in terms of a full enumeration of sequences of helical/coil states along the peptide backbone is impractical. We verify the structural-kinetic relationships by scanning the parameter space of a simple native-biased model and then employ a distinct transferable model to validate and generalize the conclusions. Our results further demonstrate the validity of the previous findings, while clarifying the role of conformational entropy in the determination of the structural-kinetic relationships. More specifically, while the global, long timescale kinetic properties of a particular class of models with varying energetic parameters but approximately fixed conformational entropy are determined by the overarching structural features of the ensemble, a shift in these kinetic observables occurs for models with a distinct representation of steric interactions. At the same time, the relationship between structure and more local, faster kinetic properties is not affected by varying the conformational entropy of the model.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the developing reproductive tract primordium of male and female fetuses consists of the Wolffian duct and the Mullerian duct (MD), two epithelial tube pairs surrounded by mesenchyme. During male development, mesenchyme-epithelia interactions mediate MD regression to prevent its development into a uterus, oviduct and upper vagina. It is well established that transforming growth factor-beta family member anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) secreted from the fetal testis and its type 1 and 2 receptors expressed in MD mesenchyme regulate MD regression. However, little is known about the molecular network regulating downstream actions of AMH signaling. To identify potential AMH-induced genes and regulatory networks controlling MD regression in a global non-biased manner, we examined transcriptome differences in MD mesenchyme between males (AMH signaling on) and females (AMH signaling off) by RNA-Seq analysis of purified fetal MD mesenchymal cells. This analysis found 82 genes up-regulated in males during MD regression and identified Osterix (Osx)/Sp7, a key transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, as a novel downstream effector of AMH signaling during MD regression. Osx/OSX was expressed in a male-specific pattern in MD mesenchyme during MD regression. OSX expression was lost in mutant males without AMH signaling. In addition, transgenic mice ectopically expressing human AMH in females induced a male pattern of Osx expression. Together these results indicate that AMH signaling is necessary and sufficient for Osx expression in the MD mesenchyme. In addition, MD regression was delayed in Osx null males, identifying Osx as a new factor that regulates MD regression.\\n\\nSignificanceIn mammals, each embryo forms both male and female reproductive tract organ progenitor tissues. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) secreted by fetal testes acts on mesenchyme cells adjacent to the Mullerian duct (MD) epithelium, the progenitor tissue of the female reproductive tract, to induce MD regression. While AMH and early AMH signaling components are elucidated, downstream gene networks directing this process are largely unknown. A global non-biased approach using whole transcriptome sequencing of fetal MD mesenchymal cells identified 82 factors as potential target genes of AMH including Osterix (Osx). Our findings provide in vivo evidence Osx is an AMH-induced gene that regulates MD regression. Identification of Osx may provide key insights into gene regulatory networks underlying MD regression and male sex differentiation.",

We reexamined previous claims that the Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1b was brought to southern Africa by pastoralists from eastern Africa, and investigated patterns of sex-biased gene flow in southern Africa.\\n\\nMaterial and MethodsWe analyzed previously published complete mtDNA genome sequences and ~900 kb of NRY sequences from 23 populations from Namibia, Botswana and Zambia, as well as haplogroup frequencies from a large sample of southern African populations and 23 newly genotyped Y-linked STR loci for samples assigned to haplogroup E1b1b.\\n\\nResultsOur results support an eastern African origin for Y-chromosome haplogroup E1b1b; however, its current distribution in southern Africa is not strongly associated with pastoralism, suggesting a more complex origin for pastoralism in this region. We confirm that the Bantu expansion had a notable genetic impact in southern Africa, and that in this region it was probably a rapid, male-dominated expansion. Furthermore, we find a significant increase in the intensity of sex-biased gene flow from north to south, which may reflect changes in the social dynamics between Khoisan and Bantu groups over time.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study shows that the population history of southern Africa has been very complex, with different immigrating groups mixing to different degrees with the autochthonous populations. The Bantu expansion led to heavily sex-biased admixture as a result of interactions between Khoisan females and Bantu males, with a geographic gradient which may reflect changes in the social dynamics between Khoisan and Bantu groups over time.",

Here we present the first simultaneous examination of DNA polymerization kinetics and errors in the human genome sequenced with Single-Molecule-Real-Time technology. We show that polymerization speed differs between non-B and B-DNA: it decelerates at G-quadruplexes and fluctuates periodically at disease-causing tandem repeats. Analyzing polymerization kinetics profiles, we predict and validate experimentally non-B DNA formation for a novel motif. We demonstrate that several non-B motifs affect sequencing errors (e.g., G-quadruplexes increase error rates) and that sequencing errors are positively associated with polymerase slowdown. Finally, we show that highly divergent G4 motifs have pronounced polymerization slowdown and high sequencing error rates, suggesting similar mechanisms for sequencing errors and germline mutations.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are segmented single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses that constitute a major threat to human health. The IAV genome consists of eight RNA segments contained in separate viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) that are packaged together into a single virus particle1,2. While IAVs are generally considered to have an unstructured single-stranded genome, it has also been suggested that secondary RNA structures are required for selective packaging of the eight vRNPs into each virus particle3,4. Here, we employ high-throughput sequencing approaches to map both the intra and intersegment RNA interactions inside influenza virions. Our data demonstrate that a redundant network of RNA-RNA interactions is required for vRNP packaging and virus growth. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that IAVs have a much more structured genome than previously thought and the redundancy of RNA interactions between the different vRNPs explains how IAVs maintain the potential for reassortment between different strains, while also retaining packaging selectivity. Our study establishes a framework towards further work into IAV RNA structure and vRNP packaging, which will lead to better models for predicting the emergence of new pandemic influenza strains and will facilitate the development of antivirals specifically targeting genome assembly.",

Results from imaging studies in two neurodegenerative diseases reveal new subgroups and their distinct trajectories of regional neurodegeneration. In genetic frontotemporal dementia, SuStaIn identifies genotypes from imaging alone, validating its ability to identify subtypes, and characterises within-group heterogeneity for the first time. In Alzheimers disease, SuStaIn uncovers three subtypes, uniquely revealing their temporal complexity. SuStaIn provides fine-grained patient stratification, which substantially enhances the ability to predict conversion between diagnostic categories over standard models that ignore subtype (p=7.18x10--4) or temporal stage (p=3.96x10-5). SuStaIn thus offers new promise for enabling disease subtype discovery and precision medicine.",

A limitation of this approach is that multiple aetiological pathways could result in a similar phenotype, so the role of any one brain mechanism may be substantially underestimated. Building on advances in network analysis, we used a data-driven community-clustering algorithm to identify robust subgroups based on white-matter microstructure in childhood and adolescence (total N=313, mean age: 11.24 years). The algorithm indicated the presence of two equal-size groups that show a critical difference in FA of the left and right cingulum. These different  brain types had profoundly different cognitive abilities with higher performance in the higher FA group. Further, a connectomics analysis indicated reduced structural connectivity in the low FA subgroup that was strongly related to reduced functional activation of the default mode network.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=155 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/237859_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (34K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135e807org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145673org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@137cd67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8e2cff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

During motor activity, high gamma power was the only frequency band where the electrophysiological response was colocalised with fMRI measures across all subjects.

    "abstract": "Successful motor performance relies on our ability to adapt to changes in the environment by learning novel mappings between motor commands and sensory outcomes. Such adaptation is thought to involve two distinct mechanisms: An implicit, error-based component linked to slow learning and an explicit, strategic component linked to fast learning and savings (i.e., faster relearning). Because behaviour, at any given moment, is the resultant combination of these two processes, it has remained a challenge to parcellate their relative contributions to performance. The explicit component to visuomotor rotation (VMR) learning has recently been measured by having participants verbally report their aiming strategy used to counteract the rotation. However, this procedure has been shown to magnify the explicit component. Here we tested whether task-specific eye movements, a natural component of reach planning--but poorly studied in motor learning tasks--can provide a direct read-out of the state of the explicit component during VMR learning. We show, by placing targets on a visible ring and including a delay between target presentation and reach onset, that individual differences in gaze patterns during sensorimotor adaptation are linked to participants rates of learning and can predict the expression of savings. Specifically, we find that participants who, during reach planning, naturally fixate an aimpoint, rotated away from the target location, show faster initial adaptation and readaptation 24 hrs. later. Our results demonstrate that gaze behaviour can not only uniquely identify individuals who implement cognitive strategies during learning, but also how their implementation is linked to differences in learning.",

    "abstract": "The scale of the ongoing biodiversity crisis requires both effective conservation prioritisation and urgent action. The EDGE metric, which prioritises species based on their Evolutionary Distinctiveness (ED) and Global Endangerment (GE), relies on adequate phylogenetic and extinction risk data to generate meaningful priorities for conservation. However, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of large clades are extremely rare and, even when available, become quickly out-of-date due to the rapid rate of species descriptions and taxonomic revisions. Thus, it is important that conservationists can use the available data to incorporate evolutionary history into conservation prioritisation. We compared published and new methods to impute ED for species missing from a phylogeny whilst simultaneously correcting the ED scores of their close taxonomic relatives. We found that following artificial removal of species from a phylogeny, the new method provided the closest estimates of their \\\"true\\\" score, differing from the true ED score by an average of less than 1%, compared to the 31% and 38% difference of the previous imputation methods. Previous methods also substantially under- and over-estimated scores as more species were artificially removed from a phylogeny. We therefore used the new method to estimate ED scores for all tetrapods. From these scores we updated EDGE prioritisation rankings for all tetrapod species with IUCN Red List assessments, including the first EDGE prioritisation for reptiles. Further, we identified criteria to identify robust priority species in an effort to further inform conservation action whilst limiting uncertainty and anticipating future phylogenetic advances.",

    "abstract": "Modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes reared in laboratories are being released around the world to control wild mosquito populations and the diseases they transmit. Several efforts have failed due to poor competitiveness of the released mosquitoes. We hypothesized that colonized mosquito populations could suffer from inbreeding depression and adapt to laboratory conditions, reducing their performance in the field. We established replicate populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes collected from Queensland, Australia, and maintained them in the laboratory for twelve generations at different census sizes. Mosquito colonies maintained at small census sizes ([&le;]100 individuals) suffered from inbreeding depression due to low effective population sizes which were only 25% of the census size as estimated by SNP markers. Populations that underwent full-sib mating for 9 consecutive generations had greatly reduced performance across all traits measured. We compared the established laboratory populations with their ancestral population resurrected from quiescent eggs for evidence of laboratory adaptation. The overall performance of laboratory populations maintained at a large census size (400 individuals) increased, potentially reflecting adaptation to artificial rearing conditions. However most individual traits were unaffected, and patterns of adaptation were not consistent across populations. Differences between replicate populations may indicate that founder effects and drift affect experimental outcomes. Though we find limited evidence of laboratory adaptation, mosquitoes maintained at low population sizes can clearly suffer fitness costs, compromising the success of \\\"rear and release\\\" strategies for arbovirus control.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in life-science instrumentation and automation enable entirely new modes of human interaction with microbiological processes and corresponding applications for science and education through biology cloud labs. A critical barrier for remote life-science experimentation is the absence of suitable abstractions and interfaces for programming living matter. To this end we conceptualize a programming paradigm that provides stimulus control functions and sensor control functions for realtime manipulation of biological (physical) matter. Additionally, a simulation mode facilitates higher user throughput, program debugging, and biophysical modeling. To evaluate this paradigm, we implemented a JavaScript-based web toolkit,  Bioty, that supports realtime interaction with swarms of phototactic Euglena cells hosted on a cloud lab. Studies with remote users demonstrate that individuals with little to no biology knowledge and intermediate programming knowledge were able to successfully create and use scientific applications and games. This work informs the design of programming environments for controlling living matter in general and lowers the access barriers to biology experimentation for professional and citizen scientists, learners, and the lay public.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBiology cloud labs are an emerging approach to lower access barriers to life-science experimentation. However, suitable programming approaches and user interfaces are lacking, especially ones that enable the interaction with the living matter itself - not just the control of equipment. Here we present and implement a corresponding programming paradigm for realtime interactive applications with remotely housed biological systems, and which is accessible and useful for scientists, programmers and lay people alike. Our user studies show that scientists and non-scientists are able to rapidly develop a variety of applications, such as interactive biophysics experiments and games. This paradigm has the potential to make first-hand experiences with biology accessible to all of society and to accelerate the rate of scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "Membraneless organelles important to intracellular compartmentalization have recently been shown to comprise assemblies of proteins which undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, many proteins involved in this phase separation are at least partially disordered. The molecular mechanism and the sequence determinants of this process are challenging to determine experimentally owing to the disordered nature of the assemblies, motivating the use of theoretical and simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may incorporate additional features for biological systems of interest.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLiquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) of low-complexity protein sequences has emerged as an important research topic due to its relevance to membraneless organelles and intracellular compartmentalization. However a molecular level understanding of LLPS cannot be easily obtained by experimental methods due to difficulty of determining structural properties of phase separated protein assemblies, and of choosing appropriate mutations. Here we advance a coarse-grained computational framework for accessing the long time scale phase separation process and for obtaining molecular details of LLPS, in conjunction with state of the art enhanced sampling methods. We are able to capture qualitatively the changes of phase diagram due to specific mutations, inclusion of a folded domain, and to variation of chain length. The model is flexible and can be used with different knowledge-based potential energy functions, as we demonstrate. We expect a wide application of the presented framework for advancing our understanding of the formation of liquid-like protein assemblies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSomatic mutations observed in clonal hematopoiesis are associated with increased age and risk of hematological malignancies. However, the limited number of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in studies of clonal hematopoiesis thus far has precluded determination of the spectrum of mutations leading to AML and their impact on risk and time to diagnosis.\\n\\nMethodsThe relationship between baseline mutations and subsequent AML was determined in a case-control study design. 212 women eventually diagnosed with AML (median time: 9.8 years) were identified from the Womens Health Initiative cohort alongside 212 matched AML-free controls. Deep sequencing of 67 genes was performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood to detect subclonal mutations.\\n\\nResultsThe presence of any mutation was associated with increased odds of eventual AML (odds ratio [OR] 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-6.3). These odds were further elevated with mutations in IDH1/2 (OR 8.4; 95% CI, 1.4-51.9), TP53 (OR 54.2; 95% CI, 2.9-1017.7), or spliceosome genes (OR 5.6; 95% CI, 1.5-20.6). Eventual AML diagnosis occurred in all or most participants with mutations in TP53 (N=23/23) or IDH1/2 (N=15/16). Mutations indicated sooner AML diagnosis (median 8.0 vs. 11.9 years; P < 0.001) with TP53 mutations demonstrating increased odds of AML within 5 years (OR 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-9.1).\\n\\nConclusionsMutations are present in peripheral blood of AML patients a decade prior to AML diagnosis with mutations in TP53 producing especially rapid presentation. Strategies for monitoring of high-risk populations are needed and clinical trials of potential early interventions can be considered.",

Improved technical ability to detect circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) component of blood plasma via next-generation sequencing and established correlations between ctDNA load and tumor burden in cancer patients have spurred excitement about the possibilities of detecting cancer early by performing ctDNA mutation detection.\\n\\nWe reanalyze published data on the expected ctDNA allele fraction in early-stage cancer and the population statistics of cfDNA concentration to show that under conservative technical assumptions, high-sensitivity cancer detection by ctDNA mutation detection will require either more blood volume (150-300mL) than practical for a routine screen or variant filtering that may be impossible given our knowledge of cancer evolution, and will likely remain out of economic reach for routine population screening without multiple-order-of-magnitude decreases in sequencing cost. Instead, new approaches that integrate ctDNA mutations with multiple other blood-based analytes (such as exosomes, circulating tumor cells, ctDNA epigenetics, metabolites) as well as integration of these signals over time for each individual may be needed.",

FUCCI consists of two fluorescent probes, so that cells in the G1 phase fluoresce red and cells in the S/G2/M phase fluoresce green. FUCCI reveals real-time information about cell cycle dynamics of individual cells, and can be used to explore how the cell cycle relates to the location of individual cells, local cell density, and different cellular microenvironments. In particular, FUCCI is used in experimental studies examining cell migration, such as malignant invasion and wound healing. Here we present new mathematical models which can describe cell migration and cell cycle dynamics as indicated by FUCCI. The fundamental model describes the two cell cycle phases, G1 and S/G2/M, which FUCCI directly labels. The extended model includes a third phase, early S, which FUCCI indirectly labels. We present experimental data from scratch assays using FUCCI-transduced melanoma cells, and show that the predictions of spatial and temporal patterns of cell density in the experiments can be described by the fundamental model. We obtain numerical solutions of both the fundamental and extended models, which can take the form of travelling waves. These solutions are mathematically interesting because they are a combination of moving wavefronts and moving pulses. We derive and confirm a simple analytical expression for the minimum wave speed, as well as exploring how the wave speed depends on the spatial decay rate of the initial condition.",

    "abstract": "There is growing appreciation of the importance of the mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment on disease progression. However, the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and cellular mechanotransduction in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of substrate rigidity on various aspects of SKOV3 human EOC cell morphology and migration. Youngs modulus values of normal mouse peritoneum, a principal target tissue for EOC metastasis, were determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and hydrogels were fabricated to mimic these values. We find that cell spreading, focal adhesion formation, myosin light chain phosphorylation, and cellular traction forces all increase on stiffer matrices. Substrate rigidity also positively regulates random cell migration and, importantly, directional increases in matrix tension promote SKOV3 cell durotaxis. Matrix rigidity also promotes nuclear translocation of YAP1, an oncogenic transcription factor associated with aggressive metastatic EOC. Furthermore, disaggregation of multicellular EOC spheroids, a behavior associated with dissemination and metastasis, is enhanced by matrix stiffness through a mechanotransduction pathway involving ROCK, actomyosin contractility, and FAK. Finally, this pattern of mechanosensitivity is maintained in highly metastatic SKOV3ip.1 cells. These results establish that the mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment may play a role in EOC metastasis.",

Species-rich sites contain disproportionately high numbers of recently diverged sympatric species but contain lineages with slower-than-average diversification rates. The positive sympatry-diversity relationship consistently overwhelms the negative diversification-diversity relationship, particularly among high-diversity sites (>250 species). These patterns repeat across biomes and continents with striking regularity, and remain consistent across multiple timescales, including the recent evolutionary past.

In the microbial world, seasonality has been reported for communities inhabiting temperate zones, but not much is known on seasonality for individual species.

Here we developed a  Recurrence Index to quantify predictability in microbial species. Applying our index to 18S rDNA metabarcoding data from one of the longest temporal observatories of marine plankton we determined that 13% of the picoeukaryotic and 19% of the nanoeukaryotic species, accounting for about 40% of the community abundance in both fractions, feature predictable dynamics when sampled monthly during 10 years. Thus, most of the species analysed had unpredictable temporal abundance patterns. Altogether, we show that species with both predictable and unpredictable temporal dynamics can occur within the same seasonal microbial community.",

Functional comparisons of homologous neurons may reveal how neural circuitry contributes to behavioural evolution, but homologous neurons cannot be identified and manipulated in most taxa. Here, we compare the function of homologous courtship song neurons by exporting neurogenetic reagents that label identified neurons in Drosophila melanogaster to D. yakuba. We found a conserved role for a cluster of brain neurons that establish a persistent courtship state. In contrast, a descending neuron with conserved electrophysiological properties drives different song types in each species. Our results suggest that song evolved, in part, due to changes in the neural circuitry downstream of this descending neuron. This experimental approach can be generalized to other neural circuits and therefore provides an experimental framework for studying how the nervous system has evolved to generate behavioural diversity.",

    "abstract": "Important traits in agricultural, natural, and human populations are increasingly being shown to be under the control of many genes that individually contribute only a small proportion of genetic variation. However, the majority of modern tools in quantitative and population genetics, including genome wide association studies and selection mapping protocols, are designed to identify individual genes with large effects. We have developed an approach to identify traits that have been under selection and are controlled by large numbers of loci. In contrast to existing methods, our technique utilizes additive effects estimates from all available markers, and relates these estimates to allele frequency change over time. Using this information, we generate a composite statistic, denoted[G] , which can be used to test for significant evidence of selection on a trait. Our test requires pre- and post-selection genotypic data but only a single time point with phenotypic information. Simulations demonstrate that[G] is powerful for identifying selection, particularly in situations where the trait being tested is controlled by many genes, which is precisely the scenario where classical approaches for selection mapping are least powerful. We apply this test to breeding populations of maize and chickens, where we demonstrate the successful identification of selection on traits that are documented to have been under selection.",

    "abstract": "Despite rapid developments in single cell sequencing technology, sample-specific batch effects, detection of cell doublets, and the cost of generating massive datasets remain outstanding challenges. Here, we introduce cell \\\"hashing\\\", where oligo-tagged antibodies against ubiquitously expressed surface proteins are used to uniquely label cells from distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled. By sequencing these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we can assign each cell to its sample of origin, and robustly identify doublets originating from multiple samples. We demonstrate our approach by pooling eight human PBMC samples on a single run of the 10x Chromium system, substantially reducing our per-cell costs for library generation. Cell \\\"hashing\\\" is inspired by, and complementary to, elegant multiplexing strategies based on genetic variation, which we also leverage to validate our results. We therefore envision that our approach will help to generalize the benefits of single cell multiplexing to diverse samples and experimental designs.",

    "abstract": "Transposon-Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS) is a high-throughput method coupling transposon mutagenesis with short-fragment DNA sequencing. It is commonly used to identify essential genes. Single gene deletion libraries are considered the gold standard for identifying essential genes. Currently, the TraDIS method has not been benchmarked against such libraries and therefore it remains unclear whether the two methodologies are comparable. To address this, a high density transposon library was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12. Essential genes predicted from sequencing of this library were compared to existing essential gene databases. To decrease false positive identification of essential gene candidates, statistical data analysis included corrections for both gene length and genome length. Through this analysis new essential genes and genes previously incorrectly designated as essential were identified. We show that manual analysis of TraDIS data reveals novel features that would not have been detected by statistical analysis alone. Examples include short essential regions within genes, orientation-dependent effects and fine resolution identification of genome and protein features. Recognition of these insertion profiles in transposon mutagenesis datasets will assist genome annotation of less well characterized genomes and provides new insights into bacterial physiology and biochemistry.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEIncentives to define lists of genes that are essential for bacterial survival include the identification of potential targets for antibacterial drug development, genes required for rapid growth for exploitation in biotechnology, and discovery of new biochemical pathways. To identify essential genes in E. coli, we constructed a very high density transposon mutant library. Initial automated analysis of the resulting data revealed many discrepancies when compared to the literature. We now report more extensive statistical analysis supported by both literature searches and detailed inspection of high density TraDIS sequencing data for each putative essential gene for the model laboratory organism, Escherichia coli. This paper is important because it provides a better understanding of the essential genes of E. coli, reveals the limitations of relying on automated analysis alone and a provides new standard for the analysis of TraDIS data.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive and specific antibodies are essential for detecting molecules in cells and tissues. However, currently used polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often less sensitive than desired, difficult to produce, and available in limited quantities. A promising recent approach to circumvent these limitations is to employ chemically-defined antigen-combining sites called nanobodies, derived from single chain camelid antibodies. Here, we used nanobodies to prepare sensitive unimolecular detection reagents by genetically fusing cDNAs encoding nanobodies to enzymatic or antigenic reporters. We call these fusions between a reporter and a nanobody RANbodies. They can be used to localize epitopes and to amplify signals from fluorescent proteins. They be generated and purified simply and in unlimited amounts, and can be preserved safely and inexpensively in the form of DNA or digital sequence.",

    "abstract": "Amblyopia is a prevalent developmental visual disorder of childhood that typically persists in adults. Due to altered visual experience during critical periods of youth, the structure and function of adult visual cortex is abnormal. In addition to substantial deficits shown with task-based fMRI, previous studies have used resting state measures to demonstrate altered long-range connectivity in amblyopia. This is the first study in amblyopia to analyze connectivity between regions of interest that are smaller than a single cortical area and to apply partial correlation analysis to reduce network effects. We specifically assess short-range connectivity between retinotopically defined regions of interest within the occipital lobe of 8 subjects with amblyopia and 7 subjects with normal vision (aged 19-45). The representations of visual areas V1, V2, and V3 within each of the four quadrants of visual space were further subdivided into three regions based on maps of visual field eccentricity. Connectivity between pairs of all nine regions of interest in each quadrant was tested via correlation and partial correlation for both groups. Only the tests of partial correlation, i.e., correlation between time courses of two regions following the regression of time courses from all other regions, yielded significant differences between resting state functional connectivity in amblyopic and normal subjects. Subjects with amblyopia showed significantly higher partial correlation between para-foveal and more eccentric representations within V1, and this effect associated with poor acuity of the worse eye. In addition, we observed reduced correlation in amblyopic subjects between isoeccentricity regions in V1 and V2, and separately, between such regions in V2 and V3. We conclude that partial correlation-based connectivity is altered in an eccentricity-dependent pattern in visual field maps of amblyopic patients. Moreover, results are consistent with known clinical and psychophysical vision loss. More broadly, this provides evidence that abnormal cortical adaptations to disease may be better isolated with tests of partial correlation connectivity than with the regular correlation techniques that are currently widely used.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between our conscious experiences of the visual world and the neuronal processes involved in the processing of visual information is a central theme of current research. However, it is not yet known whether conscious experiences possess unique quantitative or qualitative processing features. Recently we have shown that two visual stimuli, one consciously experienced and one not, interact as function of features and objects similarity, pointing to preserved visual representations in the absence of perceptual awareness. Here we ask whether these representations can be modified in the absence of perceptual awareness by testing interactions while the unperceived stimulus is being modified outside of ones awareness. Observers performed a Motion Induced Blindness task, wherein a plaid  Target was morphed into a Gabor patch once disappearance was reported. Reappearances of the morphed target were induced by a visible  Cue. Our results indicate that the effectiveness of the cue depends on the target representation during the time of suppression. Reappearance rates were highest when the morphed target and the cue share the same orientations. Our findings indicate that the target-cue interactions do not depend on memory-stored representations, but rather on the current state of the consciously unavailable target. We conclude that visual representations can be modified in the absence of conscious perception.",

    "abstract": "Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) pass through multiple stages of developmental competence, where they successively acquire and lose the ability to generate individual cell subtypes. To identify the transcriptional regulatory networks that control these transitions, we conducted epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling of early and late-stage RPCs and observed a developmentally dynamic landscape of chromatin accessibility. Open chromatin regions that showed stage-specificity, as well as those shared by early and late-stage RPCs, were selectively targeted by the homeodomain factor Lhx2, which is expressed throughout retinal neurogenesis but also regulates many stage-specific processes in RPCs. Stage-specific Lhx2 binding sites were frequently associated with target sites for transcription factors that are preferentially expressed in either early or late-stage RPCs, and which were predicted to possess pioneer activity. Lhx2 loss of function in RPCs led to a loss of chromatin accessibility at both direct Lhx2 target sites and more broadly across the genome, as well as a loss of binding by transcription factors associated with stage-specific Lhx2 target sites. These findings demonstrate a central role for Lhx2 in control of chromatin accessibility in RPCs, and identify transcription factors that may guide stage-specific target site selection by Lhx2.\\n\\nSummaryLhx2 is a central regulator of chromatin accessibility in retinal progenitor cells, and interacts with stage-specific transcription factors to regulate genes that are dynamically expressed during retinal neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Visual stimuli are encoded in the activity patterns of neocortical neuronal populations. Trial-averaged neuronal activity is selectively modulated by particular visual stimulus parameters, such as the direction of a moving bar of light, resulting in well-defined tuning properties. However, a large number of neurons in visual cortex remain unmodulated by any given stimulus parameter, and the role of this untuned population is not well understood. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging to record, in an unbiased manner, from large populations of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to describe co-varying activity on single trials in populations consisting of tuned and untuned neurons. Specifically, we summarize pairwise covariability with an asymmetric partial correlation coefficient, allowing us to analyze the population correlation structure with graph theory. Using the graph neighbors of a neuron, we find that the local population, including tuned and untuned neurons, are able to predict individual neuron activity on a single trial basis and recapitulate average tuning properties of tuned neurons. We also find that a specific functional triplet motif in the graph results in the best predictions, suggesting a signature of informative correlations in these populations. Variance explained in total population activity scales with the number of neurons imaged, suggesting larger sample sizes are required to fully capture local network interactions. In summary, we show that unbiased sampling of the local population can explain single trial response variability as well as trial-averaged tuning properties in V1, and the ability to predict responses is tied to the occurrence of a functional triplet motif.\\n\\nAuthor summaryV1 populations have historically been characterized by single cell response properties and pairwise co-variability. Many cells, however, do not show obvious dependencies to a given stimulus or behavioral task, and have consequently gone unanalyzed. We densely record from V1 populations to measure how trial-to-trial response variability relates to these previously understudied neurons. We find that individual neurons, regardless of response properties, are inextricably dependent on the population in which they are embedded. By studying patterns of correlations between groups of neurons, we identify a specific triplet motif that predicts this dependence on local population activity. Only by studying large populations simultaneously were we able to find an emergent property of this information. These results imply that understanding how the visual system operates with substantial trial-to-trial variability will necessitate a network perspective that accounts for both visual stimuli and activity in the local population.",

Here we report for the first time that elevated expression of progesterone receptor (PGR) isoforms A and B parallels increased estrogen receptor (ER) expression in PCOS-like rat uteri. The aberrant PGR-targeted gene expression in PCOS-like rats before and after implantation overlaps with dysregulated expression of Fkbp52 and Ncoa2, two genes that contribute to the development of uterine P4 resistance. In vivo and in vitro studies of the effects of metformin on the regulation of the uterine P4 signaling pathway under PCOS conditions showed that metformin directly inhibits the expression of PGR and ER along with the regulation of several genes that are targeted dependently or independently of PGR-mediated uterine implantation. Functionally, metformin treatment corrected the abnormal expression of cell-specific PGR and ER and some PGR-target genes in PCOS-like rats with implantation. Additionally, we documented how metformin contributes to the regulation of the PGR-associated MAPK/ERK/p38 signaling pathway in the PCOS-like rat uterus. Our data provide novel insights into how metformin therapy regulates uterine P4 signaling molecules under PCOS conditions.",

Although barley (Hordeum vulgare) is the fourth most abundant cereal crop plant, the knowledge about these important phytohormones in regard to the root and shoot stem cell niche in barley is still negligible. In this study, we analyse the influence of auxin and cytokinin on the barley root meristem and present reporter lines to describe the auxin and cytokinin signalling output. Application of high concentrations of auxin and cytokinin to barley seedlings had a negative influence on barley root and meristem growth. The expression of the cytokinin reporter TCSn revealed that cytokinin signalling mostly takes place in the stele cells proximal to the QC and in the differentiated root cap cells, but can additionally be activated in the root stem cell niche by cytokinin application. Analysing signalling targets of auxin showed that a homologue of AtPLT1, HvPLT1, is expressed in a similar way as AtPLT1 in Arabidopsis, in particular in the QC and the surrounding cells. Furthermore, a homologue of the auxin PIN transporters PIN1, HvPIN1, was expressed in the root and the shoot meristem and polarly localizes to the plasma membrane. Its expression is regulated by cytokinin and the intracellular localisation is affected by BFA. With this study, we provide a valuable tool set of fluorescent barley reporter lines for auxin and cytokinin.",
