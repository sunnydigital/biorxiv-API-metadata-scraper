    "abstract": "In this study, we analyse RNA-Seq data from panels of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to identify covariation in the mRNA levels of large numbers of genes. Such large scale covariation may have biological origin or be due to technical variation in analysis (generally referred to as batch effects). We show that batch effects cannot explain this covariation by demonstrating reproducibility across different human populations and across different methods of analysis. This view is also supported by enrichment of single and combinations of transcription factors (TFs) binding to cognate promoter regions, enrichment of genes shown to be sensitive to the knockdown of individual TFs, enrichment of functional pathways, and finally enrichment of protein-protein interactions in proteins encoded by groups of covarying genes. The properties of the groups of covarying genes are therefore most readily explained by the influence of cumulative variations in the effectors of gene expression that act in trans on cognate genes. We suggest that covariation has functional outcomes by showing that covariation of 83 genes involved in the spliceosome pathway accounts for 8-16% of the variation in the alternative splicing patterns of genes expressed in human LCLs.",

    "abstract": "The closure of the Isthmus of Panama has long been considered to be one of the best defined biogeographic calibration points for molecular divergence-time estimation. However, geological and biological evidence has recently cast doubt on the presumed timing of the initial isthmus closure around 3 Ma but has instead suggested the existence of temporary land bridges as early as the Middle or Late Miocene. The biological evidence supporting these earlier land bridges was based either on only few molecular markers or on concatenation of genome-wide sequence data, an approach that is known to result in potentially misleading branch lengths and divergence times, which could compromise the reliability of this evidence. To allow divergence-time estimation with genomic data using the more appropriate multi-species coalescent model, we here develop a new method combining the SNP-based Bayesian species-tree inference of the software SNAPP with a molecular clock model that can be calibrated with fossil or biogeographic constraints. We validate our approach with simulations and use our method to reanalyze genomic data of Neotropical army ants (Dorylinae) that previously supported divergence times of Central and South American populations before the isthmus closure around 3 Ma. Our reanalysis with the multi-species coalescent model shifts all of these divergence times to ages younger than 3 Ma, suggesting that the older estimates supporting the earlier existence of temporary land bridges were artifacts resulting at least partially from the use of concatenation. We then apply our method to a new RAD-sequencing data set of Neotropical sea catfishes (Ariidae) and calibrate their species tree with extensive information from the fossil record. We identify a series of divergences between groups of Caribbean and Pacific sea catfishes around 10 Ma, indicating that processes related to the emergence of the isthmus led to vicariant speciation already in the Late Miocene, millions of years before the final isthmus closure.",

    "abstract": "\\\"This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100032)\\\"\\n\\nThe Neotropical region has experienced a dynamic landscape evolution throughout the Miocene, with the large wetland Pebas occupying western Amazonia until 11-8 my ago and continuous uplift of the Andes mountains along the western edge of South America. Although the complex dynamics between the Andes and Amazonia may have strongly affected the trajectory of Neotropical biodiversity, there is little evidence for such an influence from time-calibrated phylogenies of groups that diversified during this period. Here, we generate one of the most comprehensive time-calibrated molecular phylogenies of a group of Neotropical insects: the butterfly tribe Ithomiini. Our tree includes 340 species (87% of extant species), spanning 26 million years of diversification in the Neotropics. We investigate temporal and spatial patterns of diversification, focusing on the influence of Miocene landscape tranformations on the dynamics of speciation, extinction and biotic interchanges at the Amazonia/Andes interface. We find that Ithomiini likely began diversifying at the interface between the Andes and the Amazonia around 26.4 my ago. Five subtribes with a very low extant diversity started diversifying early in western Amazonia, but a rapid decrease in diversification rate due to increased extinction rate between 20 and 10 my ago suggests a negative impact of the Pebas wetland system on these early lineages. By contrast, the clade containing the five most species-rich subtribes (85% of extant species) was characterized by a high, positive net diversification rate. This clade diversified exclusively in the Central Andes from 20 to 10 my ago. After the demise of the Pebas system (11-8 my ago), we found a sudden increase of interchanges with the Northern Andes and Amazonia, followed by local diversification, which led to a substantial renewal of diversification. In general, ecological turnovers throughout the Miocene strongly determined the dynamics of speciation, and extinction and interchanges, and appear as a key driving force shaping the regions current extraordinary biodiversity.",

However, the speed and acuity of tactile edge orientation processing with respect to the fingertips as reported in previous perceptual studies appear inadequate in these respects. Here we directly establish the tactile systems capacity to process edge-orientation information during dexterous manipulation. Participants extracted tactile information about edge orientation very quickly, using it within 200 ms of first touching the object. Participants were also strikingly accurate. With edges spanning the entire fingertip, edge-orientation resolution was better than 3{degrees} in our object manipulation task, which is several times better than reported in previous perceptual studies. Performance remained impressive even with edges as short as 2 mm, consistent with our ability to precisely manipulate very small objects. Taken together, our results radically redefine the spatial processing capacity of the tactile system.",

    "abstract": "During mammalian cerebellar development, postnatal granule cell progenitors proliferate in the outer part of the External Granule Layer (EGL). Postmitotic granule progenitors migrate tangentially in the inner EGL before switching to migrate radially inward, past the Purkinje cell layer, to achieve their final position in the mature Granule Cell Layer (GCL). Here, we show that the RacGAP {beta}-chimaerin is expressed by a small population of late-born, premigratory granule cells. {beta}-chimaerin deficiency causes a subset of granule cells to become arrested in the EGL, where they differentiate and form ectopic neuronal clusters. These clusters of granule cells are able to recruit aberrantly projecting mossy fibers. Collectively, these data suggest a role for {beta}-chimaerin as an intracellular mediator of Cerebellar Granule Cell radial migration.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMetacognition is the capacity to evaluate the success of ones own cognitive processes in various domains, e.g. memory and perception. It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a domain-general resource that is applied to different tasks, or whether self-evaluative processes are domain-specific. Here we directly investigated this issue by examining the neural substrates engaged when metacognitive judgments were made by human participants during perceptual and memory tasks matched for stimulus and performance characteristics. By comparing patterns of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity while subjects evaluated their performance, we revealed both domain-specific and domain-general metacognitive representations. Multi-voxel activity patterns in anterior prefrontal cortex predicted levels of confidence in a domain-specific fashion, whereas domain-general signals predicting confidence and accuracy were found in a widespread network in the frontal and posterior midline. The demonstration of domain-specific metacognitive representations suggests the presence of a content-rich mechanism available to introspection and cognitive control.\\n\\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW O_SCPLOWSTATEMENTC_SCPLOWWe use human neuroimaging to investigate processes supporting memory and perceptual metacognition. It remains controversial whether metacognition relies on a global resource that is applied to different tasks, or whether self-evaluative processes are specific to particular tasks. Using multivariate decoding methods, we provide evidence that perceptual- and memory-specific metacognitive representations cortex co-exist with generic confidence signals. Our findings reconcile previously conflicting results on the domain-specificity/generality of metacognition, and lay the groundwork for a mechanistic understanding of metacognitive judgments.",

    "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) undergoes regulated degradation as part of feedback control of the sterol pathway. In yeast the stability of the Hmg2 isozyme of HMGR is controlled by the 20 carbon isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP): increasing levels of GGPP causes more efficient degradation by the HRD pathway, allowing feedback regulation of HMGR. The HRD pathway is a conserved quality control pathway critical for the ER-associated degradation of misfolded ER proteins. We have explored the action of GGPP in HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation. GGPP was highly potent as a regulatory molecule in vivo, and in vitro, GGPP altered Hmg2 folding at nanomolar concentrations. These effects of GGPP were absent in a variety of stabilized or non-regulated Hmg2 mutants. Consistent with its high potency, the effects of GGPP were highly specific; other closely related molecules were ineffective in altering Hmg2 structure. In fact, two close GGPP analogues, 2F-GGPP and GGSPP were completely inactive at all concentrations tested, and GGSPP was an antagonist of GGPPs effects in vivo and in vitro. The effects of GGPP on Hmg2 structure and degradation were reversed by chemical chaperones, indicating that GGPP caused selective Hmg2 misfolding. These data indicate that GGPP functions in a manner analogous to an allosteric ligand, causing Hmg2 misfolding through interaction with a reversible, specific binding site. Consistent with this, the Hmg2 protein forms mulitmers. We propose that this \\\"allosteric misfolding,\\\" or mallostery, may be a widely used tactic of biological regulation, with potential for development of small molecule pharmaceuticals that induce selective misfolding.",

    "abstract": "N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) is a procarcinogen used widely in physiological investigations of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Its metabolic pathways have been described extensively, yet little is known about its biochemical processing, growth cycle expression and pharmacological properties inside living hepatocytes - the principal cellular targets of this hepatocarcinogen. In this report, primary monolayer adult rat hepatocyte cultures and high specific-activity [ring G-3H]-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene were used to extend previous observations of metabolic activation of AAF by highly differentiated, proliferation-competent hepatocytes in long-term cultures. AAF metabolism proceeded by zero-order kinetics. Hepatocytes processed significant amounts of procarcinogen ({approx}12 g AAF/106 cells/day). Five ring-hydroxylated and one deacylated species of AAF were secreted into the culture media. Extracellular metabolite levels varied during the growth cycle (days 0-13), but their rank quantitative order was time invariant: 5-OH-AAF > 7-OH-AAF > 3-OH-AAF > N-OH-AAF > aminofluorene (AF) > 1-OH-AAF. Lineweaver-Burk analyses revealed two principal classes of metabolism: System I (high-affinity and low-velocity), Km[APPARENT] = 1.64 x 10-7 M and VMAX[APPARENT] = 0.1 nmols/106 cells/day; and, System II (low-affinity and high-velocity), Km[APPARENT] = 3.25 x 10-5 M and VMAX[APPARENT] = 1000 nmols/106 cells/day. A third system of metabolism of AAF to AF, with Km[APPARENT] and VMAX[APPARENT] constants of 9.6 x 10-5 M and 4.7 nmols/106 cells/day, was also observed. Evidence provided in this report and its companion paper suggests selective roles and intracellular locations for System I- and System II-mediated AAF metabolite formation during hepatocarcinogenesis, although some of the molecules and mechanisms responsible for multi-system processing remain to be fully defined.",

    "abstract": "Long-term cultures of primary adult rat hepatocytes were used to study the effects of N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene (AAF) on hepatocyte proliferation during the growth cycle; on the initiation of hepatocyte DNA synthesis in quiescent cultures; and, on hepatocyte DNA replication following the initiation of DNA synthesis. Scatchard analyses were used to identify the pharmacologic properties of radiolabeled AAF metabolite binding to hepatocyte macromolecules. Two classes of growth cycle-dependent AAF metabolite binding sites - a high-affinity low-capacity site (designated Site I) and a low-affinity high-capacity site (designated Site II) - associated with two spatially distinct classes of macromolecular targets, were revealed. Based upon radiolabeled AAF metabolite binding to purified hepatocyte genomic DNA or to DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids from isolated nuclei, Site IDAY 4 targets (KD[APPARENT] {approx} 2-4 x 10-6 M and BMAX[APPARENT] {approx} 6 pmols/106 cells/24 h) were consistent with genomic DNA; and with AAF metabolized by a nuclear cytochrome P450. Based upon radiolabeled AAF binding to total cellular lysates, Site IIDAY 4 targets (KD[APPARENT] {approx} 1.5 x 10-3 M and BMAX[APPARENT] {approx} 350 pmols/106 cells/24 h) were consistent with cytoplasmic proteins; and with AAF metabolized by cytoplasmic cytochrome P450s. DNA synthesis was not inhibited by concentrations of AAF that saturated DNA binding in the neighborhood of the Site I KD. Instead, hepatocyte DNA synthesis inhibition required higher concentrations of AAF approaching the Site II KD. These observations raise the possibility that carcinogenic DNA adducts derived from AAF metabolites form below concentrations of AAF that inhibit replicative and repair DNA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Blue light has been shown to elicit a tumbling response in E. coli, a non-phototrophic bacterium. The exact mechanism of this phototactic response is still unknown, and its biological significance remains unclear. Here, we quantify phototaxis in E. coli by analyzing single-cell trajectories in populations of free-swimming bacteria before and after light exposure. Bacterial strains expressing only one type of chemoreceptor reveal that all five E. coli receptors - Aer, Tar, Tsr, Tap and Trg - are capable of mediating a response to light. In particular, light exposure elicits a running response in Tap-only strain, the opposite of the tumbling response observed for all other strains. Light therefore emerges as a universal stimulus for all E. coli chemoreceptors. We also show that blue light exposure causes a reversible decrease in swimming velocity, a proxy for proton motive force. We hypothesize that rather than sensing light directly, chemoreceptors sense light-induced perturbations in proton motive force.\\n\\nImportanceOur findings provide new insights on the mechanism of E. coli phototaxis, showing that all five chemoreceptor types respond to light and that their interactions play an important role in cell behavior. Our results also open up new avenues for examining and manipulating E. coli taxis. Since light is a universal stimulus, it may provide a way to quantify interactions between different types of receptors. Since light is easier to control spatially and temporally than chemicals, it may be used to study swimming behavior in complex environments. Since phototaxis can cause migration of E. coli bacteria in light gradients, light may be used to control bacterial density for studying density-dependent processes in bacteria.",

Here, we present evidence that uncovering the latent geometry of the hPIN can ease challenging problems in systems biology. We embedded the hPIN to hyperbolic space, whose geometric properties reflect the characteristic scale invariance and strong clustering of the network. Interestingly, the inferred hyperbolic coordinates of nodes capture biologically relevant features, like protein age, function and cellular localisation. We also realised that the shorter the distance between two proteins in the embedding space, the higher their connection probability, which resulted in the prediction of plausible protein interactions. Finally, we observed that proteins can efficiently communicate with each other via a greedy routeing process, guided by the latent geometry of the hPIN. When analysed from the appropriate biological context, these efficient communication channels can be used to determine the core members of signal transduction pathways and to study how system perturbations impact their efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which visual inference is shaped by attentional goals is unclear. Voluntary attention may simply modulate the priority with which information is accessed by higher cognitive functions involved in perceptual decision making. Alternatively, voluntary attention may influence fundamental visual processes, such as those involved in segmenting an incoming retinal signal into a structured scene of coherent objects, thereby determining perceptual organisation. Here we tested whether the segmentation and integration of visual form can be determined by an observers goals by exploiting a novel variant of the classical Kanizsa figure. We generated predictions about the influence of attention with a machine classifier, and tested these predictions with a psychophysical response classification technique. Despite seeing the same image on each trial, observers perception of illusory spatial structure depended on their attentional goals. These attention-contingent illusory contours directly conflicted with equally plausible visual form implied by the geometry of the stimulus, revealing that attentional selection can determine the perceived layout of a fragmented scene. Attentional goals, therefore, not only select pre-computed features or regions of space for prioritised processing, but, under certain conditions, also greatly influence perceptual organisation and thus visual appearance.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe extent to which higher cognitive functions can influence perceptual organisation is debated. The role of voluntary spatial attention, the ability to focus on only some parts of a scene, has been particularly controversial among neuroscientists and psychologists who aim to uncover the basic neural computations involved in grouping image features into coherent objects. To address this issue, we repeatedly presented the same novel ambiguous image to observers and changed their attentional goals by having them make fine spatial judgements about only some elements of the image. We found that observers attentional goals determine the perceived organisation of multiple illusory shapes. We thus reveal that voluntary spatial attention can control the fundamental processes that determine perceptual organisation.",

    "abstract": "Conjoint measurement was used to investigate the joint influences of the luminance of the background and the inner contour on hue- and brightness filling-in for a stimulus configuration generating a water-color effect (WCE), i.e., a wiggly bi-chromatic contour enclosing a region with the lower luminance component on the exterior. Two stimuli with the background and inner contour luminances covarying independently were successively presented, and in separate experiments, the observer judged which member of the pairs interior regions contained a stronger hue or was brighter. Braided-contour control stimuli that generated little or no perceptual filling-in were also used to assess whether observers were judging the interior regions and not the contours themselves. Three nested models of the contributions of the background and inner contour to the judgments were fit to the data by maximum likelihood and evaluated by likelihood ratio tests. Both stimulus components contributed to both the hue and brightness of the interior region with increasing luminance of the inner contour generating an assimilative filling-in for the hue judgments but a contrast effect for the brightness judgments. Control analyses showed negligible effects for the order of the luminance of the background or inner contour on the judgments. An additive contribution of both components was rejected in favor of a saturated model in which the responses depended on the levels of both stimulus components. For the hue judgments, increased background luminance led to greater hue filling-in at higher luminances of the interior contour. For the brightness judgments, the higher background luminance generated less brightness filling-in at higher luminances of the interior contour. The results indicate different effects of the inner contour and background on the induction of the brightness and coloration percepts of the WCE, suggesting that they are mediated by different mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Fleshy fruit evolved independently multiple times during angiosperm history. Many climacteric fruits utilize the hormone ethylene to regulate ripening. The fruitENCODE project shows there are multiple evolutionary origins of the regulatory circuits that govern climacteric fruit ripening. Eudicot climacteric fruits with recent whole-genome duplications (WGDs) evolved their ripening regulatory systems using the duplicated floral identity genes, while others without WGD utilised carpel senescence genes. The monocot banana uses both leaf senescence and duplicated floral-identity genes, forming two interconnected regulatory circuits. H3K27me3 plays a conserved role in restricting the expression of key ripening regulators and their direct orthologs in both the ancestral dry fruit and non-climacteric fleshy fruit species. Our findings suggest that evolution of climacteric ripening was constrained by limited availability of signalling molecules and genetic and epigenetic materials, and WGD provided new resources for plants to circumvent this limit. Understanding these different ripening mechanisms makes it possible to design tailor-made ripening traits to improve quality, yield and minimize postharvest losses.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe fruitENCODE project discovered three evolutionary origins of the regulatory circuits that govern climacteric fruit ripening.",

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy type 1 (Na-1) and 2 (Na-2) are characterized by an inability to sustain wakefulness and are likely caused by degeneration of orexin neurons. Near complete orexin neurodegeneration depletes orexin-A from the cerebrospinal fluid and produces Na-1. The pathophysiology of Na-2 is less understood, but has been hypothesized to be due to less extensive loss of orexin neurotransmission. The orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A mouse allows conditional control over the extent and timing of orexin neurodegeneration. To evaluate partial ablation of the orexin field as a model of Na-2, orexin-A positive cell counts and sleep/wake phenotypes (determined by piezoelectric monitoring) were correlated within individual mice after different protocols of diet-controlled neurodegeneration. Partial ablations that began during the first 8 days of study were 14% larger than partial ablations induced during the last 8 days of study, six weeks later and prior to sacrifice of all mice, suggesting orexin-A positive cell death continued despite the resumption of conditions intended to keep orexin neurons intact. Sleep/wake of mice with 71.0% orexin-A positive cell loss, initiated at the beginning of study, resembled that of orexin-intact controls more than mice with near complete neurodegeneration. Conversely, mice with 56.6% orexin-A positive cell loss, created at the end of study, had sleep/wake phenotypes that were similar to those of mice with near complete orexin-A positive cell loss. Collectively, these results suggest that compensatory wake-promotion develops in mice that have some critical portion of their orexinergic system remaining after partial ablation.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2 is poorly understood but has been hypothesized to be due, at least in part, to degeneration of a smaller proportion of the orexin neuronal field than occurs in narcolepsy type 1. To evaluate a transgenic mouse model of narcolepsy type 2, we correlated the sleep/wake phenotypes of individual, male and female adult mice that received diet-induced conditional ablations of orexin neurons with their orexin cell counts. Using a translatable measure of narcolepsy sleepiness severity, we demonstrated that compensatory wake-promoting responses developed in mice concurrent with progressive orexin neurodegeneration. These results provide important details necessary for preclinical drug discovery for therapeutic areas characterized by orexin insufficiency, such as narcolepsy, Parkinsons disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Rice endosperms form chalkiness in a part of the tissue under heat conditions during the grain-filling stage, although nitrogen supply reduces chalky rice. Air spaces formed in the cells cause an irregular light reflection and create chalkiness, yet what exactly occurs remains unclear at cell level. Through on-site cell-specific analysis, we show that heat-treated cells adjust osmotically and retard protein synthesis to preserve protein storage vacuoles in the cytosol, resulting in air space formation. Application of nitrogen enhances heat tolerance to sustain protein body and amyloplast development during strong osmotic adjustment, which diminishes air spaces to avoid chalkiness. Hence, we conclude that rice endosperm cells could alter organelle compartments spatially during the heat adaptation, depending on the available nitrogen level. Our findings provide new insight into the cellular mechanism of rice chalky formation as a strategy for heat acclimation.",

The rapid growth of protein-protein complexes with known 3D structures offers a unique opportunity to study PPI to gain crucial insights into protein function and the causes of many diseases. In particular, it would be extremely useful to compare interaction surfaces of monomers, as this would enable the pinpointing of potential interaction surfaces based solely on the monomer structure, without the need to predict the complete complex structure. While there are many structural alignment algorithms for individual proteins, very few have been developed for protein interfaces, and none that can align only the interface residues to other interfaces or surfaces of interacting monomer subunits in a topology independent (non-sequential) manner.\\n\\nResultsWe present InterComp, a method for topology and sequence-order independent structural comparisons. The method is general and can be applied to various structural comparison applications. By representing residues as independent points in space rather than as a sequence of residues, InterComp can can be applied to a wide range of problems including: interface-surface comparisons, interface-interface comparisons and even comparisons of small molecule ligands. We demonstrate a use-case by applying InterComp to find similar protein interfaces on the surface of proteins. We show that InterComp pinpoints the correct interface for almost half of the targets (283 of 586) when considering the top 10 hits, and for 24% of the top 1, even when no templates can be found with the already available sequence-order dependent methods like TM-align.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe program is available from: http://wallnerlab.org/InterComp\\n\\nContactbjorn.wallner@liu.se\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data included in the pdf.",

For unclear reasons, vocal learning circuits lie at this second extreme: they repeatedly evolved to be spatially segregated from other parts of the motor system. Here we show that spatially segregated motor circuits can solve a specific problem that arises when an animal tries to learn two things at once. We trained songbirds in vocal and place learning paradigms with brief strobe light flashes and noise bursts. Strobe light negatively reinforced place learning but did not affect song syllable learning. Noise bursts positively reinforced place preference but negatively reinforced syllable learning. These double dissociations indicate that vocalization-related reinforcement signals specifically target the vocal motor system, while place-related reinforcement signals specifically target the navigation system. Non-global, target-specific reinforcement signals have established utility in machine implementation of multi-objective learning. In vocal learners, such signals could enable an animal to practice vocalizing as it does other things such as forage for food or learn to walk.",

Ortholog comparisons of extant sequences show that many mutations do not have profound influence on enzyme function. As the number of potential single natural amino acid substitutions that can be introduced in a protein of N amino acids in length by directed mutation is very large (19 * N), it would be useful to have a method to predict which amino acid substitutions are more likely to introduce significant changes in kinetic parameters in order to design meaningful probes into enzyme function.

    "abstract": "Allosteric transcription factors undergo binding events both at their inducer binding sites as well as at distinct DNA binding domains, and it is often difficult to disentangle the structural and functional consequences of these two classes of interactions. In this work, we compare the ability of two statistical mechanical models - the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) and the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) models of protein conformational change - to characterize the multi-step activation mechanism of the broadly acting cyclic-AMP receptor protein (CRP). We first consider the allosteric transition resulting from cyclic-AMP binding to CRP, then analyze how CRP binds to its operator, and finally investigate the ability of CRP to activate gene expression. In light of these models, we examine data from a beautiful recent experiment that created a single-chain version of the CRP homodimer, thereby enabling each subunit to be mutated separately. Using this construct, six mutants were created using all possible combinations of the wild type subunit, a D53H mutant subunit, and an S62F mutant subunit. We demonstrate that both the MWC and KNF models can explain the behavior of all six mutants using a small, self-consistent set of parameters. In comparing the results, we find that the MWC model slightly outperforms the KNF model in the quality of its fits, but more importantly the parameters inferred by the MWC model are more in line with structural knowledge of CRP. In addition, we discuss how the conceptual framework developed here for CRP enables us to not merely analyze data retrospectively, but has the predictive power to determine how combinations of mutations will interact, how double mutants will behave, and how each construct would regulate gene expression.",

We have performed comparative genome analysis among 40 different species of Mycobacterium whose whole genome sequence is available, in order to identify the distribution of sigma factors. The study illustrate that SigC, SigD, SigG, SigH, SigK and SigI are dominant among the true pathogens. Moreover, 16S rDNA based phylogenetic analyses distinctly differentiate the slow growing Mycobacterium from the fast growers, and clusters the true pathogens from the opportunists and non-pathogens. While evaluating the similarity coefficient upon the allotment of sigma factors of different Mycobacterium species through UPGMA dendrogram analysis, it is apparent that the true pathogens are grouped separately following the similar trend observed from evolutionary approach. Sigma factors playing dominant role in pathogenicity are found stable in nature with high aliphatic index thereby remain flexible at a wide range of temperature. The comparative distribution of six well known virulence factors of Mycobacterium - PhoP, PcaA, FbpA, Mce1B, KatG and PE_PGRS and various sigma factors justify the allotment pattern of mycobacterial sigma factors among pathogenic species. The pathogenicity responsible sigma factors elicit close resemblance with few notable characters of the known virulence factors. Thus the analysis renders that the distribution of sigma factors of different species of Mycobacterium can be a potential tool to predict the pathogenicity index of this genus.",

    "abstract": "In most organ systems, regeneration is a coordinated effort that involves many stem cells, but little is known about whether and how individual stem cells compensate for the functional deficiencies of other stem cells. Functional compensation between stem cells is critically important during disease progression and treatment. Here, we show how individual hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a mouse heterogeneously compensate for the deficiencies of other HSCs during lymphopoiesis by increasing their clonal expansion at specific differentiation stages. This compensation rescues the overall blood supply and influences blood cell types outside of the deficient lineages in distinct patterns. We have identified the molecular regulators and signaling pathways in HSCs that are involved in this process. Our data demonstrate how stem cells interact with each other to constitute a coordinated network that is robust enough to withstand minor functional disruptions. Exploiting the innate compensation capacity of stem cell networks may improve the prognosis and treatment of many diseases.",

Their phylogeny, however, remains poorly understood and to date, only the 18S rRNA nuclear gene and mitogenomes have been used to delineate the major groups of tunicates. To resolve their evolutionary relationships and provide a first estimate of their divergence times, we used a transcriptomic approach to build a phylogenomic dataset including all major tunicate lineages, consisting of 258 evolutionarily conserved orthologous genes from representative species.\\n\\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses using site-heterogeneous CAT mixture models of amino acid sequence evolution resulted in a strongly supported tree topology resolving the relationships among four major tunicate clades: 1) Appendicularia, 2) Thaliacea + Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia, 3) Molgulidae, and 4) Styelidae + Pyuridae. Notably, the morphologically derived Thaliacea are confirmed as the sister-group of the clade uniting Phlebobranchia + Aplousobranchia within which the precise position of the model ascidian genus Ciona remains uncertain. Relaxed molecular clock analyses accommodating the accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates reveal ancient diversification (~450-350 million years ago) among the major groups and allow comparing their evolutionary age with respect to the major vertebrate model lineages.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study represents the most comprehensive phylogenomic dataset for the main tunicate lineages. It offers a reference phylogenetic framework and first tentative timescale for tunicates, allowing the direct comparison with vertebrate model species in comparative genomics and evolutionary developmental biology studies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSuicide death is a highly preventable, yet growing, worldwide health crisis. To date, there has been a lack of adequately powered genomic studies of suicide, with no sizeable suicide death cohorts available for study. To address this limitation, we conducted the first comprehensive genomic analysis of suicide death, using a previously unpublished suicide cohort.\n\nMethodsThe analysis sample consisted of 3,413 population-ascertained cases of European ancestry and 14,810 ancestrally matched controls. Analytical methods included principle components analysis for ancestral matching and adjusting for population stratification, linear mixed model genome-wide association testing (conditional on genetic relatedness matrix), gene and gene set enrichment testing, polygenic score analyses, as well as SNP heritability and genetic correlation estimation using LD score regression.\n\nResultsGWAS identified two genome-wide significant loci (6 SNPs, p<5x10-8). Gene-based analyses implicated 19 genes on chromosomes 13, 15, 16, 17, and 19 (q<0.05). Suicide heritability was estimated h2 =0.2463, SE = 0.0356 using summary statistics from a multivariate logistic GWAS adjusting for ancestry. Notably, suicide polygenic scores were robustly predictive of out of sample suicide death, as were polygenic scores for several other psychiatric disorders and psychological traits, particularly behavioral disinhibition and major depressive disorder.\n\nConclusionsIn this report, we identify multiple genome-wide significant loci/genes, and demonstrate robust polygenic score prediction of suicide death case-control status, adjusting for ancestry, in independent training and test sets. Additionally, we report that suicide death cases have increased genetic risk for behavioral disinhibition, major depression, autism spectrum disorder, psychosis, and alcohol use disorder relative to controls. Results demonstrate the ability of polygenic scores to robustly, and multidimensionally, predict suicide death case-control status.",

The technique can detect and discriminate target DNA easily, rapidly, specifically, and sensitively. This technique detects target DNA in three steps: (1) amplifying target DNA with PCR by using a pair of universal primers (PCR1); (2) treating PCR1 products with a process referred to as CAT, representing Cas9 cutting, A tailing and T adaptor ligation; (3) amplifying the CAT-treated DNA with PCR by using a pair of general-specific primers (gs-primers) (PCR2). The technique was verified by detecting HPV16 and HPV18 L1 gene in 13 different high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes. The technique was also detected two high-risk HPVs (HPV16 and HPV18) in cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa and SiHa) by detecting the L1 and E6/E7 genes, respectively. In this method, PCR1 was performed to determine if the detected DNA sample contained the target DNA (such as virus infection), while PCR2 was performed to discriminate which genotypic target DNA was present in the detected DNA sample (such as virus subtypes). With these proof-of-concept experiments, this study provides a new CRISPR-based DNA detection and typing method.",

    "abstract": "A natural way to benchmark the performance of an analytical experimental setup is to use samples of known content, and see to what degree one can correctly infer the content of such a sample from the data. For shotgun proteomics, one of the inherent problems of interpreting data is that the measured analytes are peptides and not the actual proteins themselves. As some proteins share proteolytic peptides, there might be more than one possible causative set of proteins resulting in a given set of peptides and there is a need for mechanisms that infer proteins from lists of detected peptides. A weakness of commercially available samples of known content is that they consist of proteins that are deliberately selected for producing tryptic peptides that are unique to a single protein. Unfortunately, such samples do not expose any complications in protein inference. For a realistic benchmark of protein inference procedures, there is, therefore, a need for samples of known content where the present proteins share peptides with known absent proteins. Here, we present such a standard, that is based on E. coli expressed human protein fragments. To illustrate the usage of this standard, we benchmark a set of different protein inference procedures on the data. We observe that inference procedures excluding shared peptides provide more accurate estimates of errors compared to methods that include information from shared peptides, while still giving a reasonable performance in terms of the number of identified proteins. We also demonstrate that using a sample of known protein content without proteins with shared tryptic peptides can give a false sense of accuracy for many protein inference methods.",

Since in vivo validation is not possible for the human, we developed a mouse PSC micropattern system and, with direct comparisons to mouse embryos, reveal the robust specification of distinct regional identities. BMP, WNT, ACTIVIN and FGF directed mouse epiblast-like cells to undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and radially pattern posterior mesoderm fates. Conversely, WNT, ACTIVIN and FGF patterned anterior identities, including definitive endoderm. By contrast, epiblast stem cells, a developmentally advanced state, only specified anterior identities, but without patterning.

    "abstract": "The discriminating capacity (i.e., ability to correctly classify presences and absences) of species distribution models (SDMs) is commonly evaluated with metrics such as the Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic Curve, the Kappa statistic and the True Skill Statistic (TSS). AUC and Kappa have been repeatedly criticised, but the TSS has fared relatively well since its introduction, mainly because it has been considered as independent of prevalence. In addition, discrimination metrics have been contested because they should be calculated on presence-absence data, but are often used on presence-only or presence-background data. Here, we investigate the TSS and an alternative set of metrics -similarity indices, also known as F-measures. We first show that even in ideal conditions (i.e., perfectly random presence-absence sampling), TSS can be misleading because of its dependence on prevalence, whereas similarity/F-measures provide adequate estimations of model discrimination capacity. Second, we show that in real-world situations where sample prevalence is different from true species prevalence (i.e., biased sampling or presence-pseudoabsence), no discrimination capacity metric provide adequate estimations of model discrimination capacity, including metrics specifically designed for presence-pseudoabsence. Our conclusions are twofold. First, they unequivocally appeal SDM users to understand the potential shortcomings of discrimination metrics when quality presence-absence data are lacking, and we provide recommendations to obtain such data. Second, in the specific case of virtual species, which are increasingly used to develop and test SDM methodologies, we strongly recommend the use of similarity/F-measures, which were not biased by prevalence, contrary to TSS.",

The behavioral patterns of individual animals affect their respective role in the ecosystem and their prospects for survival. Even though some of the factors shaping individuality have been identified, the mechanisms underlying individuation are poorly understood and are generally considered to be genetics-based. Here we devised a large environment where mice live continuously, and observed that individuality, measured by both social and individual traits, emerged and settled within the group. Midbrain dopamine neurons underwent neurophysiological adaptations that mirrored this phenotypic divergence in individual behaviors. Strikingly, modifying the social environment resulted in a fast re-adaptation of both the animals personality and its dopaminergic signature. These results indicate that individuality can rapidly evolve upon social challenges, and does not just depend on the genetic or epigenetic initial status of the animal.",

LARGE, a protein associated with intellectual disability, was found to be a novel component of the AMPA-R protein complex in our proteomic study. Here, our functional study of LARGE showed that during homeostatic scaling-down, increased LARGE expression at the Golgi apparatus (Golgi) negatively controlled AMPA-R trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, leading to downregulated surface and synaptic AMPA-R targeting. In LARGE knockdown mice, long-term potentiation (LTP) was occluded by synaptic AMPA-R overloading, resulting in impaired long-term memory formation. These findings indicate that the fine-tuning of AMPA-R trafficking by LARGE at the Golgi is critical for memory stability in the brain. Our study thus provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of brain disorders associated with intellectual disability.",

    "abstract": "Tunicata, a diverse clade of approximately 3,000 described species of marine, filter-feeding chordates, is of great interest to researchers because tunicates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates and they facilitate comparative studies of our own biology. The group also includes numerous invasive species that cause considerable economic damage and some species of tunicates are edible. Despite their diversity and importance, relationships among major lineages of Tunicata are not completely resolved. Here, we supplemented public data with transcriptomes from seven species spanning the diversity of Tunicata and conducted phylogenomic analyses on data sets of up to 798 genes. Sensitivity analyses were employed to examine the influences of reducing compositional heterogeneity and branch-length heterogeneity. All analyses maximally supported a monophyletic Tunicata within Olfactores (Vertebrata + Tunicata). Within Tunicata, all analyses recovered Appendicularia sister to the rest of Tunicata and confirmed (with maximal support) that Thaliacea is nested within Ascidiacea. Stolidobranchia is the sister taxon to all other tunicates except Appendicularia. In most analyses, phlebobranch tunicates were recovered paraphyletic with respect to Aplousobranchia. Support for this topology varied but was strong in some cases. However, when only the 50 best genes based on compositional heterogeneity were analysed, we recovered Phlebobranchia and Aplousobranchia reciprocally monophyletic with strong support, consistent with most traditional morphology-based hypotheses. Examination of internode certainty also cast doubt on results of phlebobranch paraphyly, which may be due to limited taxon sampling. Taken together, these results provide a higher-level phylogenetic framework for our closest living invertebrate relatives.",

Here we reexamine the protein sequence conservation at the N-terminus using PSI-BLAST analysis and report our discovery of a cysteine rich motif (CxCXXC) conserved in nematodes and vertebrates. This motif is found in a solvent exposed linker region connecting two TPR-like helical motifs. Mutation of this motif in Caenorhabditis elegans separase leads to a temperature sensitive hypomorphic protein, and several N-terminal residues identified as intragenic suppressors are not conserved. Conservation of this motif in multiple organisms raises the possibility that the motif plays similar roles across species.",

These limits necessitate trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial resolution, light exposure, and imaging depth. In this work we show how image restoration based on deep learning extends the range of biological phenomena observable by microscopy. On seven concrete examples we demonstrate how microscopy images can be restored even if 60-fold fewer photons are used during acquisition, how near isotropic resolution can be achieved with up to 10-fold under-sampling along the axial direction, and how tubular and granular structures smaller than the diffraction limit can be resolved at 20-times higher frame-rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Biomedical researchers are generating high-throughput, high-dimensional single-cell data at a staggering rate. As costs of data generation decrease, experimental design is moving towards measurement of many different single-cell samples in the same dataset. These samples can correspond to different patients, conditions, or treatments. While scalability of methods to datasets of these sizes is a challenge on its own, dealing with large-scale experimental design presents a whole new set of problems, including batch effects and sample comparison issues. Currently, there are no computational tools that can both handle large amounts of data in a scalable manner (many cells) and at the same time deal with many samples (many patients or conditions). Moreover, data analysis currently involves the use of different tools that each operate on their own data representation, not guaranteeing a synchronized analysis pipeline. For instance, data visualization methods can be disjoint and mismatched with the clustering method. For this purpose, we present SAUCIE, a deep neural network that leverages the high degree of parallelization and scalability offered by neural networks, as well as the deep representation of data that can be learned by them to perform many single-cell data analysis tasks, all on a unified representation.\\n\\nA well-known limitation of neural networks is their interpretability. Our key contribution here are newly formulated regularizations (penalties) that render features learned in hidden layers of the neural network interpretable. When large multi-patient datasets are fed into SAUCIE, the various hidden layers contain denoised and batch-corrected data, a low dimensional visualization, unsupervised clustering, as well as other information that can be used to explore the data. We show this capability by analyzing a newly generated 180-sample dataset consisting of T cells from dengue patients in India, measured with mass cytometry. We show that SAUCIE, for the first time, can batch correct and process this 11-million cell data to identify cluster-based signatures of acute dengue infection and create a patient manifold, stratifying immune response to dengue on the basis of single-cell measurements.",

    "abstract": "Modern mass spectrometry now permits genome-scale and quantitative measurements of biological proteomes. However, analyses of specific specimens are currently hindered by the incomplete representation of biological variability of protein sequences in canonical reference proteomes, and the technical demands for their construction. Here, we report ProteomeGenerator, a framework for de novo and reference-assisted proteogenomic database construction and analysis based on sample-specific transcriptome sequencing and high-resolution and high-accuracy mass spectrometry proteomics. This enables assembly of proteomes encoded by actively transcribed genes, including sample-specific protein isoforms resulting from non-canonical mRNA transcription, splicing, or editing. To improve the accuracy of protein isoform identification in non-canonical proteomes, ProteomeGenerator relies on statistical target-decoy database matching augmented with spectral-match calibrated sample-specific controls. We applied this method for the proteogenomic discovery of splicing factor SRSF2-mutant leukemia cells, demonstrating high-confidence identification of non-canonical protein isoforms arising from alternative transcriptional start sites, intron retention, and cryptic exon splicing, as well as improved accuracy of genome-scale proteome discovery. Additionally, we report proteogenomic performance metrics for the current state-of-the-art implementations of SEQUEST HT, Proteome Discoverer, MaxQuant, Byonic, and PEAKS mass spectral analysis algorithms. Finally, ProteomeGenerator is implemented as a Snakemake workflow, enabling open, scalable, and facile discovery of sample-specific, non-canonical and neomorphic biological proteomes (https://github.com/jtpoirier/proteomegenerator).",

We show that 27% of the tumors can be assigned to statistically supported modules, most of which encompass 1-2 cancer types. The rest of the tumors belong to a diffuse network component suggesting lower gene-specificity of driver mutations. Linear regression of the mutational loads in cancer-associated genes was used to estimate the number of drivers required for the onset of different cancers. The mean number of drivers is ~2, with a range of 1 to 5. Cancers that are associated to modules had more drivers than those from the diffuse network component, suggesting that unidentified and/or interchangeable drivers exist in the latter.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive catalogue of the mutations that drive tumorigenesis and progression is essential to understanding tumor biology and developing therapies. Protein-coding driver mutations have been well-characterized by large exome-sequencing studies, however many tumors have no mutations in protein-coding driver genes. Non-coding mutations are thought to explain many of these cases, however few non-coding drivers besides TERT promoter are known. To fill this gap, we analyzed 150,000 cis-regulatory regions in 1,844 whole cancer genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. Using our new method, ActiveDriverWGS, we found 41 frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) enriched in non-coding SNVs and indels (FDR<0.05) characterized by aging-associated mutation signatures and frequent structural variants. Most FMREs are distal from genes, reported here for the first time and also recovered by additional driver discovery methods. FMREs were enriched in super-enhancers, H3K27ac enhancer marks of primary tumors and long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that the mutations drive cancer by distally controlling gene expression through threedimensional genome organization. In support of this hypothesis, the chromatin interaction network of FMREs and target genes revealed associations of mutations and differential gene expression of known and novel cancer genes (e.g., CNNB1IP1, RCC1), activation of immune response pathways and altered enhancer marks. Thus distal genomic regions may include additional, infrequently mutated drivers that act on target genes via chromatin loops. Our study is an important step towards finding such regulatory regions and deciphering the somatic mutation landscape of the non-coding genome.",

The roles of AURKA outside of mitosis, and how these might contribute to cancer progression, are not well understood. Here we show that a fraction of cytoplasmic AURKA is associated with mitochondria, co-fractionating in cell extracts and interacting with mitochondrial proteins by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. We have also found that the dynamics of the mitochondrial network are sensitive to AURKA inhibition, depletion or overexpression. This can account for the different mitochondrial morphologies observed in RPE1 and U2OS cell lines, which show very different levels of expression of AURKA. We identify the mitochondrial fraction of AURKA as influencing mitochondrial morphology, since an N-terminally truncated version of the kinase that does not localize to mitochondria does not affect the mitochondrial network. We identify a cryptic mitochondrial targeting sequence in the AURKA N-terminus and discuss how alternative conformations of the protein may influence its cytoplasmic fate.",

A diverse set of multiprotein complexes was assembled on DNA origami nanostructures using streptavidin and the sensitive glucose sensor protein FLIP as model systems. We demonstrate that our approach allows for the direct cytosolic delivery of these multifunctional protein complexes into the cytosol of HeLa cells. We also demonstrate that targeting groups can be incorporated into the protein-DNA nanoassemblies to enable their intracellular targeting to cytosolic compartments, such as the cytoskeleton or nucleus. We believe that this methodology will open up novel strategies for research in fundamental cell biology, such as the reverseengineering of the supramolecular machinery involved in gene regulation, cell signalling, or cell division.

Pooled RNA from 16 laboratory conditions was used for differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) to identify 3731 transcriptional start sites (TSS) and 110 small RNAs, including the first identification in A. baumannii of sRNAs encoded at the 3 end of coding genes. Most sRNAs were conserved among sequenced A. baumannii genomes, but were only weakly conserved or absent in other Acinetobacter species. Single nucleotide mapping of TSS enabled prediction of -10 and -35 RNA polymerase binding sites and revealed an unprecedented base preference at position +2 that hints at an unrecognized transcriptional regulatory mechanism. To apply functional genomics to the problem of antimicrobial resistance, we dissected the transcriptional regulation of the drug efflux pump responsible for chloramphenicol resistance, craA. The two craA promoters were both down-regulated >1000-fold when cells were shifted to nutrient limited medium. This conditional down-regulation of craA expression renders cells sensitive to chloramphenicol, a highly effective antibiotic for the treatment of multidrug resistant infections.

We document the development of non-proliferating intracellular amastigotes in vivo and in vitro in the absence of drug treatment. Non-proliferative amastigotes ultimately converted to trypomastigotes and established infections in new host cells. Most significantly, dormant amastigotes were uniquely resistant to extended drug treatment in vivo and in vitro and could re-establish a flourishing infection after as many as 30 days of drug exposure.

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens evolve during the course of infection as they adapt to the selective pressures that confront them inside the host. Identification of adaptive mutations and their contributions to pathogen fitness remain a central challenge. Although mutations can either target intergenic or coding regions in the pathogen genome, studies of host adaptation have focused predominantly on molecular evolution within coding regions whereas the role of intergenic mutations remains unclear. Here, we address this issue and investigate the extent to which intergenic mutations contribute to the evolutionary response of pathogens to host environments, and if intergenic mutations have distinct roles in host adaptation. We characterize intergenic evolution in 44 lineages of a clinically important bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as they adapt to their hosts. We identify 88 intergenic regions in which parallel evolution occur. At the genetic level, we find that mutations in these regions under selection are located primarily within regulatory elements upstream of transcriptional start sites. At the functional level, we show that these mutations both create or destroy regulatory interactions in connection to transcriptional processes, and are directly responsible for evolution of important pathogenic phenotypes including antibiotic sensitivity. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations are more likely to be selected than coding region mutations, and that intergenic mutations enable essential genes to become targets of evolution. In summary, our results highlight the evolutionary significance of intergenic mutations in creating host-adapted variants, and that intergenic and coding regions have different qualitative and quantitative contributions to this process.\\n\\nSignificancePathogens adapt to their host during infection, but the contribution and function of non-coding intergenic sequences to adaptation is poorly understood. Here, genome-wide identification of adaptive mutations within intergenic regions demonstrates that these sequences constitute an important part of the genetic basis for host adaptation. We find that intergenic mutations are abundant relative to adaptive mutations within coding sequences, and can contribute directly to evolution of pathogen relevant traits. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations modify expression of essential genes and thus make contributions that are functionally distinct from coding mutations. These results improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes in vivo, and can potentially assist in refining predictions of pathogen evolution, disease outcome, and antibiotic resistance development.",

    "abstract": "mRNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) by association with proteins that are crucial for mRNA metabolism. While the mRNP proteome has been well characterized, little is known about mRNP organization. Using a single molecule approach, we show that mRNA conformation changes depending on its cellular localization and translational state. Compared to nuclear mRNPs and lncRNPs, association with ribosomes decompacts individual mRNAs, while their sequestration into stress-granules leads to increased compaction. Moreover, translating mRNAs rarely show co-localizing 5 and 3 ends, indicating that mRNAs are either not translated in a closed-loop configuration, or that mRNA circularization is transient, suggesting that a stable closed-loop conformation is not a universal state for all translating mRNAs.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySingle mRNA studies in cells show RNA compaction changes depending on translational state, but mRNAs are not translated in closed-loop conformation.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of about 19-25 nt that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally under various cellular conditions, including apoptosis. The miRNAs involved in modulation of apoptotic events in T cells are partially known. However, heterogeneity associated with cell lines makes it difficult to interpret gene expression signatures especially in cancer-related cell lines. Treatment of Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line with the universal apoptotic drug, camptothecin, resulted in identification of two Jurkat sub-populations: one that is sensitive to camptothecin and the other being rather intrinsically resistant. We sorted apoptotic Jurkat cells from the non-apoptotic ones prior to profiling miRNAs through deep sequencing. Our data showed that a total of 184 miRNAs were dysregulated. Interestingly, apoptotic and non-apoptotic sub-populations exhibited a distinct miRNA expression profile. In particular, 6 miRNAs were inversely expressed in these two sub-populations. The pyrosequencing results were validated by real time qPCR. Altogether these results suggest that miRNAs modulate apoptotic events in T cells and that cellular heterogeneity requires careful interpretation of miRNA expression profiles obtained from drug-treated cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Gene knockout technologies have contributed fundamentally to our understanding of the cellular functions of various genes. Two prevalent systems used for the efficient elimination of the expression of specific genes are the Cre-LoxP system and the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Here we present a simple method that combines the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and Cre-loxP for the conditional deletion of essential genes in mammalian cells. First, an inducible Cre recombinase is stably expressed in the cells. Next CRISPR-Cas9 is used to knockout an essential gene, whose function is complemented by stable expression of a FLAG-tagged version of the same protein encoded from a floxed transcription unit containing silent mutations, making it refractory to the CRISPR-Cas9 guide. This FLAG-tagged protein can be deleted by activating the expressed Cre protein enabling evaluation of the cellular consequences of its deletion. We have further used this system to evaluate potential mutants of the tested gene.",

    "abstract": "Macromolecular crystallography (MX) is now a mature and widely used technique essential in the understanding of biology and medicine. Increases in computing power combined with robotics have enabled not only large numbers of samples to be screened and characterised but also for better decisions to be taken on data collection itself. This led to the development of MASSIF-1 at the ESRF, the worlds first beamline to run fully automatically while making intelligent decisions taking user requirements into account. Since opening in late 2014 the beamline has now processed over 39,000 samples. Improvements have been made to the speed of the sample handling robotics and error management within the software routines. The workflows initially put in place, while highly innovative at the time, have been expanded to include increased complexity and additional intelligence using the information gathered during characterisation, this includes adapting the beam diameter dynamically to match the diffraction volume within the crystal. Complex multi-position and multi-crystal data collections are now also integrated into the selection of experiments available. This has led to increased data quality and throughput allowing even the most challenging samples to be treated automatically.\\n\\nSynopsis\\n\\nSignificant improvements in the sample location, characterisation and data collection algorithms on the autonomous ESRF beamline MASSIF-1 are described.

    "abstract": "Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.",

    "abstract": "Developmental programs continuously sculpt plant morphology to meet environmental challenges, and these same programs have been manipulated to increase agricultural productivity1,2. Small molecule phytohormones act as signals within these programs creating chemical circuitry3 that, in many cases, has been represented in mathematical models4,5. To date, model validation and forward engineering of plant morphology has been largely restricted to adding or subtracting genes, as more nuanced tools to modulate key control parameters identified by such models in vivo are severely limited6,7. Here, we use Arabidopsis thaliana to validate a novel set of synthetic and modular hormone activated Cas9-based repressors (HACRs) that respond to three phytohormones: auxin, gibberellins and jasmonates. We demonstrate that HACRs can regulate genes in response to both exogenous hormone treatments, as well as in response to local differences in endogenous hormone levels associated with developmental events. We further show that HACRs can be used to reprogram the agriculturally relevant traits of shoot branching and phyllotaxy by tuning canalization strength, a critical control parameter predicted by mathematical models. By deploying a HACR to re-parameterize the threshold for induction of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1), we observed a decrease in shoot branching and phyllotactic noise as predicted by existing models4,5. The approach described here provides a framework for improved mapping of developmental circuitry, as well as a means to better leverage model predictions to engineer development.",
