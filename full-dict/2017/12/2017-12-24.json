    "abstract": "The hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and episodic memory. Mechanistic models predict that hippocampal subfields have computational specializations that differentially support memory. However, there is little empirical evidence suggesting differences between the subfields, particularly in humans. To clarify how hippocampal subfields support human spatial and episodic memory, we developed a virtual reality paradigm where participants passively navigated through houses (spatial contexts) across a series of videos (episodic contexts). We then used multivariate analyses of high-resolution fMRI data to identify neural representations of contextual information during recollection. Multi-voxel pattern similarity analyses revealed that CA1 represented objects that shared an episodic context as more similar than those from different episodic contexts. CA23DG showed the opposite pattern, differentiating between objects encountered in the same episodic context. The complementary characteristics of these subfields explain how we can parse our experiences into cohesive episodes while retaining the specific details that support vivid recollection.",

    "abstract": "Determining whether convergent novelties share a common genetic basis is vital to understanding the extent to which evolution is predictable. The convergent evolution of innovative anal fin pigmentation patterns in cichlid fishes is an ideal model for studying this question. Here, we focused on two patterns: 1) egg-spots, circular pigmentation patterns with different numbers, sizes and positions; and 2) the blotch, irregular pattern with no variation among species. How these two novelties originate and evolve remains unclear. Based on a thorough comparative transcriptomic and genomic analysis, we observed a common genetic basis with high evolutionary rates and similar expression levels between egg-spots and the blotch. Furthermore, associations of common genes with transcription factors and signalling pathways in the core gene network, as well as the integration of advantageous genes were observed for egg-spots. We propose that the re-use of the common genetic basis indicates important conservative functions (e.g., toolkit genes) for the origin of these convergent novel phenotypes, whereas independently evolved associations of common genes with transcription factors and signalling pathways (intrinsic factor) can free the evolution of egg-spots, and together with the integration of advantageous genes (extrinsic factor) can provide a clue to link egg-spots as a key innovation to the adaptive radiation in cichlid fishes. This hypothesis will further illuminate the mechanism of the origin and evolution of novelties in a broad sense.",

    "abstract": "Of late, there has been a growing interest in studying brain networks, particularly, for understanding spontaneous temporal changes in functional brain networks. Recently, phase synchrony based methods have been proposed to track instantaneous time-resolved functional connectivity without any need of windowing the data. This paper extends one such recently used phase synchrony measure in two steps. First, multiple temporal models are built from four-mode tensor that are further clustered to detect dynamic brain network communities. This clustering is based on spatio-temporal data and hence, is named as Spatio-Temporal Clustering (STC). Second, a method is proposed to rank all the communities allowing the proposed model to deal with multiple communities of differing time evolution. This helps in the comparison of network communities, especially, when available communities are too dense to provide relevant information for comparison. The ranking of communities allows for the dimensionality reduction of communities, while still maintaining the key brain networks. Intrinsic time-varying functional connectivity has been investigated for large scale brain networks, including default-mode network (DMN), visual network (VN), cognitive control network (CCN), auditory network (AN), etc. The proposed method provides a new complementary tool to investigate dynamic network states at a high temporal resolution and is tested on resting-state functional MRI data of 26 typically developing controls (TDC) and 35 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects. Simulation results demonstrate that ASD subjects have altered dynamic brain networks compared to TDC.",

    "abstract": "The balance of fresh and saline water is essential to estuarine ecosystem function. Along the fresh-brackish-saline water gradient within the C-43 canal/Caloosahatchee River estuary (CRE) the quantity, timing and distribution of water and associated water quality significantly influences ecosystem function. Long-term trends of water quality and quantity were assessed from Lake Okeechobee to the CRE between May 1978 to April 2016. Significant changes to monthly flow volumes were detected between the lake and the estuary which correspond to changes in upstream management. and climatic events. Across the 37-year period total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean (FWM) concentration significantly increased at the lake, meanwhile total nitrogen (TN) FMW concentrations significantly declined at both the lake and estuary headwaters. Between May 1999 and April 2016, TN, TP and total organic carbon (TOC), ortho-P and ammonium conditions were assessed within the estuary at several monitoring locations. Generally nutrient concentrations decreased from upstream to downstream with shifts in TN:TP from values >20 in the freshwater portion, ~20 in the estuarine portion and <20 in the marine portion indicating a spatial shift in nutrient limitations along the continuum. Aquatic productivity analysis suggests that the estuary is net heterotrophic with productivity being negatively influenced by TP, TN and TOC likely due to a combination of effects including shading by high color dissolved organic matter. We conclude that rainfall patterns, land use and the resulting discharges of run-off drives the ecology of the C-43/CRE aquatic continuum and associated biogeochemistry rather than water management associated with Lake Okeechobee.",

    "abstract": "Exome capture is an effective tool for surveying the genome for loci under selection. However, traditional methods require annotated genomic resources. Here, we present a method for creating cDNA probes from expressed mRNA, which are then used to enrich and capture genomic DNA for exon regions. This approach, called \\\"EecSeq\\\", eliminates the need for costly probe design and synthesis. We tested EecSeq in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, using a controlled exposure experiment. Four adult oysters were heat shocked at 36{degrees} C for 1 hour along with four control oysters kept at 14{degrees} C. Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared for two individuals from each treatment and pooled. Half of the combined library was used for probe synthesis and half was sequenced to evaluate capture efficiency. Genomic DNA was extracted from all individuals, enriched via captured probes, and sequenced directly. We found that EecSeq had an average capture sensitivity of 86.8% across all known exons and had over 99.4% sensitivity for exons with detectable levels of expression in the mRNA library. For all mapped reads, over 47.9% mapped to exons and 37.0% mapped to expressed targets, which is similar to previously published exon capture studies. EecSeq displayed relatively even coverage within exons (i.e. minor \\\"edge effects\\\") and even coverage across exon GC content. We discovered 5,951 SNPs with a minimum average coverage of 80X, with 3,508 SNPs appearing in exonic regions. We show that EecSeq provides comparable, if not superior, specificity and capture efficiency compared to costly, traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Task learning relies on brain executive function (EF), the construct of controlling and coordinating behavior under the everlasting flow of environmental changes. We have previously shown, that a complete knockout of a vertebrate brain-specific pair of gene paralogs (Ntng1/2) distorts the mouse EF, making behavior less predictable (more variable) via the affected working memory and attention (1). In the current study, conditionally targeting either serotonin transporter (5-HTT) or Emx1-expressing neurons, we show that the cell type-specific ablation of Ntng1 within the excitatory circuits of either cortex or thalamus does not have a profound impact on the EF but rather affects its certain modalities, i.e. impulsivity and/or selective attention, modulated by cognitive demand. Several mice of both conditional genotypes simultaneously occupy either top or bottom parameter-specific behavioral ranks, indicative of a subject-unique antagonistic either proficit or deficit of function within the same behavior. Employing genotype-attributable behavior variability as a phenotypic trait, we deduce, that Ntng1-parsed excitatory pathways contribute but do not fully reconstitute the attention-impulsivity phenotypes, associated with the mouse EF deficit. However, complete knockdown of Ntng1/2, and associated with it behavior variability, explains the deficit of executive function and task learning.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effect of targeted kinase inhibitors can be significantly reduced by intrinsic or acquired resistance mutations that modulate the affinity of the drug for the kinase. In cancer, the majority of missense mutations are rare, making it difficult to predict their impact on inhibitor affinity. This complicates the practice of precision medicine, pairing of patients with clinical trials, and development of next-generation inhibitors. Here, we examine the potential for alchemical free-energy calculations to predict how kinase mutations modulate inhibitor affinities to Abl, a major target in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We find these calculations can achieve useful accuracy in predicting resistance for a set of eight FDA-approved kinase inhibitors across 144 clinically-identified point mutations, achieving a root mean square error in binding free energy changes of [Formula] kcal/mol (95% confidence interval) and correctly classifying mutations as resistant or susceptible with [Formula] accuracy. Since these calculations are fast on modern GPUs, this benchmark establishes the potential for physical modeling to collaboratively support the rapid assessment and anticipation of the potential for patient mutations to affect drug potency in clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Human high-level visual cortex shows a distinction between animate and inanimate objects, as revealed by fMRI. Recent studies have shown that object animacy can similarly be decoded from MEG sensor patterns. Which object properties drive this decoding? Here, we disentangled the influence of perceptual and categorical object properties by presenting perceptually matched objects (e.g., snake and rope) that were nonetheless easily recognizable as being animate or inanimate. In a series of behavioral experiments, three aspects of perceptual dissimilarity of these objects were quantified: overall dissimilarity, outline dissimilarity, and texture dissimilarity. Neural dissimilarity of MEG sensor patterns was modeled using regression analysis, in which perceptual dissimilarity (from the behavioral experiments) and categorical dissimilarity served as predictors of neural dissimilarity. We found that perceptual dissimilarity was strongly reflected in MEG sensor patterns from 80ms after stimulus onset, with separable contributions of outline and texture dissimilarity. Surprisingly, when controlling for perceptual dissimilarity, MEG patterns did not carry information about object category (animate vs inanimate) at any time point. Nearly identical results were found in a second MEG experiment that required basic-level object recognition. These results suggest that MEG sensor patterns do not capture object animacy independently of perceptual differences between animate and inanimate objects. This is in contrast to results observed in fMRI using the same stimuli, task, and analysis approach: fMRI showed a highly reliable categorical distinction in visual cortex even when controlling for perceptual dissimilarity. Results thus point to a discrepancy in the information contained in multivariate fMRI and MEG patterns.",

The correlation of these tests with laboratory investigations based on biochemical parameters could increase the certainty of the diagnosis. In recent years, several biochemical markers for the diagnosis of AD have been proposed, but in most cases they show a limited specificity and their application is invasive, because it generally requires the sampling of cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, the use of a peripheral biochemical marker could represent a valuable complement for the diagnosis of this disease.\\n\\nSeveral studies have shown a relationship between the neurodegenerative disorders typical of the ageing process, the weakening of the immune system, alterations in the levels of selenium and of the antioxidant selenoenzymes in brain tissues and blood cells, particularly in neutrophil granulocytes.

We accounted for such aberrations by aligning our system and measuring distortions in the images, and found that speckle reduction by angular compounding was limited. Our theoretical analysis using Monte Carlo simulations indicates that \\\"pure\\\" angular compounding over 13{degrees} (our full numerical aperture) can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by no more than a factor of 1.5, significantly lower than values reported in literature. Analysis suggests that illuminating only part of the lens to further reduce speckle also involves a trade-off with resolution roughly equivalent to spatial averaging. We conclude that angular compounding provides substantially less benefit than previously expected.",

Here we propose DeepMHC, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based protein-peptide binding prediction algorithm for achieving better performance in MHC-I peptide binding affinity prediction than conventional algorithms. Our model takes only raw binding peptide sequences as input without needing any human-designed features and othe physichochemical or evolutionary information of the amino acids. Our CNN models are shown to be able to learn non-linear relationships among the amino acid positions of the peptides to achieve highly competitive performance on most of the IEDB benchmark datasets with a single model architecture and without using any consensus or composite ensemble classifier models.

In its extreme form, found in ascidians, early embryonic cell lineages are invariant between embryos within and between species, despite rapid genomic divergence. To resolve this paradox, we used live light-sheet imaging to quantify individual cell behaviors in digitalized embryos and explore the forces that canalize their development. This quantitative approach revealed that individual cell geometries and cell contacts are strongly constrained, and that these constraints are tightly linked to the control of fate specification by local cell inductions. While in vertebrates ligand concentration usually controls cell inductions, we found that this role is fulfilled in ascidians by the area of contacts between signaling and responding cells. We propose that the duality between geometric and genetic control of inductions contributes to the counterintuitive inverse correlation between geometric and genetic variability during embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "A major goal of invasion biology is to understand under what conditions exotic species thrive in the introduced range. High competitive abilities are thought to be an important characteristic of exotic species. Most invasion studies focus on the competitive ability of exotic species in the introduced range and attribute their ecological success to competitive release, but fewer studies have compared the relative competitive differences within the native range. These comparative studies are important in order to determine if competitive abilities of exotic species are strong predictors of invasion success. The little fire ant Wasmmnia auropunctata is a highly invasive species that has spread from its original range (Central and South America) to becoming a globally distributed exotic species in recent decades. It is generally accepted that island ecosystems offer weak biotic resistance to exotic species as compared to their native range. Here, we examined this empirically by comparing the relative competitive difference of W. auropunctata and locally dominant ants, between its native range of Mexico and introduced range of Puerto Rico. Resource competition was assessed between W. auropunctata and native ants under field conditions and in the laboratory. Furthermore, we compared resource competition at different temporal intervals ranging from short-term (< 2 hours) to long-term (14-days) dynamics. Our results are in contrast to common invasion predictions on island communities because we show that native species were resistant to W. auropunctata in its introduced range of Puerto Rico. We observed that the ground-foraging ant Solenopsis invicta competitive displaced W. auropunctata in Puerto Rico during short-term experiments. Meanwhile, the native arboreal ant Linepithema iniquum withstood competitive pressure from W. auropunctata. In the native range of Mexico, W. auropunctata was superior against Solenopsis Picea and Pheidole protensa species, but was outcompeted by dominant ants Solenopsis geminata and Pheidole synanthropica. This study challenges the relative importance of competitive ability in predicting invasion success. This is one of the few detailed comparative studies that examines exotic species performance between native and introduced habitats.",

    "abstract": "In species with sexual reproduction, the mating pattern is a meaningful element for understanding evolutionary and speciation processes. Given a mating pool where individuals can encounter each other randomly, the individual mating preferences would define the mating frequencies in the population. However, in every mating process we can distinguish two different steps. First, the encounter between partners. Second, the actual mating once the encounter has occurred. Yet, we cannot always assume that the observed population patterns accurately reflect the individuals preferences. In some scenarios the individuals may have difficulties to achieve their preferred matings, such as in monogamous species with low population size, where the mating process is similar to a sampling without replacement. In the latter, the encounter process will introduce some noise that may disconnect the individual preferences from the obtained mating pattern. Actually, the difference between the mating pattern observed in a population and the mating preferences of the individuals have been shown by different modeling scenarios.\\n\\nHere I present a program that simulates the mating process for both discrete and continuous traits, under different encounter models and individual preferences, including effects as time dependence and aging. The utility of the software is demonstrated by replicating and extending, a recent study that showed how patterns of positive assortative mating, or marriage in human societies, may arise from non-assortative individual preferences. The previous result is confirmed and is shown to be caused by the marriage among the \\\"ugliest\\\" and oldest individuals, who after many attempts were finally able to mate among themselves. In fact, I show that the assortative pattern vanishes if an aging process prevents these individuals from mating altogether.

    "abstract": "Natural selection plays a variety of roles in hybridization, speciation and admixture. Most research has focused on two extreme cases: crosses between closely-related inbred lines, where hybrids are fitter than their parents, or crosses between effectively isolated species, where hybrids suffer severe breakdown. Many natural populations must fall into intermediate regimes, with multiple types of gene interaction, but these are more difficult to study. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model, and show that it naturally interpolates between previous modeling approaches, involving mildly deleterious recessives, or discrete hybrid incompatibilities. The model yields several new predictions, which we test with genomic data from Mytilus mussels, and published data from plants (Zea, Populus and Senecio) and animals (Mus, Teleogryllus and Drosophila). The predictions are generally supported, and the model explains surprising empirical patterns that have been observed in both extreme regimes. Our approach enables novel and complementary uses of genome-wide datasets, which do not depend on identifying outlier loci, or \\\"speciation genes\\\" with anomalous effects. Given its simplicity and flexibility, and its predictive successes with a wide range of data, the approach should be readily extendable to other outstanding questions in the study of hybridization.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict how multiple traits interact in determining performance is key to understanding the evolution of complex functional systems. Similar to Simpsons adaptive landscape, which describes the fitness consequences of varying morphological traits, performance landscapes depict the performance consequences of varying morphological traits. Mapping the populations location with respect to the topographic features of the landscape could inform us on the selective forces operating on the traits that underlie performance. Here, we used a mechanistic model derived from first principles of hydrodynamics to construct a hypothetical performance landscape for zooplankton prey capture using suction feeding. We then used the landscape to test whether a population of Chromis viridis, a coral reef zooplanktivore, is located on a performance peak or ridge based on measurements of kinematic variables recorded in-situ during undisturbed foraging. Observed trait combinations in the wild population closely matched regions of high feeding performance in the landscape, however the population was not located on a local performance peak. This sub-optimal performance was not due to constraints stemming from the observed trait correlations. The predominant directions of variation of the phenotypic traits was tangent to the  path of steepest ascent that points towards the local peak, indicating that the population does not reside on a \\\"performance ridge\\\". Rather, our analysis suggests that feeding performance is constrained by stabilizing selection, possibly reflecting a balance between selection on feeding performance and mechanical or genetic constraints.",

Here, we present SAKE (Single-cell RNA-Seq Analysis and Klustering Evaluation): a robust method for scRNA-Seq analysis that provides quantitative statistical metrics at each step of the scRNA-Seq analysis pipeline including metrics for: the determination of the number of clusters present, the likelihood that each cell belongs to a given cluster, and the association of each gene marker in determining cluster membership. Comparing SAKE to multiple single-cell analysis methods shows that most methods perform similarly across a wide range cellular contexts, with SAKE outperforming these methods in the case of large complex populations. We next applied the SAKE algorithms to identify drug-resistant cellular populations as human melanoma cells respond to targeted BRAF inhibitors. Single-cell RNA-Seq data from both the Fluidigm C1 and 10x Genomics platforms were analyzed with SAKE to dissect this problem at multiple scales. Data from both platforms indicate that BRAF inhibitor resistant cells can emerge from rare populations already present before drug application, with SAKE identifying both novel and known markers of resistance.

    "abstract": "Axonal structure underlies white matter functionality and plays a major role in brain connectivity. The current literature on the axonal structure is based on the analysis of two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections, which, as we demonstrate, is precarious. To be able to quantify three-dimensional (3D) axonal morphology, we developed a novel pipeline for automated 3D segmentation and morphometric analysis (ACSON) of the white matter ultrastructure. The automated pipeline eliminates the need for time-consuming manual segmentation of 3D datasets. ACSON segments myelin, myelinated and unmyelinated axons, mitochondria, cells and vacuoles, and analyzes the morphology of axons. We applied the pipeline to serial block-face scanning electron microscopy images of the corpus callosum of sham-operated (n = 2) and brain injured (n = 3) rats 5 months after the injury. The 3D morphometry showed that axonal cross-sections were elliptic rather than spherical, and their diameter varied substantially along axons. It also showed a significant reduction in the axonal diameter of the ipsilateral corpus callosum of rats 5 months after brain injury, indicating ongoing axonal alterations even at this chronic time-point.",

    "abstract": "Transplanting stem cells into the central nervous system is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, preclinical trials of cell-based therapies are limited by poor local cell engraftment and survival. Here, we present a polylactic acid (PLA) scaffold to support delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a mouse model of stroke. We isolated bone marrow MSCs from adult C57/Bl6 mice, cultured them on PLA polymeric rough microfibrous (PLA-PRM) scaffolds obtained by rotary jet spinning, and transplanted into the brains of adult C57/Bl6 mice, carrying thermocoagulation-induced cortical stroke. Interleukins (IL4, IL6 and IL10) and tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF) expression levels in the brain of mice that received PRM were similar to untreated. MSCs transplantation significantly reduced the area of the lesion and PRM delivery increased MSCs retention at the injury site. We conclude that PLA-PRM scaffolds offer a promising new system to deliver stem cells to injured areas of the brain.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\\n\\nSynthetic scaffolds offer an alternative to optimize stem cell transplantation at sites of brain injury.

    "abstract": "A subset of plant nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) proteins carry extraneous integrated domains that have been proposed to mediate pathogen effector recognition. The current view is that these unconventional domains function by directly binding or serving as substrates for pathogen effectors, yet only a few domains have been functionally characterized to date. Here we report that the integrated NOI domain of the rice NLR protein Pii-2, together with its partner Pii-1, mediates immunity to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae by indirect recognition of the AVR-Pii effector. We discovered that the Pii-2 NOI domain does not physically interact with the effector itself but instead binds the host protein OsExo70-F3, which is a target of AVR-Pii. We further identified mutations within the NOI core motif (PxFGxW) of Pii-2 that abolish both OsExo70-F3 binding and Pii-mediated resistance to M. oryzae expressing AVR-Pii. This led us to propose a novel conceptual model in which an NLR-integrated domain functions to detect host proteins targeted by pathogen effectors, in a framework that extends classical indirect recognition models.",
