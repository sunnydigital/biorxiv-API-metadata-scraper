    "abstract": "How to define a partition of individuals into species is a long-standing question called the species problem in systematics. Here, we focus on this problem in the thought experiment where individuals reproduce clonally and both the differentiation process and the population genealogies are explicitly known. We point out three desirable properties of species partitions: (A) Heterotypy between species, (B) Homotypy within species and (M) Monophyly of each species. We then ask: How and when is it possible to delineate species in a way satisfying these properties?\\n\\nWe point out that the three desirable properties cannot in general be satisfied simultaneously, but that any two of them can. We mathematically prove the existence of the finest partition satisfying (A) and (M) and the coarsest partition satisfying (B) and (M). For each of them, we propose a simple algorithm to build the associated phylogeny out of the genealogy.\\n\\nThe ways we propose to phrase the species problem shed new light on the interaction between the genealogical and phylogenetic scales in modeling work. The two definitions centered on the monophyly property can readily be used at a higher taxonomic level as well, e.g. to cluster species into monophyletic genera.",

    "abstract": "Whipworms are parasitic nematodes that live in the gut of more than 500 million people worldwide. Due to the difficulty in obtaining parasite material, the mouse whipworm Trichuris muris has been extensively used as a model to study human whipworm infections. These nematodes secrete a multitude of compounds that interact with host tissues where they orchestrate a parasitic existence. Herein we provide the first comprehensive characterisation of the excretory/secretory products of T. muris. We identify 148 proteins secreted by T. muris and show for the first time that the mouse whipworm secretes exosome-like extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can interact with host cells. We use an Optiprep(R) gradient to purify the EVs, highlighting the suitability of this method for purifying EVs secreted by a parasitic nematode. We also characterise the proteomic and genomic content of the EVs, identifying >350 proteins, 56 miRNAs (22 novel) and 475 full-length mRNA transcripts mapping to T. muris gene models. Many of the miRNAs putatively mapped to mouse genes involved in regulation of inflammation, implying a role in parasite-driven immunomodulation. In addition, for the first time to our knowledge, we use colonic organoids to demonstrate the internalisation of parasite EVs by host cells. Understanding how parasites interact with their host is crucial to develop new control measures. This first characterisation of the proteins and EVs secreted by T. muris provides important information on whipworm-host communication and forms the basis for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Many components of host-parasite interactions have been shown to affect the way virulence (i.e., parasite-induced harm to the host) evolves. However, coevolution of multiple parasite traits is often neglected. We explore how an immunosuppressive mechanism of parasites affects and co-evolves with virulence through multiple infections. Applying the adaptive dynamics framework to epidemiological models with coinfection, we show that immunosuppression is a double-edged-sword for the evolution of virulence. On one hand, it amplifies the adaptive benefit of virulence by increasing the abundance of coinfections through epidemiological feedbacks. On the other hand, immunosuppression hinders host recovery, prolonging the duration of infection and elevating the cost of killing the host. The balance between the cost and benefit of immunosuppression varies across different background mortality rates of hosts. In addition, we find that immunosuppression evolution is influenced considerably by the precise trade-off shape determining the effect of immunosuppression on host recovery and susceptibility to further infection. These results demonstrate that the evolution of virulence is shaped by immunosuppression while highlighting that the evolution of immune evasion mechanisms deserves further research attention.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) has been a major evolutionary driver of increased genomic complexity in vertebrates. One such event occurred in the salmonid family ~80 million years ago (Ss4R) giving rise to a plethora of structural and regulatory duplicate-driven divergence, making salmonids an exemplary system to investigate the evolutionary consequences of WGD. Here, we present a draft genome assembly of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and use this in a comparative framework to study evolution of gene regulation following WGD. Among the Ss4R duplicates identified in European grayling and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), one third reflect non-neutral tissue expression evolution, with strong purifying selection, maintained over ~50 million years. Of these, the majority reflect conserved tissue regulation under strong selective constraints related to brain and neural-related functions, as well as higher-order protein-protein interactions. A small subset of the duplicates has evolved tissue regulatory expression divergence in a common ancestor, which have been subsequently conserved in both lineages, suggestive of adaptive divergence following WGD. These candidates for adaptive tissue expression divergence have elevated rates of protein coding- and promoter-sequence evolution and are enriched for immune- and lipid metabolism ontology terms. Lastly, lineage-specific duplicate divergence points towards underlying differences in adaptive pressures on expression regulation in the non-anadromous grayling versus the anadromous Atlantic salmon.\\n\\nOur findings enhance our understanding of the role of WGD in genome evolution and highlights cases of regulatory divergence of Ss4R duplicates, possibly related to a niche shift in early salmonid evolution.",

    "abstract": "For many neural network models in which neurons are trained to classify inputs like perceptrons, the number of inputs that can be classified is limited by the connectivity of each neuron, even when the total number of neurons is very large. This poses the problem of how the biological brain can take advantage of its huge number of neurons given that the connectivity is sparse. One solution is to combine multiple perceptrons together, as in committee machines. The number of classifiable random patterns would then grow linearly with the number of perceptrons, even when each perceptron has limited connectivity. However, the problem is moved to the downstream readout neurons, which would need a number of connections that is as large as the number of perceptrons. Here we propose a different approach in which the readout is implemented by connecting multiple perceptrons in a recurrent attractor neural network. We prove analytically that the number of classifiable random patterns can grow unboundedly with the number of perceptrons, even when the connectivity of each perceptron remains finite. Most importantly, both the recurrent connectivity and the connectivity of downstream readouts also remain finite. Our study shows that feed-forward neural classifiers with numerous long range afferent connections can be replaced by recurrent networks with sparse long range connectivity without sacrificing the classification performance. Our strategy could be used to design more general scalable network architectures with limited connectivity, which resemble more closely the brain neural circuits which are dominated by recurrent connectivity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNetwork generation tools coupled with chemical reaction rules have been mainly developed for synthesis planning and more recently for metabolic engineering. Using the same core algorithm, these tools apply a set of rules to a source set of compounds, stopping when a sink set of compounds has been produced. When using the appropriate sink, source and rules, this core algorithm can be used for a variety of applications beyond those it has been developed for.\\n\\nResultsHere, we showcase the use of the open source workflow RetroPath2.0. First, we mathematically prove that we can generate all structural isomers of a molecule using a reduced set of reaction rules. We then use this enumeration strategy to screen the chemical space around a set of monomers and predict their glass transition temperatures, as well as around aminoglycosides to search structures maximizing antibacterial activity. We also perform a screening around aminoglycosides with enzymatic reaction rules to ensure biosynthetic accessibility. We finally use our workflow on an E. coli model to complete E. coli metabolome, with novel molecules generated using promiscuous enzymatic reaction rules. These novel molecules are searched on the MS spectra of an E. coli cell lysate interfacing our workflow with OpenMS through the KNIME analytics platform.\\n\\nConclusionWe provide an easy to use and modify, modular, and open-source workflow. We demonstrate its versatility through a variety of use cases including, molecular structure enumeration, virtual screening in the chemical space, and metabolome completion. Because it is open source and freely available on MyExperiment.org, workflow community contributions should likely expand further the features of the tool, even beyond the use cases presented in the paper.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide array of motor and non-motor symptoms. It remains unclear whether neurodegeneration in discrete loci gives rise to discrete symptoms, or whether network-wide atrophy gives rise to the unique behavioural and clinical profile associated with PD. Here we apply a data-driven strategy to isolate large-scale, multivariate associations between distributed atrophy patterns and clinical phenotypes in PD. In a sample of N = 229 de novo PD patients, we estimate disease-related atrophy using deformation based morphometry (DBM) of T1 weighted MR images. Using partial least squares (PLS), we identify a network of subcortical and cortical regions whose collective atrophy is associated with a clinical phenotype encompassing motor and non-motor features. Despite the relatively early stage of the disease in the sample, the atrophy pattern encompassed lower brainstem, substantia nigra, basal ganglia and cortical areas, consistent with the Braak hypothesis. In addition, individual variation in this putative atrophy network predicted longitudinal clinical progression in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Altogether, these results demonstrate a pleiotropic mapping between neurodegeneration and the clinical manifestations of PD, and that this mapping can be detected even in de novo patients.",

It was previously thought that a single microtubule spindle is responsible to spatially combine the two genomes and then segregate them to create the two-cell embryo. Utilizing light-sheet microscopy, we showed that two bipolar spindles form in the zygote, that independently congress the maternal and paternal genomes. These two spindles aligned their poles prior to anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This spindle assembly mechanism provides a rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian zygotes and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell embryo.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: After fertilization, two spindles form around pro-nuclei in mammalian zygotes and keep the parental genomes apart during the first division.",

    "abstract": "There is substantial interest in uncovering the genetic basis of the traits underlying adaptive responses in tree species, as this information will ultimately aid conservation and industrial endeavors across populations, generations, and environments. Fundamentally, the characterization of such genetic bases is within the context of a genetic architecture, which describes the mutlidimensional relationship between genotype and phenotype through the identification of causative variants, their relative location within a genome, expression, pleiotropic effect, environmental influence, and degree of dominance, epistasis, and additivity. Here, we review theory related to polygenic local adaptation and contextualize these expectations with methods often used to uncover the genetic basis of traits important to tree conservation and industry. A broad literature survey suggests that most tree traits generally exhibit considerable heritability, that underlying quantitative genetic variation (QST) is structured more so across populations than neutral expectations (FST) in 69% of comparisons across the literature, and that single-locus associations often exhibit small estimated per-locus effects. Together, these results suggest differential selection across populations often acts on tree phenotypes underlain by polygenic architectures consisting of numerous small to moderate effect loci. Using this synthesis, we highlight the limits of using solely single-locus approaches to describe underlying genetic architectures and close by addressing hurdles and promising alternatives towards such goals, remark upon the current state of tree genomics, and identify future directions for this field. Importantly, we argue, the success of future endeavors should not be predicated on the shortcomings of past studies and will instead be dependent upon the application of theory to empiricism, standardized reporting, centralized open-access databases, and continual input and review of the communitys research.",

How cellular dynamics sustain neurogenesis and how alterations with age may result in this decline, are both unresolved issues. Therefore, we clonally traced neural stem cell lineages using confetti reporters in young and old adult mice. To understand underlying mechanisms, we derived mathematical population models of adult neurogenesis that explain the observed clonal cell type abundances. Models fitting the data best consistently show self renewal of transit amplifying progenitors and rapid neuroblast cell cycle exit. Most importantly, we identified an increase of asymmetric stem cell divisions at the expense of symmetric stem cell differentiation with age. Beyond explaining existing longitudinal population data, our model identifies a particular cellular strategy underlying adult neural stem cell homeostasis that gives insights into the aging of a stem cell compartment.",

    "abstract": "Identifying units of conservation of aquatic species is fundamental to informed natural resources science and management. We used a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear molecular methods to identify potential units of conservation of westslope cutthroat trout, a taxon native to montane river basins of the northwestern U.S. and southwestern Canada. Mitogenomic sequencing identified two major lineages composed of nine monophyletic clades, and a well-supported subclade within one of these, largely delineated by river basins. Analyses of microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms corroborated most of these groupings, sometimes with less resolution but demonstrating more complex connections among clades. The mitochondrial and nuclear analyses revealed that Pleistocene glacial cycles profoundly influenced the distribution and divergence of westslope cutthroat trout, that this taxon crossed the Continental Divide in two separate events, and that genetically pure but nonindigenous fish were widely distributed. Herein, we recognize nine geographically discrete, cytonuclear lineages largely circumscribed by major river basins as potential units of conservation: 1) John Day; 2) Coeur dAlene; 3) St. Joe; 4) North Fork Clearwater; 5) Salmon; 6) Clearwater headwaters; 7) Clearwater-eastern Cascades; 8) neoboreal, consisting of most of the Columbia upstream from central Washington, the Fraser in British Columbia, and the South Saskatchewan in Alberta; and 9) Missouri.",

Biosensors, capable of label-free and in-line evaluation, play an important role in the investigation of chitin synthesis, degradation and interaction with other materials. This work presents a comparative study of the usefulness of a chitin surface preparation, either on gold (Au) or on polystyrene (PS). In both cases the most common method to dissolve chitin was used, followed by a simple spin-coating procedure. Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance (MP-SPR), modeling of the optical properties of the chitin layers, scanning electron microscopy, and contact angle goniometry were used to confirm: the thickness of the layers in air and buffer, the refractive indices of the chitin layers in air and buffer, the hydrophobicity, the binding properties of the chitin binding domain (CBD) of Bacillus circulans, and the split-intein capture process. Binding of the CBD differed between chitin on Au versus chitin on PS in terms of binding strength and binding specificity due to a less homogenous structured chitin-surface on Au in comparison to chitin on PS, despite a similar thickness of both chitin layers in air and after running buffer over the surfaces. The use of the simple method to reproduce chitin films on a thin polystyrene layer to study chitin as a biosensor and for chitin binding studies was obvious from the SPR studies and the binding studies of CBD as moiety of chitinases or as protein fusion partner. In conclusion, stable chitin layers for SPR studies can be made from chitin in a solution of dimethylacetamide (DMA) and lithium chloride (LiCl) followed by spin-coating if the gold surface is protected with PS.",

However, several unanswered questions remain over folic acid efficacy, safety and interactions with gut microbes. Prevention of a development defect caused by folate deficiency in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans requires > 10 fold higher concentrations of folic acid compared to folinic acid, a reduced folate. Here we show that the major route for folic acid to restore normal development is indirect via the Escherichia coli used to feed C. elegans. This route occurs mainly via the E. coli transporter AbgT, which takes up the folic acid breakdown product para-aminobenzoate-glutamate (PABA-glu). We found that folic acid preparations, including a commercial supplement, contain 0.3- 4.0 % of this breakdown product. Previously, we have shown that inhibiting bacterial folate synthesis increases C. elegans lifespan by removing a life-shortening bacterial activity. Here, we show that folic acid restores bacterial folate synthesis and reverses this lifespan increase.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSchistosoma mansoni invasion of the human host involves a variety of cross-species protein-protein interactions. The pathogen expresses a diverse arsenal of proteins that facilitate the breach of physical and biochemical barriers present in skin, evasion of the immune system, and digestion of human hemoglobin, allowing schistosomes to reside in the host for years. However, only a small number of specific interactions between S. mansoni and human proteins have been identified. We present and apply a protocol that generates testable predictions of S. mansoni-human protein interactions.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we first predict S. mansoni-human protein interactions based on similarity to known protein complexes. Putative interactions were then scored and assessed using several contextual filters, including the use of annotation automatically derived from literature using a simple natural language processing methodology. Our method predicted 7 out of the 10 previously known cross-species interactions.\\n\\nConclusionsSeveral predictions that warrant experimental follow-up were presented and discussed, including interactions involving potential vaccine candidate antigens, protease inhibition, and immune evasion. The application framework provides an integrated methodology for investigation of host-pathogen interactions and an extensive source of orthogonal data for experimental analysis. We have made the predictions available online for community perusal.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe S. mansoni parasite is the etiological agent of the disease Schistomiasis. However, protein-protein interactions have been experimentally characterized that relate to pathogenesis and establishment of infection. As with many pathogens, the understanding of these interactions is a key component for the development of new vaccines. In this project, we have applied a computational whole-genome comparative approach to aid in the prediction of interactions between S. mansoni and human proteins and to identify important proteins involved in infection. The results of applying this method recapitulate several previously characterized interactions, as well as suggest additional ones as potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Glutamatergic synapses display a rich repertoire of plasticity mechanisms on many different time scales, involving dynamic changes in the efficacy of transmitter release as well as changes in the number and function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR enables visualization of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals at frequencies up to [~]10 Hz. However, to resolve glutamate dynamics during high frequency bursts, faster indicators are required. Here we report the development of fast (iGluf) and ultrafast (iGluu) variants with comparable brightness, but increased Kd for glutamate (137 M and 600 M, respectively). Compared to iGluSnFR, iGluu has a 6-fold faster dissociation rate in vitro and 5-fold faster kinetics in synapses. Fitting a three-state model to kinetic data, we identify the large conformational change after glutamate binding as the rate-limiting step. In rat hippocampal slice culture stimulated at 100 Hz, we find that iGluu is sufficiently fast to resolve individual glutamate release events, revealing that glutamate is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft. Depression of iGluu responses during 100 Hz trains correlates with depression of postsynaptic EPSPs, indicating that depression during high frequency stimulation is purely presynaptic in origin. At individual boutons, the recovery from depression could be predicted from the amount of glutamate released on the second pulse (paired pulse facilitation/depression), demonstrating differential frequency-dependent filtering of spike trains at Schaffer collateral boutons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementExcitatory synapses convert presynaptic action potentials into chemical signals that are sensed by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. To eavesdrop on synaptic transmission, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for glutamate have been developed. However, even the best available sensors lag behind the very fast glutamate dynamics in the synaptic cleft. Here we report the development of an ultrafast genetically encoded glutamate sensor, iGluu, which allowed us to image glutamate clearance and synaptic depression during 100 Hz spike trains. We found that only boutons showing paired-pulse facilitation were able to rapidly recover from depression. Thus, presynaptic boutons act as frequency-specific filters to transmit select features of the spike train to specific postsynaptic cells.",

We used genome-wide genetic analysis on 74,896 women and men to find rare genetic variants that modulate gonadal function in both sexes. This uncovered an association with variants disrupting CSMD1, a complement regulatory protein located on 8p23, in a genomic region with an exceptional evolution. We found that Csmd1 knockout mice display a diverse array of gonadal defects in both sexes, and in females, impaired mammary gland development that leads to increased offspring mortality. The complement pathway is significantly disrupted in Csmd1 mice, and further disruption of the complement pathway from joint inactivation of C3 leads to more extreme reproductive defects.

    "abstract": "Adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) persists during mitosis in most cell types. Yet, classical adhesion complexes (ACs), such as focal adhesions and focal complexes, do and must disassemble to enable cytoskeletal rearrangements associated with mitotic rounding. Given this paradox, mechanisms of mitotic cell-ECM adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify  reticular adhesions, a new class of AC that is mediated by integrin v{beta}5, formed during interphase and preserved at cell-ECM attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin {beta}5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Quantitative imaging reveals reticular adhesions to be both morphologically and dynamically distinct from classic focal adhesions, while mass spectrometry defines their unique composition; lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, remarkably, reticular adhesions are functionally independent of both talin and F-actin, yet are promoted by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2). Overall, the distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a unique solution to the problem of maintaining cell-ECM attachment during mitotic rounding and division.",

    "abstract": "Abacavir is an antiretroviral drug used to reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication and decrease the risk of developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, its therapeutic value is diminished by the fact that it is associated with drug hypersensitivity reactions in up to 8% of treated patients. This hypersensitivity is strongly associated with patients carrying human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57:01, but not patients carrying closely related alleles. Abacavirs specificity to HLA-B*57:01 is attributed to its binding site within the peptide-binding cleft and subsequent influence of the repertoire of peptides that can bind HLA-B*57:01. To further our understanding of abacavir-induced hypersensitivity we used molecular dynamics (MD) to analyze the dynamics of three different peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01 in the presence and absence of abacavir or abacavir analogues. We found that abacavir and associated peptides bind to HLA-B*57:01 in a highly diverse range of conformations that are not apparent from static crystallographic snapshots. Further, the presence of abacavir has a direct impact on the dynamics and the conformational space available to peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01, likely influencing abacavir-induced immune self-reactivity. Our results support hypersensitivity models in which abacavir-binding alters the equilibrium proportions of neopeptide conformations in a manner favourable to TCR binding. Our findings highlight the need to also consider the role of dynamics in understanding drug-induced hypersensitivities at the molecular and mechanistic level. This additional insight can help inform the chemical modification of abacavir to prevent hypersensitivity reactions in HLA-B*57:01+ HIV patients whilst retaining potent antiretroviral activity.",

    "abstract": "For proper biofilm formation, bacteria must have mechanisms in place to sense adhesion to surfaces. In Escherichia coli, the CpxAR and RcsCDB systems have been reported to sense surfaces. The CpxAR system is widely considered to be responsible for sensing attachment, to specifically hydrophobic surfaces. Here, using both single-cell and population-level analyses, we confirm RcsCDB activation upon surface contact, but find that the CpxAR system is not activated, in contrast to what had earlier been reported. Thus, the role of CpxAR in surface sensing and initiation of biofilm formation needs to be reconsidered.\\n\\nSignificance statementE. coli is capable of forming medically problematic biofilms, which are surface-associated microbial communities, protected by an exopolymeric matrix and with increased antibiotic tolerance. How these bacteria sense physical contact with a surface, which may lead to initiation of the biofilm formation process, is largely elusive. The signal transduction systems CpxAR and RcsCDB have previously been found to activate upon surface contact. Here, we confirm that RcsCDB is a surface sensing system, immediately responding to attachment. In contrast, using two different experimental approaches, we found that the CpxAR system does not perceive surface contact. Thus, contrary to the current view, the CpxAR system does not play a signaling role in the first step of biofilm initiation.",

Here we compare these hypotheses across four regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a spatial WM task, where an intervening distractor indicated the reward available for a correct saccade. WM representations were strongest in ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) neurons with higher intrinsic temporal stability (time-constant). At the population-level, although a stable mnemonic state was reached during the delay, this tuning geometry was reversed relative to cue-period selectivity, and was disrupted by the distractor. Single-neuron analysis revealed many neurons switched to coding reward, rather than maintaining task-relevant spatial selectivity until saccade. These results imply WM is fulfilled by dynamic, population-level activity within high time-constant neurons. Rather than persistent activity supporting stable mnemonic representations that bridge distraction, PFC neurons may stabilise a dynamic population-level process that supports WM.",

We explore whether complex population coding dynamics during WM relate to the intrinsic temporal properties of single neurons in lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC), the frontal eye fields (FEF) and lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) of two monkeys (Macaca mulatta). We found that cells with short timescales carried memory information relatively early during memory encoding in lPFC; whereas long timescale cells played a greater role later during processing, dominating coding in the delay period. We also observed a link between functional connectivity at rest and intrinsic timescale in FEF and LIP.

    "abstract": "Phylogenomic research is accelerating the publication of landmark studies that aim to resolve deep divergences of major organismal groups. Meanwhile, systems for identifying and integrating the novel products of phylogenomic inference - such as newly supported clade concepts - have not kept pace. However, the ability to verbalize both node concept congruence and conflict across multiple, (in effect) simultaneously endorsed phylogenomic hypotheses, is a critical prerequisite for building synthetic data environments for biological systematics, thereby also benefitting other domains impacted by these (conflicting) inferences. Here we develop a novel solution to the conflict verbalization challenge, based on a logic representation and reasoning approach that utilizes the language of Region Connection Calculus (RCC-5) to produce consistent alignments of node concepts endorsed by incongruent phylogenomic studies. The approach employs clade concept labels to individuate concepts used by each source, even if these carry identical names. Indirect RCC-5 modeling of intensional (property-based) node concept definitions, facilitated by the local relaxation of coverage constraints, allows parent concepts to attain congruence in spite of their differentially sampled children. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we align two recently published phylogenomic reconstructions of higher-level avian groups that entail strong conflict in the \\\"neoavian explosion\\\" region. According to our representations, this conflict is constituted by 26 instances of input \\\"whole concept\\\" overlap. These instances are further resolvable in the output labeling schemes and visualizations as \\\"split concepts\\\", thereby providing the provenance services needed to build truly synthetic phylogenomic data environments. Because the RCC-5 alignments fundamentally reflect the trained, logic-enabled judgments of systematic experts, future designs for such environments need to promote a culture where experts routinely assess the intensionalities of node concepts published by our peers - even and especially when we are not in agreement with each other.",

Water sample for algae from aquatic system is usually consist of mix culture of algae and need to be processed for targeted isolated algal strains using reported techniques like streaking, spraying, serial dilution, and single-cell isolations. But none of these techniques is considered as efficient or popular except streaking on agar plate which involves a set of microbial techniques and may take months to make isolation properly.

The trapped algal species in the beads are grown in 96 wells plate having single bead in each well with standard medium leading to microscopic verification of the isolated algal species to process further.

    "abstract": "Changes in vigilance or alertness during a typical resting state fMRI scan are inevitable and have been found to affect measures of functional brain connectivity. Since it is not often feasible to monitor vigilance with EEG during fMRI scans, it would be of great value to have methods for estimating vigilance levels from fMRI data alone. A recent study, conducted in macaque monkeys, proposed a template-based approach for fMRI-based estimation of vigilance fluctuations. Here, we use simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI data to investigate whether the same template-based approach can be employed to estimate vigilance fluctuations of awake humans across different resting-state conditions. We first demonstrate that the spatial pattern of correlations between EEG-defined vigilance and fMRI in our data is consistent with the previous literature. Notably, however, we observed a significant difference between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions finding stronger negative correlations with vigilance in regions forming the default mode network and higher positive correlations in thalamus and insula in the EC condition when compared to the EO condition. Taking these correlation maps as \\\"templates\\\" for vigilance estimation, we found that the template-based approach produced fMRI-based vigilance estimates that were significantly correlated with EEG-based vigilance measures, indicating its generalizability from macaques to humans. We also demonstrate that the performance of this method was related to the overall amount of variability in a subjects vigilance state, and that the template-based approach outperformed the use of the global signal as a vigilance estimator. In addition, we show that the template-based approach can be used to estimate the variability across scans in the amplitude of the vigilance fluctuations. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using the template-based approach in future fMRI studies.",

Understanding ecological effects of warming requires linking empirical evidence to theories that allow projection to unobserved conditions. Metabolic scaling theory and its tests suggest that warming accelerates ecosystem functions (e.g., oxygen flux), yet this prediction apparently contradicts community-level studies suggesting warming is a stressor that can reduce ecosystem function. We sought to reconcile these predictions with an experimental test of the hypothesis that cascading trophic interactions modify the temperature-dependence of community structure and ecosystem fluxes. In a series of independent freshwater ecosystems exposed to a thermal gradient, we found that warmer temperatures strengthened the trophic cascade increased and indirectly changed community structure by altering grazer species composition and phytoplankton biomass. Temperature-driven community shifts only modestly affected the temperature dependence of net ecosystem oxygen fluxes. Over the 10 {degrees}C thermal gradient, NPP and ER increased [~]2.7-fold among ecosystems, while standing phytoplankton biomass declined by 85-95%. The exponential increase in oxygen flux over the thermal gradient, as well as monotonic declines in phytoplankton standing stock, suggested no threshold effects of warming across systems. We also observed temperature variation over time, within ecosystems. For phytoplankton biomass, temporal variation had the opposite effect to spatial variation, suggesting that within-community temporal change in community structure was not predicted by space-for-time substitution. We conclude that food chain length can modify effects of temperature on ecosystem fluxes, but that temperature can still have continuous and positive effects on ecosystem fluxes, consistent with patterns based on large-scale, macroecological comparisons. Changes in community structure, including temperature dependent trophic cascades, may be compatible with prevailing and predictable effects of temperature on ecosystem functions related to fundamental effects of temperature on metabolism.\\n\\nStatement of authorshipJG & MIO designed the study, MIO & US provided materials, JG & SJC performed research and collected data, JG performed zooplankton analysis, SJC performed phytoplankton analysis, JG & MIO performed modeling work, analyzed data output, and wrote the first draft, and all authors contributed substantially to reviews",

    "abstract": "Light is one of the main signals that regulates flowering. Low red to far-red ratios accelerate flowering in a wide range of species. The central gene pathways controlling flowering time in Arabidopsis, appear to be largely conserved in legumes. However, numerous examples exist of gene duplication and loss. The role of CONSTANS-LIKE genes as integrators of the photoperiod response has been questioned in several dicot species, including legumes. In this study on subterranean clover, using RNA-seq and controlled light spectra, we identified 13 differentially expressed genes related to light signalling, meristem identity and flowering promotion. Of these, we pinpointed genes which seem to link photoperiod and far-red light signalling coding for a With no lysine kinase, a CCT motif related to CONSTANS, a FLOWERING LOCUS T b2 like protein, and their active downstream cascade. The earlier down-regulation of these genes under blue compared to far-red-enriched light may explain their role in floral induction. A second independent approach (qPCR analysis) confirmed our findings. Contrasting responses to light quality related to reproduction and defence mechanisms were also found. These results will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of flowering in response to light quality in long-day plants.",

We utilise a genome wide approach using generalized restricted maximum likelihood (GCTA-GREML) to determine the total phenotypic variance in educational attainment and value-added measures that is attributable to common genetic variation across the genome within a sample of unrelated individuals from a UK birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Our findings suggest that the heritability of educational attainment measured using point score test data increases with age from 47% at age 11 to 61% at age 16. We also find that genetic variation does not contribute towards value-added measures created only from educational attainment point score data, but it does contribute a small amount to measures that additionally control for background characteristics (up to 20.09% [95%CI: 6.06 to 35.71] from age 11 to 14). Finally, our results show that value-added measures built from teacher rated ability have higher heritability than those built from exam scores. Our findings suggest that the heritability of educational attainment increases through childhood and adolescence. Value-added measures based upon fine grain point scores may be less prone to between-individual genomic differences than measures that control for students backgrounds, or those built from more subjective measures such as teacher rated ability.",

In South America where the Viannia subgenus predominates, so far only L. (Viannia) braziliensis and L. (V.) panamensis have been sequenced, assembled and annotated as reference genomes. Addressing this deficit in molecular information can inform species typing, epidemiological monitoring and clinical treatment. Here, L. (V.) naiffi and L. (V.) guyanensis genomic DNA was sequenced to assemble these two genomes as draft references from short sequence reads. The methods used were tested using short sequence reads for L. braziliensis M2904 against its published reference as a comparison. This assembly and annotation pipeline identified 70 additional genes not annotated on the original M2904 reference. Phylogenetic and evolutionary comparisons of L. guyanensis and L. naiffi with ten other Viannia genomes revealed four traits common to all Viannia: aneuploidy, 22 orthologous groups of genes absent in other Leishmania subgenera, elevated TATE transposon copies, and a high NADH-dependent fumarate reductase gene copy number. Within the Viannia, there were limited structural changes in genome architecture specific to individual species: a 45 Kb amplification on chromosome 34 was present in all bar L. lainsoni, L. naiffi had a higher copy number of the virulence factor leishmanolysin, and laboratory isolate L. shawi M8408 had a possible minichromosome derived from the 3 end of chromosome 34. This combination of genome assembly, phylogenetics and comparative analysis across an extended panel of diverse Viannia has uncovered new insights into the origin and evolution of this subgenus and can help improve diagnostics for leishmaniasis surveillance.",

New Zealand has a complex history of mouse invasions, and the living descendants of these invaders have genetic ancestry from all three subspecies, although most are primarily descended from M. m. domesticus. We used the GigaMUGA genotyping array (~135,000 loci) to describe the genomic ancestry of 161 mice, sampled from 34 locations from across New Zealand (and one Australian city - Sydney). Of these, two populations, one in the south of the South Island, and one on Chatham Island, showed complete mitochondrial lineage capture, featuring two different lineages of M. m. castaneus mitochondrial DNA but with only M. m. domesticus nuclear ancestry detectable. Mice in the northern and southern parts of the North Island had small traces (~2-3%) of M. m. castaneus nuclear ancestry, and mice in the upper South Island had ~7-8% M. m. musculus nuclear ancestry including some Y-chromosomal ancestry - though no detectable M. m. musculus mitochondrial ancestry. This is the most thorough genomic study of introduced populations of house mice yet conducted, and will have relevance to studies of the isolation mechanisms separating subspecies of mice.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dynamics are poorly understood in developing countries, where data on the prevalence of AMR in enteric bacteria are sparse, particularly among children and in the community setting. Here we use a combination of phenotyping, genomics and antimicrobial usage data to investigate patterns of AMR amongst atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) strains isolated from children <5 years old in seven countries (four in sub-Saharan Africa and three in South Asia) over a three-year period. We detected very high rates of AMR, with 65% of isolates displaying resistance to [&ge;]3 drug classes; the rates of AMR were the same amongst strains associated with diarrhea and strains that were carried asymptomatically. Whole genome sequencing identified a diversity of genetic mechanisms for AMR, which could explain >95% of observed phenotypic resistance. Analysis of AMR gene co-occurrence revealed clusters of acquired AMR genes that were frequently co-located on small plasmids and transposons, providing opportunities for acquisition of multidrug resistance in a single step. We used discriminant analysis to investigate potential drivers of AMR within the bacterial population, and found that genetic determinants of AMR were associated with geographical location of isolation but not with phylogenetic lineage of the E. coli strain or disease status of the human host. Comparison with antimicrobial usage data showed that the prevalence of resistance to newer drugs (fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins) was correlated with usage, which was generally higher in South Asia than Africa. In particular, fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations in gyrA were significantly associated with use of these drugs for treatment of diarrheic children. Notably resistance to older drugs such as trimethoprim, chloramphenicol and ampicillin, which are conferred by acquired AMR genes that were frequently clustered together in mobile genetic elements, were common in all locations despite differences in usage; this suggests that reversion to sensitivity is unlikely to occur even if these drugs are removed from circulation. This study provides much-needed insights into the frequencies of AMR in intestinal E. coli in community-based children in developing countries and to antimicrobial usage for diarrhea where the burden of infections is greatest.",

    "abstract": "Variability of spiking activity is ubiquitous throughout the brain but little is known about its contextual dependence. Trial-to-trial spike count variability, estimated by the Fano Factor (FF), and within-trial spike time irregularity, quantified by the local coefficient of variation (CV2), reflect variability on long and short time scales, respectively. We co-analyzed FF and CV2 in monkey motor cortex comparing two behavioral contexts, movement preparation (wait) and execution (movement). We find that FF significantly decreases from wait to movement, while CV2 increases. The more regular firing (low CV2) during wait is related to an increased power of local field potential beta oscillations and phase locking of spikes to these oscillations. In renewal processes, a widely used model for spiking activity under stationary input conditions, both measures are related as FF{approx}CV2. This expectation was met during movement, but not during wait where FF>>CV22. We conclude that during movement preparation, ongoing brain processes result in changing network states and thus in high trial-to-trial variability (high FF). During movement execution, the network is recruited for performing the stereotyped motor task, resulting in reliable single neuron output. We discuss our results in the light of recent computational models that generate non-stationary network conditions.",

    "abstract": "Negative emotionality is a well-established and stable risk factor for affective disorders. Individual differences in negative emotionality have been linked to associative learning processes which can be captured experimentally in fear conditioning paradigms. Literature suffers from underpowered samples, suboptimal methods, and an isolated focus on single questionnaires and single outcome measures. Here, we apply multivariate and dimensional approaches for three commonly investigated questionnaires in the field (STAI-T, NEO-FFI Neuroticism, Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale) across multiple analysis units (ratings, skin conductance, startle, BOLD-fMRI) during fear acquisition-training in two large samples (NStudy1=356; NStudy2=113). We investigate whether the specific or shared variance of these questionnaires is linked with CS-discrimination in specific outcome measures (Study 1). We identify a significant negative association between STAI-T and CS-discrimination in SCRs and between Intolerance of Uncertainty and CS-discrimination in startle responding. Yet, correlation coefficients for all questionnaire-outcome measure combinations did not differ significantly from each other. In Study 2 the STAI-T score was positively associated with CS-discrimination in a number of brain areas linked to conditioned fear (amygdala, putamen, thalamus), but not to SCRs or ratings. Importantly, we replicate potential sampling biases between fMRI and behavioral studies regarding anxiety levels. We discuss the implications of these results.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a popular method for examining pharmacological effects on the brain; however the BOLD response is an indirect measure of neural activity, and as such is vulnerable to confounding effects of pharmacological probes. Controlling for such non-specific effects in pharmacological fMRI studies is therefore an important consideration. We have developed two variants of a standardized control task that are short (5 minutes duration) simple (for both the subject and experimenter), widely applicable, and yield a number of readouts in a spatially diverse set of brain networks. The tasks consist of four functionally discreet three-second trial types (plus additional null trials) and contain visual, auditory, motor and cognitive (eye-movements, and working memory tasks in the two task variants) stimuli. Performance of the tasks was assessed in a group of 15 subjects scanned on two separate occasions, with test-retest reliability explicitly assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients. Both tasks produced robust patterns of brain activation in the expected brain regions, and reliability coefficients for the tasks were generally high, with four out of eight task conditions rated as  excellent, and only one out of eight rated as  poor. Voxel-wise reliability measures also showed good spatial concordances with the brain activation results. Either of the two task variants would be suitable for use as a control task in future pharmacological fMRI studies or for any situation where a short, reliable, basic task paradigm is required.

Here, we apply transcranial US and perform brain mapping studies in guinea pigs using extracellular electrophysiology. We find that US elicits extensive activation across cortical and subcortical brain regions. However, transection of the auditory nerves or removal of cochlear fluids eliminates the US-induced activity, revealing an indirect auditory mechanism for US neural activation. US likely vibrates the cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, which is continuous with the fluid in the cochlea via cochlear aqueducts; thus, US can activate the ascending auditory pathways and other non-auditory regions through cross-modal projections. This finding of a cochlear fluid-induced vibration mechanism challenges the idea that US can directly activate neurons in the intact brain, suggesting that future US stimulation studies will need to control for this effect to reach reliable conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Human observers automatically extract temporal contingencies from the environment and predict the onset of future events. Temporal predictions are modelled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability was either solely driven by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function), or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area (SMA), underlining this areas link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing, and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilised to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.\\n\\nSignificance StatementExtracting temporal predictions from sensory input allows to process future input more efficiently and to prepare responses in time. In mathematical terms, temporal predictions can be described by the hazard function, modelling the probability of an event to occur over time. Here, we show that the human EEG tracks temporal hazard in an implicit foreperiod paradigm. Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal-hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions that differed in their build-up of hazard over time. These neural signatures of tracking temporal hazard converge with the extant literature on temporal processing and provide new evidence that the supplementary motor area tracks hazard under strictly implicit timing conditions.",

The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is a key structure underlying auditory-cued fear conditioning. Here, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of GR in the LA (LAGRKO) resulted in an auditory-cued fear memory deficit for strengthened conditioning. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of a single restraint stress (RS) prior to conditioning on auditory-cued fear memory in floxed GR (control) mice was abolished in LAGRKO mice. Optogenetic induction of long-term depression (LTD) at auditory inputs to the LA reduced auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice, and in contrast, optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) increased auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed floxed GR mice. These findings suggest that prior stress suppresses fear conditioning-induced LTP at auditory inputs to the LA in a GR-dependent manner, thereby protecting animals from encoding excessive cued fear memory under stress conditions.",

Nulliparous and primiparous rats were sham-ovariectomized or ovariectomized, administered vehicle or Premarin six months later, and trained in the Morris water maze. Premarin improved spatial learning and memory in nulliparous rats, but impaired spatial and reversal learning in primiparous rats. Primiparity increased hippocampal neurogenesis, whereas Premarin treatment decreased immature neurons in both primiparous and nulliparous middle-aged rats in a region-specific manner. Moreover, Premarin increased serum TNF and KC/GRO in nulliparous, but not primiparous, rats, whereas Premarin increased zif268 expression in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in primiparous rats. Thus, primiparity alters how Premarin affects spatial learning, neuronal activation, serum cytokines, and adrenal mass. These findings have implications for the tailored treatment of age-associated cognitive decline in women.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound has received widespread attention as an emerging technology for targeted, non-invasive neuromodulation based on its ability to evoke electrophysiological and motor responses in animals. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal pattern of ultrasound-induced brain activity that could drive these responses. Here, we address this question by combining focused ultrasound with wide-field optical imaging of calcium signals in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, we find cortical activity patterns consistent with indirect activation of auditory pathways rather than direct neuromodulation at the ultrasound focus. Ultrasound-induced activity is similar to that evoked by audible sound. Furthermore, both ultrasound and audible sound elicit motor responses consistent with a startle reflex, with both responses reduced by chemical deafening. These findings reveal an indirect auditory mechanism for ultrasound-induced cortical activity and movement requiring careful consideration in future development of ultrasonic neuromodulation as a tool in neuroscience research.",

Current first-line standard of care is the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), but this treatment strategy adds only ~4 months to median survival due to the rapid development of resistance. While some mechanisms of TMZ resistance have been identified, they are not fully understood. There are few effective strategies to manage therapy resistant GBM, and we lack diverse preclinical models of acquired TMZ resistance in which to test therapeutic strategies on TMZ resistant GBM. In this study, we create and characterize two new GBM cell lines resistant to TMZ, based on the 8MGBA and 42MGBA cell lines. Analysis of the TMZ resistant (TMZres) variants in conjunction with their parental, sensitive cell lines shows that acquisition of TMZ resistance is accompanied by broad phenotypic changes, including increased proliferation, migration, chromosomal aberrations and secretion of cytosolic lipids. Importantly, each TMZ resistant model captures a different facet of the \\\"go\\\" (8MGBA-TMZres) or \\\"grow\\\" (42MGBA-TMZres) hypothesis of GBM behavior. These model systems will be important additions to the available tools for investigators seeking to define molecular mechanisms of acquired TMZ resistance.",

Spatially-explicit models of ecosystems suggest that loss of such power-law clustering may indicate loss of ecosystem resilience. Hence, it is hypothesised that spatial clustering properties in ecosystems - which can be readily measured using remotely-sensed high-resolution data - can help infer proximity to ecosystem thresholds and may even provide early warning signals of ecosystem collapse. Recent empirical and simulation studies, however, dont find consistent relationships between spatial clustering and ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, how spatial clustering metrics relate to other well-known early warning signals of ecosystems collapse, specifically the phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD), remains unclear.\nC_LIO_LIWe synthesize the literature on cluster sizes in empirical and theoretical studies that show how local interactions (especially, positive feedback) among organisms can cause power-law clustering. In addition, we analyse a minimal spatial model of ecosystem transitions that allows us to disentangle the role of environmental stressor and positive feedback on spatial patterns and ecosystem resilience.\nC_LIO_LIOur literature synthesis reveals that empirically observed power-law clustering in ecosystems is parsimoniously explained by local positive feedback. Our synthesis together with model analysis demonstrates that, depending on the strength of positive feedback, emergence of power-law clustering can occur at any distance from the critical threshold of ecosystem collapse. In fact, we find that for systems with strong positive feedbacks, which are most likely to exhibit abrupt transitions, loss of power-law clustering may not even occur prior to ecosystem thresholds. We also argue that cluster-size distributions are unrelated to the phenomenon of CSD.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that, due to CSD, a power-law feature does occur near critical thresholds but in a different quantity; specifically, a power-law decay of spatial correlations of ecosystem state.\nC_LIO_LIWe conclude that loss of power-law clustering cannot be used as a reliable indicator of ecosystem resilience. Our synthesis and model analyses highlights links between local positive feedback, emergent spatial properties and how they may be used to interpret ecosystem resilience.\nC_LI",

We show that these closely related populations express strikingly different ASRs, despite having similar ecologies and life histories, and that ASR variation is largely driven by sex differences in the apparent survival of juveniles. Furthermore, families in populations with biased ASRs were predominantly tended by a single parent, suggesting that parental cooperation breaks down with unbalanced sex ratios.

Because climate warming affects metabolic rates, it creates direct selective effects on body mass. Many empirical studies suggest that body mass decreases under warming, although important exceptions have been noted. We first analyze the evolution of body mass in a simple consumer-resource model to provide conditions under which a body mass increase or decrease may be expected. We then extend our model to a multi-trophic food web context that allows for the coevolution of body mass and of feeding preferences. We focus here on how the trophic position of a consumer influences its evolutionary response to warming under different scenarios for the temperature dependence of attack rates. We observe that body masses can remain constant or increase with temperature when attack rates are constant or increasing with temperature, while body mass reductions in response to warming are only expected when attack rates have a thermal optimum and populations are initially locally adapted. We also found that body masses at lower trophic levels vary less under warming than body masses at higher trophic levels, which may be explained by decreasing levels of stabilizing selection along food chains.",

    "abstract": "More than a hundred years after Griggs influential analysis of species borders, the causes of limits to species ranges still represent a puzzle that has never been understood with clarity. The topic has become especially important recently as many scientists have become interested in the potential for species ranges to shift in response to climate change - and yet, nearly all of those studies fail to recognise or incorporate evolutionary genetics in a way that relates to theoretical developments. I show that range margins can be understood based on just two measurable parameters: i) the fitness cost of dispersal - a measure of environmental heterogeneity - and ii) the strength of genetic drift, which reduces genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define an expansion threshold: adaptation fails when genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below that required for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. When the key parameters drop below this expansion threshold locally, a sharp range margin forms. When they drop below this threshold throughout the species range, adaptation collapses everywhere, resulting in either extinction, or formation of a fragmented meta-population. Because the effects of dispersal differ fundamentally with dimension, the second parameter - the strength of genetic drift - is qualitatively different compared to a linear habitat. In two-dimensional habitats, genetic drift becomes effectively independent of selection. It decreases with neighbourhood size - the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation. Moreover, in contrast to earlier predictions, which neglected evolution of genetic variance and/or stochasticity in two dimensions, dispersal into small marginal populations aids adaptation. This is because the reduction of both genetic and demographic stochasticity has a stronger effect than the cost of dispersal through increased maladaptation. The expansion threshold thus provides a novel, theoretically justified and testable prediction for formation of the range margin and collapse of the species range.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGene flow across environments has conflicting effects: while it increases the genetic variation necessary for adaptation and counters the loss of genetic diversity due to genetic drift, it may also swamp adaptation to local conditions. This interplay is crucial for the dynamics of a species range expansion, which can thus be understood based on two dimensionless parameters: i) the fitness cost of dispersal - a measure of environmental heterogeneity - and ii) the strength of genetic drift - a measure of reduction of genetic diversity. Together, these two parameters define an expansion threshold: adaptation fails when the number of individuals accessible by dispersal within one generation is so small that genetic drift reduces genetic diversity below the level required for adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. This threshold provides a novel, theoretically justified and testable prediction for formation of a range margin and a collapse of a species range in two-dimensional habitats.",

    "abstract": "Resistance against different antibiotics appears on the same bacterial strains more often than expected by chance, leading to high frequencies of multidrug resistance. There are multiple explanations for this observation, but these tend to be specific to subsets of antibiotics and/or bacterial species, whereas the trend is pervasive. Here, we consider the question in terms of strain ecology: explaining why resistance to different antibiotics is often seen on the same strain requires an understanding of the competition between strains with different resistance profiles. This work builds on models originally proposed to explain another aspect of strain competition: the stable coexistence of antibiotic sensitivity and resistance observed in a number of bacterial species. We first demonstrate a partial structural similarity in these models of coexistence. We then generalise this unified underlying model to multidrug resistance and show that models with this structure predict high levels of association between resistance to different drugs and high multidrug resistance frequencies. We test predictions from this model in six bacterial datasets and find them to be qualitatively consistent with observed trends. The higher than expected frequencies of multidrug resistance are often interpreted as evidence that these strains are out-competing strains with lower resistance multiplicity. Our work provides an alternative explanation that is compatible with long-term stability in resistance frequencies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAntibiotic resistance is a serious public health concern, yet the ecology and evolution of drug resistance are not fully understood. This impacts our ability to design effective interventions to combat resistance. From a public health point of view, multidrug resistance is particularly problematic because resistance to different antibiotics is often seen on the same bacterial strains, which leads to high frequencies of multidrug resistance and limits treatment options. This work seeks to explain this trend in terms of strain ecology and the competition between strains with different resistance profiles. Building on recent work exploring why resistant bacteria are not out-competing sensitive bacteria, we show that models originally proposed to explain this observation also predict high multidrug resistance frequencies. These models are therefore a unifying explanation for two pervasive trends in resistance dynamics. In terms of public health, the implication of our results is that new resistances are likeliest to be found on already multidrug resistant strains and that changing patterns of prescription may not be enough to combat multidrug resistance.",

Here we further described that responsive TADs contain 20-100 kb-long clusters of intermingled estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) binding sites, hereafter called Hormone-Control Regions (HCRs). We identified more than 200 HCRs, which are frequently bound by ER and PR even in the absence of hormones. These HCRs establish steady long-distance inter-TAD interactions between them and organize characteristic looping structures with promoters even in the absence of hormones. This organization is dependent on the expression of the receptors and is further dynamically modulated in response to steroid hormones. HCRs function as platforms integrating different signals resulting in some cases in opposite transcriptional responses to estrogens or progestins. Altogether, these results suggest that steroid hormone receptors act not only as hormone-regulated sequence-specific transcription factors, but also as local and global genome organizers.\\n\\nHighlightsHormone responsive TADs are organized around conserved large regulatory regions (HCRs) enriched in ER and PR.\\nHCR contact promoters within their TADs and engaged long-range inter-TADs contacts between them.\\nBinding of the receptors in absence of hormones maintains global HCR-HCR interactions and intra-TADs regulatory loops.\\nHCRs can integrate the hormone signals in divergent ways leading to opposite restructuration of TADs in response to Estrogens or Progestins.",

Fosfomycin is a cell wall inhibitor with a unique mode of action, increasingly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections. In this study, the prevalence of fosfomycin resistant E. coli in a panel of 1000 urine isolates was investigated. Three different clinically used fosfomycin susceptibility testing methods were assessed and genome sequencing used to characterise resistant isolates.\\n\\nOf the 1000 isolates, 676 were E. coli of which initial susceptibility testing with the MAST Uri(R)system suggested 81 (12%) were fosfomycin resistant. Of these, 62 were subsequently confirmed as being E. coli. However, using micro-broth dilution, agar dilution and E-test strips, a lower rate of 1.3% (8/62) of E. coli isolates were robustly identified as being truly fosfomycin resistant; a prevalence comparable with other similar studies. The use of E-test and 96-well breakpoint plates gave results that were inconsistent and hard to interpret. Resistant isolates of E. coli belonged to diverse MLST types and each had a unique set of chromosomal alterations in genes associated with fosfomycin resistance. Changes in GlpT and UhpT/UhpA transport systems were commonly identified, with 6/8 of the resistant isolates possessing amino-acid changes or deletions absent in susceptible strains. Fosfomycin resistant isolates were not multiply drug resistance and did not carry plasmidic fosfomycin resistance genes. Therefore, the use of fosfomycin may be unlikely to drive selection of a particular clone or movement of transferrable resistance genes.\\n\\nFosfomycin remains a viable option for the treatment of E. coli in uncomplicated UTIs, different susceptibility testing platforms can give very different results regarding the prevalence of fosfomycin resistance with false positives a potential problem that may unnecessarily limit use of this agent.",

    "abstract": "Functional connectomes are commonly analysed as sparse graphs, constructed by thresholding cross-correlations between regional neurophysiological signals. Thresholding generally retains the strongest edges (correlations), either by retaining edges surpassing a given absolute weight, or by constraining the edge density. The latter (more widely used) method risks inclusion of false positive edges at high edge densities and exclusion of true positive edges at low edge densities. Here we apply new wavelet-based methods, which enable construction of probabilistically-thresholded graphs controlled for type I error, to a dataset of resting-state fMRI scans of 56 patients with schizophrenia and 71 healthy controls. By thresholding connectomes to fixed edge-specific P value, we found that functional connectomes of patients with schizophrenia were more dysconnected than those of healthy controls, exhibiting a lower edge density and a higher number of (dis)connected components. Furthermore, many participants connectomes could not be built up to the fixed edge densities commonly studied in the literature (~5-30%), while controlling for type I error. Additionally, we showed that the topological randomisation previously reported in the schizophrenia literature is likely attributable to \\\"non-significant\\\" edges added when thresholding connectomes to fixed density based on correlation. Finally, by explicitly comparing connectomes thresholded by increasing P value and decreasing correlation, we showed that probabilistically thresholded connectomes show decreased randomness and increased consistency across participants. Our results have implications for future analysis of functional connectivity using graph theory, especially within datasets exhibiting heterogenous distributions of edge weights (correlations), between groups or across participants.",

    "abstract": "Generation of hierarchical structures, such as the embedding of subordinate elements into larger structures, is a core feature of human cognition. Discrimination of well-formed hierarchies is thought to rely on lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the brain bases underlying the active generation of new hierarchical levels remain poorly understood. Here, we created a new motor paradigm to isolate this active generative process. In fMRI, participants planned and performed (identical) movement sequences based on three previously learned rules: (1) a hierarchical  fractal rule that involved generation of new levels, (2) a linear  iterative rule adding items to existing hierarchical levels, and (3) simple  repetition. We found that generation of new hierarchical levels (using the fractal rule) activated a bilateral motor planning-and imagery network, but did not involve lateral PFC. Conversely, adding items to existing hierarchical levels required M1 directly during execution. These results show that the generation of new hierarchical levels can be achieved without involvement of putative domain-general systems such as those ascribed to lateral PFC. We hypothesize that these systems might be important to parse hierarchical sequences in a multi-domain fashion but not necessarily to generate new hierarchical levels.",

    "abstract": "The gradual accumulation of sensory evidence is a crucial component of perceptual decision making, but its neural mechanisms are still poorly understood. Given the wide availability of genetic and optical tools for mice, they can be useful model organisms for the study of these phenomena; however, behavioral tools are largely lacking. Here, we describe a new evidence-accumulation task for head-fixed mice navigating in a virtual reality environment. As they navigate down the stem of a virtual T-maze, they see brief pulses of visual evidence on either side, and retrieve a reward on the arm with the highest number of pulses. The pulses occur randomly with Poisson statistics, yielding a diverse yet well-controlled stimulus set, making the data conducive to a variety of computational approaches. A large number of mice of different genotypes were able to learn and consistently perform the task, at levels similar to rats in analogous tasks. They are sensitive to side differences of a single pulse, and their memory of the cues is stable over time. Moreover, using non-parametric as well as modeling approaches, we show that the mice indeed accumulate evidence: they use multiple pulses of evidence from throughout the cue region of the maze to make their decision, albeit with a small overweighting of earlier cues, and their performance is affected by the magnitude but not the duration of evidence. Additionally, analysis of the mice's running patterns revealed that trajectories are fairly stereotyped yet modulated by the amount of sensory evidence, suggesting that the navigational component of this task may provide a continuous readout correlated to the underlying cognitive variables. Our task, which can be readily integrated with state-of-the-art techniques, is thus a valuable tool to study the circuit mechanisms and dynamics underlying perceptual decision making, particularly under more complex behavioral contexts.",

The method works by pruning poorly fitting genes from estimated modules and then re-running WGCNA to refine gene clusters.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a key role in the biosynthesis of two metal cofactors, iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters and molybdenum cofactor (Moco). The two pathways intersect at several points, but a scarcity of mutants has hindered studies to better understand these links. We screened a collection of sirtinol-resistant Arabidopsis thaliana mutants for lines with decreased activities of cytosolic FeS enzymes and Moco enzymes. We identified a new mutant allele of ATM3, encoding the ATP-binding cassette Transporter of the Mitochondria 3 (systematic name ABCB25), confirming the previously reported role of ATM3 in both FeS cluster and Moco biosynthesis. We also identified a mutant allele in CNX2, Cofactor of Nitrate reductase and Xanthine dehydrogenase 2, encoding GTP 3',8-cyclase, the first step in Moco biosynthesis which is localized in the mitochondria. A single nucleotide polymorphism in cnx2-2 leads to substitution of Arg88 with Gln in the N-terminal FeS cluster-binding motif. cnx2-2 plants are small and chlorotic, with severely decreased Moco enzyme activities, but they performed better than a cnx2-1 knockout mutant, which could only survive with ammonia as nitrogen source. Measurement of cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate (cPMP) levels by LC-MS/MS showed that this Moco intermediate was below the limit of detection in both cnx2-1 and cnx2-2, and accumulated more than 10-fold in seedlings mutated in the downstream gene CNX5. Interestingly, atm3-1 mutants had less cPMP than wild type, correlating with previous reports of a similar decrease in nitrate reductase activity. Taken together, our data functionally characterise CNX2 and suggest that ATM3 is indirectly required for cPMP synthesis.",

Here, we implemented the genetically encoded ratiometric Cl- indicator Superclomeleon (SCLM) to estimate the steady-state [Cl-]i in cortical neurons from anesthetized and awake mice using 2-photon microscopy. Additionally, we implemented superecliptic pHluorin as a ratiometric sensor to estimate the intracellular steady-state pH (pHi) of mouse cortical neurons in vivo. We estimated an average resting [Cl-]i of 6 {+/-} 2 mM with no evidence of subcellular gradients in the proximal somato-dendritic domain and an average somatic pHi of 7.1 {+/-} 0.1. Neither [Cl-]i nor pHi were affected by isoflurane anesthesia. We deleted the cation-Cl- co-transporter KCC2 in single identified neurons of adult mice and found an increase of [Cl-]i to approximately 26 {+/-} 8 mM, demonstrating that under in vivo conditions KCC2 produces low [Cl-]i in adult mouse neurons. In summary, neurons of the brain of awake adult mice exhibit a low and evenly distributed [Cl-]i in the proximal somato-dendritic compartment that is independent of anesthesia and requires KCC2 expression for its maintenance.",

We now report that Gorab is present not only in the trans-Golgi but also in association with Sas6 at the core of the centriole. Flies lacking Gorab show defects in centriole duplication in many tissues and are also uncoordinated due to basal body defects in sensory cilia, which lose their 9-fold symmetry. We demonstrate the separation of centriole and Golgi functions of Drosophila Gorab in two ways: First, we have created Gorab variants that are unable to localize to trans-Golgi but can still rescue the centriole and cilia defects of gorab null flies. Secondly, we show that expression of C-terminally tagged Gorab disrupts Golgi functions in cytokinesis of male meiosis, a dominant phenotype overcome by a second mutation preventing Golgi targeting. We discuss the tissue specific requirement of Gorab for centriole duplication in the context of its split functions.",

Sequencing of sRNAs extracted from human plasma samples was performed and significant levels of non-human (exogenous) sequences were detected. The source of the most abundant of these sequences could be traced to the microRNA extraction columns by qPCR-based analysis of laboratory reagents. The presence of artefactual sequences originating from the confirmed contaminants were furthermore replicated in a range of published datasets. To avoid artefacts in future experiments, several protocols for the removal of the contaminants were elaborated, minimal amounts of starting material for artefact-free analyses were defined, and the reduction of contaminant levels for identification of bona fide sequences using  ultra-clean extraction kits was confirmed. In conclusion, this is the first report of the presence of RNA molecules as contaminants in laboratory reagents. The described protocols should be applied in the future to avoid confounding sRNA studies.",

The similarity of brain activity was estimated by voxel-wise comparison of the BOLD signal time courses. Inter-subject correlation of the time courses revealed that lipreading and listening are supported by the same brain areas in temporal, parietal and frontal cortices, precuneus and cerebellum. However, lipreading activated only a small part of the neural network that is active during listening/reading the narrative, demonstrating that neural processing during lipreading vs. listening/reading differs substantially. Importantly, skilled lipreading was specifically associated with bilateral activity in the superior and middle temporal cortex, which also encode auditory speech.

By adjusting individual expression levels and strengths of molecular relationships, users can predict effects on the cell cycle.

    "abstract": "Supergenes are groups of tightly linked loci whose variation is inherited as a single Mendelian locus and are a common genetic architecture for complex traits under balancing selection1. Supergene alleles are long-range haplotypes with numerous mutations underlying distinct adaptive strategies, often maintained in linkage disequilibrium through the suppression of recombination by chromosomal rearrangements2-5. However, the mechanism governing the formation of supergenes is not well understood, and poses the paradox of establishing divergent functional haplotypes in face of recombination1,6. Here, we show that the formation of the supergene alleles encoding mimicry polymorphism in the butterfly Heliconius numata is associated with the introgression of a divergent, inverted chromosomal segment. Haplotype divergence and linkage disequilibrium indicate that supergene alleles, each allowing precise wing-pattern resemblance to distinct butterfly models, originate from over a million years of independent chromosomal evolution in separate lineages. These \\\"superalleles\\\" have evolved from a chromosomal inversion captured by introgression and maintained in balanced polymorphism, triggering supergene inheritance. This mode of evolution is likely to be a common feature of complex structural polymorphisms associated with the coexistence of distinct adaptive syndromes, and shows that the reticulation of genealogies may have a powerful influence on the evolution of genetic architectures in nature.",

    "abstract": "Multiple species within the basidiomycete genus, Cryptococcus, cause cryptococcal disease. These species are estimated to affect nearly a quarter of a million people leading to approximately 180,000 mortalities, annually. Sexual repro-duction, which can occur between haploid yeasts of the same or opposite mating type, is a potentially important contributor to pathogenesis as recombination can generate novel genotypes and transgressive phenotypes. However, our quantitative understanding of recombination in this clinically important yeast is limited. Here we describe genome-wide estimates of recombination rates in Cryptococcus deneoformans and compare recombination between progeny from - unisexual and a- bisexual crosses. We find that offspring from bisexual crosses have modestly higher average rates of recombination than those derived from unisexual crosses. Recombination hot and cold spots across the C. deneoformans genome are also identified and are associated with increased GC content. Finally, we observed regions genome-wide with allele frequencies deviating from the expected parental ratio. These findings and observations advance our quantitative understanding of the genetic events that occur during sexual reproduction in C. deneoformans, and the impact that different forms of sexual reproduction are likely to have on genetic diversity in this important fungal pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Interactions and emergent processes are essential for research on complex systems involving many components. Most studies focus solely on pairwise interactions and ignore higher-order interactions among three or more components. To gain deeper insights into higher-order interactions and complex environments, we study antibiotic combinations applied to pathogenic Escherichia coli and obtain unprecedented amounts of detailed data (251 two-drug combinations, 1512 three-drug combinations, 5670 four-drug combinations, and 13608 five-drug combinations). Directly opposite to previous assumptions and reports, we find higher-order interactions increase in frequency with the number of drugs in the bacterias environment. Furthermore, we observe a shift towards net synergy (effect greater than expected based on independent individual effects) and towards emergent antagonism (effect less than expected based on lower-order interaction effects). These findings have implications for the potential efficacy of drug combinations and are crucial for better navigating problems associated with the combinatorial complexity of multi-component systems.",
