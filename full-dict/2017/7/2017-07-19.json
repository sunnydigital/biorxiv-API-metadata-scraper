    "abstract": "Work on genetic model systems such as Drosophila and mouse has shown that the fundamental mechanisms of myogenesis are remarkably similar in vertebrates and invertebrates. Strikingly, however, satellite cells, the adult muscle stem cells that are essential for the regeneration of damaged muscles in vertebrates, have not been reported in invertebrates. In this study we show role of Muscle stem cells (Gunage et al., 2014) identified in a previous study, in muscle regeneration. We show that muscle stem cells lineal descendants are present in adult muscle as small, unfused cells located superficially and in close proximity to the mature muscle fibers. Normally quiescent cells, following muscle fiber injury become mitotically active, engage in Notch-Delta signaling-dependent proliferative activity and generate lineal descendant populations, which fuse with the injured muscle fiber. In view of their strikingly similar morphological and functional features, we consider these novel cells to be Drosophila muscle satellite cells",

    "abstract": "LONG ABSTRACTHuman perceptual decisions are often described as optimal. This view reflects recent successes of Bayesian approaches to both cognition and perception. However, claims regarding optimality have been strongly criticized for their excessive flexibility and lack of explanatory power. Rebuttals from Bayesian theorists in turn claim that critics unfairly pick on select few papers. To resolve the issue regarding the role of optimality in perceptual decision making, we review the vast literature on suboptimal performance in perceptual tasks. Specifically, we discuss eight different classes of suboptimal perceptual decisions, including improper placement, maintenance, and adjustment of perceptual criteria, inadequate tradeoff between speed and accuracy, inappropriate confidence ratings, misweightings in cue combination, and findings related to various perceptual illusions and biases. We then extract the proposed explanations for the suboptimal behavior seen in each type of task. Critically, we show that these explanations naturally fit within an overarching Bayesian framework. Specifically, each suboptimality can be explained by alternative likelihood functions, priors, cost functions, or decision rules (LPCDs). We argue that unless the observers likelihood functions, priors, and cost functions are known, statements about the optimality or suboptimality of decision rules are meaningless. Further, the very definition of optimal behavior is debatable and may ultimately require appeals to evolutionary history beyond the current scope of perceptual science. The field should therefore shift its focus away from optimality. We propose a \\\"LPCD approach\\\" to perceptual decision making that focuses exclusively on uncovering the LPCD components, without debating whether the uncovered LPCDs are \\\"optimal\\\" or not.\\n\\nSHORT ABSTRACTHuman perceptual decisions are often described as optimal, but this view remains controversial.

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that neural activity in sensory cortices is remarkably variable over time and across trials even when subjects are presented with an identical repeating stimulus or task. This trial-by-trial neural variability is relatively large in the pre-stimulus period and considerably smaller (quenched) following stimulus presentation. Previous studies have suggested that the magnitude of neural variability affects behavior such that perceptual performance is better on trials and in individuals where variability quenching is larger. To what degree are neural variability magnitudes of individual subjects flexible or static? Here, we used EEG recordings from adult humans to demonstrate that neural variability magnitudes in visual cortex are remarkably consistent across different tasks and recording sessions. While magnitudes of neural variability differed dramatically across individual subjects, they were surprisingly stable across four tasks with different stimuli, temporal structures, and attentional/cognitive demands as well as across experimental sessions separated by one year. These experiments reveal that, in adults, neural variability magnitudes are mostly solidified individual characteristics that change little with task or time, and are likely to predispose individual subjects to exhibit distinct behavioral capabilities.\\n\\nSignificance statementBrain activity varies dramatically from one moment to the next. Recent research has revealed that humans exhibit different magnitudes of trial-by-trial neural variability, which explain differences in their perceptual performance.

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites are protists of the genus Plasmodium, whose transmission to mosquitoes is initiated by the production of gametes. Male gametogenesis is an extremely rapid process that is tightly controlled to produce eight flagellated microgametes from a single haploid gametocyte within 10 minutes after ingestion by a mosquito. Regulation of the cell cycle is poorly understood in divergent eukaryotes like Plasmodium, where the highly synchronous response of gametocytes to defined chemical and physical stimuli from the mosquito has proved to be a powerful model to identify specific phosphorylation events critical for cell-cycle progression. To reveal the wider network of phosphorylation signalling in a systematic and unbiased manner, we have measured a high-resolution time course of the phosphoproteome of P. berghei gametocytes during the first minute of gametogenesis. The data show an extremely broad response in which distinct cell-cycle events such as initiation of DNA replication and mitosis are rapidly induced and simultaneously regulated. We identify several protein kinases and phosphatases that are likely central in the gametogenesis signalling pathway and validate our analysis by investigating the phosphoproteomes of mutants in two of them, CDPK4 and SRPK1. We show these protein kinases to have distinct influences over the phosphorylation of similar downstream targets that are consistent with their distinct cellular functions, which is revealed by a detailed phenotypic analysis of an SRPK1 mutant. Together, the results show that key cell-cycle systems in Plasmodium undergo simultaneous and rapid phosphoregulation. We demonstrate how a highly resolved time-course of dynamic phosphorylation events can generate deep insights into the unusual cell biology of a divergent eukaryote, which serves as a model for an important group of human pathogens.",

The LEDs closely match the excitation peaks of bound and free Fura-2 and enables the precise detection of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which is only limited by the Ca2+ response of Fura-2. Using this illuminator, we have shown that Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) concentrations as low as 250 nM can be used to detect induced Ca2+ events in tsA-201 cells and while utilizing the 150 s switching speeds available, it was possible to image spontaneous Ca2+ transients in hippocampal neurons at a rate of 24.39 Hz that were blunted or absent at typical 0.5 Hz acquisition rates.

    "abstract": "Genome wide association studies (GWAS) rely on microarrays, or more recently mapping of whole-genome sequencing reads, to genotype individuals. The reliance on prior sequencing of a reference genome for the organism on which the association study is to be performed limits the scope of association studies, and also precludes the identification of differences between cases and controls outside of the reference. We present an alignment free method for association studies that is based on counting k-mers in sequencing reads, testing for associations directly between k-mers and the trait of interest, and local assembly of the statistically significant k-mers to identify sequence differences. Results with simulated data and an analysis of the 1000 genomes data provide a proof of principle for the approach. In a pairwise comparison of the Toscani in Italia (TSI) and the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) populations we find that sequences identified by our method largely agree with results obtained using standard GWAS based on variant calling from mapped reads. However unlike standard GWAS, we find that our method identifies associations with structural variations and sites not present in the reference genome revealing sequences absent from the human reference genome. We also analyze data from the Bengali from Bangladesh (BEB) population to explore possible genetic basis of high rate of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among South Asians and find significant differences in frequencies of a number of non-synonymous variants in genes linked to CVDs between BEB and TSI samples, including the site rs1042034, which has been associated with higher risk of CVDs previously, and the nearby rs676210 in the Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) gene.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe present a method for associating regions in genomes to traits or diseases. The method is based on finding differences in frequencies of short strings of letters in sequencing reads and do not require reads to be aligned to a reference genome. This makes it applicable to study of organisms with no or incomplete reference genomes. We test our method with simulated data and sequencing data from the 1000 genomes project and find agreement with the conventional approach based on alignment to a reference genome. In addition, our method finds associations with sequences not in reference genomes and reveals sequences missing from the human reference genome. We also explore high rates of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases among South Asians and find prevalence of variations in genes associated with heart diseases in samples from the Bengali from Bangladesh population including one that has been reported to be associated with early onset of cardiovascular diseases.",

Wild-type Canton-S adult flies walked in one direction, counter-clockwise or clockwise, for minutes, whereas white-eyed mutant w1118 changed directions frequently. Locomotion in the circular arena could be classified into four components: counter-clockwise walking, clockwise walking, nondirectional walking and pausing. Genetic analysis revealed that while wild-type genetic background was associated with reduced directional change and reduced numbers of one-way (including counterclockwise and clockwise) and nondirectional walks, the white (w+) locus promoted persistent oneway walking by increasing the maximal duration of one-way episodes. The promoting effect of w+ was further supported by the observations that (1) w+ duplicated to the Y chromosome, (2) four genomic copies of mini-white inserted on the autosomes, and (3) pan-neuronal overexpression of the White protein increased the maximal duration of one-way episodes, and that RNAi knockdown of w+ in the neurons decreased the maximal duration of one-way episodes. These results suggested a pleiotropic function of w+ in promoting persistent one-way walking in the circular arena.",

    "abstract": "A key limitation for achieving deep imaging in biological structures lies in photon absorption and scattering leading to attenuation of fluorescence. In particular, neurotransmitter imaging is challenging in the biologically-relevant context of the intact brain, for which photons must traverse the cranium, skin and bone. Thus, fluorescence imaging is limited to the surface cortical layers of the brain, only achievable with craniotomy. Herein, we describe optimal excitation and emission wavelengths for through-cranium imaging, and demonstrate that near-infrared emissive nanosensors can be photoexcited using a two-photon 1560 nm excitation source. Dopamine-sensitive nanosensors can undergo two-photon excitation, and provide chirality-dependent responses selective for dopamine with fluorescent turn-on responses varying between 20% and 350%. We further calculate the two-photon absorption cross-section and quantum yield of dopamine nanosensors, and confirm a two-photon power law relationship for the nanosensor excitation process. Finally, we show improved image quality of the nanosensors embedded 2 mm deep into a brain-mimetic tissue phantom, whereby one-photon excitation yields 42% scattering, in contrast to 4% scattering when the same object is imaged under two-photon excitation. Our approach overcomes traditional limitations in deep-tissue fluorescence microscopy, and can enable neurotransmitter imaging in the biologically-relevant milieu of the intact and living brain.",

    "abstract": "During lytic Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, the viral endonu-clease SOX promotes widespread degradation of cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA). However, select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), escape SOX-induced cleavage. IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3 UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins. However, the overall composition of their ribonucleoprotein complexes appears distinct, leading to differences in the breadth of nucleases restricted. These findings highlight how RNA elements can selectively control transcript abundance in the background of widespread virus-induced mRNA degradation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe ability of viruses to control the host gene expression environment is crucial to promote viral infection. Many viruses express factors that reduce host gene expression through widespread mRNA decay. However, some mRNAs escape this fate, like the transcript encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-6 during KSHV infection. IL-6 escape relies on an RNA regulatory element located in its 3UTR and involves the recruitment of a protective protein complex. Here, we show that this escape extends beyond KSHV to a variety of related and unrelated viral endonucleases. However, the IL-6 element does not protect against cellular endonucleases, revealing for the first time a virus-specific nuclease escape element. We identified a related escape element in the GADD45B mRNA, which displays several similarities with the IL-6 element. However, these elements assemble a largely distinct complex of proteins, leading to differences in the breadth of their protective capacity. Collectively, these findings reveal how a putative new class of RNA elements function to control RNA fate in the background of widespread mRNA degradation by viral endonucleases.",

    "abstract": "One approach to the reconstruction of infectious disease transmission trees from pathogen genomic data has been to use a phylogenetic tree, reconstructed from pathogen sequences, and annotate its internal nodes to provide a reconstruction of which host each lineage was in at each point in time. If only one pathogen lineage can be transmitted to a new host (i.e. the transmission bottleneck is complete), this corresponds to partitioning the nodes of the phylogeny into connected regions, each of which represents evolution in an individual host. These partitions define the possible transmission trees that are consistent with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the mathematical properties of the transmission trees given a phylogeny remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe a procedure to calculate the number of possible transmission trees for a given phylogeny, and we show how to uniformly sample from these transmission trees. The procedure is outlined for situations where one sample is available from each host and trees do not have branch lengths, and we also provide extensions for incomplete sampling, multiple sampling, and the application to time trees in a situation where limits on the period during which each host could have been infected are known. The sampling algorithm is available as an R package (STraTUS).",

    "abstract": "Genome expansion is believed to be an important driver of the evolution of gene regulation. To investigate the role of newly arising sequence in rewiring the regulatory network we estimated the age of each region of the human genome by applying maximum parsimony to genome-wide alignments with 100 vertebrates. We then studied the age distribution of several types of functional regions, with a focus on regulatory elements. The age distribution of regulatory elements reveals the extensive use of newly formed genomic sequence in the evolution of regulatory interactions. Many transcription factors have expanded their repertoire of targets through waves of genomic expansions that can be traced to specific evolutionary times. Repeated elements contributed a major part of such expansion: many classes of such elements are enriched in binding sites of one or a few specific transcription factors, whose binding sites are localized in specific portions of the element and characterized by distinctive motif words. These features suggest that the binding sites were available as soon as the new sequence entered the genome, rather than being created later by accumulation of point mutations. By comparing the age of regulatory regions to the evolutionary shift in expression of nearby genes we show that rewiring through genome expansion played an important role in shaping the human regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "How individuals move through their environment dictates which other individuals they encounter, determining their social and reproductive interactions and the extent to which they experience sexual selection. Specifically, females rarely have the option of mating with all males in a population--they can only choose among the males they encounter. Further, quantifying phenotypic differences between the males that females encounter and those that sire females offspring lends insight into how social and reproductive interactions shape male phenotypes. We used an explicitly spatiotemporal Markov chain model to estimate the number of potential mates of Anolis sagrei lizards from their movement behavior, and used genetic paternity assignments to quantify sexual selection on males. Females frequently encountered and mated with multiple males, offering ample opportunity for female mate choice. Sexual selection favored males that were bigger and moved over larger areas, though the effect of body size cannot be disentangled from last-male precedence. Our approach corroborates some patterns of sexual selection previously hypothesized in anoles based on describing them as territorial, whereas other results, including female multiple mating itself, are at odds with territorial polygyny, offering insight into discrepancies in other taxa between behavioral and genetic descriptions of mating systems.",

    "abstract": "mRNA translation is an energetically costly activity required for almost all biological processes. The multiprotein complex eIF4F, which bridges the 5 cap and the polyA tail through eIF4E and eIF4G, respectively, is necessary for efficient translation initiation of most mRNAs and is an important target of translational control. Previous work suggests that cap-proximal nucleotides can modulate eIF4E binding to mRNAs, but the effect of specific cap-proximal nucleotide sequences on eIF4E recruitment and the ultimate consequences for translation remain unknown. Using RNA Bind-n-Seq on a model 5 UTR, we systematically identify eIF4E-intrinsic cap-proximal nucleotide binding preferences. mRNAs with highly-bound motifs are translated well in a cell-free system, whereas those with low-eIF4E-binding motifs are not. However, eIF4E juxtacap motif preferences do not dictate the ribosome occupancy of endogenous mRNAs in cells, suggesting that the effect of juxtacap sequence on eIF4E binding and translation is mRNA-context-dependent. Accordingly, a single downstream point mutation that disrupts a predicted base pair with a preferred juxtacap nucleotide increases translation. The juxtacap sequence is a previously unappreciated determinant of eIF4E recruitment to mRNAs, and we propose that differences in mRNA 5 end accessibility defined by the juxtacap sequence are important for establishing translational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "When Drosophila flies feed on Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14, some bacteria cross the intestinal barrier and start proliferating inside the hemocoel. This process is limited by hemocytes through phagocytosis. We have previously shown that the PA14 quorum-sensing regulator RhlR is required for these bacteria to elude the cellular immune response. RhlI synthesizes the auto-inducer signal that activates RhlR. Here, we compare the null mutant phenotypes of rhlR and rhlI in a variety of infection assays in Drosophila and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Surprisingly, in Drosophila, unlike{Delta} rhlR mutants,{Delta} rhlI mutants are only modestly attenuated for virulence and are poorly phagocytosed and opsonized in a Thioester-containing Protein4-dependent manner. Likewise, {Delta}rhlI but not {Delta}rhlR mutants colonize the digestive tract of C. elegans and kill it as efficiently as wild-type PA14. Thus, RhlR has an RhlI-independent function in eluding detection or counter-acting the action of the immune system. In contrast to the intestinal infection model, Tep4 mutant flies are more resistant to PA14 in a septic injury model, which also depends on rhlR. Thus, the Tep4 putative opsonin can either be protective or detrimental to host defense depending on the infection route.",

    "abstract": "Measurements for protein half-lives in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reported large discrepancies, with median values between minutes to several hours. We present a unifying analysis that provides a consistent half-life estimate, based on our re-analysis of three published and one new dataset of cells grown under similar conditions. We found that degradation of many proteins can be approximated by exponential decay. Protein disappearance was primarily driven by dilution due to cell division, with cell doubling times ranging from [~]2 to 3.5 hours across the four experiments. After adjusting for doubling time, protein half-lives increased to median values between [~]7.5 to [~]40 hours. Half-lives correlated with cell doubling time even after adjustment, implying that slow growth also slows protein degradation. All estimates were validated by multiple means and were robust to different analysis methods. Overall, protein stability correlated with abundance and showed weak enrichment for degradation signals such as degrons and disordered regions. Long-lived proteins often functioned in oxidation-reduction and amino acid synthesis. Short-lived proteins often functioned in ribosome biogenesis. Despite some overall differences in behavior, all methods were able to resolve subtle difference in half-lives of ribosomal proteins, e.g. the short lifespan of RPL10. Finally, our results help the design of future experiments: time series measurements need to cover at least two to three cell doubling times for accurate estimates, exponential decay provides a reasonable proxy for protein stability, and it can be sufficiently estimated with four measurement points.",

Flower petal surfaces are an attractive tissue to use for investigation of the dispersal of environmental DNA in nature as they are isolated from the external environment until the bud opens and only then can the petal surface accumulate environmental DNA. Here, we performed a crowdsourced experiment, the \\\"Ohanami Project\\\", to obtain environmental DNA samples from petal surfaces of Cerasus x yedoensis  Somei-yoshino across the Japanese archipelago during spring 2015. C. x yedoensis is the most popular garden cherry species in Japan and clones of this cultivar bloom simultaneously every spring. Data collection spanned almost every prefecture and totaled 577 DNA samples from 149 collaborators. Preliminary amplicon-sequencing analysis showed the rapid attachment of environmental DNA onto the petal surfaces. Notably, we found DNA of other common plant species in samples obtained across a wide distribution; this DNA likely originated from pollen of the Japanese cedar. Our analysis supports our belief that petal surfaces after blossoming are a promising target to reveal the dynamics of environmental DNA in nature. The success of our experiment also shows that crowdsourced environmental DNA analyses have considerable value in ecological studies.",

    "abstract": "LINE-1 mobile genetic elements have shaped the mammalian genome during evolution. A minority of them have escaped fossilization which, when activated, can threaten genome integrity. We report that LINE-1 are expressed in substantia nigra ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons, a class of neurons that degenerate in Parkinson disease. In Engrailed-1 heterozygotes, these neurons show a progressive degeneration that starts at 6 weeks of age, coinciding with an increase in LINE-1 expression. Similarly, DNA damage and cell death, induced by an acute oxidative stress applied to embryonic midbrain neurons in culture or to adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons in vivo, are accompanied by enhanced LINE-1 expression. Reduction of LINE-1 activity through (i) direct transcriptional repression by Engrailed, (ii) a siRNA directed against LINE-1, (iii) the nucleoside-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor stavudine and (iv) viral Piwil1 expression, protects against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. We thus propose that LINE-1 overexpression triggers oxidative stress-induced DNA strand breaks and that an Engrailed adult function is to protect mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons through the repression of LINE-1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Determining whether convergent novelties share a common genetic basis is vital to understanding the extent to which evolution is predictable. The convergent evolution of innovative anal fin pigmentation patterns in cichlid fishes is an ideal model for studying this question. Here, we focused on two patterns: 1) egg-spots, circular pigmentation patterns with different numbers, sizes and positions; and 2) the blotch, irregular pattern with no variation among species. How these two novelties originate and evolve remains unclear. Based on a thorough comparative transcriptomic and genomic analysis, we observed a common genetic basis with high evolutionary rates and similar expression levels between egg-spots and the blotch. Furthermore, associations of common genes with transcription factors and signalling pathways in the core gene network, as well as the integration of advantageous genes were observed for egg-spots. We propose that the re-use of the common genetic basis indicates important conservative functions (e.g., toolkit genes) for the origin of these convergent novel phenotypes, whereas independently evolved associations of common genes with transcription factors and signalling pathways (intrinsic factor) can free the evolution of egg-spots, and together with the integration of advantageous genes (extrinsic factor) can provide a clue to link egg-spots as a key innovation to the adaptive radiation in cichlid fishes. This hypothesis will further illuminate the mechanism of the origin and evolution of novelties in a broad sense.",

    "abstract": "Judgments of the present visual world are affected by what came before. When judgments of visual properties such as orientation are biased in the direction of preceding stimuli, this is called visual serial dependence. Visual serial dependence is thought to arise from mechanisms that support perceptual continuity: because physical properties of an object usually vary smoothly in time, perception might be accurately stabilized by smoothing the perceived features in time. However, mechanisms that support perceptual continuity should be object-specific, because the orientation of one object is more related to its own past than to the past of a distinct object. Thus, we tested the perceptual continuity explanation by comparing the magnitude of serial dependence between objects and within objects. Across three experiments, we manipulated objecthood by varying the color, the location, and both the color and the location of Gabor patches. We observed a serial dependence effect in every experiment but did not observe an effect of objecthood in any experiment. We further observed serial dependence even when the orientations of two successive stimuli were nearly orthogonal. These data are inconsistent with explanations of serial dependence based on visual continuity. We hypothesize that serial dependence arises from a combination of perceptual features and internal response variables, which interact within a common task or decisional context.",

    "abstract": "The neural mechanisms underlying time perception are of vital importance to a comprehensive understanding of behavior and cognition. Recent work has pointed to a supramodal role for beta oscillations in coordinating endogenous timing mechanisms for the purpose of measuring temporal intervals. However, the majority of this work has employed paradigms relying on timed motor responses, which are confounded by betas established role in motor movement. Further, no study to date has tested if the alteration of beta oscillations subsequently impacts timing. Here, we address these concerns and demonstrate for the first time a causal connection between beta oscillations and timing. To accomplish this, we first re-analyzed two, separate EEG datasets from psychophysical experiments (Wiener, et al. 2012; 2015) demonstrating that beta oscillations are associated with the retention and comparison of a memory standard for duration, and that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right supramarginal gyrus leads to an increase in midline beta power during the encoding of a temporal interval, corresponding with a longer perceived interval of time. Next, we conducted a study of 20 healthy human participants using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), over frontocentral cortex, at alpha (10Hz) and beta (20Hz) frequencies, during a visual temporal bisection task, demonstrating that beta stimulation exclusively shifts the perception of time such that stimuli are reported as longer in length, while preserving precision. Finally, we decomposed trial-by-trial choice data with a drift diffusion model of decision making and temporal encoding that reveals the shift in timing is caused by a change in the starting point of accumulation, rather than the drift rate or threshold. Our results provide causal evidence of betas involvement in the perception of time, and point to a specific role for beta oscillations in the encoding and retention of memory for temporal intervals.",

It couples NADH oxidation by ubiquinone to proton transport across the energy-conserving inner membrane, catalyzing respiration and driving ATP synthesis. In the absence of substrates,  active complex I gradually enters a pronounced resting or  deactive state. The active-deactive transition occurs during ischemia and is crucial for controlling how respiration recovers upon reperfusion. Here, we set a highly-active preparation of Bos taurus complex I into the biochemically-defined deactive state, and used single-particle electron cryomicroscopy to determine its structure to 4.1 [A] resolution. The deactive state arises when critical structural elements that form the ubiquinone-binding site become disordered, and we propose reactivation is induced when substrate binding templates their reordering. Our structure both rationalizes biochemical data on the deactive state, and offers new insights into its physiological and cellular roles.",

In this study we used the combination of an advanced intercross between wild and domestic chickens with a combined QTL and eQTL genetical genomics approach to identify genes for social reinstatement (SR) behaviour. A total of 24 SR QTL were identified and overlaid with over 600 eQTL obtained from the same birds using hypothalamus tissue. Correlations between overlapping QTL and eQTL indicated 5 strong candidate genes, with the gene TTRAP being strongly significantly correlated with multiple aspects of SR behaviour, as well as possessing a highly significant eQTL. The distribution of eQTL can also indicate the genetic mechanisms underlying domestication itself. Multiple eQTL were found to in discrete clusters, however tests for pleiotropy show that these blocks were primarily linked in origin. This suggests that clustered genetic modules, rather than pure pleiotropy (as hypothesised by the neural crest theory) appears to be driving domestication in the chicken.",

However, TSS profiling has not been investigated in an orthogonal in vivo setting. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset that links TSS dynamics with nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in the wandering third instar larva, a developmental stage characterized by large-scale shifts in transcriptional programs in preparation for metamorphosis.\\n\\nResultsThe data recapitulate major regulatory classes of TSSs, based on peak width, promoter-proximal polymerase pausing, and cis-regulatory element density. We confirm the paucity of divergent transcription units in D. melanogaster, but also identify notable exceptions. Furthermore, we identify thousands of novel initiation events occurring at unannotated TSSs that can be classified into functional categories by their local density of histone modifications. Interestingly, a sub-class of these unannotated TSSs overlaps with functionally validated enhancer elements, consistent with a regulatory role for \\\"enhancer RNAs\\\" (eRNAs) in defining transcriptional programs that are important for animal development.\\n\\nConclusionsHigh-depth TSS mapping is a powerful strategy for identifying and characterizing low-abundance and/or low-stability RNAs. Global analysis of transcription initiation patterns in a developing organism reveals a vast number of novel initiation events that identify potential eRNAs as well as other non-coding transcripts critical for animal development.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian inactive X chromosome (Xi) condenses into a bipartite structure with two superdomains of frequent long-range contacts separated by a boundary or hinge region. Using in situ DNase Hi-C in mouse cells with deletions or inversions within the hinge we show that the conserved repeat locus Dxz4 alone is sufficient to maintain the bipartite structure and that Dxz4 orientation controls the distribution of long-range contacts on the Xi. Frequent long-range contacts between Dxz4 and the telomeric superdomain are either lost after its deletion or shifted to the centromeric superdomain after its inversion. This massive reversal in contact distribution is consistent with the reversal of CTCF motif orientation at Dxz4. De-condensation of the Xi after Dxz4 deletion is associated with partial restoration of TADs normally attenuated on the Xi. There is also an increase in chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding on the Xi after Dxz4 deletion or inversion, but few changes in gene expression, in accordance with multiple epigenetic mechanisms ensuring X silencing. We propose that Dxz4 represents a structural platform for frequent long-range contacts with multiple loci in a direction dictated by the orientation of a bank of CTCF motifs at Dxz4, which may work as a ratchet to form the distinctive bipartite structure of the condensed Xi.",

The root microbiota was found to be highly dynamic during the vegetative phase of plant growth, then stabilizes compositionally for the remainder of the life cycle. Bacterial taxa conserved between field sites can be used as predictive features of rice plant age by modeling using a random forests approach. The age-prediction models were used to reveal that drought stressed plants have developmentally delayed microbiota compared to unstressed plants. Further, by using genotypes with varying developmental rates, we show that shifts in the microbiome are correlated with rates of developmental transitions rather than age alone, such that different microbiota compositions reflect juvenile and adult life stages.

It is important to accurately construct the microcapsule membranes with desired properties including a certain thickness suitable for cell growth, and maximum strength for the stability of microencapsules. As single factor experiments are time-consuming to obtain the desired membrane preparation conditions, Box-Behnken model was used to investigate the interactions among reaction conditions, predict the optimized reaction conditions for given purpose, that was membrane with maximum strength and desired thickness for microencapsulated cell culture. Significant values of R2 in this study indicated the model theoretical values are very close to the measured values. Based on the desired membrane thickness, the process of maximum strength was optimized, and the prediction agreement of measured value and model theoretical value was 91.11%. The optimized microencapsules with maximum strength and 15 m membrane thickness promote CHO cells viability and protein production in stirred tank bioreactor.

    "abstract": "We extend classical tumor regression models, such as the Norton-Simon hypothesis, from instantaneous regression rates (i.e. the derivative) to the cumulative effect (i.e. the integral) over one (or many) cycles of chemotherapy. To achieve this end, we use a stochastic Moran process model of tumor cell kinetics, coupled with a prisoners dilemma game-theoretic cell-cell interaction model to design chemotherapeutic strategies tailored to different tumor growth characteristics. Using the Shannon entropy as a novel tool to quantify the success of dosing strategies, we contrast maximum tolerated dose (MTD) strategies as compared with low dose, high density metronomic strategies (LDM) for tumors with different growth rates. Our results show that LDM strategies can outperform MTD strategies in total tumor cell reduction (TCR). The advantage is magnified for fast growing tumors that thrive on long periods of unhindered growth without chemotherapy drugs present and is not evident after a single cycle of chemotherapy, but grows after each subsequent cycle of repeated chemotherapy. The model supports the concept of designing different chemotherapeutic schedules for tumors with different growth rates and develops quantitative tools to optimize these schedules for maintaining low volume tumors. The evolutionary model we introduce in this paper is compared with regression data from murine models and shown to be in good agreement.\\n\\nMajor FindingsModel simulations show that metronomic (low dose, high density) therapies can outperform maximum tolerated dose (high dose, low density) therapies. This is due to the fact that tumor cell reduction is more sensitive to changes in dose density than changes in dose concentration, especially for faster growing tumors. This effect is negligible after a single cycle of chemotherapy, but magnified after many cycles. The model also allows for novel chemotherapeutic schedules and quantifies their performance according to tumor growth rate.",

    "abstract": "Diel migrations (DMs) undertaken by prey to avoid visual predators during the day have been demonstrated in many taxa in aquatic ecosystems. We reveal that zebras in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe) employ a similar anti-predator strategy. Zebras forage near waterholes during the day but move away from them at sunset. We demonstrate that this DM, occurring over a few km, dramatically reduces their night-time risk of encountering lions, which generally remain close to waterholes. By contrast, zebra changes in night-time selection for vegetation types marginally reduced their risk of encountering lions. This may arise from a trade-off between encounter risk and vulnerability across vegetation types, with zebras favouring low vulnerability once DM has reduced encounter risk. In summary, here we (1) quantify the effect of a predator-induced DM in a terrestrial system on the likelihood of encountering a predator, (2) distinguish the effects of the DM from those related to day/night changes in selection for vegetation types. We discuss how revealing how prey partition their risk between predator encounter risk and habitat-driven vulnerability is likely critical to understand the emergence of anti-predator behavioural strategies.",

    "abstract": "The discrete space, continuous time birth-death model is a key process for describing phylogenies in the absence of coalescent approximations. Extensively used in macroevolution for analysing diversification, and in epidemiology for estimating viral dynamics, the birth-death process (BDP) is an important null model for inferring the parameters of reconstructed phylogenies. In this paper we show how optimal, point process (Snyder) filtering techniques can be used for parametric inference on BDPs. Specifically, we introduce the Bayesian Snyder filter (SF) to estimate birth and death rate parameters, given a reconstructed phylogeny. Our estimation procedure makes use of the equivalent Markov birth process description for a reconstructed birth-death phylogeny (Nee et al, 1994). We first analyse the popular constant rate BDP and show that our method gives results consistent with previous work. Among these results is an analytic solution to the special case of the Yule-Furry model. We also find an equivalence between the SF Poisson likelihood and two standard conditioned birth-death model likelihoods. We then generalise our estimation problem to BDPs with time varying rates and numerically solve the SF for two illustrative cases. Our results compare well with a recent Markov chain Monte Carlo method by Hohna et al (2016) and we numericaly show that both methods are solving the same likelihood functions. Lastly we apply the SF to a model selection problem on empirical data. We use the Australian Agamid dataset and predict the same relative model fit as that of the original maximum likelihood technique developed and used by Rabosky (2006) for this dataset. While several capable parametric and non-parametric birth-death estimators already exist, ours is the first to take the Nee et al approach, and directly computes the posterior distribution of the parameters. The SF makes no approximations, beyond those required for parameter space discretisation and numerical integration, and is mean square error optimal. It is deterministic, easily implementable and flexible. We think SFs present a promising alternative parametric BDP inference engine.",

Previous laboratory research supports two hypotheses regarding the effects of pesticides on interactions between amphibians and the predominately aquatic fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd): 1) pesticides can be directly toxic to Bd reducing infection risk of aquatic larval amphibians, and 2) exposure to pesticides at formative stages of amphibian development can have long-term consequences on defenses, increasing disease risk after metamorphosis. It remains equivocal whether these laboratory patterns are consistent across amphibian species and occur in the field across broad spatial scales. The aim of this research is to address this research gap on the impact of pesticides on Bd distributions.\\n\\nLocationContiguous United States.\\n\\nTime Period1998-2009.\\n\\nMajor Taxa StudiedAmphibian hosts and Bd.\\n\\nMethodsOur data included 3,946 individuals evaluated for Bd infection across 49 amphibian species, at 126 locations, which resulted in 199 estimates of Bd prevalence in populations.

Our current understanding of how organisms adapt to unpredictably fluctuating environments is almost entirely based on studies that investigate fluctuations among different values of a single environmental stressor like temperature or pH. However, in nature multiple stresses often exist simultaneously. How would unpredictability in environmental fluctuations affect adaptation under such a scenario? To answer this question, we subjected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli to selection over ~260 generations. The populations faced predictable and unpredictable environmental fluctuations across qualitatively different selection environments, namely, salt and acidic pH. We show that predictability of environmental fluctuations does not play a role in determining the extent of adaptation. Interestingly, the extent of ancestral adaptation, to the chosen selection environments, is of key importance. Integrating the insights from two previous studies, our results suggest that it is the simultaneous presence of multiple environmental factors that poses a bigger constraint on extent of adaptation, rather than unpredictability of the fluctuations.",

They demonstrate their approach by producing two independent GPSs for Educational Attainment (\\\"multiple indicators\\\") in a prediction sample (Health and Retirement Study; HRS) from independent sets of SNP regression weights, each computed from a different half of the discovery sample (EA2; Okbay et al. 2016), i.e. \\\"by randomly splitting the GWAS sample that was used for [the GPS] construction.\\\"\\n\\nHere, I elucidate how a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework that specifies true score variance in GPSs as a latent variable can be used to derive an equivalent correction to the IV approach proposed by DiPrete et al. (2017). This approach, which is rooted in a psychometric modeling tradition, has a number of advantages: (1) it formalizes the assumed data-generating model, (2) it estimates all parameters of interest in a single step, (3) is can be flexibly incorporated into a larger multivariate analysis (such as the \\\"Genetic Instrumental Variable\\\" approach proposed by DiPrete et al., 2017), (4) it can easily be adapted to relax assumptions (e.g. that the GPS indicators equally represent the true genetic factor score), and (5) it can easily be extended to include more than two GPS indicators. After describing how the multiple indicator approach to GPS correction can specified as a structural equation model, I demonstrate how a structural equation modeling approach can be used to correct GPSs for error using SNP heritability obtained using GREML or LD score regression to produce a correction that is equivalent to an approach recently proposed by Daniel Benjamin and colleagues. Finally, I briefly discuss what I view as some conceptual limitations surrounding the error correction approaches described, regardless of the estimation method implemented.",

    "abstract": "RNA transcripts circulating in peripheral blood represent an important source of non-invasive biomarkers. To accurately quantify the levels of a circulating transcript, one needs to normalize the data with internal control reference genes, which are detected at relatively constant levels across different blood samples. A few stably-expressed reference gene candidates have to be selected from transcriptome data before validation of their stable expression by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. However, there is a lack of transcriptome, let alone whole-transcriptome, data from maternal blood. To overcome this shortfall, we performed RNA-seq on blood samples from women presented with preterm labor. Of 11215 exons detected in the maternal blood whole-transcriptome, we systematically identified a panel of 395 genes comprising exons that were detected at a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 7.75%-17.7%. Their levels were considerably less variable than any GAPDH exon (minimum CV, 27.3%). Upon validation, selected genes from this panel remained as more stably expressed than GAPDH in maternal blood. This panel is over-represented with genes involved with actin cytoskeleton, macromolecular complex and the integrin signaling pathway. This groundwork provides a starting point for systematically selecting reference gene candidates for normalizing the levels of circulating RNA transcripts in maternal blood.",

Pseudopaline differs from staphylopine with regard to the stereochemistry of its histidine moiety associated to an alpha ketoglutarate moiety instead of pyruvate. In vivo, the pseudopaline operon is regulated by zinc through the Zur repressor. The metal-uptake property of the pseudopaline system appears different from that of staphylopine with a predominant effect on nickel uptake, and on zinc uptake in metal scarce conditions mimicking a chelating environment, thus reconciling the regulation of the cnt operon by zinc with its function as a zinc importer under metal scarce conditions.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYZinc is an essential micronutrients for bacteria, particularly important at the host-pathogen interface where the host tends to sequester metals in a so called nutritional immunity framework, and the pathogenic bacterium increases its metal uptake efforts in order to keep up with its metal requirements. Here we reveal a novel metallophore, named pseudopaline, which is synthesized and exported by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and serves for the uptake of nickel in metal poor media, and for the uptake of zinc in metal scarce conditions that mimic the chelating environment that presumably prevails within a host.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the use of augmented reality (AR) to assist children and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); however, little investigation has been conducted into the safety of devices for AR such as smartglasses. The objective of this report was to assess the safety and negative effects of the Brain Power Autism System (BPAS), a novel AR smartglasses-based social communication aid for people with ASD. A sequential series of 18 children and adults aged 4.4 to 21.5 years (mean 12.2 years) with clinically diagnosed ASD of varying severity used the BPAS. Users and caregivers were interviewed about perceived negative effects and design concerns. Most users were able to wear and use the BPAS (n=16/18, 89%), with most of them reporting no negative effects (n=14/16, 87.5%). Two users reported temporary negative effects: eye strain, dizziness, and nasal discomfort. Caregivers observed no negative effects in users (n=16/16, 100%). Most users (77.8%) and caregivers (88.9%) had no design concerns. This report found no major negative effects in using an AR smartglasses-based social communication aid across a wide age and severity range of people with ASD.

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly experience symptoms related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. One-third of ASD cases may be complicated by the presence of ADHD. Individuals with dual diagnoses face greater barriers to accessing treatment for ADHD and respond less positively to primary pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic technology-aided tools for hyperactivity and inattention in people with ASD are being developed, although research into their efficacy and safety remains limited.\\n\\nObjectiveThe objective of this preliminary study was to describe the changes in ADHD-related symptoms in children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD after use of the Empowered Brain system, a behavioral and social communication aid for ASD running on augmented reality smartglasses.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited 8 children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD (male to female ratio of 7:1, mean age 15 years, range 11.7-20.5 years) through a Web-based research signup form. The baseline score on the hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC-H), a measure of hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, determined their classification into a high ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H [&ge;]13) and a low ADHD-related symptom group (n=4, ABC-H <13). All participants received an intervention with Empowered Brain, where they used smartglasses-based social communication and behavioral modules while interacting with their caregiver. We then calculated caregiver-reported ABC-H scores at 24 and 48 hours after the session.\\n\\nResultsAll 8 participants were able to complete the intervention session. Postintervention ABC-H scores were lower for most participants at 24 hours (n=6, 75%) and for all participants at 48 hours (n=8, 100%). At 24 hours after the session, average participant ABC-H scores decreased by 54.9% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 20% in the low ADHD symptom group. At 48 hours after the session, ABC-H scores compared with baseline decreased by 56.4% in the high ADHD symptom group and by 66.3% in the low ADHD symptom group.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides initial evidence for the efficacy of the Empowered Brain system in reducing ADHD-related symptoms, such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity, in school-aged children, adolescents, and young adults with ASD. This digital smartglasses intervention can potentially be targeted at a broader array of mental health conditions that exhibit transdiagnostic attentional and social communication deficits, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Further research is required to understand the clinical importance of these observed changes and to conduct longitudinal studies on this intervention with larger sample sizes.",

As the majority of these animals are migratory, their utility to interrogate the molecular and cellular basis of the magnetic sense is limited. Vidal-Gadea and colleagues recently argued that the worm C. elegans possesses a magnetic sense that guides their vertical movement in soil.

Here, we set out to replicate their results employing blinded protocols and double wrapped coils that control for heat generation.

    "abstract": "Visuospatial attention prioritizes processing of attended visual stimuli. It is characterized by lateralized alpha-band (8-14 Hz) amplitude suppression in visual cortex and increased neuronal activity in a network of frontal and parietal areas. It has remained unknown what mechanisms coordinate neuronal processing among frontoparietal network and visual cortices and implement the attention-related modulations of alpha-band amplitudes and behavior. We investigated whether large-scale network synchronization could be such a mechanism. We recorded human cortical activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a visuospatial attention task. We then identified the frequencies and anatomical networks of inter-areal phase synchronization from source localized MEG data. We found that visuospatial attention is associated with robust and sustained long-range synchronization of cortical oscillations exclusively in the high-alpha (10-14 Hz) frequency band. This synchronization connected frontal, parietal and visual regions and was observed concurrently with amplitude suppression of low-alpha (6-9 Hz) band oscillations in visual cortex. Furthermore, stronger high-alpha phase synchronization was associated with decreased reaction times to attended stimuli and larger suppression of alpha-band amplitudes. These results thus show that high-alpha band phase synchronization is functionally significant and could coordinate the neuronal communication underlying the implementation of visuospatial attention.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAugmented reality smartglasses are an emerging technology that are under investigation as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and as a research tool to aid with digital phenotyping. Tolerability of this wearable technology in people with ASD is an important area for research, especially as these individuals may experience sensory, cognitive, and attentional challenges.\\n\\nAimsThe aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and usability of a novel smartglasses system that has been designed as a social communication aid for children and adults with autism (the Brain Power Autism System; BPAS). BPAS runs on Google Glass Explorer Edition and other smartglasses, utilizes both augmented reality and affective artificial intelligence, and helps users learn key social and emotional skills.\\n\\nMethodTwenty-one children and adults with ASD across a spectrum of severity used BPAS for a coaching session. The users tolerability to the smartglasses was determined through caregiver report, and user being able to wear the smartglasses for one-minute (initial tolerability threshold), and for the entire duration of the coaching session (whole session tolerability threshold).\\n\\nResultsNineteen out of 21 users (90.5%) demonstrated tolerability on all three measures. Caregivers reported 21 out of 21 users (100%) as tolerating the experience, while study staff found only 19 out of 21 users managed to demonstrate initial tolerability (90.5%). Of the 19 users who demonstrated initial tolerability, all 19 were able to use the smartglasses for the entire session (whole session tolerability threshold) (n = 19 of 19, 100%). Caregivers reported that 19 out of 21 users (90.5%) successfully used BPAS, and users surpassed their caregivers expectations in 15 of 21 cases (71.4%). Users who could communicate reported BPAS as being comfortable (94.4%).\\n\\nDiscussionThis preliminary report suggests that BPAS is well tolerated and usable to a diverse age- and severity-range of people with ASD. This is encouraging as these devices are being developed as assistive technologies for people with ASD. Further research should focus on improving smartglasses design and exploring their efficacy in helping with social communication in children and adults with ASD.",

Preplay sequences have been hypothesized to participate in hippocampal learning and memory, but such functional roles and their potential cellular mechanisms remain unexplored. Here, we report a computational model based on the functional propagation of preplay sequences in the CA3 neuronal network. The model instantiates two synaptic pathways in CA3 neurons, one for proximal dendrite-somatic interactions to generate intrinsic preplay sequences and the other for distal dendritic processing of extrinsic sensory signals. The core dendritic computation is the maximization of matching between patterned activities in the two compartments through nonlinear spike generation. The model performs robust one-shot learning with long-term stability and independence that are modulated by the plasticity of dendrite-targeted inhibition. This model demonstrates that learning models combined with dendritic computations can enable preplay sequences to act as templates for rapid and stable memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in many brain areas exhibit high trial-to-trial variability, with spike counts that are over-dispersed relative to a Poisson distribution. Recent work (Goris et al., 2014) has proposed to explain this variability in terms of a multiplicative interaction between a stochastic gain variable and a stimulus-dependent Poisson firing rate, which produces quadratic relationships between spike count mean and variance. Here we examine this quadratic assumption and propose a more flexible family of models that can account for a more diverse set of mean-variance relationships. Our model contains additive Gaussian noise that is transformed nonlinearly to produce a Poisson spike rate. Different choices of the nonlinear function can give rise to qualitatively different mean-variance relationships, ranging from sub-linear to linear to multiplicative. Intriguingly, a rectified squaring nonlinearity produces a linear mean-variance function, corresponding to responses with constant Fano factor. We describe a computationally efficient method for fitting this model to data, and demonstrate that a majority of neurons in a V1 population are better described by a model with non-quadratic relationship between mean and variance. Lastly, we develop an application to Bayesian adaptive stimulus selection in closed-loop neurophysiology experiments, which shows that accounting for overdispersion can lead to dramatic improvements in adaptive tuning curve estimation.",

We used multichannel electroencephalograph recordings in 91 children 0-40 months old. We mapped spatial power and coherence across the cortex. During sevoflurane exposure: (1) slow-delta oscillations are present in all ages; (2) theta and alpha oscillations emerge around 4 months; (3) alpha oscillations increase in power from 4 to 10 months; (4) frontal alpha oscillation predominance emerge at ~6 months; (5) frontal slow oscillations are coherent in the first 6 months of age only; and (6) frontal alpha oscillations become coherent around 10 months and persist in older ages.

To investigate image features important for texture perception, we psychophysically compare a recent parameteric model of texture appearance (CNN model) that uses the features encoded by a deep convolutional neural network (VGG-19) with two other models: the venerable Portilla and Simoncelli model (PS) and an extension of the CNN model in which the power spectrum is additionally matched. Observers discriminated model-generated textures from original natural textures in a spatial three-alternative oddity paradigm under two viewing conditions: when test patches were briefly presented to the near-periphery (\\\"parafoveal\\\") and when observers were able to make eye movements to all three patches (\\\"inspection\\\"). Under parafoveal viewing, observers were unable to discriminate 10 of 12 original images from CNN model images, and remarkably, the simpler PS model performed slightly better than the CNN model (11 textures). Under foveal inspection, matching CNN features captured appearance substantially better than the PS model (9 compared to 4 textures), and including the power spectrum improved appearance matching for two of the three remaining textures. None of the models we test here could produce indiscriminable images for one of the 12 textures under the inspection condition. While deep CNN (VGG-19) features can often be used to synthesise textures that humans cannot discriminate from natural textures, there is currently no uniformly best model for all textures and viewing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Current and reoccurring viral epidemic outbreaks such as those caused by Zika virus illustrate the need for rapid development of antivirals. Such development would be immensely facilitated by computational approaches that can provide experimentally testable predictions for possible antiviral strategies. A key factor that has not been considered fully to date in the study of antiviral targets is the high dependence of viruses to their host metabolism for reproduction. Here, we focus on this dependence and develop a stoichiometric, genome-scale metabolic model that integrates human macrophage cell metabolism with the biochemical demands arising from virus production. Focusing this approach to currently epidemic viruses Chikungunya, Dengue and Zika, we find that each virus causes specific alterations in the host metabolic flux towards fulfilling their individual biochemical demands as predicted by their genome and capsid structure. Subsequent analysis of this integrated model allows us to predict a set of host reactions, which when constrained can inhibit virus production. We show that this prediction recovers most of the known targets of existing antiviral drugs, while highlighting a set of hitherto unexplored reactions with either broad or virus specific antiviral potential. Thus, this computational approach allows rapid generation of experimentally testable hypotheses for novel antiviral targets within a host.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA key challenge in combatting any new and emerging virus outbreaks is rapid drug development. In particular, generation of experimentally testable hypotheses through computational approaches is mostly lacking. Here, we address this gap by developing host-virus metabolic models for three viruses that cause current (or previously) epidemic viral outbreaks. We develop viral biomass functions using information from their genomes and physical structure, and incorporate these within a genome-scale metabolic model of human macrophage cells. The resulting integrated model allows us to predict host reactions, which when blocked, stop the system from attaining optimal viral production. These predictions recover currently known antiviral targets within human cells, and highlight a set of new reactions that are hitherto not explored for antiviral capacity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAgrochemicals are widely used in many parts of the world posing direct and indirect threats to organisms. Xenobiotic-related disease susceptibility is a common phenomenon and a proposed cause of amphibian declines and malformations. For example, parasitic infections combined with pesticides generally pose greater risk to both tadpoles and adult frogs than either factor alone. Here, we report on experimental effects of lone and combined exposures to cercariae of the digenetic trematode Acanthostomum burminis and ecologically relevant concentrations of (0.5 ppm) four pesticides (insecticides: chlorpyrifos, dimethoate; herbicides: glyphosate, propanil) on the tadpoles and metamorphs of the Asian common toad, Duttaphrynus melanostictus.\\n\\nResultsAll 48 cercaraie successfully penetrated each host suggesting that the pesticides had no short-term detrimental effect on cercarial penetration abilities. When the two treatments were provided separately, both cercariae and pesticides significantly decreased the survival of tadpoles and metamorphs and increased developmental malformations, such as scoliosis, kyphosis, and skin ulcers. Exposure to cercariae and the two insecticides additively reduced host survival. In contrast, mortality associated with the combination of cercariae and herbicides was less than additive. The effect of cercariae on malformation incidence depended on the pesticide treatment; dimethoate, glyphosate, and propanil reduced the number of cercarial-induced malformations relative to both the control and chlorpyrifos treatments.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results show that ecologically relevant concentrations of the tested agrochemicals had minimal effects on trematode infections, in contrast to others studies which showed that these same treatments increased the adverse effects of these infections on tadpoles and metamorphs of the Asian common toad. These findings reinforce the importance of elucidating the complex interactions among xenobiotics and pathogens on sentinel organisms that may be indicators of risk to other biota.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating how wildlife conservation laws are implemented is critical for safeguarding biodiversity. Two agencies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service (FWS and NMFS; Services collectively), are responsible for implementing the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), which requires federal protection for threatened and endangered species. FWS and NMFS comparable role for terrestrial and marine taxa, respectively, provides the opportunity to examine how implementation of the same law varies between agencies. We analyzed how the Services implement a core component of the ESA, section 7 consultations, by objectively assessing the contents of >120 consultations on sea turtle species against the requirements in the Services consultation handbook, supplemented with in-person observations from Service biologists. Our results showed that NMFS consultations were 1.40 times as likely to have higher completeness scores than FWS consultations given the standard in the handbook. Consultations tiered from an FWS programmatic consultation inherited higher quality scores of generally more thorough programmatic consultations, indicating that programmatic consultations could increase the quality of consultations while improving efficiency. Both agencies commonly neglected to account for the effects of previous consultations and the potential for compounded effects on species. From these results, we recommend actions that can improve quality of consultation, including the use of a single database to track and integrate previously authorized harm in new analyses and the careful but more widespread use of programmatic consultations. Our study reveals several critical shortfalls in the current process of conducting ESA section 7 consultations that the Services could address to better safeguard North Americas most imperiled species.",

    "abstract": "Small colony variants (SCVs) of Staphylococcus aureus typically lack a functional electron transport chain and cannot produce virulence factors such as leukocidins, hemolysins or the anti-oxidant staphyloxanthin. Despite this, SCVs are associated with persistent infections of the bloodstream, bones and prosthetic devices. The survival of SCVs in the host has been ascribed to intracellular residency, biofilm formation and resistance to antibiotics. However, the ability of SCVs to resist host defences is largely uncharacterised. To address this, we measured survival of wild-type and SCV S. aureus in whole human blood, which contains high numbers of neutrophils, the key defense against staphylococcal infection. Despite the loss of leukcocidin production and staphyloxanthin biosynthesis, SCVs defective for heme or menquinone biosynthesis were significantly more resistant to the oxidative burst than wild-type bacteria in a whole human blood model. Supplementation of the culture medium of the heme-auxotrophic SCV with heme, but not iron, restored growth, hemolysin and staphyloxanthin production, and sensitivity to the oxidative burst. Since Enterococcus faecalis is a natural heme auxotroph and cause of bloodstream infection, we explored whether restoration of the electron transport chain in this organism also affected survival in blood. Incubation of E. faecalis with heme increased growth and restored catalase activity, but resulted in decreased survival in human blood via increased sensitivity to the oxidative burst. Therefore, the lack of functional electron transport chains in SCV S. aureus and wild-type E. faecalis results in reduced growth rate but provides resistance to a key immune defence mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive processes do not occur by pure insertion and instead depend on the full complement of co-occurring mental processes, including perceptual and motor functions. As such, there is limited ecological validity to human neuroimaging experiments that use highly controlled tasks to isolate mental processes of interest. However, a growing literature shows how dynamic, interactive tasks have allowed researchers to study cognition as it more naturally occurs. Collective analysis across such neuroimaging experiments may answer broader questions regarding how naturalistic cognition is biologically distributed throughout the brain. We applied an unbiased, data-driven, meta-analytic approach that uses k-means clustering to identify core brain networks engaged across the naturalistic functional neuroimaging literature. Functional decoding allowed us to, then, delineate how information is distributed between these networks throughout the execution of dynamical cognition in realistic settings. This analysis revealed seven recurrent patterns of brain activation, representing sensory, domain-specific, and attentional neural networks that support the cognitive demands of naturalistic paradigms. Though gaps in the literature remain, these results suggest that naturalistic fMRI paradigms recruit a common set of networks that that allow both separate processing of different streams of information and integration of relevant information to enable flexible cognition and complex behavior.",

    "abstract": "Clustering infections by genetic similarity is a popular technique for identifying potential outbreaks of infectious disease, in part because sequences are now routinely collected for clinical management of many infections. A diverse number of nonparametric clustering methods have been developed for this purpose. These methods are generally intuitive, rapid to compute, and readily scale with large data sets. However, we have found that nonparametric clustering methods can be biased towards identifying clusters of diagnosis -- where individuals are sampled sooner post-infection -- rather than the clusters of rapid transmission that are meant to be potential foci for public health efforts. We develop a fundamentally new approach to genetic clustering based on fitting a Markov-modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which represents the evolution of transmission rates along the tree relating different infections. We evaluated this model-based method alongside five nonparametric clustering methods using both simulated and actual HIV sequence data sets. For simulated clusters of rapid transmission, the MMPP clustering method obtained higher mean sensitivity (85%) and specificity (91%) than the nonparametric methods. When we applied these clustering methods to published HIV-1 sequences from a study cohort of men who have sex with men in Seattle, USA, we found that the MMPP method categorized about half (46%) as many individuals to clusters compared to the other methods, and that the MMPP clusters were more consistent with transmission outbreaks. This new approach to genetic clustering has significant implications for the application of pathogen sequence analysis to public health, where it is critical to robustly and accurately identify clusters for the most cost-effective deployment of resources.",
