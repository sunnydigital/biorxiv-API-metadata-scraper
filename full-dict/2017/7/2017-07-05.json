    "abstract": "Populations of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) are typically structured into groups of closely related organisms or lineages, but it is not clear whether they are maintained by selection or neutral processes. Here, we attempt to address this question by applying a machine learning technique to SP whole genomes. Our results indicate that lineages evolved through immune selection on the groEL chaperone protein. The groEL protein is part of the groESL operon and enables a large range of proteins to fold correctly within the physical environment of the nasopharynx, thereby explaining why lineage structure is so stable within SP despite high levels of genetic transfer. SP is also antigenically diverse, exhibiting a variety of distinct capsular serotypes. Associations exist between lineage and capsular serotype but these can be easily perturbed, such as by vaccination. Overall, our analyses indicate that the evolution of SP can be conceptualized as the rearrangement of modular functional units occurring on several different timescales under different pressures: some patterns have locked in early (such as the epistatic interactions between groESL and a constellation of other genes) and preserve the differentiation of lineages, while others (such as the associations between capsular serotype and lineage) remain in continuous flux.",

    "abstract": "Human evolution depends on the co-evolution between genetically determined behaviors and socially transmitted information. Although vertical transmission of cultural information from parent to off-spring is common in hominins, its effects on cumulative cultural evolution are not fully understood. Here, we investigate gene-culture co-evolution in a family-structured population by studying the invasion fitness of a mutant allele that influences a deterministic level of cultural information (e.g., amount of knowledge or skill) to which diploid carriers of the mutant are exposed in subsequent generations. We show that the selection gradient on such a mutant, and the concomitant level of cultural information it generates, can be evaluated analytically under the assumption that the cultural dynamic has a single attractor point, thereby making gene-culture co-evolution in family-structured populations with multigenerational effects mathematically tractable. We apply our result to study how genetically determined phenotypes of individual and social learning co-evolve with the level of adaptive information they generate under vertical transmission. We find that vertical transmission increases adaptive information due to kin selection effects, but when information is transmitted as efficiently between family members as between unrelated individuals, this increase is moderate in diploids. By contrast, we show that the way resource allocation into learning trades off with allocation into reproduction (the \\\"learning-reproduction trade-off\\\") significantly influences levels of adaptive information. We also show that vertical transmission prevents evolutionary branching and may therefore play a qualitative role in gene-culture co-evolutionary dynamics. More generally, our analysis of selection suggests that vertical transmission can significantly increase levels of adaptive information under the biologically plausible condition that information transmission between relatives is more efficient than between unrelated individuals.",

    "abstract": "Counteracting the destabilizing force of gravity is usually considered to be the main purpose of postural control. However, from the consideration of the mechanical requirements for movement, we argue that posture is adjusted in view of providing impetus for movement. Thus, we show that the posture that is usually adopted in quiet standing in fact allows torque for potential movement. Moreover, when performing a movement - either voluntarily or in response to an external perturbation - we show that the postural adjustments are organized both spatially and temporally so as to provide the required torque for the movement. Thus, when movement is performed skillfully, the force of gravity is not counteracted but actually used to provide impetus to movement. This ability to move ones weight so as to exploit the torque of gravity seems to be dependent on development and skill learning, and is impaired in aging.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection occurs when multiple alleles are maintained in a population, which can result in their preservation over long evolutionary time periods. A characteristic signature of this long-term balancing selection is an excess number of intermediate frequency polymorphisms near the balanced variant. However, the expected distribution of allele frequencies at these loci has not been extensively detailed, and therefore existing summary statistic methods do not explicitly take it into account. Using simulations, we show that new mutations which arise in close proximity to a site targeted by balancing selection accumulate at frequencies nearly identical to that of the balanced allele. In order to scan the genome for balancing selection, we propose a new summary statistic, {beta}, which detects these clusters of alleles at similar frequencies. Simulation studies show that compared to existing summary statistics, our measure has improved power to detect balancing selection, and is reasonably powered in non-equilibrium demographic models or when recombination or mutation rate varies. We compute {beta} on 1000 Genomes Project data to identify lo ci potentially subjected to long-term balancing selection in humans. We report two balanced haplotypes - localized to the genes WFS1 and CADM2 - that are strongly linked to association signals for complex traits. Our approach is computationally efficient and applicable to species that lack appropriate outgroup sequences, allowing for well-powered analysis of selection in the wide variety of species for which population data are rapidly being generated.",

Validation of YSA with 96 previously characterized interactions shows a strong log-linear relationship between mating efficiency and PPI strength for interactions with KDs ranging from 500 pM to 25 M. Using induced chromosomal translocation to pair barcodes representing interacting proteins, thousands of distinct interactions can be screened in a single pot.

    "abstract": "Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animals behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. As a particular target, we applied this framework to C. elegans thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, the fed and starved worms prefer and avoid from the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient, respectively. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both absolute and temporal derivative of temperature and that their strategy comprised mixture of two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). The DM is a strategy that the worms efficiently reach to specific temperature, which explained thermotactic behaviors of the fed worms. The IM is a strategy that the worms track along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking well observed in previous studies. We also showed the neural basis underlying the strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. In contrast to fed animals, the strategy of starved animals indicated that they escaped the cultivation temperature using only absolute, but not temporal derivative of temperature. Thus, our IRL-based approach is capable of identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and will be applicable to wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making of other organisms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding animal decision-making has been a fundamental problem in neuroscience and behavioral ecology. Many studies analyze actions that represent decision-making in behavioral tasks, in which rewards are artificially designed with specific objectives. However, it is impossible to extend this artificially designed experiment to a natural environment, because in a natural environment, the rewards for freely-behaving animals cannot be clearly defined. To this end, we must reverse the current paradigm so that rewards are identified from behavioral data. Here, we propose a new reverse-engineering approach (inverse reinforcement learning) that can estimate a behavioral strategy from time-series data of freely-behaving animals. By applying this technique with thermotaxis in C. elegans, we successfully identified the reward-based behavioral strategy.",

    "abstract": "The genus Stenotrophomonas (Gammaproteobacteria) has a broad environmental distribution. S. maltophilia is its best known species because it is a globally emerging, multidrug-resistant (MDR), opportunistic pathogen. Members of this species are known to display high genetic, ecological and phenotypic diversity, forming the so-called S. maltophilia complex (Smc). Heterogeneous resistance and virulence phenotypes have been reported for environmental Smc isolates of diverse ecological origin. We hypothesized that this heterogeneity could be in part due to the potential lumping of several cryptic species in the Smc. Here we used state-of-the-art phylogenetic and population genetics methods to test this hypothesis based on the multilocus dataset available for the genus at pubmlst.org. It was extended with sequences from complete and draft genome sequences to assemble a comprehensive set of reference sequences. This framework was used to analyze 108 environmental isolates obtained in this study from the sediment and water column of four rivers and streams in Central Mexico, affected by contrasting levels of anthropogenic pollution. The aim of the study was to identify species in this collection, defined as genetically cohesive sequence clusters, and to determine the extent of their genetic, ecological and phenotypic differentiation. The multispecies coalescent, coupled with Bayes factor analysis was used to delimit species borders, together with population genetic structure analyses, recombination and gene flow estimates between sequence clusters.\\n\\nThese analyses consistently revealed that the Smc contains at least 5 significantly differentiated lineages: S. maltophilia and Smc1 to Smc4. Only S. maltophilia was found to be intrinsically MDR, all its members expressing metallo-{beta}-lactamases (MBLs). The other Smc lineages were not MDR and did not express MBLs. We also obtained isolates related to S. acidaminiphila, S. humi and S. terrae. They were significantly more susceptible to antibiotics than S. maltophilia. We demonstrate that the sympatric lineages recovered display significantly differentiated habitat preferences, antibiotic resistance profiles and beta-lactamase expression phenotypes, as shown by diverse multivariate analyses and robust univariate statistical tests. We discuss our data in light of current models of bacterial speciation, which fit these data well, stressing the implications of species delimitation in ecological, evolutionary and clinical research.",

The neurobiological mechanisms that underpin this prodromal phase of PD remain poorly understood. Based on converging evidence of basal ganglia (BG) dysfunction in early PD, we set out to establish whether the prodromal phase of the disease is characterized by alterations in functional communication within the input and output structures of the BG. We analyzed resting-state functional MRI data collected from patients with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and/or hyposmia, two of the strongest markers of prodromal PD, in comparison to age-matched controls. Relative to controls, subjects in the prodromal group showed reduced intra- and interhemispheric functional connectivity in a striato-thalamo-pallidal network. Functional connectivity alterations were restricted to the BG and did not extend to functional connections with the cortex. The data suggest that local interactions between input and output BG structures may be disrupted already in the prodromal phase of PD.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) predominantly respond to a patch of the visual input, their classical receptive field. These responses are modulated by the visual input in the surround [2]. This reflects the fact that features in natural scenes do not occur in isolation: lines, surfaces are generally continuous, and the surround provides context for the information in the classical receptive field. It is generally assumed that the information in the near surround is transmitted via lateral connections between neurons in the same area [2]. A series of large scale efforts have recently described the relation between lateral connectivity and visual evoked responses and found like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons [16, 18]. Additionally, specific cell type connectivity for inhibitory neuron types has been described [11, 31]. Current normative models of cortical function relying on sparsity [27], saliency [4] predict functional inhibition between similarly tuned neurons. What computations are consistent with the observed structure of the lateral connections between the excitatory and diverse types of inhibitory neurons?\\n\\nWe combined natural scene statistics [24] and mouse V1 neuron responses [7] to compute the lateral connections and computations of individual neurons which optimally integrate information from the classical receptive field with that from the surround by directly implementing Bayes rule. This increases the accuracy of representation of a natural scene under noisy conditions. We show that this network has like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons, similar to the observed one [16, 18, 11], and has three types of inhibition: local normalization, surround inhibition and gating of inhibition from the surround - that can be attributed to three classes of inhibitory neurons. We hypothesize that this computation: optimal integration of contextual cues with a gate to ignore context when necessary is a general property of cortical circuits, and the rules constructed for mouse V1 generalize to other areas and species.",

    "abstract": "The tetrapod appendicular skeleton is initiated as spatially patterned mesenchymal condensations. The size and spacing of these condensations in avian limb buds are mediated by a reaction-diffusion-adhesion network consisting of galectins Gal-1A, Gal-8 and their cell surface receptors. In cell cultures, the appearance of condensations is synchronized across distances greater than the characteristic wavelength of their spatial pattern. We explored the possible role of observed oscillations of the transcriptional co-regulator Hes1 in this phenomenon. Treatment of micromass cultures with DAPT, a {gamma}-secretase inhibitor, damped Hes1 oscillations, elevated Gal-1A and -8 mRNA levels, and led to irregularly-sized and fused condensations. In developing limb buds, DAPT led to spatially non-uniform Hes1 expression and fused and misshapen digits. Periodicity in adhesive response to Gal-1A, a plausible Hes1-dependent function, was added to a previously tested mathematical model for condensation patterning by the two-galectin network. The enhanced model predicted regularization of patterning due to synchronization of Hes1 oscillations and resulting spatiotemporal coordination of its expression. The model also predicted changes in galectin expression and patterning in response to suppression of Hes1 expression, which were confirmed in in vitro experiments. Our results indicate that the two-galectin patterning network is regulated by Hes1 dynamics, the synchronization of which refines and regularizes limb skeletogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cells in culture display diverse motility behaviors that may reflect differences in cell state and function, providing motivation to discriminate between different motility behaviors. Current methods to do so rely upon manual feature engineering. However, the types of features necessary to distinguish between motility behaviors can vary greatly depending on the biological context, and it is not always clear which features may be most predictive in each setting for distinguishing particular cell types or disease states. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are machine learning models allowing for relevant features to be learned directly from spatial data. Similarly, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of models capable of learning long term temporal dependencies. Given that cell motility is inherently spacio-temporal data, we present an approach utilizing both convolutional and long- short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network units to analyze cell motility data. These RNN models provide accurate classification of simulated motility and experimentally measured motility from multiple cell types, comparable to results achieved with hand-engineered features. The variety of cell motility differences we can detect suggests that the algorithm is generally applicable to additional cell types not analyzed here. RNN autoencoders based on the same architecture are capable of learning motility features in an unsupervised manner and capturing variation between myogenic cells in the latent space. Adapting these RNN models to motility prediction, RNNs are capable of predicting muscle stem cell motility from past tracking data with performance superior to standard motion prediction models. This advance in cell motility prediction may be of practical utility in cell tracking applications.",

Lower concentration of glucose is optimal to initiate {beta}-cell maturation, while increased glucose delivery to every cell through microcirculation is required for functional boosting of the {beta}-cells.

Our pipeline, named All-RNA-Information sequencing (ARIseq), comprises a high-throughput sequencing of reverse transcribed total RNA and several widely used computational tools, and generates quantitatively reliable information on both community structures and gene expression patterns, which were verified by quantitative PCR analyses in this study. Particularly, correlation network analysis in the pipeline can reveal microbial taxa and expressed genes that share patterns of dynamics among different time and/or geographical points. The pipeline is primarily mapping-based, using a public database for small subunit rRNA genes and obtained contigs as the reference database for protein-coding genes. We applied this pipeline to biofilm samples, as examples, collected from an acidic spring water stream in the Chyatsubomi-goke Park in Gunma prefecture, Japan. Our analyses revealed the predominance of iron and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and Pinnularia diatoms, and also indicated that the distributions of the iron-sulfur-oxidizing bacterial consortium and the Pinnularia diatoms largely overlapped but showed distinct patterns. In addition, our analyses showed that the iron-oxidizing bacterial genus Acidithiobacillus and co-occurring Acidiphilium shared similar distribution pattern whereas another iron-oxidizing genus Leptospirillum exhibited a distinct pattern. Our pipeline enables researchers to more easily capture the outline of microbial ecosystems based on the taxonomic composition, protein-coding gene expression, and their correlations.",

    "abstract": "Subjective inner experiences, such as mind-wandering, represent the fundaments of human cognition. While the precise function of mind-wandering is still debated, it is increasingly acknowledged to have influence across cognition on processes such as future planning, creative thinking and problem-solving, and even on depressive rumination and other mental health disorders. Recently, there has been important progress in characterizing mind-wandering and identifying the neural networks associated with it. Two prominent features of mind-wandering are mental time travel and visuo-spatial imagery, which are often associated with the hippocampus. People with amnesia arising from selective bilateral hippocampal damage ( hippocampal amnesia) cannot vividly recall events from their past, envision their future or imagine fictitious scenes. This raises the question of whether the hippocampus plays a causal role in mind-wandering and if so, in what way. Leveraging a unique opportunity to shadow people with hippocampal amnesia for several days, we examined, for the first time, what they thought about spontaneously, without direct task demands. We found that they engaged in as much mind-wandering as control participants. However, whereas controls thought flexibly and creatively about the past, present and future, imagining vivid visual scenes, hippocampal amnesia resulted in thoughts primarily about the present comprising verbally-mediated semantic knowledge. These findings expose the hippocampus as a key pillar in the neural architecture of mind-wandering and also reveal its impact beyond memory, placing it at the heart of human mental life.\\n\\nSignificance statementHumans tend to mind-wander about 30-50% of their waking time. Two prominent features of this pervasive form of thought are mental time travel and visuo-spatial imagery, which are often associated with the hippocampus. To examine whether the hippocampus plays a causal role in mind-wandering, we examined the frequency and phenomenology of mind-wandering in patients with selective bilateral hippocampal damage. We found that they engaged in as much mind-wandering as controls. However, hippocampal damage changed the form and content of mind-wandering from flexible, episodic, and scene-based to abstract, semanticized, and verbal. These findings expose the hippocampus as a key pillar in the neural architecture of mind-wandering and reveal its impact beyond memory, placing it at the heart of our mental life.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMany developmental disorders are associated with deficits in controlling and regulating behaviour. These difficulties are frequently observed across multiple groups of children including children with diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning difficulties, autistic spectrum disorder, or conduct disorder. The co-occurrence of these behavioural problems across disorders typically leads to comorbid diagnoses and can complicate intervention approaches. An alternative to classifying children on the basis of specific diagnostic criteria is to use a data-driven grouping that identifies dimensions of behaviour that meaningfully distinguish groups of children.\\n\\nMethodsThe sample consisted of 442 children identified by health and educational professionals as having difficulties in attention, learning and/or memory. The current study applied community clustering, a data-driven clustering algorithm, to group children by similarities across scales on a commonly used rating scale, the Conners-3 questionnaire. Further, the current study investigated if the groups identified by the data-driven algorithm could be identified by white matter connectivity using a structural connectomics approach combined with partial least squares analysis.\\n\\nResultsThe data-driven clustering yielded three distinct groups of children with symptoms of either: (1) elevated inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, and poor executive function, (2) learning problems, and (3) aggressive behaviour and problems with peer relationships. These groups were associated with significant inter-individual variation in white matter connectivity of the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex.\\n\\nConclusionIn sum, data-driven classification of executive function difficulties identifies stable groups of children, provides a good account of inter-individual differences, and aligns closely with underlying neurobiological substrates.",

A general feature of motor timing is temporal scaling: the ability to produce motor patterns at different speeds. Here we report that temporal scaling is not automatic. After learning to produce a Morse code pattern at one speed, subjects did not accurately generalize to novel speeds. Temporal scaling was also not a general property of a recurrent neural network (RNN) model, however after training across different speeds the model produced robust temporal scaling. The model captured a signature of motor timing--Webers law--but predicted that temporal precision increases at faster speeds. A human psychophysics study confirmed this prediction: the standard deviation of responses in absolute time were lower at faster speeds. These results establish that RNNs can account for temporal scaling, and suggest a novel psychophysical principle: the Weber-speed effect.",

    "abstract": "Lesion to symptom mapping (LSM) is a crucial tool for understanding the causality of brain-behavior relationships. The analyses are typically performed by applying statistical methods on individual brain voxels (VLSM), a method called the mass-univariate approach. Several authors have shown that VLSM suffers from limitations that may decrease the accuracy and reliability of the findings, and have proposed the use of multivariate methods to overcome these limitations. In this study, we propose a multivariate optimization technique known as sparse canonical correlation analysis for neuroimaging (SCCAN) for lesion to symptom mapping. To validate the method and compare it with mass-univariate results, we used data from 131 patients with chronic stroke lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, and created synthetic behavioral scores based on the lesion load of 93 brain regions (putative functional units). LSM analyses were performed with univariate VLSM or SCCAN, and the accuracy of the two methods was compared in terms of both overlap and and displacement from the simulated functional areas. Overall, SCCAN produced more accurate results - higher dice overlap and smaller average displacement - compared to VLSM. This advantage persisted at different sample sizes (N=20-131) and different multiple comparison corrections (false discovery rate, FDR; Bonferroni; permutation-based family wise error rate, FWER). These findings were replicated with a fully automated SCCAN routine that relied on cross-validated predictive accuracy to find the optimal sparseness value. Simulations of one, two, and three brain regions showed a systematic advantage of SCCAN over VLSM; under no circumstance could VLSM exceed the accuracy obtained with SCCAN. When considering functional units composed of multiple brain areas VLSM identified fewer areas than SCCAN. The investigation of real scores of aphasia severity (aphasia quotient and picture naming) showed that SCCAN could accurately identify known language-critical areas, while VLSM either produced diffuse maps (FDR correction) or few scattered voxels (FWER correction). Overall, this study shows that a multivariate method, such as, SCCAN, outperforms VLSM in a number of scenarios, including functional dependency on single or multiple areas, different sample sizes, different multi-area combinations, and different thresholding mechanisms (FWER, Bonferroni, FDR). These results support previous claims that multivariate methods are in general more accurate than mass-univariate approaches, and should be preferred over traditional VLSM approaches. All the methods described in this study are available in the newly developed LESYMAP package for R.",

Here, we provide a kinetic model of primer binding and PCR product formation as the rational basis for taking and evaluating calibration curves. With the help of a purposeful designed data processing workflow supported by easy-to-use Perl scripts for calibration, data evaluation, and quality control, the calibration procedure and the model predictions were confirmed and the robustness and linearity of transcript quantification demonstrated for differentiating Physarum polycephalum plasmodial cells. We conclude that GeXP analysis is a robust, sensitive, and useful method when the transcripts of tens to few hundred genes are to be precisely quantified in a high number of samples.",

While genome-wide screens are desirable as they provide the most comprehensive interaction profiles, they are resource and time-intensive and sometimes infeasible, depending on the species and experimental platform. For these scenarios, optimal methods for more efficient screening while still producing the maximal amount of information from the resulting profiles are of interest.\\n\\nTo address this problem, we developed an optimal algorithm, called COMPRESS-GI, which selects a small but informative set of genes that captures most of the functional information contained within genome-wide genetic interaction profiles. The utility of this algorithm is demonstrated through an application of the approach to define a diagnostic mutant set for large-scale chemical genetic screens, where more than 13,000 compound screens were achieved through the increased throughput enabled by the approach. COMPRESS-GI can be broadly applied for directing genetic interaction screens in other contexts, including in species with little or no prior genetic-interaction data.",

The most common repeated regions are those coding for ribosomal operons (rDNAs), which occur in a bacterial genome between 1 and 15 times, and are typically used as sequence markers to classify and identify bacteria. Here, we exploit conservation in the genomic context in which rDNAs occur across taxa to improve assembly of these regions relative to de novo sequencing by using the conserved nature of rDNAs across taxa and the uniqueness of their flanking regions within a genome. We describe a method to construct targeted pseudocontigs generated by iteratively assembling reads that map to a reference genomes rDNAs. These pseudocontigs are then used to more accurately assemble the newly-sequenced chromosome. We show that this method, implemented as riboSeed, correctly bridges across adjacent contigs in bacterial genome assembly and, when used in conjunction with other genome polishing tools, can assist in closure of a genome.",

Critically, despite this large heterogeneity, we were able to visualize nanometer-sized epigenetic domains at the single-cell level. In addition, absolute contact frequencies within and between TADs were to a large extent defined by genomic distance, higher-order chromosome architecture, and epigenetic identity.

    "abstract": "Androgens act through the nuclear androgen receptor (AR) to regulate gonad differentiation and development. In mice, AR is required for spermatogenesis, testis development and formation of external genitalia in males and oocyte maturation in females. However, the extent to which these phenotypes are conserved in nonmammalian vertebrates is not well understood, because mutations in AR have not been generated in any other species. Here, we generate zebrafish with a mutation in the ar gene and examine the role of AR on sexual differentiation and gonad development. We find that zebrafish AR is not required for male sexual differentiation, since a portion of ar mutants develop a testis. However, we show that in zebrafish, as in mice, AR is required for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and for proper organization of the testis in males and for oocyte maturation in females. Additionally, we find that zebrafish ar mutant males have functional, mature sperm present in their testis, but are infertile due to an inability to release sperm. These findings suggest that AR is required for male sexual development and fertility, but not essential for sexual differentiation in zebrafish. The ar mutant we developed will be useful for modeling human endocrine function in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Muscle fiber length is nearly uniform within a muscle but widely different among muscles. Here, we show that Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (Abl2) has a key role in regulating myofiber length, as a loss of Abl2 leads to excessively long myofibers in the diaphragm and other muscles. Increased myofiber length is caused by enhanced myoblast proliferation, expanding the pool of available myoblasts and leading to increased myoblast fusion. Abl2 acts in myoblasts, but expansion of the diaphragm muscle causes a reduction in size of the diaphragm central tendon. Replacement of tendon for muscle is likely responsible for the reduced stamina of abl2 mutant mice. Further, ectopic muscle islands, each composed of myofibers of uniform length and orientation, form within the central tendon in abl2+/- mice. Induction of scleraxis in tendon cells at the ends of these muscle islands suggests that myofibers stimulate tendon differentiation, which in turn regulates myofiber length.",

While orthologous gene conservation is commonly employed in variant annotation, approximately 80% of known disease-associated genes are paralogs and belong to gene families. It has not been thoroughly investigated how gene family information can be utilized for disease gene discovery and variant interpretation. We developed a paralog conservation score to empirically evaluate whether paralog conserved or nonconserved sites of in-human paralogs are important for protein function. Using this score, we demonstrate that disease-associated missense variants are significantly enriched at paralog conserved sites across all disease groups and disease inheritance models tested. Next, we assessed whether gene family information could assist in discovering novel disease-associated genes. We subsequently developed a gene family de novo enrichment framework that identified 43 exome-wide enriched gene families including 98 de novo variant carrying genes in more than 10k neurodevelopmental disorder patients. 33 gene family enriched genes represent novel candidate genes which are brain expressed and variant constrained in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Schaefer et al. recently advanced the provocative conclusion that CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease can induce off-target alterations at genomic loci that do not resemble the intended on-target site.1 Using high-coverage whole genome sequencing (WGS), these authors reported finding SNPs and indels in two CRISPR-Cas9-treated mice that were not present in a single untreated control mouse. On the basis of this association, Schaefer et al. concluded that these sequence variants were caused by CRISPR-Cas9. This new proposed CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity runs contrary to previously published work2-8 and, if the authors are correct, could have profound implications for research and therapeutic applications. Here, we demonstrate that the simplest interpretation of Schaefer et al.s data is that the two CRISPR-Cas9-treated mice are actually more closely related genetically to each other than to the control mouse. This strongly suggests that the so-called \\\"unexpected mutations\\\" simply represent SNPs and indels shared in common by these mice prior to nuclease treatment. In addition, given the genomic and sequence distribution profiles of these variants, we show that it is challenging to explain how CRISPR-Cas9 might be expected to induce such changes. Finally, we argue that the lack of appropriate controls in Schaefer et al.s experimental design precludes assignment of causality to CRISPR-Cas9. Given these substantial issues, we urge Schaefer et al. to revise or re-state the original conclusions of their published work so as to avoid leaving misleading and unsupported statements to persist in the literature.",

Mutations in HPCA, encoding the neuronal calcium sensor Hippocalcin, are associated with primary dystonia, suggesting a function for Hippocalcin in regulating the initiation and/or maintenance of activity. However, such a role for Hippocalcin or Hippocalcin homologs has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. Here we investigate the cellular and organismal functions of the Drosophila Hippocalcin homolog Neurocalcin (NCA), and define a role for NCA in promoting sleep by suppressing nighttime hyperactivity. We show that NCA acts in a common pathway with the D1-type Dop1R1 dopamine receptor and facilitates sleep by inhibiting neurotransmitter release from a multi-component activity-promoting circuit. Our results suggest conserved roles for Hippocalcin homologs in modulating motor control through dopaminergic pathways, suppressing aberrant movements in humans and inappropriate nighttime locomotion in Drosophila.",

To date, no experimental paradigm outside of loss of dopamine has been able to specifically elevate {beta} oscillations in the CBT loop. Here, we show that activation of striatal cholinergic receptors selectively increased {beta} oscillations in mouse striatum and motor cortex. In individuals showing simultaneous {beta} increases in both striatum and M1, {beta} partial directed coherence (PDC) increased from striatum to M1 (but not in the reverse direction). In individuals that did not show simultaneous {beta} increases, {beta} PDC increased from M1 to striatum (but not in the reverse direction), and M1 was characterized by persistent {beta}-HFO phase-amplitude coupling. Finally, the direction of {beta} PDC distinguished between {beta} subbands. This suggests: (1) striatal cholinergic tone exerts state-dependent and frequency-selective control over CBT {beta} power and coordination; (2) ongoing rhythmic dynamics can determine whether elevated {beta} oscillations are expressed in striatum and M1; (3) altered striatal cholinergic tone differentially modulates distinct {beta} subbands.",

If all genetic variants satisfy the instrumental variable (IV) and necessary modelling assumptions, then their individual ratio estimates of causal effect should be homogeneous. Observed heterogeneity signals that one or more of these assumptions could have been violated.\\n\\nMethodsCausal estimation and heterogeneity assessment in MR requires an approximation for the variance, or equivalently the inverse-variance weight, of each ratio estimate. We show that the most popular  1st order weights can lead to an inflation in the chances of detecting heterogeneity when in fact it is not present. Conversely, ostensibly more accurate  2nd order weights can dramatically increase the chances of failing to detect heterogeneity, when it is truly present. We derive modified weights to mitigate both of these adverse effects.\\n\\nResultsUsing Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the modified weights outperform 1st and 2nd order weights in terms of heterogeneity quantification. Modified weights are also shown to remove the phenomenon of regression dilution bias in MR estimates obtained from weak instruments, unlike those obtained using 1st and 2nd order weights. However, with small numbers of weak instruments, this comes at the cost of a reduction in estimate precision and power to detect a causal effect compared to 1st order weighting. Moreover, 1st order weights always furnish unbiased estimates and preserve the type I error rate under the causal null. We illustrate the utility of the new method using data from a recent two-sample summary data MR analysis to assess the causal role of systolic blood pressure on coronary heart disease risk.\\n\\nConclusionsWe propose the use of modified weights within two-sample summary data MR studies for accurately quantifying heterogeneity and detecting outliers in the presence of weak instruments. Modified weights also have an important role to play in terms of causal estimation (in tandem with 1st order weights) but further research is required to understand their strengths and weaknesses in specific settings.",

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a dataset of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural networks based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource. Given the likely importance of phenology for forecasting the likelihood of future Ebola spillover events, our results highlight the need for cost-effective transect surveys to supply phenology data for predictive modelling efforts.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSurgical removal of the adenoids and tonsils are common pediatric procedures, with conventional wisdom suggesting their absence has little impact on health or disease. However, little is known about long-term health consequences beyond the perioperative risks. Such ignorance is significant, for these lymphatic organs play important roles in both the development and the function of the immune system.\\n\\nMETHODSWe tested the long-term consequences of surgery in the population of Denmark by examining risk for 28 diseases with 1 million individuals followed from birth up to 30 years of age depending on whether any of three common surgeries (adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, adenotonsillectomy) occurred in the first 9 years of life. To weigh costs and benefits, we also compared the absolute risks for these diseases to the risks for the conditions that these surgeries aimed to treat. We obtained robust results by using stratified Cox regressions with statistically well-powered samples of cases (with surgery) and controls (without surgery) whose general health was no different prior to surgery. We adjusted our estimates of risk for diseases occurring before surgery, stratified for sex (and other effects) and for 18 covariates, including parental disease history and birth metrics.\\n\\nRESULTSWe found significantly elevated relative risks for many diseases, with effects on respiratory, allergic and infectious disorders after removal of adenoids and tonsils being most pronounced. For some of these diseases, absolute risk increases were considerable. In comparison, many risks for conditions that surgeries aimed to treat were either not significantly different or significantly higher following surgery up to 30 years of age. This suggests that any immediate benefits of these surgeries may not continue longer-term, while resulting in slightly compromised early adult health due to significantly increased risk of many non-target diseases.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur results indicate that surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids early in life are associated with longer-term health risks. They underline the importance of these organs and tissues for normal immune functioning and early immune development, and suggest that these longer-term disease risks may outweigh the short-term benefits of these surgeries.",

Failure to achieve consistently high VE has been attributed both to mismatches between the vaccine and circulating influenza strains and to the vaccine's elicitation of protective immunity in only a subset of the population. The low H3N2 VE in 2012-13 was attributed to egg-adaptive mutations that created antigenic mismatch between the intended (A/Victoria/361/2011) and actual vaccine strain (IVR-165).\\n\\nMethodsWe investigate the basis of the low VE in 2012-2013 by evaluating whether vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were infected by different viral strains and assessing the serologic responses to A/Victoria/361/2011 and the IVR-165 vaccine strain in an adult cohort before and after vaccination.\\n\\nResultsWe found no significant genetic differences between the strains that infected vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Vaccination increased titers to A/Victoria/361/2011 as much as to IVR-165. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that vaccination served merely to boost preexisting cross-reactive immune responses, which provided limited protection against infection with the circulating influenza strains.\\n\\nConclusionsIn contrast to suggestive analyses based on ferret antisera, low H3N2 VE in 2012-13 does not appear to be due to the failure of the egg-adapted strain to induce a response to the intended vaccine strain.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in research on gene drives have produced genetic constructs that could theoretically spread a desired gene (payload) into all populations of a species, with a single release in one place. This attribute has advantages, but also comes with risks and ethical concerns. There has been a call for research on gene drive systems that are spatially and/or temporally self-limiting. Here we use a population genetics model to compare the expected characteristics of three spatially self-limiting gene drive systems: one-locus underdominance, two-locus underdominance, and daisy-chain drives. We find large differences between these gene drives in the minimum release size required for successfully driving a payload into a population. The daisy-chain system is the most efficient, requiring the smallest release, followed by the two-locus underdominance system, and then the one-locus underdominance system. However, when the target population exchanges migrants with a non-target population, the gene drives requiring smaller releases suffer from higher risks of unintended spread. For payloads that incur relatively low fitness costs (up to 30%), a simple daisy-chain drive is practically incapable of remaining localized, even with migration rates as low as 0.5% per generation. The two-locus underdominance system can achieve localized spread under a broader range of migration rates and of payload fitness costs, while the one-locus underdominance system largely remains localized. We also find differences in the extent of population alteration and in the permanence of the alteration achieved by the three gene drives. The two-locus underdominance system does not always spread the payload to fixation, even after successful drive, while the daisy-chain system can, for a small set of parameter values, achieve a temporally-limited spread of the payload. These differences could affect the suitability of each gene drive for specific applications.

We model the problem as one of unsupervised structure discovery, and use emerging principles from algebraic topology and graph theory for discovering higher-order structures of complex phenomics data. We present an open source software which has interactive visualization capabilities to facilitate data navigation and hypothesis formulation. We test and evaluate Hyppo-X on two real-world plant (maize) data sets. Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to delineate divergent subpopulation-level behavior. Notably, our approach shows how environmental factors could influence phenotypic behavior, and how that effect varies across different genotypes and different time scales. To the best of our knowledge, this effort provides one of the first approaches to systematically formalize the problem of hypothesis extraction for phenomics data. Considering the infancy of the phenomics field, tools that help users explore complex data and extract plausible hypotheses in a data-guided manner will be critical to future advancements in the use of such data.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about venom in young developmental stages of animals. The appearance of stinging cells in very early life stages of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis suggests that toxins and venom are synthesized already in eggs, embryos and larvae of this species. Here we harness transcriptomic and biochemical tools as well as transgenesis to study venom production dynamics in Nematostella. We find that the venom composition and arsenal of toxin-producing cells change dramatically between developmental stages of this species. These findings might be explained by the vastly different ecology of the larva and adult polyp as sea anemones develop from a miniature non-feeding mobile planula to a much larger sessile polyp that predates on other animals. Further, the results suggest a much wider and dynamic venom landscape than initially appreciated in animals with a complex life cycle.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn humans, emotional and physical signs of withdrawal from ethanol are commonly seen. Many of these symptoms, including anxiety-like and depression-like behavior, have been characterized in animal models of ethanol dependence. One issue with several current behavioral tests measuring withdrawal in animal models is they are often not repeatable within subjects over time. Additionally, irritability, one of the most common symptoms of ethanol withdrawal in humans, has not been well characterized in animal models. The corticotropinreleasing factor (CRF)-CRF1 receptor system has been suggested to be critical for the emergence of anxiety-like behavior in ethanol dependence, but the role of this system in irritability-like behavior has not been characterized.\\n\\nMethodsThe present study compared the effects of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE)-induced ethanol dependence on irritabilitylike behavior in rats using the bottle-brush test during acute withdrawal and protracted abstinence. Rats were trained to self-administer ethanol in operant chambers and then either left in a nondependent state or made dependent via CIE. Naive, nondependent, and dependent rats were tested for irritability-like behavior in the bottle-brush test 8 h and 2 weeks into abstinence from ethanol. A separate cohort of dependent rats was used to examine the effect of the specific CRF1 receptor antagonist R121919 on irritability-like behavior.\\n\\nResultsDependent rats exhibited escalated ethanol intake compared with their own pre-CIE baseline and nondependent rats. At both time-points of abstinence, ethanol-dependent rats exhibited increased aggressive-like responses compared with naive and nondependent rats. R121919 blocked the increased irritability-like behavior in dependent rats.\\n\\nConclusionsThe effect of R121919 to block increased irritability-like behavior suggests that CRF plays an important role in this behavior, similar to other negative emotional withdrawal symptoms. Quantifying and understanding the molecular basis of irritability-like behavior may yield new insights into withdrawal from ethanol and other drugs of abuse.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive and brain development are determined by dynamic interactions between genes and environment across the lifespan. Aside from marker-by-marker analyses of polymorphisms, biologically meaningful features of the whole-genome (derived from the combined effect of individual markers) have been postulated to inform on human phenotypes including cognitive traits and their underlying biological substrate.\\n\\nHere, estimates of inbreeding and genetic susceptibility for schizophrenia calculated from genome-wide data -runs of homozygosity (ROH) and schizophrenia polygenic risk score (PGRS)- are analyzed in relation to cognitive abilities (n=4183) and brain structure (n=516) in a general-population sample of European-ancestry participants aged 8-22, from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort.\\n\\nThe findings suggest that a higher ROH burden and higher schizophrenia PGRS are associated with higher intelligence. Cognition~ROH and cognition~PGRS associations obtained in this cohort may respectively evidence that assortative mating influences intelligence, and that individuals with high schizophrenia genetic risk who do not transition to disease status are cognitively resilient.\\n\\nNeuroanatomical data showed that the effects of schizophrenia PGRS on cognition could be modulated by brain structure, although larger imaging datasets are needed to accurately disentangle the underlying neural mechanisms linking IQ with both inbreeding and the genetic burden for schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "How olfactory stimuli are perceived as meaningful cues for specific appetitive drives remains poorly understood. Here we show that despite their enormous diversity, Drosophila larvae can discriminatively respond to food-related odor stimuli based on both qualitative and quantitative properties. Perceptual processing of food scents takes place in a neural circuit comprising four dopamine (DA) neurons and a neuropeptide F (NPF) neuron per brain hemisphere. Furthermore, these DA neurons integrate and compress inputs from second-order olfactory neurons into one-dimensional DA signals, while the downstream NPF neuron assigns appetitive significance to limited DA outputs via a D1-type DA receptor (DoplR1)-mediated gating mechanism. Finally, Dop1R, along with a G{beta}13F/Irk2-mediated inhibitory and a Gs-mediated excitatory pathway, underlie a binary precision tuning apparatus that restricts the excitatory response of NPF neurons to DA inputs that fall within an optimum range. Our findings provide fresh molecular and cellular insights into cognitive processing of olfactory cues.",
