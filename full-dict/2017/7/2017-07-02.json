    "abstract": "Human genes exhibit different effects on fitness in cancer and normal cells. Here, we present an evolutionary approach to measure the selection pressure on human genes, using the well-known ratio of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate in both cancer genomes (CN/CS) and normal populations (pN/pS). A new mutation-profile-based method that adopts sample-specific mutation rate profiles instead of conventional substitution models was developed. We found that cancer-specific selection pressure is quite different from the selection pressure at the species and population levels. Both the relaxation of purifying selection on passenger mutations and the positive selection of driver mutations may contribute to the increased CN/CS values of human genes in cancer genomes compared with the pN/pS values in human populations. The CN/CS values also contribute to the improved classification of cancer genes and a better understanding of the onco-functionalization of cancer genes during oncogenesis. The use of our computational pipeline to identify cancer-specific positively and negatively selected genes may provide useful information for understanding the evolution of cancers and identifying possible targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "The branched periphytic green alga Cladophora glomerata, often abundant in nearshore waters of lakes and rivers worldwide, plays important ecosystem roles, some mediated by epibiotic microbiota that benefit from host-provided surface, organic C, and O2. Previous microscopy and high throughput sequencing studies have indicated surprising epibiont taxonomic and functional diversity, but have not included adequate consideration of sample replication or the potential for spatial and temporal variation. Here we report the results of 16S rRNA amplicon-based phylum-to-genus taxonomic analysis of Cladophora-associated bacterial epibiota sampled in replicate from three microsites and at six times during the open-water season of 2014, from the same lake locale (Picnic Point, Lake Mendota, Dane Co., WI, USA) explored by high throughput sequencing studies in two previous years. Statistical methods were used to test null hypotheses that the bacterial community: 1) is homogeneous across microsites tested, and 2) does not change over the course of a growth season or among successive years. Results indicated a dynamic microbial community that is more strongly influenced by sampling day during the growth season than by microsite variation. A surprising diversity of bacterial genera known to be associated with the key function of methane-oxidation (methanotrophy)-including relatively high-abundance of Crenothrix, Methylomonas, and Methylocaldum-showed intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability possibly related to temperature differences, and microsite preferences possibly related to variation in methane abundance. By contrast, a core assemblage of bacterial genera seems to persist over a growth season and from year-to-year, possibly transmitted by a persistent attached host resting stage.",

Ecological mechanisms underlying these impacts are well studied but the role of evolutionary processes is rarely assessed. Using a long-term field experiment, we tested whether natural selection in plant communities increased the effects of biodiversity on productivity. We re-assembled communities with 8-year co-selection history adjacent to communities with identical species composition but no history of co-selection (\\\"naive communities\\\"). Monocultures and in particular mixtures of two to four co-selected species were more productive than their corresponding naive communities over four years in soils with or without co-selected microbial communities. At the highest diversity level of eight plant species, no such differences were observed. Our findings suggest that plant community evolution can lead to rapid increases in ecosystem functioning at low diversity but may take longer at high diversity.

    "abstract": "In this detailed critique of the study proposing using RNA-seq from tumor-educated platelets (TEP) as a  liquid biopsy source [1], several flawed assumptions leave little biological basis behind the statistical computations. First, there is no supporting evidence provided for the FFPE based classification of METoverexpression and EGFR mutation on tumor-tissues. Considering that raw reads of MET expression in a subset of healthy [N=21, mean=112, sd=77] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=11, sd=12] samples (typically with millions of reads) translates into over-expression in reality, providing the data for such computations is vital for future validation. A similar criticism applies for classifying samples based on EGFR mutations (the study uses only exon 20 and 21 from a wide range of possible mutations) with negligible counts [N=24, mean=3, sd=6]. While Ofner et. al, 2017 faced  major problems associated with FFPE DNA, it is also true that Fassunke, et al., 2015 found concordance in 26 out of 26 samples for EGFR mutations in another FFPE-based study. However, Fassunke, et al., 2015 have been meticulous in describing the EGFR amplicons (exon 18 and 19 are missing in the TEP-study). Any error in initial classification renders downstream computations error-prone. The low counts of MET in the RNA-seq firmly establishes that inclusion of genes with such low counts in the set of 1100 discriminatory genes (Table S4) makes no sense as the \\\"real\\\" counts could vary wildly. Yet, TRAT1 is an example of one discriminator gene with counts of healthy [N=21, mean=164, sd=375] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=53, sd=176]. There are many such genes which should be excluded. Moving on to a discriminator with high counts (F13A1) in both healthy [N=21, mean=28228, sd=48581] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=98336, sd=74574] samples, a bonafide platelet gene that \\\"encodes the coagulation factor XIII A subunit\\\". Platelets do not have a nucleus, and thus the blue-print (chromosomes and related machinery) for making or regulating mRNA. They are boot-strapped with mRNA, like F13A1, during origination and then just go on keep collecting mRNA during circulation (which is the premise of their use in liquid biopsy). The assumption that these genes are differentially spliced in huge numbers is highly speculative without providing experimental proof. The discovery of spliceosomes in anucleate platelets [2] in 2005, 30 years after splicing was discovered in the nucleus by Sharp and Robert, probably indicates that spliceosomes are not dominant in platelets. Zucker, et al., 2017 have shown for another gene F11 that it  is present in platelets as pre-mRNA and is spliced upon platelet activation [3]. Any study using the F13A1 gene as a discriminator ought to show the same two things, followed by differential counts in TEP. Ironically, F11 is not present in the discriminator set. Another blood coagulation related gene (TFPI) shows slight over-expression in NSCLC (moderate counts, healthy [N=21, mean=1352, sd=592] and NSCLC [N=24, mean=1854, sd=846]), agreeing with Iversen, et al., 1998 [4], but in contrast to Fei, et al., 2017 [5], demonstrating that the jury is still out on the levels of many such genes. Thus, circulating mRNA from tumor tissues are not discriminatoryif MET is degraded to such levels in platelets  educated by NSCLC tumors, why not other possible mRNA that might have been picked during the same  class? Furthermore, high count genes can only be bona-fide platelet genes, and have no supporting experimental proof of splicing differences (any one gene would suffice to instill some confidence). In conclusion, looking past the statistical smoke surrounding \\\"surrogate signatures\\\", one finds no biological relevance.",

Multiple previous studies have commented on methods for identifying both germline and somatic variants. However, interpreting individual variants remains a significant challenge, relying in large part on the integration of observed variants with biological knowledge. A number of data and software resources have been developed to assist in interpreting observed variants, determining their potential clinical actionability, and augmenting them with ancillary information that can inform clinical decisions and even generate new hypotheses for exploration in the laboratory.

    "abstract": "The DNA repair enzyme polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP) protects genome integrity by restoring ligatable 5-phosphate and 3-hydroxyl termini at single-strand breaks (SSBs). In humans, PNKP mutations underlie the neurological disease known as MCSZ, but these individuals are not predisposed for cancer, implying effective alternative repair pathways in dividing cells. Homology-directed repair (HDR) of collapsed replication forks was proposed to repair SSBs in PNKP-deficient cells, but the critical HDR protein Rad51 is not required in PNKP-null (pnk1{Delta}) cells of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here, we report that pnk1{Delta} cells have enhanced requirements for Rad3 (ATR/Mec1) and Chk1 checkpoint kinases, and the multi-BRCT domain protein Brc1 that binds phospho-histone H2A ({gamma}H2A) at damaged replication forks. The viability of pnk1{Delta} cells depends on Mre11 and Ctp1 (CtIP/Sae2) double-strand break (DSB) resection proteins, Rad52 DNA strand annealing protein, Mus81-Eme1 Holliday junction resolvase, and Rqh1 (BLM/WRN/Sgs1) DNA helicase. Eliminating Pnk1 strongly sensitizes mre11{Delta} pku80{Delta} cells to DNA damaging agents that collapse replication forks, indicating a requirement for Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) protein complex that cannot be efficiently replaced by Exo1 5-3 exonuclease. Coupled with increased sister chromatid recombination and Rad52 repair foci in pnk1{Delta} cells, these findings indicate that lingering SSBs in pnk1{Delta} cells trigger Rad51-independent homology-directed repair of collapsed replication forks.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDNA is constantly damaged by normal cellular metabolism, for example production of reactive oxygen species, or from exposure to external DNA damaging sources, such as radiation from the sun or chemicals in the environment. These genotoxic agents create thousands of single-strand breaks/cell/day in the human body. An essential DNA repair protein known as polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP) makes sure the single-strand breaks have 5 phosphate and 3 hydroxyl ends suitable for healing by DNA ligase. Mutations that reduce PNKP activity cause a devastating neurological disease but surprisingly not cancer, suggesting that other DNA repair mechanisms step into the breach in dividing PNKP-deficient cells. One popular candidate was homology-directed repair (HDR) of replication forks that collapse at single-strand breaks, but the crucial HDR protein Rad51 was found to be non-essential in PNKP-deficient cells of fission yeast. In this study, Sanchez and Russell revive the HDR model by showing that SSBs in PNKP-deficient cells are repaired by a variant HDR mechanism that bypasses the requirement for Rad51. Notably, Mus81 endonuclease that resolves sister chromatid recombination structures formed during HDR of collapsed replication forks was found to be essential in PNKP-deficient cells.",

    "abstract": "Genetic expression of fluorescently labeled proteins is essential to visualizing dynamic behavior within live cells. Recent advances in microscopy have increased resolution to the level where it is now possible to capture individual molecules interacting. However, the criteria for determining whether a fluorescent label perturbs protein function have not undergone a corresponding increase in resolution. The effects of protein labeling on cell function are still judged by whether populations of protein localize and interact with known binding partners. Here we use integrins, bidirectional signal adhesion molecules that regulate interactions between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton through a well-defined series of conformational changes to show that not all labeling strategies are the same. We found that labeling the beta subunit decreased the mobility of individual integrin molecules and the protrusive activity of the entire cell. While integrins with labeled alpha subunits behaved similarly to unlabeled integrins, labeling the beta subunit increased the size of adhesions by elevating integrin affinity and exposing the ligand induced binding domain to change the molecule conformation. Thus, our single molecule and cellular data indicate that the ability of labeled proteins to localize and interact with known binding partners does not guarantee it does not alter protein function. We propose that the behaviors of individual molecules rather than the ensemble behavior of populations need to be considered as criteria to determine if a probe is non-perturbative.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms driving lineage-specific evolution in both primates and rodents has been hindered by the lack of sister clades with a similar phylogenetic structure having high-quality genome assemblies. Here, we have created chromosome-level assemblies of the Mus caroli and Mus pahari genomes. Together with the Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus genomes, this set of rodent genomes is similar in divergence times to the Hominidae (human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan). By comparing the evolutionary dynamics between the Muridae and Hominidae, we identified punctate events of chromosome reshuffling that shaped the ancestral karyotype of Mus musculus and Mus caroli between 3 to 6 MYA, but that are absent in the Hominidae. In fact, Hominidae show between four-and seven-fold lower rates of nucleotide change and feature turnover in both neutral and functional sequences suggesting an underlying coherence to the Muridae acceleration. Our system of matched, high-quality genome assemblies revealed how specific classes of repeats can play lineage-specific roles in related species. For example, recent LINE activity has remodeled protein-coding loci to a greater extent across the Muridae than the Hominidae, with functional consequences at the species level such as reproductive isolation. Furthermore, we charted a Muridae-specific retrotransposon expansion at unprecedented resolution, revealing how a single nucleotide mutation transformed a specific SINE element into an active CTCF binding site carrier specifically in Mus caroli. This process resulted in thousands of novel, species-specific CTCF binding sites. Our results demonstrate that the comparison of matched phylogenetic sets of genomes will be an increasingly powerful strategy for understanding mammalian biology.",

In particular, we assemble multiple data sources including gene expression data, genome-wide binding data, gene ontology, known pathways and use a supervised learning framework to compute prior probabilities of regulatory relationships. We show that our integrated method improves the accuracy of inferred gene networks. We apply our method to two different human cell lines, which illustrates the general scope of our method.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a flexible and systematic framework for external data integration that improves the accuracy of human gene network inference while retaining efficiency. Integrating various data sources of biological information also provides a systematic way to build on knowledge from existing literature.",

    "abstract": "Environmental heterogeneity is known to modulate the interactions between pathogens and hosts. However, the impact of environmental heterogeneity on the structure of host-associated microbial communities, and how these communities respond to pathogenic exposure remain poorly understood. Here we use an experimental framework to probe the links between environmental heterogeneity, skin microbiome structure and infection by the emerging pathogen Ranavirus in a vertebrate host, the European common frog (Rana temporaria). We provide evidence that environmental complexity directly influences the diversity and structure of the host skin microbiome, and that more diverse microbiomes are more resistant to perturbation associated with exposure to Ranavirus. Our data also indicate that host microbiome diversity covaries with survival following exposure to Ranavirus. Our study highlights the importance of extrinsic factors in driving host-pathogen dynamics in vertebrate hosts, and suggests that environment-mediated variation in the structure of the host microbiome may covary with observed differences in host susceptibility to disease in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate that CD8+ T cells are important in the control of HIV-1 (HIV) replication. However, CD8+ T cells induced by natural infection cannot eliminate the virus or reduce viral loads to acceptably low levels in most infected individuals. Understanding the basic quantitative features of CD8+ T-cell responses induced during the course of HIV infection may therefore inform us about the limits that HIV vaccines, which aim to induce protective CD8+ T-cell responses, must exceed. Using previously published experimental data from a cohort of HIV-infected individuals with sampling times from acute to chronic infection we defined the quantitative properties of CD8+ T-cell responses to the whole HIV proteome. In contrast with a commonly held view, we found that the relative number of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses (response breadth) changed little over the course of infection (first 400 days post-infection), with moderate but statistically significant changes occurring only during the first 35 symptomatic days. This challenges the idea that a change in the T-cell response breadth over time is responsible for the slow speed of viral escape from CD8+ T cells in the chronic infection. The breadth of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses was not correlated with the average viral load for our small cohort of patients. Metrics of relative immunodominance of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses such as Shannon entropy or the Evenness index were also not significantly correlated with the average viral load. Our mathematical-model-driven analysis suggested extremely slow expansion kinetics for the majority of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses and the presence of intra- and interclonal competition between multiple CD8+ T-cell responses; such competition may limit the magnitude of CD8+ T-cell responses, specific to different epitopes, and the overall number of T-cell responses induced by vaccination. Further understanding of mechanisms underlying interactions between the virus and virus-specific CD8+ T-cell response will be instrumental in determining which T-cell-based vaccines will induce T-cell responses providing durable protection against HIV infection.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The equal probability of transmission of alleles from either parent during sexual reproduction is a central tenet of genetics and evolutionary biology. Yet, there are many cases where this rule is violated. Such violations limit intraspecific gene flow and can facilitate the formation of genetic barriers, a first step in speciation. Biased transmission of alleles, or segregation distortion, can result from a number of biological processes including epistatic interactions between incompatible loci, gametic selection, and meiotic drive. Examples of these phenomena have been identified in many species, implying that they are universal, but comprehensive species-wide studies of segregation distortion are lacking. We have performed a species-wide screen for distorted allele frequencies in over 500 segregating populations of Arabidopsis thaliana using reduced-representation genome sequencing. Biased transmission of alleles was evident in up to a quarter of surveyed populations. Most populations exhibited distortion at only one genomic region, with some regions being repeatedly affected in multiple populations. Our results begin to elucidate the species-level architecture of biased transmission of genetic material in A. thaliana, and serve as a springboard for future studies into the basis of intraspecific genetic barriers.",

The structure of microbial communities may in turn affect plant performance. Yet, outside of simple systems with pairwise interacting partners, the plant genetic pathways that influence microbial community structure remain largely unknown, as are the performance feedbacks of microbial communities selected by the host plant genotype. We investigated the role of the plant circadian clock in shaping rhizosphere community structure and function. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize rhizosphere bacterial communities of Arabidopsis thaliana between day and night time points, and tested for differences in community structure between wild-type (Ws) vs. clock mutant (toc1-21, ztl-30) genotypes. We then characterized microbial community function, by growing wild-type plants in soils with an overstory history of Ws, toc1-21 or ztl-30 and measuring plant performance. We observed that rhizosphere community structure varied between day and night time points, and clock misfunction significantly altered rhizosphere communities. Finally, wild-type plants germinated earlier and were larger when inoculated with soils having an overstory history of wild-type in comparison to clock mutant genotypes. Our findings suggest the circadian clock of the plant host influences rhizosphere community structure and function.",

Using the growth factor-activated PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, we develop computational and analytical models, and experimentally validate a novel mechanism of relative sensing in mammalian cells. This non-transcriptional mechanism relies on a new form of cellular memory, where cells effectively encode past stimulation levels in the abundance of cognate receptors on the cell surface. We show the robustness and specificity of the relative sensing for two physiologically important ligands, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and across wide ranges of background stimuli. The described memory and sensing mechanism could play a role in multiple other sensory cascades where stimulation leads to a proportional reduction in the abundance of cell surface receptors.",

In this paper, we extend the methodology towards efficient sampling of related mutants by borrowing ideas from transfer learning methods in machine learning. Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states are found in both the wild type (base line) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using Multi-state Bennett Acceptance Ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type. We first benchmark our methodology by re-capturing alanine dipeptide dynamics across a range of different atomistic force fields, including the polarizable Amoeba force field, after learning a set of slow modes using Amber ff99sb-ILDN. We next extend the method by including structural data from the wild type simulation and apply the technique to recapturing the affects of the GTT mutation on the FIP35 WW domain.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 interactor with leucine-rich repeats (Tril) is a transmembrane protein that functions as a coreceptor for Toll-like receptors (Tlrs) to mediate innate immune responses in the adult brain. Tril also triggers degradation of the Bmp inhibitor, Smad7, during early embryonic development to allow for normal blood formation. Tril most likely plays additional, yet to be discovered, roles during embryogenesis. In the current studies, we performed a structure-function analysis, which indicated that the extracellular domain, including the fibronectin type III (FN) domain, and the intracellular domain of Tril are required to trigger Smad7 degradation in the early Xenopus embryo. Furthermore, we found that a Tril deletion mutant lacking the FN domain (Tril{Delta}FN) can dominantly inhibit signaling by endogenous Tril when overexpressed in vivo. This finding raises the intriguing possibility that the FN domain functions to bind endogenous Tril/Tlr4 ligands, perhaps including extracellular matrix molecules. We also show that Tril normally cycles between the cell surface and endosomes, and that the Tril extracellular domain is required to retain Tril at the cell surface, while the intracellular domain is required for Tril internalization in Xenopus ectodermal explants. Using a CHO cell aggregation assay, we further show that, unlike other transmembrane proteins that contain leucine rich repeats in the extracellular domain, Tril is not sufficient to mediate homophilic adhesion. Our findings identify Tril{Delta}FN as a valuable tool that can be used to block the function of endogenous Tril in vivo in order to discover additional roles during embryonic development.",

A large elevational gradient of mature forests on the Tibetan Plateau provides a powerful space-for-time  natural experiment to explore driving forces of spring phenology. Combining 5-yr of in situ phenological observations of Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii) with concurrent air temperature data along two altitudinal gradients on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, we tested the hypothesis that spring frost was a major factor regulating the timing of spring phenology. Onset of bud swelling and leaf unfolding in the study years occurred {approx} 18 or 17 days earlier, respectively, at the lowest (3800 m a.s.l.) elevation relative to upper treelines (4360 or 4380 m a.s.l.). The frequency of freezing events and last freezing date were critical factors in determining the timing of bud swelling along two altitudinal gradients, whereas onset of leaf unfolding was primarily controlled by the onset of bud swelling. This finding provides evidence for detrimental impacts of spring frost on spring phenology, which have been underappreciated in research on phenological sensitivity to climate but should be included in phenology models. It contributes to explain the declining global warming effects on spring phenophases, because climatic extreme events (e.g. spring frosts) tend to increase with warming.",

    "abstract": "Cross-tolerance effects for cold and drought stressors are well known for temperate and polar ectothermic organisms. However, less attention has been paid to plastic changes induced by wet-dry conditions for the tropical insect taxa. Drosophila ananassae is abundant in wet habitats but its desiccation sensitivity is likely to make it vulnerable under expected drought conditions due to climate change. We tested plastic effects of heat hardening, acclimation to drought or starvation; and changes in trehalose, proline and body lipids in D. ananassae flies reared under wet or dry season specific conditions. Wet season flies showed significant increase in heat knockdown, starvation resistance and body lipids after heat hardening. However, accumulation of proline was observed only after desiccation acclimation of dry season flies while wet season flies elicited no proline but trehalose only. Thus, drought induced proline can be a marker metabolite for dry season flies. Further, partial utilization of proline and trehalose under heat hardening reflects their possible thermoprotective effects. Heat hardening elicited cross-protection to starvation stress. Stressor specific accumulation or utilization as well as rates of metabolic change for each energy metabolite were significantly higher in wet season flies than dry season flies. Energy budget changes due to inter-related stressors (heat vs desiccation or starvation) resulted in possible maintenance of energetic homeostasis in wet or dry season flies. Thus, low or high humidity induced plastic changes in energy metabolites can provide cross-protection to seasonally varying climatic stressors.\\n\\nSummary statementIn the tropical Drosophila ananassae, low or high humidity induced plastic changes in energy metabolites provide cross-protection to seasonally varying climatic stressors",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are replete with repeated sequences, in the form of transposable elements (TEs) dispersed across the genome or as satellite arrays, large stretches of tandemly repeated sequence. Many satellites clearly originated as TEs, but it is unclear how mobile genetic parasites can transform into megabase-sized tandem arrays. Comprehensive population genomic sampling is needed to determine the frequency and generative mechanisms of tandem TEs, at all stages from their initial formation to their subsequent expansion and maintenance as satellites. The best available population resources, short-read DNA sequences, are often considered to be of limited utility for analyzing repetitive DNA due to the challenge of mapping individual repeats to unique genomic locations. Here we develop a new pipeline called ConTExt which demonstrates that paired-end Illumina data can be successfully leveraged to identify a wide range of structural variation within repetitive sequence, including tandem elements. Analyzing 85 genomes from five populations of Drosophila melanogaster we discover that TEs commonly form tandem dimers. Our results further suggest that insertion site preference is the major mechanism by which dimers arise and that, consequently, dimers form rapidly during periods of active transposition. This abundance of TE dimers has the potential to provide source material for future expansion into satellite arrays, and we discover one such copy number expansion of the DNA transposon Hobo to ~16 tandem copies in a single line. The very process that defines TEs --transposition-- thus regularly generates sequences from which new satellites can arise.",

However, on passage into one each of RD and L20B cell lines, the CPE was not reproducible. All samples were subjected to RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, the WHO recommended VP1 RT-seminestedPCR assay, species resolution PCR assay, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.\\n\\nSix (6) samples were positive for the VP1 RT-seminested PCR assay. Only four of which were positive by the species resolution PCR assay. The four amplicons were sequenced, however, only three (3) were successfully identified as Coxsackievirus A20 (2 isolates) and Echovirus 29 (1 isolate).\\n\\nThe results of this study unambiguously showed the presence of NPEVs (particularly CVA20 and E29) in cell culture supernatants of samples with CPE on initial inoculation into L20B cell line but with no observed or reproducible CPE on passage in RD cell line. Therefore, like reoviruses, adenoviruses and other non-enteroviruses, NPEVs can also be recovered in cases with non-reproducible CPE.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how nervous systems exploit task relevant properties of sensory stimuli to perform natural tasks is fundamental to the study of perceptual systems. However, there are few formal methods for determining which stimulus properties are most useful for a given task. As a consequence, it is difficult to develop principled models for how to compute task-relevant latent variables from natural signals, and it is difficult to evaluate descriptive models fit to neural response. Accuracy Maxmization Analysis (AMA) is a recently developed Bayesian method for finding the optimal task-specific filters (receptive fields). Here, we introduce AMA-Gauss, a new faster form of AMA that incorporates the assumption that the class-conditional filter responses are Gaussian distributed. Next, we use AMA-Gauss to show that its assumptions are justified for two fundamental visual tasks: retinal speed estimation and binocular disparity estimation. Then, we show that AMA-Gauss has striking formal similarities to popular quadratic models of neural response: the energy model and the Generalized Quadratic Model (GQM). Together, these developments deepen our understanding of why the energy model of neural response have proven useful, improve our ability to evaluate results from subunit model fits to neural data, and should help accelerate psychophysics and neuroscience research with natural stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic sequence learning involves a set of robust mechanisms that enable the extraction of statistical patterns embedded in the environment. It contributes to different perceptual and cognitive processes as well as to effective behavior adaptation, which is a crucial aspect of decision making. Although previous research attempted to model reinforcement learning and reward sensitivity in different risky decision-making paradigms, the basic mechanism of the sensitivity to statistical regularities has not been anchored to external tasks. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the statistical learning mechanism underlying individual differences in risky decision making. To reach this goal, we tested whether implicit probabilistic sequence learning and risky decision making share common variance. To have a more complex characterization of individual differences in risky decision making, hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on performance data obtained in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) in a large sample of healthy young adults. Implicit probabilistic sequence learning was measured by the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task. According to the results, a four-cluster structure was identified involving average risk-taking, slowly responding, risk-taker, and risk-averse groups of participants, respectively. While the entire sample showed significant learning on the ASRT task, we found greater sensitivity to statistical regularities in the risk-taker and risk-averse groups than in participants with average risk-taking. These findings revealed common mechanisms in risky decision making and implicit probabilistic sequence learning and an adaptive aspect of higher risk taking on the BART. Our results could help to clarify the neurocognitive complexity of decision making and its individual differences.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) predominantly respond to a patch of the visual input, their classical receptive field. These responses are modulated by the visual input in the surround [2]. This reflects the fact that features in natural scenes do not occur in isolation: lines, surfaces are generally continuous, and the surround provides context for the information in the classical receptive field. It is generally assumed that the information in the near surround is transmitted via lateral connections between neurons in the same area [2]. A series of large scale efforts have recently described the relation between lateral connectivity and visual evoked responses and found like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons [16, 18]. Additionally, specific cell type connectivity for inhibitory neuron types has been described [11, 31]. Current normative models of cortical function relying on sparsity [27], saliency [4] predict functional inhibition between similarly tuned neurons. What computations are consistent with the observed structure of the lateral connections between the excitatory and diverse types of inhibitory neurons?\\n\\nWe combined natural scene statistics [24] and mouse V1 neuron responses [7] to compute the lateral connections and computations of individual neurons which optimally integrate information from the classical receptive field with that from the surround by directly implementing Bayes rule. This increases the accuracy of representation of a natural scene under noisy conditions. We show that this network has like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons, similar to the observed one [16, 18, 11], and has three types of inhibition: local normalization, surround inhibition and gating of inhibition from the surround - that can be attributed to three classes of inhibitory neurons. We hypothesize that this computation: optimal integration of contextual cues with a gate to ignore context when necessary is a general property of cortical circuits, and the rules constructed for mouse V1 generalize to other areas and species.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a brain disorder of unknown etiology. Brain imaging studies have revealed evidence for hypoperfusion of the frontal cortex (hypofrontality) and progressive brain volume reduction in schizophrenic patients. Mild cerebral ischemia (oligemia) has been postulated as a cause of the disorder. If the ischemia hypothesis for the adult brain is correct, genes induced by cerebral ischemia should be increased in the frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients during acute psychosis. Here, we show for the first time through a combined analysis of gene expression data from all the studies of the Stanley Brain Collection covering the Brodmann area 46 of the frontal cortex and employing the well-established Affymetrix HGU133a microarray platform that genes upregulated by cerebral ischemia are significantly overexpressed (4.5-fold) in the frontal cortex of acute schizophrenic patients (representation factor (RF) 4.5, p < 0.0002) and to a lesser degree in chronic patients (RF 3.9, p < 0.008) in comparison to normal controls. Neurodevelopmental-, repair-, inflammation- and synapse-related genes showed no significant change. The difference between acute and chronic schizophrenic patients regarding cerebral ischemia-induced genes was highly significant (RF 2.8, p < 0.00007). The results reported here are in line with evidence from biochemical, cellular, electroencephalographic, brain imaging, cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy, vascular, and genetic association studies. In summary, our genomic analysis revealed a clear ischemic signature in the frontal cortex of schizophrenia patients, confirming the prediction of the adult ischemia hypothesis for this disorder. This finding suggests new possibilities for the treatment and prevention of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate decoding methods were developed originally as tools to enable accurate predictions in real-world applications. The realization that these methods can also be employed to study brain function has led to their widespread adoption in the neurosciences. However, prior to the rise of multivariate decoding, the study of brain function was firmly embedded in a statistical philosophy grounded on univariate methods of data analysis. In this way, multivariate decoding for brain interpretation grew out of two established frameworks: multivariate decoding for predictions in real-world applications, and classical univariate analysis based on the study and interpretation of brain activation. We argue that this led to two confusions, one reflecting a mixture of multivariate decoding for prediction or interpretation, and the other a mixture of the conceptual and statistical philosophies underlying multivariate decoding and classical univariate analysis. Here we attempt to systematically disambiguate multivariate decoding for the study of brain function from the frameworks it grew out of. After elaborating these confusions and their consequences, we describe six, often unappreciated, differences between classical univariate analysis and multivariate decoding. We then focus on how the common interpretation of what is signal and noise changes in multivariate decoding. Finally, we use four examples to illustrate where these confusions may impact the interpretation of neuroimaging data. We conclude with a discussion of potential strategies to help resolve these confusions in interpreting multivariate decoding results, including the potential departure from multivariate decoding methods for the study of brain function.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe highlight two sources of confusion that affect the interpretation of multivariate decoding results\\nC_LIO_LIOne confusion arises from the dual use of multivariate decoding for predictions in real-world applications and for interpretation in terms of brain function\\nC_LIO_LIThe other confusion arises from the different statistical and conceptual frameworks underlying classical univariate analysis to multivariate decoding\\nC_LIO_LIWe highlight six differences between classical univariate analysis and multivariate decoding and differences in the interpretation of signal and noise\\nC_LIO_LIThese confusions are illustrated in four examples revealing assumptions and limitations of multivariate decoding for interpretation\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The ability to inhibit our responses voluntarily is an important case of cognitive control. The stop-signal paradigm is a popular tool to study response inhibition. Participants perform a response time task (go task) and, occasionally, the go stimulus is followed by a stop signal after a variable delay, indicating subjects to withhold their response (stop task). The main interest of modeling is in estimating the unobservable stop-signal processing time, that is, the covert latency of the stopping process as a characterization of the response inhibition mechanism. In the independent race model the stop-signal task is represented as a race between stochastically independent go and stop processes. Without making any specific distributional assumptions about the processing times, the model allows to estimate the mean time to cancel a response. However, neurophysiological studies on countermanding saccadic eye movements have shown that neural correlates of go and stop processes consist of networks of mutually interacting gaze-shifting and gaze-holding neurons. This poses a major challenge in formulating linking propositions between the behavioral and neural findings. Here we propose a dependent race model that postulates perfect negative stochastic dependence between go and stop activations. The model is consistent with the concept of interacting processes while retaining the simplicity and elegance of the distribution-free independent race model. For mean data, the dependent models predictions remain identical to those of the independent model. The resolution of this apparent paradox advances the understanding of mechanisms of response inhibition and paves the way for modeling more complex situations.",

    "abstract": "In grassland biodiversity experiments the positive biodiversityn-ecosystem functioning relationship generally increases over time. However, we know little about the underlying short-term evolutionary processes. Using five plant species selected for twelve years in a biodiversity experiment in mixture or monoculture and plants without such a selection history, we assessed whether differential selection altered productivity, biodiversity effects, and functional trait differences within newly assembled monocultures and 2-species mixtures. Plants without past community selection history produced the lowest assemblage biomass and showed the weakest biodiversity effects. In newly assembled mixtures, plants with a selection history in mixtures produced more biomass than plants with a monoculture selection history. Biodiversity effects were generally positive and differed significantly between selection histories. However, contrary to our expectations, biodiversity effects were not stronger for mixture-type plants. Biodiversity effects were influenced by both trait differences between plants and community-weighted means, but these relationships were mostly independent of selection history. Our findings suggest that twelve years of selection history in monocultures or species mixtures differentiated plants of each species into monoculture- and mixture-types. Such rapid evolution of different community-types within grassland species and its effect on ecosystem services and functioning are likely to be important for species conservation practice.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma is an undifferentiated bone-associated cancer. Although molecular detection of pathognomonic EWSR1-ETS fusions such as EWSR1-FLI1 enables definitive diagnosis, substantial confusion can arise if molecular diagnostics are unavailable. Diagnosis based solely on the conventional immunohistochemical marker CD99 is unreliable due to its abundant expression in morphological mimics. This study aimed to identify novel diagnostic immunohistochemical markers for Ewing sarcoma.\\n\\nWe analyzed 768 expression microarrays representing 21 tumor entities including Ewing-like sarcomas to nominate candidate biomarkers. These candidates were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 174 samples. Microarray, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, and reporter assays were employed to analyze their EWSR1-FLI1-dependency.\\n\\nOur comparative expression analyses revealed that ATP1A1, BCL11B, and GLG1 constitute specific markers for Ewing sarcoma. Analysis of ChIP-Seq and microarray datasets showed that their expression is EWSR1-FLI1-dependent. This outcome corresponded to EWSR1-FLI1-binding to proximal super-enhancers, which showed high activity in reporter assays. Consistently, high ATP1A1, BCL11B, and GLG1 expressions were detected by IHC. Automated cut-off-finding and combination-testing in the TMA demonstrated that detection of high BCL11B and/or GLG1 expression is sufficient to reach 96% specificity for Ewing sarcoma. While 88% of tested Ewing-like sarcomas displayed strong CD99-immunoreactivity, none displayed combined high expression of BCL11B and GLG1.\\n\\nCollectively, we provide evidence that ATP1A1, BCL11B, and GLG1 are EWSR1-FLI1 targets, of which BCL11B and GLG1 offer a fast, simple and cost-efficient way to diagnose Ewing sarcoma by IHC. We anticipate that these markers will significantly reduce the number of misdiagnosed patients, and thus improve patient care.",
