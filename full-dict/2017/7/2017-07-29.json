    "abstract": "The cerebellum aids the learning and execution of fast coordinated movements, with acquired information being stored by plasticity of parallel fibre--Purkinje cell synapses. According to the current consensus, erroneously active parallel fibre synapses are depressed by complex spikes arising when climbing fibres signal movement errors. However, this theory cannot solve the credit assignment problem of using the limited information from a global movement evaluation to optimise behaviour by guiding the plasticity in numerous neurones. We identify the possible implementation of an algorithm solving this problem, whereby spontaneous complex spikes perturb ongoing movements, create an eligibility trace for plasticity and signal resulting error changes to guide plasticity. These error changes are extracted by adaptively cancelling the average error. This framework, stochastic gradient descent with estimated global errors, generates specific predictions for synaptic plasticity rules that contradict the current consensus. However, in vitro plasticity experiments under physiological conditions verified our predictions, highlighting the sensitivity of plasticity studies to unphysiological conditions. Using numerical and analytical approaches we demonstrate the convergence and estimate the capacity of learning in our implementation. Finally, a similar mechanism may operate during optimisation of action sequences by the basal ganglia, where dopamine could both initiate movements and signal rewards, analogously to the dual perturbation and correction role of the climbing fibre outlined here.",

    "abstract": "Noncoding regulatory variants play a central role in the genetics of human diseases and in evolution. Here we measure allele-specific transcription factor binding occupancy of three liver-specific transcription factors between crosses of two inbred mouse strains to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying transcription factor binding variations in mammals. Our results highlight the pre-eminence of cis-acting variants on transcription factor occupancy divergence. Transcription factor binding differences linked to cis-acting variants generally exhibit additive inheritance, while those linked to trans-acting variants are most often dominantly inherited. Cis-acting variants lead to local coordination of transcription factor occupancies that decay with distance; distal coordination is also observed and may be modulated by long-range chromatin contacts. Our results reveal the regulatory mechanisms that interplay to drive transcription factor occupancy, chromatin state, and gene expression in complex mammalian cell states.",

    "abstract": "Characteristics of male courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster have been well-described, but the genetic basis of male-female copulation is largely unknown. Here we show that the white (w) gene, a classical gene for eye color, is associated with copulation success. 82.5 % of wild-type Canton-S flies copulated within 60 minutes in circular arenas, whereas few white-eyed mutants mated successfully. The w+ allele exchanged to the X chromosome or duplicated to the Y chromosome in the white-eyed genetic background rescued the defect of copulation success. The w+-associated copulation success was independent of eye color phenotype. Addition of the mini-white (mw+) gene to the white-eyed mutant rescued the defect of copulation success in a manner that was mw+ copy number-dependent. Lastly, male-female sexual experience mimicked the effects of w+/mw+ in improving successful copulation. These data suggest that the w+ gene controls copulation success in Drosophila melanogaster.",

In the canonical model, left inferior frontal regions are mostly involved in processing based on phonological, syntactic and semantic features of language, whereas the right inferior frontal regions process paralinguistic aspects like affective prosody.\\n\\nUsing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based probabilistic fiber tracking in 20 healthy volunteers, we identify a callosal fiber system connecting left and right inferior frontal regions that are involved in linguistic processing of varying complexity. Anatomically, we show that the interhemispheric fibers are highly aligned and distributed along a rostral to caudal gradient in the body and genu of the corpus callosum to connect homotopic inferior frontal regions.\\n\\nIn light of converging data, taking previous DTI-based tracking studies and clinical case studies into account, our findings suggest that the right inferior frontal cortex not only processes paralinguistic aspects of language (such as affective prosody), as purported by the canonical model, but also supports the computation of linguistic aspects of varying complexity in the human brain. Our model may explain patterns of right hemispheric contribution to stroke recovery as well as disorders of prosodic processing. Beyond language-related brain function, we discuss how interspecies differences in interhemispheric connectivity and fiber density, including the system we described here, may also explain differences in transcallosal information transfer and cognitive abilities across different mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense mutations in the ASPM gene have been most frequently identified among familial microcephaly patients. Depletion of the Drosophila orthologue causes spindle pole unfocusing during mitosis in multiple cell types. However, it remains unknown whether human ASPM has a similar function. Here, using CRISPR-based gene knockout (KO) and RNA interference combined with auxin-inducible degron, we show that ASPM functions in spindle pole organisation during mitotic metaphase redundantly with another microcephaly protein CDK5RAP2 (also called CEP215) in human tissue culture cells. Deletion of the ASPM gene alone did not affect spindle morphology or mitotic progression. However, when the pericentriolar material protein CDK5RAP2 was depleted in ASPM KO cells, spindle poles were unfocused during prometaphase and anaphase onset was significantly delayed. The phenotypic analysis of CDK5RAP2-depleted cells suggested that the pole-focusing function of CDK5RAP2 is independent of its known function to localise the kinesin-14 motor HSET or activate the{gamma} -tubulin complex. Finally, a hypomorphic mutation identified in ASPM microcephaly patients similarly caused spindle pole unfocusing in the absence of CDK5RAP2, suggesting a possible link between spindle pole disorganisation and microcephaly.",

    "abstract": "The Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complex plays an important role in chromosome organization and segregation in most living organisms. In Caulobacter crescentus, SMC is required to align the left and the right arms of the chromosome that run in parallel down the long axis of the cell. However, the mechanism of SMC-mediated alignment of chromosomal arms remains elusive. Here, using a genome-wide chromosome conformation capture assay (Hi-C), chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microscopy of single cells, we show that Caulobacter SMC is recruited to the centromeric parS site and that SMC-mediated arm alignment depends on the chromosome partitioning protein ParB. We provide evidence that SMC likely tethers the parS-proximal regions of the chromosomal arms together, promoting arm alignment. Strikingly, the co-orientation of DNA replication and the transcription of highly-expressed genes is crucial for chromosome-wide alignment. Highly-transcribed genes near parS that are oriented against DNA replication disrupt arm alignment suggesting that head-on transcription interferes with SMC translocation and arm alignment. Our results demonstrate a tight interdependence of bacterial chromosome organization and global patterns of transcription.",

Previous phenomenological studies of the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria have demonstrated strong positive sexual and fecundity selection on male and female size. Nevertheless, the body size of flies from a Swiss study population has declined by almost 10% from 1993 to 2009. Given substantial heritability of body size, this negative evolutionary response of an evidently positively selected trait suggests important selective factors being missed (e.g. size-selective predation or parasitism). A periodic epidemic outbreak of the fungus Entomophthora scatophagae allowedassessment of selection exerted by this parasite fatal to adult flies. Fungal infection varied over the season from ca. 50% in the cooler and more humid spring and autumn to almost 0% in summer. The probability of dying from fungal infection increased with adult body size. All infected females died before laying eggs, so there was no fungus impact on female fecundity beyond its impact on mortality. Large males showed the typical mating advantage in the field, but this pattern of positive sexual selection was nullified by fungal infection. Mean fluctuating asymmetry of paired appendages (legs, wings) did not affect the viability, fecundity or mating success of yellow dung flies in the field. This study demonstrates rare parasite-mediated disadvantages of large adult body size in the field. Reduced ability to combat parasites such as Entomophthora may be an immunity cost of large size in dung flies, although the hypothesized trade-off between fluctuating asymmetry, a presumed indicator of developmental instability and environmental stress, and immunocompetence was not found here.",

Can simpler molecular mechanisms, designed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract coupled chemical reactions have been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems, identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base pairing interactions alone suffice for arbitrarily complex dynamics. Our results argue that autonomous molecular systems that interact with and control their chemical environment can be designed via molecular programming languages.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPPositive density dependence can create a threshold of population states below which extinction of the population occurs. The existence of this threshold, which can often be a complex, multi-dimensional surface, rather than a single point, is of particular importance in degraded populations for which there is a desire for successful restoration. Here, we incorporated positive density dependence into a closed, size- and age-structured integral projection model parameterized with empirical data from an Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, population in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. To understand the properties of the threshold surface, and implications for restoration, we introduced a general method based on a linearization of the threshold surface at its unique, unstable equilibrium. We estimated the number of oysters of a particular age (i.e. stock enhancement), or the surface area of hard substrate required (i.e. habitat enhancement), to move a population from an extinction trajectory to a persistent trajectory. The location of the threshold surface was strongly affected by changes in the amount of local larval retention. Traditional stock enhancement with oysters less than a year old (i.e. spat) required three times as many oysters relative to stock enhancement with oysters between ages three and seven, while the success of habitat enhancement depended upon the initial size distribution of the population. The methodology described here demonstrates the importance of considering positive density dependence in oyster populations, and also provides insights into effective management and restoration strategies when dealing with a high dimensional threshold separating extinction and persistence.",

To identify genomic regions associated with metabolic syndrome, a disorder of energy utilization and storage affecting several organ systems, we compared two Lyon rat strains, LH/Mav which is susceptible to MetS, and LL/Mav, which is susceptible to obesity as an intermediate MetS phenotype, with a third strain (LN/Mav) that is resistant to both MetS and obesity. Applying a novel metric, we ranked the identified strain-specific haplotypes using evolutionary conservation of the occupancy three liver-specific transcription factors (HNF4A, CEBPA, and FOXA1) in five rodents including rat.\\n\\nConsideration of regulatory information effectively identified regions with liver-associated genes and rat orthologues of human GWAS variants related to obesity and metabolic traits. We attempted to find possible causative variants and compared them with the candidate genes proposed by previous studies. In strain-specific regions with conserved regulation, we found a significant enrichment for published evidence to obesity--one of the metabolic symptoms shown by the Lyon strains--amongst the genes assigned to promoters with strain-specific variation.\\n\\nOur results show that the use of functional regulatory conservation is a potentially effective approach to select strain-specific genomic regions associated with phenotypic differences among Lyon rats and could be extended to other systems.",

To investigate the effects of estrogen on osteoblasts, we treated MC3T3-E1 cells with various concentrations of estrogen and assessed their proliferation. Next, we performed RNA deep sequencing to investigate the effects on estrogen target genes. Bmpr1a and Tgfbr1, important participants in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, were down-regulated in our deep sequencing results. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that estrogen receptor response elements (EREs) were present in the Bmpr1a and Tgfbr1 promoters.

We find that deleting Nhx1 disrupts the fusogenicity of the MVB, not vacuole, by targeting pH-sensitive machinery downstream of the Rab-GTPase Ypt7 needed for SNARE-mediated lipid bilayer merger.
