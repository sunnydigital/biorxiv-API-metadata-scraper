    "abstract": "Modern scientific studies from many diverse areas of research abound with multiple hypothesis testing concerns. The false discovery rate is one of the most commonly used error rates for measuring and controlling rates of false discoveries when performing multiple tests. Adaptive false discovery rates rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in false discovery rate estimator. Our case study concerns a genome-wise association meta-analysis which considers associations with body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates. We further evaluate our approach via a number of simulation scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Multiple methods have been introduced over the past 30 years to identify the genomic insertion sites of transposable elements and other DNA elements that integrate into genomes. However, each of these methods suffer from limitations that can frustrate attempts to map multiple insertions in a single genome and to map insertions in genomes of high complexity that contain extensive repetitive DNA. I introduce a new method for transposon mapping that is simple to perform, can accurately map multiple insertions per genome, and generates long sequence \\\"reads\\\" that facilitate mapping to complex genomes. The method, called TagMap, for Tagmentation-based Mapping, relies on a modified Tn5 tagmentation protocol with a single tagmentation adaptor followed by PCR using primers specific to the tranposable element and the adaptor sequence. Several minor modifications to normal tagmentation reagents and protocols allow easy and rapid preparation of TagMap libraries. Short read sequencing starting from the adaptor sequence generates oriented reads that flank and are oriented toward the transposable element insertion site. The convergent orientation of adjacent reads at the insertion site allows straightforward prediction of the precise insertion site(s). A Linux shell script is provided to identify insertion sites from fastq files.",

    "abstract": "Research in neuroscience relies increasingly on the mouse, a mammalian species that affords unparalleled genetic tractability and brain atlases. Here we introduce high-yield methods for probing mouse visual decisions. Mice are head-fixed, which facilitates repeatable visual stimulation, eye tracking, and brain access. They turn a steering wheel to make two-alternative choices, forced or unforced. Learning is rapid thanks to intuitive coupling of stimuli to wheel position. The mouse decisions deliver high-quality psychometric curves for detection and discrimination, and conform to the predictions of a simple probabilistic observer model. The task is readily paired with two-photon imaging of cortical activity. Optogenetic inactivation reveals that the task requires the visual cortex. Mice are motivated to perform the task by fluid reward or optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. This stimulation elicits larger number of trials and faster learning. These methods provide a platform to accurately probe mouse vision and its neural basis.",

    "abstract": "Sleep deprivation has been reported to affect intrinsic brain connectivity, notably reducing connectivity in the default mode network. Studies to date have however shown inconsistent effects, in many cases lacked monitoring of wakefulness, and largely included young participants. We investigated effects of sleep deprivation on intrinsic brain connectivity in young and older participants. Participants aged 20-30 (n=30) and 65-75 (n=23) years underwent partial sleep deprivation (3h sleep) in a cross-over design, with two 8-minutes eyes-open resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) runs in each session, monitored by eye-tracking. We assessed intrinsic brain connectivity using independent components analysis (ICA) as well as seed-region analyses of functional connectivity, and also analysed global signal variability, regional homogeneity, and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability. In our study, changes in investigated resting state networks and in regional homogeneity were not statistically significant. Younger participants had higher connectivity in most examined networks, as well as higher regional homogeneity in areas including anterior and posterior cingulate cortex. In conclusion, we found that sleep deprivation caused increased global signal variability. We speculate that this may be caused by wake-state instability.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae becomes competent for genetic transformation when exposed to an autoinducer peptide named CSP. This peptide was originally described as a quorum-sensing (QS) signal, enabling individual cells to regulate competence in response to population density. However, recent studies suggest that CSP may instead serve as a probe for sensing environmental cues, such as antibiotic stress or environmental diffusion. Here, we show that competence induction can be simultaneously influenced by cell density, external pH, antibiotic-induced stress and cell history. Our experimental data is explained by a mathematical model where the environment and cell history modify how cells produce or sense CSP. Taken together, model and experiments indicate that autoinducer concentration can function as an indicator of cell density across environmental conditions, while also incorporating information on environmental factors or cell history, allowing cells to integrate cues such as antibiotic stress into their QS response. This unifying perspective may apply to other debated QS systems.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence of a \\\"set-point\\\" for body weight in the brain, that is regulated by the hypothalamus. This system modifies feeding behavior and metabolic rate, to keep body fat within predetermined parameters. It is also known that animals subjected to chronic centrifugation show a reduction in body fat. Experiments with mutant mice found that this loss of fat appears to be mediated by a vestibulo-hypothalamic pathway. Vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), also known as galvanic vestibular stimulation, involves non-invasively stimulating the vestibular system by applying a small electrical current between two electrodes placed over the mastoid processes. We suggest that any means of repeatedly stimulating the otolith organs in humans would cause a reduction in total body fat, and that VeNS would be a useful technique to use in this regard. Below we provide pilot data to support this idea.",

However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity, and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial. We approach this puzzle from a reinforcement learning perspective: what kind of spatial representation is most useful for maximizing future reward? We show that the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensional basis set for the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical planning.",

    "abstract": "Species in the genus Cercospora cause economically devastating diseases in sugar beet, maize, rice, soy bean and other major food crops. Here we sequenced the genome of the sugar beet pathogen C. beticola and found it encodes 63 putative secondary metabolite gene clusters, including the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis (CTB) cluster. We show that the CTB gene cluster has experienced multiple duplications and horizontal transfers across a spectrum of plant pathogenic fungi, including the wide host range Colletotrichum genus as well as the rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Although cercosporin biosynthesis has been thought to-date to rely on an eight gene CTB cluster, our phylogenomic analysis revealed gene collinearity adjacent to the established cluster in all CTB cluster-harboring species. We demonstrate that the CTB cluster is larger than previously recognized and includes cercosporin facilitator protein (CFP) previously shown to be involved with cercosporin auto-resistance, and four additional genes required for cercosporin biosynthesis including the final pathway enzymes that install the unusual cercosporin methylenedioxy bridge. Finally, we demonstrate production of cercosporin by Colletotrichum fioriniae, the first known cercosporin producer within this agriculturally important genus. Thus, our results provide new insight into the intricate evolution and biology of a toxin critical to agriculture and broaden the production of cercosporin to another fungal genus containing many plant pathogens of important crops worldwide.\\n\\nSignificance StatementSpecies in the fungal genus Cercospora cause diseases in many important crops worldwide. Their success as pathogens is largely due to the secretion of cercosporin during infection. We report that the cercosporin toxin biosynthesis (CTB) cluster is ancient and was horizontally transferred to diverse fungal pathogens on an unprecedented scale. Since these analyses revealed genes adjacent to the established CTB cluster, we evaluated their role in C. beticola to show that four are necessary for cercosporin biosynthesis. Finally, we confirmed that the apple pathogen Colletotrichum fioriniae produces cercosporin, the first case outside the family Mycosphaerellaceae. Other Colletotrichum plant pathogens also harbor the CTB cluster, which points to a wider concern that this toxin may play in virulence and human health.",

    "abstract": "Proper neural circuit formation requires the precise regulation of neuronal migration, axon guidance and dendritic arborization. Mutations affecting the function of the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy that is frequently associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Despite its importance in brain development, the role for dystroglycan in regulating retinal development remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of dystroglycanopathy (ISPDL79*) and conditional dystroglycan mutants of both sexes, we show that dystroglycan is critical for the proper migration, axon guidance and dendritic stratification of neurons in the inner retina. Using genetic approaches, we show that dystroglycan functions in neuroepithelial cells as an extracellular scaffold to maintain the integrity of the retinal inner limiting membrane (ILM). Surprisingly, despite the profound disruptions in inner retinal circuit formation, spontaneous retinal activity is preserved. These results highlight the importance of dystroglycan in coordinating multiple aspects of retinal development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extracellular environment plays a critical role in coordinating neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth during neural circuit development. The transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan functions as a receptor for multiple extracellular matrix proteins, and its dysfunction leads to a form of muscular dystrophy frequently associated with neurodevelopmental defects. Our results demonstrate that dystroglycan is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) in the developing retina. In the absence of functional dystroglycan, ILM degeneration leads to defective migration, axon guidance and mosaic spacing of neurons, and a loss of multiple neuron types during retinal development. These results demonstrate that disorganization of retinal circuit development is a likely contributor to visual dysfunction in patients with dystroglycanopathy.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions are an ubiquitous feature of genetic variation. Theoretical models describe several mechanisms by which inversions can drive adaptation and be maintained as polymorphisms. While inversions have been shown previously to be under selection, or contain genetic variation under selection, the specific phenotypic consequences of inversions leading to their maintenance remain unclear. Here we use genomic sequence and expression data from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel to explore the effects of two cosmopolitan inversions, In(2L)t and In(3R)Mo, on patterns of transcriptional variation. We demonstrate that each inversion has a significant effect on transcript abundance for hundreds of genes across the genome. Inversion affected loci (IAL) appear both within inversions as well as on unlinked chromosomes. Importantly, IAL do not appear to be influenced by the previously reported genome-wide expression correlation structure. We found that five genes involved with sterol uptake, four of which are Niemann-Pick Type 2 orthologs, are upregulated in flies with In(3R)Mo but do not have SNPs in LD with the inversion. We speculate that this upregulation is driven by genetic variation in mod(mdg4) that is in LD with In(3R)Mo. We find that there is little evidence for regional or position effect of inversions on gene expression at the chromosomal level but do find evidence for the distal breakpoint of In(3R)Mo interrupting one gene and possibly disassociating the two flanking genes from regulatory elements.",

Our patch-clamp recordings, together with finite-element simulations of acoustic field parameters indicate that Piezo1 channels are activated by continuous wave US at 43 MHz and 50 or 90 W/cm2 through cell membrane stress caused by acoustic streaming. NaV1.2 channels were not affected through this mechanism at these intensities, but their kinetics could be accelerated by US-induced heating.",

    "abstract": "Executive function (EF) is a regulatory construct of learning and general cognitive abilities. Genetic variations underlying the architecture of cognitive phenotypes are likely to affect EF and associated behaviors. Mice lacking one of Ntng gene paralogs, encoding the vertebrate brain-specific presynaptic Netrin-G proteins, exhibit prominent deficits in the EF control. Brain areas responsible for gating the bottom-up and top-down information flows differentially express Ntng1 and Ntng2, distinguishing neuronal circuits involved in perception and cognition. As a result, high and low cognitive demand tasks (HCD and LCD, respectively) modulate Ntng1 and Ntng2 associations either with attention and impulsivity (AI) or working memory (WM), in a complementary manner. During the LCD Ntng2supported neuronal gating of AI and WM dominates over the Ntng1-associated circuits. This is reversed during the HCD, when the EF requires a larger contribution of cognitive control, supported by Ntng1, over the Ntng2 pathways. Since human NTNG orthologs have been reported to affect human IQ (1), and an array of neurological disorders (2), we believe that mouse Ntng gene paralogs serve an analogous role but influencing brain executive functioning.",

Here we report a phylo-transcriptomic analysis of neuropeptide precursors in over fifty species of brittle stars (Class Ophiuroidea; Phylum Echinodermata).\\n\\nResultsDetailed analysis of transcriptome sequence data from three brittle star species, Ophionotus victoriae, Amphiura filiformis and Ophiopsila aranea, enabled the first comprehensive identification of neuropeptide precursors in ophiuroids. Representatives of over thirty bilaterian neuropeptide precursor families were identified, some of which occur as paralogs (e.g. thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, cholecystokinin, somatostatin and pedal peptide). Furthermore, homologs of endothelin/CCHamide, eclosion hormone, neuropeptide-F/Y and nucleobinin/nesfatin were discovered here in a deuterostome/echinoderm for the first time. The majority of ophiuroid neuropeptide precursors contain a single copy of a neuropeptide, but several precursors comprise multiple copies of identical or non-identical, but structurally-related, neuropeptides. Here we performed an unprecedented investigation of the evolution of neuropeptide copy-number over a period of ~270 million years by analysing sequence data from over fifty ophiuroid species, with reference to a robust phylogeny. Interestingly, the number of neuropeptide copies in the majority of precursors was constant across all the species examined, but examples of clade-specific losses/gains of neuropeptides were also observed.\\n\\nConclusionsWe report here the most comprehensive analysis to date of neuropeptide precursors in the phylum Echinodermata, with novel representatives of several bilaterian neuropeptide families discovered for the first time in echinoderms. Furthermore, analysis of precursor proteins comprising multiple copies of identical or related neuropeptides across ~270 million years of ophiuroid evolution indicates that the composition of neuropeptide \\\"cocktails\\\" is functionally important, but with plasticity over long evolutionary time scales.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdentifying phenotypic correlations between complex traits and diseases can provide useful etiological insights. Restricted access to individual-level phenotype data makes it difficult to estimate large-scale phenotypic correlation across the human phenome. State-of-the-art methods, metaCCA and LD score regression, provide an alternative approach to estimate phenotypic correlation using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics.\\n\\nResultsHere, we present an integrated R toolkit, PhenoSpD, to 1) apply metaCCA (or LD score regression) to estimate phenotypic correlations using GWAS summary statistics; and 2) to utilize the estimated phenotypic correlations to inform correction of multiple testing for complex human traits using the spectral decomposition of matrices (SpD). The simulations suggest it is possible to estimate phenotypic correlation using samples with only a partial overlap, but as overlap decreases correlations will attenuate towards zero and multiple testing correction will be more stringent than in perfectly overlapping samples. In a case study, PhenoSpD using GWAS results suggested 324.4 independent tests among 452 metabolites, which is close to the 296 independent tests estimated using true phenotypic correlation. We further applied PhenoSpD to estimated 7,503 pair-wise phenotypic correlations among 123 metabolites using GWAS summary statistics from Kettunen et al. and PhenoSpD suggested 44.9 number of independent tests for theses metabolites.\\n\\nConclusionPhenoSpD integrates existing methods and provides a simple and conservative way to reduce dimensionality for complex human traits using GWAS summary statistics, which is particularly valuable for post-GWAS analysis of complex molecular traits.\\n\\nAvailabilityR code and documentation for PhenoSpD V1.0.0 is available online (https://github.com/MRCIEU/PhenoSpD).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbsent adaptive, individualized dose-finding in early-phase oncology trials, subsequent registration trials risk suboptimal dosing that compromises statistical power and lowers the probability of technical success (PTS) for the investigational drug. While much methodological progress has been made toward adaptive dose-finding, and quantitative modeling of dose-response relationships, most such work continues to be organized around a concept of  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). But a new methodology, Dose Titration Algorithm Tuning (DTAT), now holds forth the promise of individualized  MTDi dosing. Relative to such individualized dosing, current  one-size-fits-all dosing practices amount to a constraint that imposes costs on society. This paper estimates the magnitude of these costs.\\n\\nMethodsSimulated dose titration as in (Norris 2017) is extended to 1000 subjects, yielding an empirical MTDi distribution to which a gamma density is fitted. Individual-level efficacy, in terms of the probability of achieving remission, is assumed to be an Emax-type function of dose relative to MTDi, scaled (arbitrarily) to identify MTDi with the LD50 of the individuals tumor. (Thus, a criterion 50% of the population achieve remission under individualized dosing in this analysis.) Current practice is modeled such that all patients receive a first-cycle dose at  the MTD, and those for whom MTDi < MTDthe experience a  dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) that aborts subsequent cycles. Therapy thus terminated is assumed to confer no benefit. Individuals for whom MTDi[&ge;] MTDthe tolerate a full treatment course, and achieve remission with probability determined by the Emax curve evaluated at MTDthe/MTDi. A closed-form expression is obtained for the population remission rate, and maximized numerically over MTDthe as a free parameter, thus identifying the best result achievable under one-size-fits-all dosing. A sensitivity analysis is performed, using both a perturbation of the assumed Emax function, and an antipodal alternative specification.\\n\\nResultsSimulated MTDi follow a gamma distribution with shape parameter  {approx} 1.75. The population remission rate under one-size-fits-all dosing at the maximizing value of MTDthe proves to be a function of the shape parameter--and thus the coefficient of variation (CV)--of the gamma distribution of MTDi. Within a plausible range of CV(MTDi), one-size-fits-all dosing wastes approximately half of the drugs population-level efficacy. In the sensitivity analysis, sensitivity to the perturbation proves to be of second order. The alternative exposure-efficacy specification likewise leaves all results intact.\\n\\nConclusionsThe CV of MTDi determines the efficacy lost under one-size-fits-all dosing at  the MTD. Within plausible ranges for this CV, failure to individualize dosing can effectively halve a drugs value to society. In a competitive environment dominated by regulatory hurdles, this may reduce the value of shareholders investment in the drug to zero.\\n\\nEpilogueThe main result on one-size-fits-all dosing is generalized to regimens with several dose levels. Implications for the ongoing ALTA-1L trial are briefly explored; the 2 dose levels in the brigatinib arm of this trial may lend it a competitive advantage over the single-dose crizotinib arm.",

    "abstract": "The rules by which neurons in neocortex choose their synaptic partners are not fully understood. In sensory cortex, intermingled neurons encode different attributes of sensory inputs and relay them to different long-range targets. While neurons with similar responses to sensory stimuli make connections preferentially, the relationship between synaptic connectivity within an area and long-range projection target remains unclear. We examined the local connectivity and visual responses of primary visual cortex neurons projecting to anterolateral (AL) and posteromedial (PM) higher visual areas in mice. Although the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons projecting to different targets were often similar, they avoided making connections with each other. Thus, projection target acts independently of response similarity to constrain local synaptic connectivity of cortical neurons. We propose that this segregated connectivity rule reduces the crosstalk between different populations of projection neurons, allowing top-down signal to modulate the activity of these output channels independently.",

We carried out meta-analyses of exome array data and three lung function measures: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC (FEV1/FVC). These analyses by the SpiroMeta and CHARGE consortia included 60,749 individuals of European ancestry from 23 studies, and 7,721 individuals of African Ancestry from 5 studies in the discovery stage, with follow-up in up to 111,556 independent individuals. We identified significant (P<2{middle dot}8x10-7) associations with six SNPs: a nonsynonymous variant in RPAP1, which is predicted to be damaging, three intronic SNPs (SEC24C, CASC17 and UQCC1) and two intergenic SNPs near to LY86 and FGF10. eQTL analyses found evidence for regulation of gene expression at three signals and implicated several genes including TYRO3 and PLAU.

While the encoding of speech in the auditory cortex is modulated by selective attention, it remains debated whether such modulation occurs already in subcortical auditory structures. Investigating the contribution of the human brainstem to attention has, in particular, been hindered by the tiny amplitude of the brainstem response. Its measurement normally requires a large number of repetitions of the same short sound stimuli, which may lead to a loss of attention and to neural adaptation. Here we develop a mathematical method to measure the auditory brainstem response to running speech, an acoustic stimulus that does not repeat and that has a high ecological validity. We employ this method to assess the brainstems activity when a subject listens to one of two competing speakers, and show that the brainstem response is consistently modulated by attention.",

While monitoring PSelL expression on activated CD8+ T cells (Tact) in adoptive transfer models, we observed two distinct PSelL on responding donor cells, the canonical cell-intrinsic PSelL PSGL1 and a second undocumented PSelL provisionally named PSL2. PSL2 is unusual among selectin ligands in that it is cell-extrinsic, loaded onto L-selectin (LSel) expressed by Tact but not LSel on resting naive CD8+ T cells. PSL2 expression is highest on Tact responding in peripheral lymph nodes and low on Tact responding in spleen suggesting that the original source of PSL2 is high endothelial venules, cells known to produce LSelL. When both PSGL1 and PSL2 were absent from the surface of Tact, no significant residual PSelL activity was detected. PSL2 is a ligand for both PSel and LSel and can physically bridge the two selectins. The LSel/PSL2 complex can mediate PSel-dependent adherence of Tact to immobilized PSel-hIgG or to activated platelets, either independently or cooperatively with PSGL1. PSel engagement of PSGL1 and LSel/PSL2 would likely deliver distinct signals known to be relevant in leukocyte recruitment.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryMurine primary in-vivo activated CD8+ T cells express two ligands for P-selectin, canonical PSGL-1 and a cell-extrinsic ligand docked on L-selectin.",

Drug response was significantly varied across biomaterials with altered stiffness, dimensionality, and cell-cell contacts, and kinome reprogramming was responsible for these differences in drug sensitivity. Screening across many platforms and applying a systems biology analysis were necessary to identify MEK phosphorylation as the key factor associated with variation in drug response. This method uncovered the combination therapy of sorafenib with a MEK inhibitor, which decreased viability on and within biomaterials in vitro, but was not captured by screening on tissue culture plastic alone. This combination therapy also reduced tumor burden in vivo, and revealed a promising approach for combating adaptive drug resistance.\\n\\nAbstractTraditional drug screening methods lack features of the tumor microenvironment that contribute to resistance. Most studies examine cell response in a single biomaterial platform in depth, leaving a gap in understanding how extracellular signals such as stiffness, dimensionality, and cell-cell contacts act independently or are integrated within a cell to affect either drug sensitivity or resistance. This is critically important, as adaptive resistance is mediated, at least in part, by the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor microenvironment. We developed an approach to screen drug responses in cells cultured on 2D and in 3D biomaterial environments to explore how key features of ECM mediate drug response. This approach uncovered that cells on 2D hydrogels and spheroids encapsulated in 3D hydrogels were less responsive to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-targeting drugs sorafenib and lapatinib, but not cytotoxic drugs, compared to single cells in hydrogels and cells on plastic. We found that transcriptomic differences between these in vitro models and tumor xenografts did not reveal mechanisms of ECM-mediated resistance to sorafenib. However, a systems biology analysis of phospho-kinome data uncovered that variation in MEK phosphorylation was associated with RTK-targeted drug resistance. Using sorafenib as a model drug, we found that co-administration with a MEK inhibitor decreased ECM-mediated resistance in vitro and reduced in vivo tumor burden compared to sorafenib alone. In sum, we provide a novel strategy for identifying and overcoming ECM-mediated resistance mechanisms by performing drug screening, phospho-kinome analysis, and systems biology across multiple biomaterial environments.",

    "abstract": "Although critical for studies of gut motility and intestinal regeneration, the in vitro culture of intestinal muscularis with peristaltic function remains a significant challenge. Periodic contractions of intestinal muscularis result from the coordinated activity of smooth muscle cells (SMC), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). Reproducing this activity requires the preservation of all these cells in one system. Here we report the first serum-free culture methodology that consistently maintains spontaneous and periodic contractions of murine and human intestinal muscularis cells for months. In this system, SMC expressed the mature marker myosin heavy chain, and multipolar/dipolar ICC, uniaxonal/multipolar neurons and glial cells were present. Furthermore, drugs affecting ENS, ICC or SMC altered the contractions. Combining this method with scaffolds, contracting cell sheets were formed with organized architecture. With the addition of intestinal epithelial cells, this platform enabled at least 9 types of cells from mucosa and muscularis to coexist and function. The method constitutes a powerful tool for mechanistic studies of gut motility disorders and the regeneration of full-thickness engineered intestine.\\n\\nIn the small intestine, the mucosa processes partially digested food and absorbs nutrients while the muscularis actuates the peristaltic flow to transport luminal content aborally. Gut motility is central to its digestive and absorptive function. The intestinal muscularis contains various types of cells: of these, smooth muscle cells, the enteric nervous system (ENS)1,2, and the pacemaker interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC)3 are three important players involved in the development of gut motility. Recent studies on intestinal tissue engineering have highlighted the importance of regenerating the functional intestinal muscularis4-9. A variety of systems derived from different cell sources, including pluripotent stem cells (PSC)4-6, embryonic stem cells (ESC)7 and primary tissue8,9, have been established to accomplish this goal and different contractile activities were developed in these systems. Notably, spontaneous contractions have been generated in culture systems that contained both ICC and smooth muscle cells4,6,10-13. In addition, electrical-induced neurogenic contractions were also successfully produced4,5,8 when ENS was introduced into culture. In one of the most recent studies, both spontaneous contractions and electrical-induced neurogenic contractions were developed in a PSC-based culture system4.",

    "abstract": "The cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase cGAS counteracts infections by detecting and binding foreign cytoplasmic DNA1. DNA-induced synthesis of cGAMP activates innate immune signalling and apoptosis through the cGAMP receptor STING and the downstream effector IRF31-7. During interphase the nuclear envelope protects chromosomal self-DNA from cGAS, but the consequences of exposing chromosomes to cGAS following mitotic nuclear envelope disassembly are unknown. Here we demonstrate that cGAS associates with chromosomes during mitosis and binds nucleosomes with even higher affinity than naked DNA in vitro. Nucleosomes nevertheless competitively inhibit the DNA-dependent stimulation of cGAS, and accordingly, chromosomal cGAS does not affect mitotic progression under normal conditions. This suggests that nucleosomes prevent the inappropriate activation of cGAS during mitosis by acting as a signature of self-DNA. During prolonged mitotic arrest, however, cGAS becomes activated to promote cell death, limiting the fraction of cells that can survive and escape mitotic arrest induced by the chemotherapeutic drug taxol. Induction of mitotic cell death involves cGAMP synthesis by cGAS, as well as signal transduction to IRF3 by STING. We thus propose that cGAS plays a previously unappreciated role in guarding against mitotic errors, promoting cell death during prolonged mitotic arrest. Our data also indicate that the cGAS pathway, whose activity differs widely among cell lines, impacts cell fate determination upon treatment with taxol and other anti-mitotic drugs. Thus, we propose the innate immune system may be harnessed to selectively target cells with mitotic abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation in the wild often involves standing genetic variation (SGV), which allows rapid responses to selection on ecological timescales. However, we still know little about how the evolutionary histories and genomic distributions of SGV influence local adaptation in natural populations. Here, we address this knowledge gap using the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model. We extend the popular restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) method to produce phased haplotypes approaching 700 base pairs (bp) in length at each of over 50,000 loci across the stickleback genome. Parallel adaptation in two geographically isolated freshwater pond populations consistently involved fixation of haplotypes that are identical-by-descent. In these same genomic regions, sequence divergence between marine and freshwater stickleback, as measured by dXY, reaches ten-fold higher than background levels and structures genomic variation into distinct marine and freshwater haplogroups. By combining this dataset with a de novo genome assembly of a related species, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), we find that this habitat-associated divergent variation averages six million years old, nearly twice the genome-wide average. The genomic variation that is involved in recent and rapid local adaptation in stickleback has actually been evolving throughout the 15-million-year history since the two species lineages split. This long history of genomic divergence has maintained large genomic regions of ancient ancestry that include multiple chromosomal inversions and extensive linked variation. These discoveries of ancient genetic variation spread broadly across the genome in stickleback demonstrate how selection on ecological timescales is a result of genome evolution over geological timescales, and vice versa.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTAdaptation to changing environments requires a source of genetic variation. When environments change quickly, species often rely on variation that is already present - so-called standing genetic variation - because new adaptive mutations are just too rare. The threespine stickleback, a small fish species living throughout the Northern Hemisphere, is well-known for its ability to rapidly adapt to new environments. Populations living in coastal oceans are heavily armored with bony plates and spines that protect them from predators. These marine populations have repeatedly invaded and adapted to freshwater environments, losing much of their armor and changing in shape, size, color, and behavior.\\n\\nAdaptation to freshwater environments can occur in mere decades and probably involves lots of standing genetic variation. Indeed, one of the clearest examples we have of adaptation from standing genetic variation comes from a gene, eda, that controls the shifts in armor plating. This discovery involved two surprises that continue to shape our understanding of the genetics of adaptation. First, freshwater stickleback from across the Northern Hemisphere share the same version, or allele, of this gene. Second, the  marine and  freshwater alleles arose millions of years ago, even though the freshwater populations studied arose much more recently. While it has been hypothesized that other genes in the stickleback genome may share these patterns, large-scale surveys of genomic variation have been unable to test this prediction directly.\\n\\nHere, we use new sequencing technologies to survey DNA sequence variation across the stickleback genome for patterns like those at the eda gene. We find that every region of the genome associated with marine-freshwater genetic differences shares this pattern to some degree. Moreover, many of these regions are as old or older than eda, stretching back over 10 million years in the past and perhaps even predating the species we now call the threespine stickleback. We conclude that natural selection has maintained this variation over geological timescales and that the same alleles we observe in freshwater stickleback today are the same as those under selection in ancient, now-extinct freshwater habitats. Our findings highlight the need to understand evolution on macroevolutionary timescales to understand and predict adaptation happening in the present day.",

In the Drosophila olfactory system, the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body (MB) are thought to mediate innate and learned olfactory behavior respectively, although the function of the LH has not been directly tested. Here we identify two LH cell-types (PD2a1/b1) that receive input from an MB output neuron required for recall of aversive olfactory memories. In contrast to the model above we find that PD2a1/b1 are required for aversive memory retrieval. PD2a1/b1 activity is modulated by training, indicating that memory information is passed to the innate olfactory processing centre. We map the connectivity of PD2a1/b1 to other olfactory neurons with connectomic data. This provides a circuit mechanism by which learned and unlearned olfactory information can interact to produce appropriate behavior.",

    "abstract": "AKT is a kinase that regulates numerous cellular processes in the brain and mutations in AKT are known to affect brain function. AKT is indirectly implicated in synaptic plasticity, but its direct role has not been studied. Moreover, three highly related AKT isoforms are expressed in the brain, but their individual roles are poorly understood. We find that each AKT isoform has a unique expression pattern in the hippocampus, with AKT1 and AKT3 primarily in neurons but displaying local differences, while AKT2 is in astrocytes. We also find isoform-specific roles for AKT in multiple paradigms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. AKT1, but not AKT2 or AKT3, is required for L-LTP through regulating activity-induced protein synthesis. Interestingly, AKT activity inhibits mGluR-LTD, with overlapping functions for AKT1 and AKT3. In summary, our studies identify distinct expression patterns and roles in synaptic plasticity for AKT isoforms in the hippocampus.",

It is currently unclear whether transfer of tau between neurons is a toxic gain-of-function process in dementia, or reflects a constitutive biological process. We report two mechanisms of entry of monomeric tau to neurons: a rapid early dynamin-dependent phase, and a second, slower actin-dependent phase, suggesting that monomeric tau enters neurons via rapid saturable clathrin-mediated endocytosis and also by bulk endocytosis. Aggregated tau entry is independent of actin polymerisation and largely dynamin dependent, consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and distinct from macropinocytosis, the major route for aggregated tau entry reported for non-neuronal cells. Anti-tau antibodies abrogate tau entry into neurons, with tau carrying antibody with it into neurons, indicating that antibody binding is insufficient to prevent neuronal tau entry.",

    "abstract": "Accurate annotation of protein functions is important for a profound understanding of molecular biology. A large number of proteins remain uncharacterized because of the sparsity of available supporting information. For a large set of uncharacterized proteins, the only type of information available is their amino acid sequence. In this paper, we propose DeepSeq - a deep learning architecture - that utilizes only the protein sequence information to predict its associated functions. The prediction process does not require handcrafted features; rather, the architecture automatically extracts representations from the input sequence data. Results of our experiments with DeepSeq indicate significant improvements in terms of prediction accuracy when compared with other sequence-based methods. Our deep learning model achieves an overall validation accuracy of 86.72%, with an F1 score of 71.13%. Moreover, using the automatically learned features and without any changes to DeepSeq, we successfully solved a different problem i.e. protein function localization, with no human intervention. Finally, we discuss how this same architecture can be used to solve even more complicated problems such as prediction of 2D and 3D structure as well as protein-protein interactions.",

Complex organisms with large genomes only rarely and only under very strong selection converge to the same genotype. In contrast, independent virus populations with very small genomes often acquire identical mutations. Here we test the hypothesis of whether convergence in early HIV-1 infection is common enough to serve as an indicator for selection. To this end, we measure the number of convergent mutations in a well-studied dataset of full-length HIV-1 env genes sampled from HIV-1 infected individuals during early infection. We compare this data to a neutral model and find an excess of convergent mutations. Convergent mutations are not evenly distributed across the env gene, but more likely to occur in gp41, which suggests that convergent mutations provide a selective advantage and hence are positively selected. In contrast, mutations that are only found in an HIV-1 population of a single individual are significantly affected by purifying selection. Our analysis suggests that comparisons between convergent and private mutations with neutral models allow us to identify positive and negative selection in small viral genomes. Our results also show that selection significantly shapes HIV-1 populations even before the onset of the adaptive immune system.",

Thus Hechtian adhesion, as a piconewton force transducer, couples the internal stress of a rapidly growing wall to the plasma membrane. Such Hechtian transduction via stretch-activated Ca2+ channels and H+-ATPase proton efflux dissociating periplasmic AGP-Ca2+, creates a Ca2+ influx that activates exocytosis of wall precursors. In effect a highly simplified primary cell wall regulates its own synthesis and a Hechtian growth oscillator regulates overall tip growth. By analogy with the Rosetta Stone that translates trilingual inscriptions as a single identical proclamation, the Hechtian Hypothesis translates classical AGPs and their roles as a Ca2+ capacitor, pollen tube guide and wall plasticiser into a simple but widely applicable model of tip growth. Even wider ramifications of the Hechtian oscillator may implicate AGPs in osmosensing or gravisensing and other tropisms, leading us yet further towards the Holy Grail of plant growth.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential but often poorly bioavailable nutrient due to its low solubility, especially in alkaline soils. Plants have evolved at least two distinct strategies to extract iron from soil: solubilization of ferric iron by phytosiderophores, and reduction to the ferrous form at the root surface followed by direct import. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel redox-active catecholic metabolite, termed sideretin, which derives from the coumarin fraxetin, and is the primary molecule exuded by Arabidopsis thaliana roots in response to iron deficiency. Using a combination of metabolomics, heterologous expression, and coexpression analysis we have identified two enzymes that complete the biosynthetic pathway of sideretin. Chemical characterization of synthetic sideretin and biological assays with pathway mutants suggest that sideretin is critical for iron nutrition and support a role for small molecule-mediated iron reduction in A. thaliana under iron-limiting growth conditions. Further, we show that sideretin production is evolutionarily ancient and occurs in eudicot species only distantly related to A. thaliana. In addition to sideretin, untargeted metabolomics of the root exudates of various eudicots revealed the production of structurally diverse redox-active molecules in response to iron deficiency. Our results indicate that secretion of small molecule reductants by roots may be a widespread and previously underappreciated component of the reduction-based iron uptake strategy.",

    "abstract": "Familiarity is the vital characteristic conveyed by social cues to determine behaviors towards conspecific. Here we characterize social contacts to familiar vs unfamiliar male conspecific, anesthetized to eliminate inter-male aggression. During initial 10 min (phase-1), subjects contacted demonstrators vigorously regardless of familiarity. During subsequent 80 min (phase-2), however, they contacted more with familiar than unfamiliar conspecifics. Then, this test was applied on highly aggressive mice with hippocampal CA3-restricted BDNF knockout (KO), in which aggression may mask other behaviors. KO showed less preference to contacting familiar conspecific than wild type (WT) during phase-2 but no differences during phase-1. Among non-social behaviors, eating duration was shorter in the presence of familiar than unfamiliar conspecific in WT, but same in KO. Additionally, KO exhibited reduced pain sensitization. Altogether, these findings suggest that KO has deficits in circuits that process social cues from familiar conspecifics and pain and, possibly, underlie empathy-like behaviors.",

    "abstract": "MotivationRapid advancement in high throughput genome and transcriptome sequencing (HTS) and mass spectrometry (MS) technologies has enabled the acquisition of the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data from the same tissue sample. In this paper we introduce a novel computational framework which can integratively analyze all three types of omics data to obtain a complete molecular profile of a tissue sample, in normal and disease conditions. Our framework includes MiStrVar, an algorithmic method we developed to identify micro structural variants (microSVs) on genomic HTS data. Coupled with deFuse, a popular gene fusion detection method we developed earlier, MiStrVar can provide an accurate profile of structurally aberrant transcripts in cancer samples. Given the breakpoints obtained by MiStrVar and deFuse, our framework can then identify all relevant peptides that span the breakpoint junctions and match them with unique proteomic signatures in the respective proteomics data sets. Our framework's ability to observe structural aberrations at three levels of omics data provides means of validating their presence.\\n\\nResultsWe have applied our framework to all The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and/or RNA-Seq data sets, spanning all four major subtypes, for which proteomics data from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) have been released. A recent study on this dataset focusing on SNVs has reported many that lead to novel peptides [1]. Complementing and significantly broadening this study, we detected 244 novel peptides from 432 candidate genomic or transcriptomic sequence aberrations. Many of the fusions and microSVs we discovered have not been reported in the literature. Interestingly, the vast majority of these translated aberrations (in particular, fusions) were private, demonstrating the extensive inter-genomic heterogeneity present in breast cancer. Many of these aberrations also have matching out-of-frame downstream peptides, potentially indicating novel protein sequence and structure. Moreover, the most significantly enriched genes involved in translated fusions are cancer-related. Furthermore a number of the somatic, translated microSVs are observed in tumor suppressor genes.\\n\\nContactcenksahi@indiana.edu",

    "abstract": "Rare genetic variants in the core endocannabinoid system genes CNR1, CNR2, DAGLA, MGLL and FAAH were identified in molecular testing data from up to 6.032 patients with a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. The variants were evaluated for association with phenotypes similar to those observed in the orthologous gene knockouts in mice. Heterozygous rare coding variants in CNR1, which encodes the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1), were found to be significantly associated with pain sensitivity (especially migraine), sleep and memory disorders - alone or in combination with anxiety - compared to a set of controls without such CNR1 variants. Similarly, heterozygous rare variants in DAGLA, which encodes diacylglycerol lipase alpha, were found to be significantly associated with seizures and developmental disorders, including abnormalities of brain morphology, compared to controls. Rare variants in MGLL, FAAH and CNR2 were not associated with any neurological phenotypes in the patients tested. Diacylglycerol lipase alpha synthesizes the endocannabinoid 2-AG in the brain, which interacts with CB1 receptors. The phenotypes associated with rare CNR1 variants are reminiscent of those implicated in the theory of clinical endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome. The severe phenotypes associated with rare DAGLA variants underscore the critical role of rapid 2-AG synthesis and the endocannabinoid system in regulating neurological function and development. Mapping of the variants to the 3D structure of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor, or primary structure of diacylglycerol lipase alpha, reveals clustering of variants in certain structural regions and is consistent with impacts to function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStentor coeruleus is a large ciliated protist, about 1mm in length, with the extraordinary ability to fully regenerate each fragment after being cut into pieces, perfectly restoring cell polarity and morphology. Single-cell regeneration in Stentor remains one of the greatest long-standing mysteries of biology, but the recently published Stentor genome now enables studies on this organism at the molecular and genetic levels. Here we characterize the complete complement of kinases, or kinome, of Stentor, in order to begin to understand the signaling capacities that underlie Stentors unique biology.\\n\\nResultsThe genome of S. coeruleus contains over 2000 kinases, representing 6% of the predicted proteome. Classification of the kinase genes reveals large expansions in several kinase families, particularly in the CDPKs, the DYRKs, and in several mitotic kinase families including the PLKs, NEKs, and Auroras. The large expansion of the CDPK and DYRK kinase families is an unusual feature of the Stentor kinome compared to other ciliates with sequenced genomes. The DYRK family in Stentor, notably, contains only a single pseudokinase which may suggest an important role in Stentor growth and survival, while the smaller PEK family contains a novel pseudokinase subfamily. The Stentor kinome also has examples of new domain architectures that have not been previously observed in other organisms.\\n\\nConclusionOur analysis provides the first gene-level view into the signaling capabilities of Stentor and will lay the foundation for unraveling how this organism can coordinate processes as complex as regeneration throughout a giant cell.",

    "abstract": "Basal gene expression levels have been shown to be predictive of cellular response to cytotoxic treatments. However, such analyses do not fully reveal complex genotype-phenotype relationships, which are partly encoded in highly interconnected molecular networks. Biological pathways provide a complementary way of understanding drug response variation among individuals. In this study, we integrate chemosensitivity data from a recent pharmacogenomics study with basal gene expression data from the CCLE project and prior knowledge of molecular networks to identify specific pathways mediating chemical response. We first develop a computational method called PACER, which ranks pathways for enrichment in a given set of genes using a novel network embedding method. It examines known relationships among genes as encoded in a molecular network along with gene memberships of all pathways to determine a vector representation of each gene and pathway in the same low-dimensional vector space. The relevance of a pathway to the given gene set is then captured by the similarity between the pathway vector and gene vectors. To apply this approach to chemosensitivity data, we identify genes with basal expression levels in a panel of cell lines that are correlated with cytotoxic response to a compound, and then rank pathways for relevance to these response-correlated genes using PACER. Extensive evaluation of this approach on benchmarks constructed from databases of compound target genes, compound chemical structure, as well as large collections of drug response signatures demonstrates its advantages in identifying compound-pathway associations, compared to existing statistical methods of pathway enrichment analysis. The associations identified by PACER can serve as testable hypotheses about chemosensitivity pathways and help further study the mechanism of action of specific cytotoxic drugs. More broadly, PACER represents a novel technique of identifying enriched properties of any gene set of interest while also taking into account networks of known gene-gene relationships and interactions.",

The shape and width of the transient displacement are similar to those of the electrically recorded action potential, but the amplitude varies from neuron to neuron, and from one region of a neuron to another, ranging from 0.2 - 0.4 nm. The work indicates that action potentials may be studied non-invasively in single mammalian neurons by label-free imaging of the accompanying subnanometer mechanical motion.",

    "abstract": "Autophagosomes are double-membrane vesicles generated during autophagy. Biogenesis of the autophagosome requires membrane acquisition from intracellular compartments, the mechanisms of which are unclear. We previously found that a relocation of COPII machinery to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) generates ERGIC-derived COPII vesicles which serve as a membrane precursor for the lipidation of LC3, a key membrane component of the autophagosome. Here we employed super-resolution microscopy to show that starvation induces the enlargement of ER-exit sites (ERES) positive for the COPII activator, SEC12, and the remodeled ERES patches along the ERGIC. A SEC12 binding protein, CTAGE5, is required for the enlargement of ERES, SEC12 relocation to the ERGIC, and modulates autophagosome biogenesis. Moreover, FIP200, a subunit of the ULK protein kinase complex, facilitates the starvation-induced enlargement of ERES independent of the other subunits of this complex and associates via its C-terminal domain with SEC12. Our data indicate a pathway wherein FIP200 and CTAGE5 facilitate starvation-induced remodeling of the ERES, a prerequisite for the production of COPII vesicles budded from the ERGIC that contribute to autophagosome formation.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid integrity assessment is an important aspect of quality control for many applications in molecular biology. A number of methods exist (electrophoresis- or PCR-based), but they are not universally applicable. Some of them need huge amounts of input, process certain amount of samples, require expensive equipment, only work specifically on (c)DNA, (m)RNA, certain species or certain tissues, or produce fragments covering a small length range. We investigated if the ubiquitin C gene (UBC) could be used to develop flexible, multi-use PCR-based (deoxy)ribonucleic acid integrity assays. UBC gene analysis (in human, mouse, pig, cow, horse, sheep, dog and cat) shows that UBC is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed gene (reference gene in RT-qPCR), that encodes a polyubiquitin precursor (containing tandem repeats of at least 5 ubiquitin monomers of 228 bp) in a single exon. On average, ubiquitin monomers show a nucleic acid sequence identity of 96% at intraspecies level and 93% at interspecies level. Based on a multiple alignment of all monomer ubiquitin sequences of all investigated species, we could design a single degenerated primer pair generating PCR amplicons of 137, 365, 593 and 821 bp on low amounts of high quality DNA of all investigated species (down to 10 pg) and on cDNA reverse transcribed from high quality RNA from different tissues (e.g. heart, liver, brain, kidney). Increasing levels of nucleic acid degradation resulted in a decrease of amplification products starting with the longer amplicons. We conclude that UBC is suited to develop a single, cheap, universal assay to estimate the presence, integrity and amplificability of native mammalian nucleic acids. In addition, we used the same strategy to design a similar assay to check the quality of bisulfite treated mammalian DNA.",

    "abstract": "Perrault syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterised by sensorineural hearing loss in both sexes and primary ovarian insufficiency in 46 XX, females. It is genetically heterogeneous with biallelic variants in six genes identified to date (HSD17B4, HARS2, LARS2, CLPP, C10orf2 and ERAL1). Most genes possessing variants associated with Perrault syndrome are involved in mitochondrial translation. We describe a consanguineous family with three affected individuals homozygous for a novel missense variant c.1454C>T; p.(Ala485Val) in KIAA0391, encoding proteinaceous RNase P (PRORP), the metallonuclease subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P complex, responsible for the 5-end processing of mitochondrial precursor tRNAs. In RNase P activity assays, RNase P complexes containing the PRORP disease variant produced ~35-45% less 5-processed tRNA than wild type PRORP. Consistently, the accumulation of unprocessed polycistronic mitochondrial transcripts was observed in patient dermal fibroblasts, leading to an observable loss of steady-state levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation components. Expression of wild type KIAA0391 in patient fibroblasts rescued tRNA processing. Immunohistochemistry analyses of the auditory sensory epithelium from postnatal and adult mouse inner ear showed a high level of PRORP in the efferent synapses and nerve fibres of hair cells, indicating a possible mechanism for the sensorineural hearing loss observed in affected individuals. We have identified a variant in an additional gene associated with Perrault syndrome. With the identification of this disease-causing variant in KIAA0391, reduced function of each of the three subunits of mitochondrial RNase P have now been associated with distinct clinical presentations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPerrault syndrome is a rare genetic condition which results in hearing loss in both sexes and ovarian dysfunction in females. Perrault syndrome may also cause neurological symptoms in some patients. Here, we present the features and genetic basis of the condition in three sisters affected by Perrault syndrome. The sisters did not have pathogenic variants in any of the genes previously associated with Perrault syndrome. We identified a change in the gene KIAA0391, encoding PRORP, a subunit of the mitochondrial RNase P complex. Mitochondrial RNase P is a key enzyme in RNA processing in mitochondria. Impaired RNA processing reduces protein production in mitochondria, which we observed in patient cells along with high levels of unprocessed RNA. When we expressed wild type PRORP in patient cells, the RNA processing improved. We also investigated PRORP localisation in the mouse inner ear and found high levels in the synapses and nerve fibers that transmit sound. It may be that disruption of RNA processing in the mitochondria of these cells causes hearing loss in this family.",

    "abstract": "DNA is subject to constant chemical modification and damage, which eventually results in variable mutation rates throughout the genome. Although detailed molecular mechanisms of DNA damage and repair are well-understood, damage impact and execution of repair across a genome remains poorly defined. To bridge the gap between our understanding of DNA repair and mutation distributions we developed a novel method, AP-seq, capable of mapping apurinic sitesand 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine bases at [~]300bp resolution on a genome-wide scale. We directly demonstrate that the accumulation rate of oxidative damage varies widely across the genome, with hot spots acquiring many times more damage than cold spots. Unlike SNVs in cancers, damage burden correlates with marks for open chromatin notably H3K9ac and H3K4me2. Oxidative damage is also highly enriched in transposable elements and other repetitive sequences. In contrast, we observe decreased damage at promoters, exons and termination sites, but not introns, in a seemingly transcription-independent manner. Leveraging cancer genomic data, we also find locally reduced SNV rates in promoters, genes and other functional elements. Taken together, our study reveals that oxidative DNA damage accumulation and repair differ strongly across the genome, but culminate in a previously unappreciated mechanism that safe-guards the regulatory sequences and the coding regions of genes from mutations.",

While the brain regions that support coherent and controlled patterns of semantic retrieval are relatively well-characterised, the temporal dynamics of these processes are not well-understood. This study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and dual-pulse chronometric transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS) in two separate experiments to examine temporal dynamics within the temporal lobe during the retrieval of strong and weak associations. MEG results revealed a dissociation within left temporal cortex: anterior temporal lobe (ATL) showed greater oscillatory response for strong than weak associations, while posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) showed the reverse pattern. In the cTMS experiment, stimulation of ATL at ~150ms disrupted the efficient retrieval of strong associations, indicating a necessary role for ATL in coherent conceptual activations. Stimulation of pMTG at the onset of the second word disrupted the retrieval of weak associations, suggesting this site may maintain information about semantic context from the first word, allowing engagement of semantic control. Together these studies provide converging evidence for a functional dissociation within the temporal lobe, across both tasks and time.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscientists of language comprehension study how neural computations relate to cognitive computations during comprehension. On the cognitive part of the equation, it is important that the computations and processing complexity are explicitly defined. Probabilistic language models can be used to give a computationally explicit account of language complexity during comprehension. Whereas such models have so far predominantly been evaluated against behavioral data, only recently have the models been used to explain neurobiological signals. Measures obtained from these models emphasize the probabilistic, information-processing view of language understanding and provide a set of tools that can be used for testing neural hypotheses about language comprehension. Here, we provide a cursory review of the theoretical foundations and example neuroimaging studies employing probabilistic language models. We high-light the advantages and potential pitfalls of this approach and indicate avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we review major classification schemes proposed for oaks by John Claudius Loudon, Anders Sandoe Orsted, William Trelease, Otto Karl Anton Schwarz, Aimee Antoinette Camus, Yuri Leonardovich Menitsky, and Kevin C. Nixon. Classifications of oaks (Fig. 1) have thus far been based entirely on morphological characters. They differed profoundly from each other because each taxonomist gave a different weight to distinguishing characters; often characters that are homoplastic in oaks. With the advent of molecular phylogenetics our view has considerably changed. One of the most profound changes has been the realisation that the traditional split between the East Asian subtropical to tropical subgenus Cyclobalanopsis and the subgenus Quercus that includes all other oaks is artificial. The traditional concept has been replaced by that of two major clades, each comprising three infrageneric groups: a Palearctic-Indomalayan clade including Group Ilex (Ilex oaks), Group Cerris (Cerris oaks) and Group Cyclobalanopsis (cycle-cup oaks), and a predominantly Nearctic clade including Group Protobalanus (intermediate or golden cup oaks), Group Lobatae (red oaks) and Group Quercus (white oaks, with most species in America and some 30 species in Eurasia). The main morphological feature characterising these phylogenetic lineages is pollen morphology, a character overlooked in traditional classifications. This realisation, along with the now available (molecular-)phylogenetic framework, opens new avenues for biogeographic, ecological and evolutionary studies and a re-appraisal of the fossil record. We provide an overview about recent advances in these fields and outline how the results of these studies contribute to the establishment of a unifying systematic scheme of oaks. Ultimately, we propose an updated classification of Quercus recognising two subgenera with eight sections. This classification considers morphological traits, molecular-phylogenetic relationships, and the evolutionary history of one of the most important temperate woody plant genera.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/168146_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (49K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5a05org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@91295forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3338fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e24a58_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1:C_FLOATNO Classification schemes for Quercus from Loudon to Nixon (see Appendix). Colour coding denotes the actual systematic affiliation of species included in each taxon: of the Old World or mid-latitude clade section Cyclobalanopsis (cycle-cup oaks, yellow), section Cerris (Cerris oaks; orange), and section Ilex (Ilex oaks; green); and of the New World or high-latitude clade section Quercus (white oaks s.str.; blue), sections Virentes (cyan) and Ponticae (dark blue), section Protobalanus (intermediate oaks; purple), and section Lobatae (red oaks; red). Colour gradients are proportional, i.e. reflect the proportion of species with different systematic affiliation included in each taxon. Note: Menitsky (1984) and Trelease (1924) only treated the Eurasian and American oaks, respectively, and provided classifications in (nearly) full agreement with current phylogenies.\\n\\nC_FIG",
