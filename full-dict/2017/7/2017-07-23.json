    "abstract": "Insects rely on chemical information to locate food, choose mates, and detect potential predators. It has been hypothesized that adaptive changes in the olfactory system facilitated the diversification of numerous insect lineages. For instance, evolutionary changes of Odorant Receptor (OR) genes often occur in parallel with modifications in life history strategies. Corbiculate bees display a diverse array of behaviors that are controlled through olfaction, including varying degrees of social organization, and manifold associations with floral resources. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms driving the evolution of the OR gene family in corbiculate bees in comparison to other chemosensory gene families. Our results indicate that the genomic organization of the OR gene family has remained highly conserved for approximately 80 million years, despite exhibiting major changes in repertoire size among bee lineages. Moreover, the evolution of OR genes appears to be driven mostly by lineage-specific gene duplications in few genomic regions that harbor large numbers of OR genes. A selection analysis revealed that OR genes evolve under positive selection, with the strongest signals detected in recently duplicated copies. Our results indicate that chromosomal translocations had a minimal impact on OR evolution, and instead local molecular mechanisms appear to be main drivers of OR repertoire size. Our results provide empirical support to the longstanding hypothesis that positive selection shaped the diversification of the OR gene family. Together, our results shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of olfaction in insects.",

    "abstract": "Aim: Alzheimers disease (AD) and other forms of dementia create a non-curable disease population in Worlds societies. To develop a blood-based biomarker is important so that the remedial or disease-altering therapeutic intervention for AD patients would be available at the early stage. Materials & Methods: TDP-43 levels were analyzed in post-mortem brain tissue and platelets of AD and control subjects. Results: We observed an increased TDP-43 (<60%) in post-mortem AD brain regions and similar trends were also observed in patients platelets. Conclusion: Platelet TDP-43 could be used as a surrogate biomarker that is measurable, reproducible, and sensitive for screening the patients with some early clinical signs of AD and can be used to monitor disease prognosis.\\n\\nLay abstractIn this study, we explore to identify an Alzheimers disease-selective phospho-specific antibody that recognizes the diseased form of TDP-43 protein in patients blood-derived platelets. Our results suggest that selective anti-phosphorylated TDP-43 antibody discriminates Alzheimers disease from non-demented controls and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, platelet screening with a selective antibody could potentially be a useful tool for diagnostic purposes for Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is regarded as the function of a specialized cytoplasmic translation-coupled mRNA decay pathway in eukaryotes, however, whether a premature translation termination codon (PTC) will lead to NMD often depends on splicing a downstream intron in the nucleus. Deposition of the exon junction complex (EJC) on mRNA is understood to mediate such splicing-dependent NMD in mammalian cells. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has introns in only 5% of its genes, characteristically at the start of the coding region, and lacks proteins essential for EJC assembly, is not expected to undergo splicing-dependent NMD. However, we found that the presence of an intron near a PTC can also enhance NMD in this organism, regardless of whether it is downstream or upstream. These data provide evidence for a hitherto unsuspected EJC-independent mechanism linking translation and pre-mRNA in S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Descending signals from the brain play critical roles in controlling and modulating locomotion kinematics. In the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system, descending AVB premotor interneurons exclusively form gap junctions with B-type motor neurons that drive forward locomotion. We combined genetic analysis, optogenetic manipulation, and computational modeling to elucidate the function of AVB-B gap junctions during forward locomotion. First, we found that some B-type motor neurons generated intrinsic rhythmic activity, constituting distributed central pattern generators. Second, AVB premotor interneurons drove bifurcation of B-type motor neuron dynamics, triggering their transition from stationary to oscillatory activity. Third, proprioceptive couplings between neighboring B-type motor neurons entrained the frequency of body oscillators, forcing coherent propagation of bending waves. Despite substantial anatomical differences between the worm motor circuit and those in higher model organisms, we uncovered converging principles that govern coordinated locomotion.\\n\\nSignificance StatementA deep understanding of the neural basis of motor behavior must integrate neuromuscular dynamics, mechanosensory feedback, as well as global command signals, to predict behavioral dynamics. Here, we report on an integrative approach to defining the circuit logic underlying coordinated locomotion in C. elegans. Our combined experimental and computational analysis revealed that (1) motor neurons in C. elegans could function as intrinsic oscillators; (2) Descending inputs and proprioceptive couplings work synergistically to facilitate the sequential activation of motor neuron activities, allowing bending waves to propagate efficiently along the body. Our work thus represents a key step towards an integrative view of animal locomotion.",

The key issue is that since parental lines were not available, might the reported variants have been inherited? To expand upon the limited available whole genome data on whether CRISPR-edited mice show more genetic variation, whole-genome sequencing was performed on two other mouse lines that had undergone a CRISPR-editing procedure. Again, parents were not available for either the Capn5 nor Fblim1 CRISPR-edited mouse lines, so strain controls were examined. Additionally, we also include verification of variants detected in the initial mouse line. Taken together, these whole-genome-sequencing-level results support the idea that in specific cases, CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations.",

    "abstract": "The identities of axons and dendrites are acquired through the self-organization of distinct microtubule (MT) orientations during neuronal polarization. The axon is generally characterized by a uniform MT orientation with all plus-ends pointing outward to the neurite terminal ( plus-end-out pattern). On the other hand, the MT orientation pattern in the dendrites depends on species: vertebrate dendrites have a mixed alignment with both plus and minus ends facing either the terminal or the cell body ( mixed pattern), whereas invertebrate dendrites have a  minus-end-out pattern. However, how MT organizations are developed in the axon and the dendrites is largely unknown. To investigate the mechanism of MT organization, we developed a biophysical model of MT kinetics, consisting of polymerization/depolymerization and MT catastrophe coupled with neurite outgrowth. The model simulation showed that the MT orientation can be controlled mainly by the speed of neurite growth and the hydrolysis rate. With a low hydrolysis rate, vertebrate plus-end-out and mixed microtubule patterns emerged in fast- and slow-growing neurites, respectively. In contrast, with a high hydrolysis rate, invertebrate plus-end-out and minus-end-out microtubule patterns emerged in fast- and slow-growing neurites, respectively. Thus, our model can provide a unified understanding of distinct microtubule organizations by simply changing the parameters.",

    "abstract": "Metal uptake is vital for all living organisms. In metal scarce conditions, a common bacterial strategy consists in the biosynthesis of metallophores, their export in the extracellular medium and the recovery of a metal-metallophore complex through dedicated membrane transporters. Staphylopine is a recently described metallophore distantly related to plant nicotianamine that contributes to the broad-spectrum metal uptake capabilities of Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we characterize a four genes operon (PA4837-PA4834) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in the biosynthesis and trafficking of a staphylopine-like metallophore named pseudopaline. Pseudopaline differs from staphylopine with regard to the stereochemistry of its histidine moiety associated to an alpha ketoglutarate moiety instead of pyruvate. In vivo, the pseudopaline operon is regulated by zinc through the Zur repressor. The metal-uptake property of the pseudopaline system appears different from that of staphylopine with a predominant effect on nickel uptake, and on zinc uptake in metal scarce conditions mimicking a chelating environment, thus reconciling the regulation of the cnt operon by zinc with its function as a zinc importer under metal scarce conditions.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYZinc is an essential micronutrients for bacteria, particularly important at the host-pathogen interface where the host tends to sequester metals in a so called nutritional immunity framework, and the pathogenic bacterium increases its metal uptake efforts in order to keep up with its metal requirements. Here we reveal a novel metallophore, named pseudopaline, which is synthesized and exported by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and serves for the uptake of nickel in metal poor media, and for the uptake of zinc in metal scarce conditions that mimic the chelating environment that presumably prevails within a host.",

    "abstract": "The majority of bacterial genomes have high coding efficiencies, but there are some genomes of intracellular bacteria that have low gene density. The genome of the endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius contains almost 50% pseudogenes containing mutations that putatively silence them at the genomic level. We have applied multiple omic strategies, combining: Illumina and Pacific Biosciences Single-Molecule Real Time DNA-sequencing and annotation; stranded RNA-sequencing; and proteome analysis to better understand the transcriptional and translational landscape of Sodalis pseudogenes, and potential mechanisms for their control. Between 53% and 74% of the Sodalis transcriptome remains active in cell-free culture. Mean sense transcription from Coding Domain Sequences (CDS) is four-times greater than that from pseudogenes. Comparative genomic analysis of six Illumina-sequenced Sodalis isolates from different host Glossina species shows pseudogenes make up ~40% of the 2,729 genes in the core genome, suggesting that they are stable and/or Sodalis is a recent introduction across the Glossina genus as a facultative symbiont. These data further shed light on the importance of transcriptional and translational control in deciphering host-microbe interactions, and demonstrate that pseudogenes are more complex than a simple degrading DNA sequence. The combination of genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics give a multidimensional perspective for studying prokaryotic genomes with a view to elucidating evolutionary adaptation to novel environmental niches.\\n\\nImportanceBacterial genomes are generally 1Kb in length, organized efficiently (i.e. with few gaps between genes or operons), and few open reading frames (ORFs) lack any predicted function. Intracellular bacteria have been removed from extracellular selection pressures acting on pathways of declining importance to fitness and thus, these bacteria tend to delete redundant genes in favour of smaller functional repertoires - maintaining genome efficiency. In the genomes of endosymbionts with a recent evolutionary relationship with their host, however, this process of genome reduction is not complete; Genes and pathways may be at an intermediate stage, undergoing mutation linked to reduced selection and small population numbers being vertically transmitted from mother to offspring in their hosts, resulting in an increase in abundance of pseudogenes and reduced coding capacities. A greater knowledge of the genomic architecture of persistent pseudogenes, with respect to their DNA structure, mRNA transcription and even putative translation to protein products, will lead to a better understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of endosymbiont genomes, many of which have important roles in arthropod ecology.",

    "abstract": "The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is often found upstream of protein coding genes across the bacterial kingdom, where it enhances start codon recognition via hybridization to the anti-SD (aSD) sequence on the small ribosomal subunit. Despite widespread conservation of the aSD sequence, the proportion of SD-led genes within a genome varies widely across species, and the evolutionary pressures shaping this variation remain largely unknown. Here, we conduct a phylogenetically-informed analysis and show that species capable of rapid growth have a significantly higher proportion of SD-led genes in their genome, suggesting a role for SD sequences in meeting the protein production demands of rapidly growing species. Further, we show that utilization of the SD sequence mechanism co-varies with: i) genomic traits that are indicative of efficient translation, and ii) optimal growth temperatures. In contrast to prior surveys, our results demonstrate that variation in translation initiation mechanisms across genomes is largely predictable, and that SD sequence utilization is part of a larger suite of translation-associated traits whose diversity is driven by the differential growth strategies of individual species.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneity of individual neurons within a population expands the computational power of the entire neural network. However, the organizing principles that support heterogeneity within a neuronal class are often poorly understood. Here, we focus on a highly heterogeneous population of local interneurons whose traits co-vary seemingly at random. We asked if local interneurons (LNs) in the antennal lobe (AL) of Manduca sexta express fixed, predictable combinations of neurotransmitters, or if transmitter co-expression can be explained by random probability. We systematically determined the co-expression of neuropeptides and GABA by LNs and found variable patterns of co-expression for all neuropeptides, except for tachykininergic LNs which exhibited highly stereotyped co-expression on a neuron-by-neuron basis. To test if observed patterns of co-expression were random, we used a computational model and found that the probabilities of transmitter co-expression cannot be explained by independent expression of each transmitter. We also determined that setting a single rule in the model, while leaving the rest of the co-expression up to random probability, allowed the model to replicate the overall heterogeneity of transmitter co-expression across antennal lobe LNs. This implies that certain co-expression relationships contribute to the ground plan of the AL, but that otherwise, transmitter expression amongst LNs may be random, allowing heterogeneous co-expression patterns to emerge. Furthermore, neuropeptide receptor expression suggests that peptidergic signaling from LNs may simultaneously target olfactory receptor neurons, LNs and projection neurons, and thus the effects of different peptides do not segregate based on principal AL cell type. Our data suggest that while specific constraints may partially shape transmitter co-expression in LNs, a large amount of flexibility on a neuron-by-neuron basis produces heterogeneous network parameters.",

At both the site- and host-level, the probability of ranavirus presence correlated negatively with distance to nearest ranavirus-positive wetland. At the site-level, ranavirus presence was associated positively with taxonomic richness. However, infection prevalence within the amphibian population correlated negatively with vertebrate richness. Finally, amphibian host species differed in their likelihood of ranavirus infection: American Bullfrogs had the weakest association with infection while Western Toads had the strongest. After accounting for host species effects, hosts with greater snout-vent length had a lower probability of infection.\\n\\nMain conclusionsStrong spatial influences at both biological levels suggest that mobile taxa (e.g., adult amphibians, birds, reptiles) may facilitate the movement of ranavirus among hosts and across the landscape. Higher taxonomic richness at sites may provide more opportunities for colonization or the presence of reservoir hosts that may influence ranavirus presence. Higher host richness correlating with higher ranavirus infection is suggestive of a dilution effect that has been observed for other amphibian disease systems and warrants further investigation. Our study demonstrates that an array of landscape, environmental, and host-level factors were associated with ranavirus epidemiology and illustrates that their importance vary with biological level.",

    "abstract": "Traditional theories of sensorimotor learning posit that animals use sensory error signals to find the optimal motor command in the face of Gaussian sensory and motor noise. However, most such theories cannot explain common behavioral observations, for example that smaller sensory errors are more readily corrected than larger errors and that large abrupt (but not gradually introduced) errors lead to weak learning. Here we propose a new theory of sensorimotor learning that explains these observations. The theory posits that the animal learns an entire probability distribution of motor commands rather than trying to arrive at a single optimal command, and that learning arises via Bayesian inference when new sensory information becomes available. We test this theory using data from a songbird, the Bengalese finch, that is adapting the pitch (fundamental frequency) of its song following perturbations of auditory feedback using miniature headphones. We observe the distribution of the sung pitches to have long, non-Gaussian tails, which, within our theory, explains the observed dynamics of learning. Further, the theory makes surprising predictions about the dynamics of the shape of the pitch distribution, which we confirm experimentally.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) are now widely used to distribute biological data. And many popular biological APIs developed by many different research teams have adopted Javascript Object Notation (JSON) as their primary data format. While usage of a common data format offers significant advantages, that alone is not sufficient for rich integrative queries across APIs.\\n\\nResultsHere, we have implemented JSON for Linking Data (JSON-LD) technology on the BioThings APIs that we have developed, MyGene.info, MyVariant.info and MyChem.info. JSON-LD provides a standard way to add semantic context to the existing JSON data structure, for the purpose of enhancing the interoperability between APIs. We demonstrated several use cases that were facilitated by semantic annotations using JSON-LD, including simpler and more precise query capabilities as well as API cross-linking.\\n\\nConclusionsWe believe that this pattern offers a generalizable solution for interoperability of APIs in the life sciences.",

    "abstract": "Dynamin is a mechanochemical GTPase essential for membrane fission during clathrin mediated endocytosis. Dynamin forms washer ring-shaped/helical complexes at the neck of clathrin-coated pits and their structural changes coupled with GTP hydrolysis drive membrane fission. Dynamin and its binding protein amphiphysin cooperatively regulates membrane remodeling during fission, but its precise mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we analyze structural changes of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane fission using electron microscopy (EM) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Interestingly, HS-AFM analyses show that the dynamin-amphiphysin rings are rearranged to form clusters upon GTP hydrolysis and membrane constriction occurs at protein-uncoated regions flanking the clusters. We also show a novel function of amphiphysin in size control of the clusters to enhance biogenesis of endocytic vesicles. Our new approaches using combination of EM and HS-AFM clearly demonstrates dynamics of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane fission suggesting a novel \\\"clusterase\\\" model of dynamin-mediated membrane fission.",

    "abstract": "The 35 kDa water-soluble Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) is responsible for photoprotection in cyanobacteria. It acts as a light intensity sensor that simultaneously serves as efficient quencher of phycobilisome excitation energy as well as of reactive oxygen species. Photoactivation triggers large-scale conformational rearrangements to convert OCP from the orange OCPO state to the red active signaling state OCPR, as demonstrated by various structural methods. Eventually, such rearrangements imply complete yet reversible separation of structural domains (C- and N-terminal domain) and significant translocation of the carotenoid cofactor. Very recently, dynamic crystallography of OCPO crystals suggested the existence of photocycle intermediates with small-scale rearrangements that may trigger further transitions in the protein. However, the currently existing gap between the ultra-fast picosecond and 100 millisecond time scale of spectroscopic and structural data precludes knowledge about distinct intermediate states. In this study, we took advantage of single 7 ns laser pulses to study carotenoid absorption transients in OCP on the time-scale from 100 ns to 10 s, which allowed us to detect a red intermediate state preceding the red signaling state OCPR. In addition, time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and following assignment of carotenoid-induced quenching of different tryptophan residues revealed a novel orange intermediate state, which appears during back-relaxation of photoactivated OCPR to OCPO. Our results show asynchronous changes in the carotenoid and protein components and provide refined mechanistic information about the OCP photocycle as well as introduce new kinetic signatures for future studies of OCP photoactivity and photoprotection.\\n\\nSignificance statementCyanobacteria utilize the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) to protect their photosynthetic apparatus from the harmful effects of intense sunlight. OCP is a blue light-triggered photoswitch, which undergoes photoconversion from its dark adapted orange to the active red state, the latter being able to interact with the phycobilisome antennae and quench their fluorescence, thus avoiding excessive energy flow to the photosystems. With the help of the fluorescence recovery protein (FRP), OCP detaches from phycobilisomes and can return faster into the orange state. Until now, only the thermodynamically stable orange state and the metastable red state are established in a primitive photocycle. In this work, we apply transient absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and identify two novel photocycle intermediates of physiological relevance.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the genetic basis of human adaptation is biased toward loci of large pheno-typic effect. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) now enable the study of genetic adaptation in polygenic phenotypes. We test for polygenic adaptation among 187 world-wide human populations using polygenic scores constructed from GWAS of 34 complex traits. We identify signals of polygenic adaptation for anthropometric traits including height, infant head circumference (IHC), hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Analysis of ancient DNA samples indicates that a north-south cline of height within Europe and and a west-east cline across Eurasia can be traced to selection for increased height in two late Pleistocene hunter gatherer populations living in western and west-central Eurasia. Our observation that IHC and WHR follow a latitudinal cline in Western Eurasia support the role of natural selection driving Bergmanns Rule in humans, consistent with thermoregulatory adaptation in response to latitudinal temperature variation.\\n\\nAuthors Note on Failure to ReplicateAfter this preprint was posted, the UK Biobank dataset was released, providing a new and open GWAS resource. When attempting to replicate the height selection results from this preprint using GWAS data from the UK Biobank, we discovered that we could not. In subsequent analyses, we determined that both the GIANT consortium height GWAS data, as well as another dataset that was used for replication, were impacted by stratification issues that created or at a minimum substantially inflated the height selection signals reported here. The results of this second investigation, written together with additional coauthors, have now been published (https://elifesciences.org/articles/39725 along with another paper by a separate group of authors, showing similar issues https://elifesciences.org/articles/39702). A preliminary investigation shows that the other non-height based results may suffer from similar issues. We stand by the theory and statistical methods reported in this paper, and the paper can be cited for these results. However, we have shown that the data on which the major empirical results were based are not sound, and so should be treated with caution until replicated.",

    "abstract": "Exploring the microbial biosphere has grown exponentially in recent years, although we are far from understanding its entirety. We present the adiversity censusa problem of exploring all bacterial species in a large cohort of specimens, and detecting a specimen that contains each species. The naive approach to this problem is to sequence each specimen, thus requiring costly sample preparation steps.\\n\\nWe suggest an orders of magnitude more efficient approach for diversity censusing. Specimens are pooled according to a predefined design and standard 16S rRNA sequencing is performed over each pool. For each bacterial species, from the ultra-rare to the most common, the algorithm detects a single specimen that contains the bacterial species. The approach can be applied to large cohorts of monomicrobial cultures or to complex samples containing a mixture of organisms.\\n\\nWe model the experimental procedure and show via in silico simulations that the approach enables censusing more than 95% of the species while taking 10 - 70 fold less resources. Simulating experiments using real samples display the utility in censusing large cohorts of samples.\\n\\nDiversity censusing presents a novel problem in the mathematical field of group testing that may also be applied in other biological problems and in other domains.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in women due to metastasis and the development of resistance to established therapies. Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the breast tumor microenvironment and can both inhibit and support cancer progression. Thus, gaining a better understanding of how macrophages support cancer could lead to the development of more effective therapies. In this study, we find that breast cancer associated macrophages express high levels of insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGFs) and are the main source of IGFs within both primary and metastatic tumours. 75% of breast cancer patients show activation of Insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling and this correlates with increased macrophage infiltration and advanced tumor stage. In patients with invasive breast cancer, activation of Insulin/IGF-1 receptors increased to 87%. Blocking IGF in combination with paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat breast cancer, showed a significant reduction in tumor cell proliferation and lung metastasis in a pre-clinical breast cancer model compared to paclitaxel monotherapy. Our findings provide the rationale for further developing the combination of paclitaxel with IGF blockers for the treatment of invasive breast cancer, and Insulin/IGF1R activation and IGF+ stroma cells as potential biomarker candidates for further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental characteristic of spontaneous brain activity is coherent oscillations covering a wide range of frequencies. Interestingly, these temporal oscillations are highly correlated among spatially distributed cortical areas forming structured correlation patterns known as the resting state networks, although the brain is never truly at  rest. Here, we introduce the concept of \\\"harmonic brain modes\\\" - fundamental building blocks of complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. We define these elementary harmonic brain modes as harmonic modes of structural connectivity; i.e. connectome harmonics, yielding fully synchronous neural activity patterns with different frequency oscillations emerging on and constrained by the particular structure of the brain. Hence, this particular definition implicitly links the hitherto poorly understood dimensions of space and time in brain dynamics and its underlying anatomy. Further we show how harmonic brain modes can explain the relationship between neurophysiological, temporal and network-level changes in the brain across different mental states; (wakefulness, sleep, anaesthesia, psychedelic). Notably, when decoded as activation of connectome harmonics, spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activity naturally emerge from the interplay between excitation and inhibition and this critical relation fits the spatial, temporal and neurophysiological changes associated with different mental states. Thus, the introduced framework of harmonic brain modes not only establishes a relation between the spatial structure of correlation patterns and temporal oscillations (linking space and time in brain dynamics), but also enables a new dimension of tools for understanding fundamental principles underlying brain dynamics in different states of consciousness.",

Both atherosclerosis or non-atherosclerotic diffuse arteriopathy are involved.\\n\\nMETHODSA single-center, prospective, case-control study was performed in consecutive patients with different CSVD manifestations. The study group consisted of 205 patients: 52 with lacunar stroke (LS), 20 with subcortical hemorrhagic stroke (HS), 50 with vascular dementia (VaD), 28 with vascular parkinsonism (VaP) and 55 controls (CG) free of cerebrovascular disease but with high vascular risk.\\n\\nRESULTSPatients with CSVD had significantly higher prevalence of vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, polymetabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease. Patients with CSVD had also significantly higher fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, fibrinogen, systolic blood pressure, IMT values and lower eGFR, albumin and HDL levels. After adjustment for age and sex, low eGFR, albumin and high levels of uric acid and fibrinogen were associated with all CSVD groups, elevated fasting glucose was related to LS and HS. In the multivariate analysiss, the independent predictors for CSVD were female sex, low albumin, high fibrinogen, fasting glucose and uric acid. Patients with LS had significantly higher IMT values comparing to other CSVD groups, patients with VaP had a trend towards higher homocysteine levels.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONRisk factor profile for CSVD as a whole differs from subjects with proatherogenic profile without history of cerebrovascular disease. Our results support the concept that CSVD is not homogeneous, and that unique risk factors profiles exist for different clinical manifestations of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Language seemingly evolved from changes in brain anatomy and wiring. We argue that language evolution can be better understood if particular changes in phasal and cross-frequency coupling properties of neural oscillations, resulting in core features of language, are considered. Because we cannot track the oscillatory activity of the brain from extinct hominins, we used our current understanding of the language oscillogenome (that is, the set of genes responsible for basic aspects of the oscillatory activity relevant for language) to infer some properties of the Neanderthal oscillome. We have found that several candidates for the language oscillogenome show differences in their methylation patterns between Neanderthals and humans. We argue that differences in their expression levels could be informative of differences in cognitive functions important for language.",
