    "abstract": "Small non-coding RNAs are highly abundant molecules that regulate essential cellular processes and are classified according to sequence and structure. Here we argue that read profiles from size-selected RNA sequencing capture the post-transcriptional processing specific to each RNA family, thereby providing functional information independently of sequence and structure. We developed SeRPeNT, the first unsupervised computational method that exploits reproducibility across replicates and uses dynamic time-warping and density-based clustering algorithms to identify, characterize and compare small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) by harnessing the power of read profiles. We applied SeRPeNT to: a) generate an extended human annotation with 671 new sncRNAs from known classes and 131 from new potential classes, b) show pervasive differential processing between cell compartments and c) predict new molecules with miRNA-like behaviour from snoRNA, tRNA and long non-coding RNA precursors, potentially dependent on the miRNA biogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we validated experimentally four predicted novel non-coding RNAs: a miRNA, a snoRNA-derived miRNA, a processed tRNA and a new uncharacterized sncRNA. SeRPeNT facilitates fast and accurate discovery and characterization of small non-coding RNAs at unprecedented scale.

    "abstract": "Factor V Leiden (F5L) is a common genetic risk factor for venous thromboembolism in humans. We conducted a sensitized ENU mutagenesis screen for dominant thrombosuppressor genes based on perinatal lethal thrombosis in mice homozygous for F5L (F5L/L) and haploinsufficient for tissue factor pathway inhibitor (Tfpi+/-). F8 deficiency enhanced survival of F5L/L Tfpi+/- mice, demonstrating that F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality is genetically suppressible. ENU-mutagenized F5L/L males and F5L/+ Tfpi+/- females were crossed to generate 6,729 progeny, with 98 F5L/L Tfpi+/- offspring surviving until weaning. Sixteen lines exhibited transmission of a putative thrombosuppressor to subsequent generations, with these lines referred to as MF5L (Modifier of Factor 5 Leiden) 1-16. Linkage analysis in MF5L6 identified a chromosome 3 locus containing the tissue factor gene (F3). Though no ENU-induced F3 mutation was identified, haploinsufficiency for F3 (F3+/-) suppressed F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality. Whole exome sequencing in MF5L12 identified an Actr2 gene point mutation (p.R258G) as the sole candidate. Inheritance of this variant is associated with suppression of F5L/L Tfpi+/- lethality (p=1.7x10-6), suggesting that Actr2p.R258G is thrombosuppressive. CRISPR/Cas9 experiments to generate an independent Actr2 knockin/knockout demonstrated that Actr2 haploinsufficiency is lethal, supporting a hypomorphic or gain of function mechanism of action for Actr2p.R258G. Our findings identify F8 and the Tfpi/F3 axis as key regulators in determining thrombosis balance in the setting of F5L and also suggest a novel role for Actr2 in this process.\\n\\nSignificance StatementVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease characterized by the formation of inappropriate blood clots. Inheritance of specific genetic variants, such as the Factor V Leiden polymorphism, increases VTE susceptibility. However, only ~10% of people inheriting Factor V Leiden develop VTE, suggesting the involvement of other genes that are currently unknown. By inducing random genetic mutations into mice with a genetic predisposition to VTE, we identified two genomic regions that reduce VTE susceptibility. The first includes the gene for blood coagulation Factor 3 and its role was confirmed by analyzing mice with an independent mutation in this gene. The second contains a mutation in the Actr2 gene. These findings identify critical genes for the regulation of blood clotting risk.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of high-throughput transcriptome sequences of non-model organisms are based on two main approaches: de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly using mapping to assign reads prior to assembly. Given the limits of mapping reads to a reference when it is highly divergent, as is frequently the case for non-model species, we evaluate whether using blastn would outperform mapping methods for read assignment in such situations (>15% divergence). We demonstrate its high performance by using simulated reads of lengths corresponding to those generated by the most common sequencing platforms, and over a realistic range of genetic divergence (0% to 30% divergence). Here we focus on gene identification and not on resolving the whole set of transcripts (i.e. the complete transcriptome). For simulated datasets, the transcriptome-guided assembly based on blastn recovers 94.8% of genes irrespective of read length at 0% divergence; however, assignment rate of reads is negatively correlated with both increasing divergence level and reducing read lengths. Nevertheless, we still observe 92.6% of recovered genes at 30% divergence irrespective of read length. This analysis also produces a categorization of genes relative to their assignment, and suggests guidelines for data processing prior to analyses of comparative transcriptomics and gene expression to minimize potential inferential bias associated with incorrect transcript assignment. We also compare the performances of de novo assembly alone vs in combination with a transcriptome-guided assembly based on blastn via simulation and empirically, using data from a cyprinid fish species and from an oak species. For any simulated scenario, the transcriptome-guided assembly using blastn outperforms the de novo approach alone, including when the divergence level is beyond the reach of mapping methods. Combining de novo assembly and a related reference transcriptome for read assignment also addresses the bias/error in contigs caused by the dependence on a related reference alone. Empirical data corroborate those findings when assembling transcriptomes from the two non-model organisms: Parachondrostoma toxostoma (fish) and Quercus pubescens (plant). For the fish species, out of the 31,944 genes known from D. rerio, the guided and de novo assemblies recover respectively 20,605 and 20,032 genes but the performance of the guided assembly approach is much higher for both the contiguity and completeness metrics. For the oak, out of the 29,971 genes known from Vitis vinifera, the transcriptome-guided and de novo assemblies display similar performance but the new guided approach detects 16,326 genes where the de novo assembly only detects 9,385 genes.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic variants and brain region abnormalities are recognized to play a role in cognitive decline. We explore the association between singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage regions for Alzheimers disease and rates of decline in brain structure using data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\\n\\nIn an initial discovery stage, we assessed the presence of linear association between the minor allele counts of 75,845 SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions and predicted rates of change in structural MRI measurements for 56 brain regions using an RV test. In a second, refinement stage, we reduced the number of SNPs using a bootstrap-enhanced sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) with a fixed tuning parameter. Each SNP was assigned an importance measure proportional to the number of times it was estimated to have a nonzero coefficient in repeated re-sampling from the ADNI-1 sample. We created refined lists of SNPs based on importance probabilities greater than 50% and 90%, respectively. In a third, validation stage, we assessed the multivariate association between these refined lists of SNPs and the rates of structural change in the independent ADNI-2 study dataset.\\n\\nThere was strong statistical evidence for linear association between the SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions and the 56 imaging phenotypes in both the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 samples (p < 0.0001). The bootstrap-enhanced SCCA identified 1,694 priority SNPs with importance probabilities > 50% and 22 SNPs with importance probabilities > 90%. The 1,694 prioritized SNPs in the ADNI-1 data were associated with imaging phenotypes in the ADNI-2 data (p = 0.0021).\\n\\nThis manuscript presents an analysis that addresses challenges in current imaging genetics studies such as biased sampling designs and highdimensional data with low-signal. Genes corresponding to priority SNPs having the highest contribution in the validation data have previously been implicated or hypothesized to be implicated in AD, including GCLC, IDE, and STAMBP1andFAS. We hypothesize that the effect sizes of the 1,694 SNPs in the priority set are likely small, but further investigation within this set may advance understanding of the missing heritability in late-onset Alzheimers disease.

    "abstract": "High-occupancy target (HOT) regions are the segments of the genome with unusually high number of transcription factor binding sites. These regions are observed in multiple species and thought to have biological importance due to high transcription factor occupancy. Furthermore, they coincide with house-keeping gene promoters and the associated genes are stably expressed across multiple cell types. Despite these features, HOT regions are solemnly defined using ChIP-seq experiments and shown to lack canonical motifs for transcription factors that are thought to be bound there. Although, ChIP-seq experiments are the golden standard for finding genome-wide binding sites of a protein, they are not noise free. Here, we show that HOT regions are likely to be ChIP-seq artifacts and they are similar to previously proposed \\\"hyper-ChIPable\\\" regions. Using ChIP-seq data sets for knocked-out transcription factors, we demonstrate presence of false positive signals on HOT regions. We observe sequence characteristics and genomic features that are discriminatory of HOT regions, such as GC/CpG-rich k-mers and enrichment of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA tertiary structures (G-quadruplex DNA). The artificial ChIP-seq enrichment on HOT regions could be associated to these discriminatory features. Furthermore, we propose strategies to deal with such artifacts for the future ChIP-seq studies.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have been useful in identifying common genetic variants related to a variety of complex traits and diseases; however, they are often limited in their ability to inform about underlying biology. Whilst bioinformatics analyses, studies of cells, animal models and applied genetic epidemiology have provided some understanding of genetic associations or causal pathways, there is a need for new genetic studies that elucidate causal relationships and mechanisms in a cost-effective, precise and statistically efficient fashion. We discuss the motivation for and the characteristics of the Recall-by-Genotype (RbG) study design, an approach that enables genotype-directed deep-phenotyping and improvement in drawing causal inferences. Specifically, we present RbG designs using single and multiple variants and discuss the inferential properties, analytical approaches and applications of both. We consider the efficiency of the RbG approach, the likely value of RbG studies for the causal investigation of disease aetiology and the practicalities of incorporating genotypic data into population studies in the context of the RbG study design. Finally, we provide a catalogue of the UK-based resources for such studies, an online tool to aid the design of new RbG studies and discuss future developments of this approach.",

    "abstract": "A key hallmark of visual perceptual awareness is robustness to instabilities arising from unnoticeable eye and eyelid movements. In previous human intracranial (iEEG) work (Golan et al., 2016) we found that excitatory broadband high-frequency activity transients, driven by eye blinks, are suppressed in higher-level but not early visual cortex. Here, we utilized the broad anatomical coverage of iEEG recordings in 12 eye-tracked neurosurgical patients to test whether a similar stabilizing mechanism operates following small saccades. We compared saccades (1.3{degrees}-3.7{degrees}) initiated during inspection of large individual visual objects with similarly-sized external stimulus displacements. Early visual cortex sites responded with positive transients to both conditions. In contrast, in both dorsal and ventral higher-level sites the response to saccades (but not to external displacements) was suppressed. These findings indicate that early visual cortex is highly unstable compared to higher-level visual regions which apparently constitute the main target of stabilizing extra-retinal oculomotor influences.",

    "abstract": "The spatial representation of stimuli in primary sensory cortices is a convenient scaffold for elucidating the circuit mechanisms underlying sensory processing. In contrast, the anterior piriform cortex (APC) lacks topology for odor identity and appears homogenous in terms of afferent and intracortical excitatory circuitry. Here, we show that an increasing rostral-caudal (RC) gradient of inhibition onto pyramidal cells is commensurate with a decrease in active neurons along the RC axis following exploration of a novel odor environment. This inhibitory gradient is supported by somatostatin interneurons that provide an opposing, rostrally-biased, gradient of inhibition to interneurons. Optogenetic or chemogenetic modulation of somatostatin cells neutralizes the inhibitory gradient onto pyramidal cells. This suggests a novel circuit mechanism whereby opposing spatial gradients of inhibition and disinhibition regulate neural activity along the RC-axis. These findings challenge our current understanding of the spatial profiles of neural circuits and odor processing within APC.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic uncertainty of sensory information (i.e., evidence) does not necessarily deter an observer from making a reliable decision. Indeed, uncertainty can be reduced by integrating (accumulating) incoming sensory evidence. It is widely thought that this accumulation is instantiated via recurrent rate-code neural networks. Yet, these networks do not fully explain important aspects of perceptual decision-making, such as a subjects ability to retain accumulated evidence during temporal gaps in the sensory evidence. Here, we utilized computational models to show that cortical circuits can switch flexibly between  retention and  integration modes during perceptual decision-making. Further, we found that, depending on how the sensory evidence was readout, we could simulate  stepping and  ramping activity patterns, which may be analogous to those seen in different studies of decision-making in the primate parietal cortex. This finding may reconcile these previous empirical studies because it suggests these two activity patterns emerge from the same mechanism.",

To investigate image features important for texture perception, we psychophysically compare a recent parameteric model of texture appearance (CNN model) that uses the features encoded by a deep convolutional neural network (VGG-19) with two other models: the venerable Portilla and Simoncelli model (PS) and an extension of the CNN model in which the power spectrum is additionally matched. Observers discriminated model-generated textures from original natural textures in a spatial three-alternative oddity paradigm under two viewing conditions: when test patches were briefly presented to the near-periphery (\\\"parafoveal\\\") and when observers were able to make eye movements to all three patches (\\\"inspection\\\"). Under parafoveal viewing, observers were unable to discriminate 10 of 12 original images from CNN model images, and remarkably, the simpler PS model performed slightly better than the CNN model (11 textures). Under foveal inspection, matching CNN features captured appearance substantially better than the PS model (9 compared to 4 textures), and including the power spectrum improved appearance matching for two of the three remaining textures. None of the models we test here could produce indiscriminable images for one of the 12 textures under the inspection condition. While deep CNN (VGG-19) features can often be used to synthesise textures that humans cannot discriminate from natural textures, there is currently no uniformly best model for all textures and viewing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease involving the selective death of upper and lower motor neurons in the primary motor cortex and spinal cord. A hallmark of ALS pathology is the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein inclusions within motor neurons. Previous studies suggest the sequestration of ubiquitin (Ub) into inclusions reduces the availability of free Ub, which is essential for cellular function and survival. However, the dynamics of the Ub landscape in ALS have not yet been described. Here we show that Ub homeostasis is altered in a SOD1 cell model of ALS. Utilising fluorescently tagged Ub, we followed the distribution of Ub in living cells expressing SOD1 and show that Ub is present at the earliest stages of SOD1 aggregation. We also report that cells containing aggregates of mutant SOD1 have greater ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) dysfunction as measured by the accumulation of the fluorescent proteasome reporter tdTomatoCL1. Furthermore, SOD1 aggregation is associated with the redistribution of Ub and depletion of the free Ub pool. Ubiquitomics analysis indicates that mutant SOD1 is associated with a shift of Ub to a pool of supersaturated proteins including those associated with oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, corresponding with altered mitochondrial morphology and function. Taken together, these results suggest misfolded SOD1 contributes to UPS dysfunction and that Ub homeostasis is an important target for monitoring pathological changes in ALS.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we review major classification schemes proposed for oaks by John Claudius Loudon, Anders Sandoe Orsted, William Trelease, Otto Karl Anton Schwarz, Aimee Antoinette Camus, Yuri Leonardovich Menitsky, and Kevin C. Nixon. Classifications of oaks (Fig. 1) have thus far been based entirely on morphological characters. They differed profoundly from each other because each taxonomist gave a different weight to distinguishing characters; often characters that are homoplastic in oaks. With the advent of molecular phylogenetics our view has considerably changed. One of the most profound changes has been the realisation that the traditional split between the East Asian subtropical to tropical subgenus Cyclobalanopsis and the subgenus Quercus that includes all other oaks is artificial. The traditional concept has been replaced by that of two major clades, each comprising three infrageneric groups: a Palearctic-Indomalayan clade including Group Ilex (Ilex oaks), Group Cerris (Cerris oaks) and Group Cyclobalanopsis (cycle-cup oaks), and a predominantly Nearctic clade including Group Protobalanus (intermediate or golden cup oaks), Group Lobatae (red oaks) and Group Quercus (white oaks, with most species in America and some 30 species in Eurasia). The main morphological feature characterising these phylogenetic lineages is pollen morphology, a character overlooked in traditional classifications. This realisation, along with the now available (molecular-)phylogenetic framework, opens new avenues for biogeographic, ecological and evolutionary studies and a re-appraisal of the fossil record. We provide an overview about recent advances in these fields and outline how the results of these studies contribute to the establishment of a unifying systematic scheme of oaks. Ultimately, we propose an updated classification of Quercus recognising two subgenera with eight sections. This classification considers morphological traits, molecular-phylogenetic relationships, and the evolutionary history of one of the most important temperate woody plant genera.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/168146_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (49K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d5a05org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@91295forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3338fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e24a58_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1:C_FLOATNO Classification schemes for Quercus from Loudon to Nixon (see Appendix).

    "abstract": "Short abstractI argue that the popular neural coding metaphor is often misleading. First, the \\\"neural code\\\" often spans both the experimental apparatus and the brain. Second, a neural code is information only by reference to something with a known meaning, which is not the kind of information relevant for a perceptual system. Third, the causal structure of neural codes (linear, atemporal) is incongruent with the causal structure of the brain (circular, dynamic). I conclude that a causal description of the brain cannot be based on neural codes, because spikes are more like actions than hieroglyphs.\\n\\nLong abstract\\\"Neural coding\\\" is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. Here I argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. First, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the neural code depends on experimental details that are not carried by the coding variable. Thus, the representational power of neural codes is much more limited than generally implied. Second, neural codes carry information only by reference to things with known meaning. In contrast, perceptual systems must build information from relations between sensory signals and actions, forming a structured internal model. Neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured. Third, coding variables are observables tied to the temporality of experiments, while spikes are timed actions that mediate coupling in a distributed dynamical system. The coding metaphor tries to fit the dynamic, circular and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent. I conclude that the neural coding metaphor cannot provide a basis for theories of brain function, because it is incompatible with both the causal structure of the brain and the informational requirements of cognition.",

    "abstract": "Single cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. However, because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. But some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, Population Balance Analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.\\n\\nSignificanceSeeing a snapshot of individuals at different stages of a process can reveal what the process would look like for a single individual over time. Biologists apply this principle to infer temporal sequences of gene expression states in cells from measurements made at a single moment in time. However, these inferences are fundamentally under-determined. Using a conservation law, we enumerate reasons that there is no unique dynamics associated with a single snapshot, limiting our ability to infer gene regulatory mechanisms. We then propose a method for dynamic inference that provides a unique dynamic solution under defined approximations and apply it to data from bone marrow stem cells. Overall, this study introduces formal biophysical approaches to single cell bioinformatics.\\n\\nClassificationBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES / Systems Biology",

    "abstract": "Protein levels are most relevant physiologically, but measuring them genome-wide remains a challenge. In contrast, mRNA levels are much easier and less expensive to measure globally. Therefore, RNA levels are typically used to infer the corresponding protein levels. The steady-state condition (assumption that protein levels remain constant) is typically used to calculate protein abundances, as it is mathematically very convenient, even though it is often clear that it is not satisfied for proteins of interest. Here, we propose a simple, yet very effective, method to estimate genome wide protein abundances, which does not require the assumption that protein levels remain constant, and thus allows us to also predict proteome dynamics. Instead, we assume that the system returns to the baseline at the end of experiments; such an assumption is satisfied in many time-course experiments and in all periodic conditions (e.g. cell cycle). The approach only requires availability of gene expression and protein half-life data. As proof-of-concept, we calculated the predicted proteome dynamics for the budding yeast proteome during the cell cycle, which can be conveniently browsed online. The approach was validated experimentally by verifying that the predicted protein concentration changes were consistent with measurements for all proteins tested. Additionally, if proteomic data are also available, our approach can be used to predict how half-lives change in response to posttranslational regulation. We illustrated this application of our method with de novo prediction of changes in the degradation rate of Clb2 in response to post-translational modifications. The predicted changes were consistent with earlier observations in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Modern time series gene expression and other omics data sets have enabled unprecedented resolution of the dynamics of cellular processes such as cell cycle and response to pharmaceutical compounds. In anticipation of the proliferation of time series data sets in the near future, we use the Hopfield model, a recurrent neural network based on spin glasses, to model the dynamics of cell cycle in HeLa (human cervical cancer) and S. cerevisiae cells. We study some of the rich dynamical properties of these cyclic Hopfield systems, including the ability of populations of simulated cells to recreate experimental expression data and the effects of noise on the dynamics. Next, we use a genetic algorithm to identify sets of genes which, when selectively inhibited by local external fields representing gene silencing compounds such as kinase inhibitors, disrupt the encoded cell cycle. We find, for example, that inhibiting the set of four kinases BRD4, MAPK1, NEK7, and YES1 in HeLa cells causes simulated cells to accumulate in the M phase. Finally, we suggest possible improvements and extensions to our model.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCell cycle - the process in which a parent cell replicates its DNA and divides into two daughter cells - is an upregulated process in many forms of cancer. Identifying gene inhibition targets to regulate cell cycle is important to the development of effective therapies. Although modern high throughput techniques offer unprecedented resolution of the molecular details of biological processes like cell cycle, analyzing the vast quantities of the resulting experimental data and extracting actionable information remains a formidable task. Here, we create a dynamical model of the process of cell cycle using the Hopfield model (a type of recurrent neural network) and gene expression data from human cervical cancer cells and yeast cells. We find that the model recreates the oscillations observed in experimental data. Tuning the level of noise (representing the inherent randomness in gene expression and regulation) to the \\\"edge of chaos\\\" is crucial for the proper behavior of the system. We then use this model to identify potential gene targets for disrupting the process of cell cycle. This method could be applied to other time series data sets and used to predict the effects of untested targeted perturbations.",

    "abstract": "The yeast ribosome is a complex molecular machine built from four rRNAs and over 70 r-proteins. Ribosome biogenesis involves ordered incorporation of ribosomal proteins, accompanied by and association and dissociation of other proteins specific to different stages of the process. By model-based analysis of temporal profiles of gene expression in a metabolically regulated system, we obtained an accurate, high-resolution estimation of the time of expression of genes coding for proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. The ribosomal proteins are expressed in a sequence that spans approximately 25-minutes under metabolically regulated conditions. The genes coding for proteins incorporated into the mature ribosome are expressed significantly later than those that are not incorporated, but are otherwise involved in ribosome biogenesis, localization and assembly, rRNA processing and translational initiation. The relative expression time of proteins localized within specified neighborhood is significantly correlated with the distance to the centroid of the mature ribosome: protein localized closer to the center of mass of the entire complex tend to be expressed earlier than the protein localized further from the center. The timeline of gene expression also agrees with the known dependencies between recruitment of specific proteins into the mature ribosome. These findings are consistent in two independent experiments. We have further identified regulatory elements correlated with the time of regulation, including a possible dependence of expression time on the position of the RAP1 binding site within the 5UTR.",

We conducted a field study in Mediterranean annual grasslands to parameterise population models of six competing plant species. Spatially explicit floral visitor assemblages and soil salinity variation were characterized for each species. Both floral visitors and soil salinity modified species population dynamics via direct changes in seed production and indirect changes in competitive responses. Although the magnitude and sign of these changes were species specific, floral visitors promoted coexistence at neighbourhood scales while soil salinity did so over larger scales by changing the superior competitor's identity.

Little consideration has been focussed towards population structure within the brown hyena, which could provide valuable insights about its evolutionary history and aid in conservation efforts of the species. Here we report both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of wild-caught brown hyena individuals from across southern Africa. Mitochondrial DNA shows little to no phylogeographic structure, whereas low-coverage nuclear genomes reveal several potential sub-populations. Moreover, we find that brown hyenas harbour the lowest genetic diversity for a species on both the mitochondrial and nuclear level when compared to a number of mammalian species for which such information is currently available. Our data also reveal that at least on the nuclear DNA level, this low diversity could be the result of a continuous and ongoing decline in effective population size that started about one million years ago and dramatically accelerated towards the end of the Pleistocene. Moreover, our findings also show that the correlation between genetic diversity and the perceived risk of extinction is not particularly strong, since many species with higher genetic diversity than the brown hyena are considered to be at greater risk of extinction. Taken together, our results have important implications for the conservation status and conservation approaches of the brown hyena.",

    "abstract": "Being cared for when sick is a benefit of sociality that can reduce disease and improve survival of group members. However, individuals providing care risk contracting infectious diseases themselves. If they contract a low pathogen dose, they may develop micro-infections that do not cause disease, but still affect host immunity by either decreasing or increasing the hosts vulnerability to subsequent pathogen infections. Caring for contagious individuals can thus significantly alter the future disease susceptibility of caregivers. Using ants and their fungal pathogens as a model system, we here tested if the altered disease susceptibility of experienced caregivers, in turn, affects their expression of sanitary care behaviour. We found that micro-infections contracted during sanitary care had protective or neutral effects upon secondary exposure to the same (homologous) pathogen, but consistently induced high mortality upon super-infection with a different (heterologous) pathogen. In response to this risk, the ants selectively adjusted the expression of their sanitary care. Specifically, the ants performed less grooming yet more antimicrobial disinfection, when caring for nestmates contaminated with heterologous pathogens as compared to homologous ones. By modulating the components of sanitary care in this way, the ants reduced their probability of contracting super-infections of the harmful heterologous pathogens. The performance of risk-adjusted sanitary care reveals the remarkable capacity of ants to react to changes in their disease susceptibility, according to their own infection history, and to flexibly adjust collective care to individual risk.",

However, neither the mechanisms by which genomic heterogeneity emerges within a single population nor how it drives the partitioning of ecological niches are well understood. Here we took advantage of billions of metagenomic reads to study one of the most abundant and widespread microbial populations in the surface ocean. We characterized its substantial amount of genomic heterogeneity using single-amino acid variants (SAAVs), and identified systematic purifying selection and adaptive mechanisms governing non-synonymous variation within this population. Our Deep Learning analysis of SAAVs across metagenomes revealed two main ecological niches that reflect large-scale oceanic current temperatures, as well as six proteotypes demarcating finer-resolved niches. We identified significantly more protein variants in cold currents and an increased number of protein sweeps in warm currents, exposing a global pattern of alternating genomic diversity for this SAR11 population as it drifts along with surface ocean currents. Overall, the geographic partitioning of SAAVs suggests natural selection, rather than neutral evolution, is the main driver of the evolution of SAR11 in surface oceans.",

Aside from the obvious artifacts induced by the magnetic pulses themselves, separate and more sinister signal disturbances arise as a result of contact between the TMS coil and EEG electrodes.\\n\\nNew methodHere we profile the characteristics of these artifacts and introduce a simple device - the coil spacer - to provide a platform allowing physical separation between the coil and electrodes during stimulation.\\n\\nResultsEEG data revealed high amplitude signal disturbances when the TMS coil was in direct contact with the EEG electrodes, well within the physiological range of viable EEG signals. The largest artifacts were located in the Delta and Theta frequency range, and standard data cleanup using independent components analysis (ICA) was ineffective due to the artifacts similarity to real brain oscillations.\\n\\nComparison with Existing MethodWhile the current best practice is to use a large coil holding apparatus to fixate the coil  hovering over the head with an air gap, the spacer provides a simpler solution that ensures this distance is kept constant throughout testing.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results strongly suggest that data collected from combined TMS-EEG studies with the coil in direct contact with the EEG cap are polluted with low frequency artifacts that are indiscernible from physiological brain signals. The coil spacer provides a cheap and simple solution to this problem and is recommended for use in future simultaneous TMS-EEG recordings.",

    "abstract": "The neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in a variety of functions that involve patience or impulse control. For example, activation of 5-HT neurons promotes waiting for delayed rewards. Many of these effects are consistent with a long-standing theory that 5-HT promotes behavioral inhibition, a motivational bias favoring passive over active behaviors. To further test this idea, we studied the impact of 5-HT in a probabilistic foraging task, in which mice must learn the statistics of the environment and infer when to leave a depleted foraging site for the next. Critically, mice were required to actively nose poke in order to exploit a given site. We found that optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus increased the willingness of mice to actively attempt to exploit a reward site before giving up. These results indicate that behavioral inhibition is not an adequate description of 5-HT function and suggest that a unified account must be based on a higher-order function.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiome composition and function are symbiotically linked with host health, and altered in metabolic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Three recognized mechanisms exist by which the microbiome influences the gut-brain axis: modification of autonomic/sensorimotor connections, immune activation, and neuroendocrine pathway regulation. We hypothesized interactions between circulating gut-derived microbial metabolites and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) also contribute to the gut-brain axis. Propionate, produced from dietary substrates by colonic bacteria, stimulates intestinal gluconeogenesis and is associated with reduced stress behaviours, but its potential endocrine role has not been addressed. After demonstrating expression of the propionate receptor FFAR3 on human brain endothelium, we examined the impact of a physiologically relevant propionate concentration (1 M) on BBB properties in vitro. Propionate inhibited pathways associated with non-specific microbial infections via a CD14-dependent mechanism, suppressed expression of LRP-1 and protected the BBB from oxidative stress via NRF2 (NFE2L2) signaling. Together, these results suggest gut-derived microbial metabolites interact with the BBB, representing a fourth facet of the gut-brain axis that warrants further attention.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila has become an excellent model system for investigating the organization and function of the gustatory system due to the relatively simple neuroanatomical organization of its brain and the availability of powerful genetic and transgenic technology. Thus, at the molecular and cellular level, a great deal of insight into the peripheral detection and coding of gustatory information has already been attained. In contrast, much less is known about the central neural circuits that process this information and induce behaviorally appropriate motor output. Here we combine functional behavioral tests with targeted transgene expression through specific driver lines to identify a single bilaterally homologous pair of bitter sensitive interneurons that are located in the subesophageal zone of the brain. Anatomical and functional data indicate that these interneurons receive specific synaptic input from bitter sensitive gustatory receptor neurons. Targeted transgenic activation and inactivation experiments show that these bitter sensitive interneurons can largely suppress the proboscis extension reflex to appetitive stimuli such as sugar and water. These functional experiments together with calcium-imaging studies indicate that these first order local interneurons play an important role in the inhibition of the proboscis extension reflex that occurs in response to bitter tastants. Taken together, our studies present a cellular identification and functional characterization of a key gustatory interneuron in the bitter sensitive gustatory circuitry of the adult fly.",

Our aims in this study were determination of the anti-mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of HBV on mammary carcinoma, lonely and in combination with cisplatin. In this study 4T1 cell line were cultured and incubated at 37 C in humidified CO2-incubator. The cell viabilities were examined by MTT assay. Also HBV was screened for its anti-mutagenic activity against sodium azide by Ames test. The result showed that 6g/ml HBV, 20g/ml cisplatin and 6g/ml HBV with 10g/ml cisplatin can induce an approximately 50% 4T1 cell death. 7mg/ml HBV with the inhibition of 62.76% sodium azide showed high potential in decreasing the mutagenic agents. MTT assay demonstrated that HBV and cisplatin can cause cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of cisplatin is also promoted by HBV. Ames test results indicated that HBV can inhibit sodium azide as a mutagenic agent. Anti-mutagenic activity of HBV was increased significantly in presence of S9 mix. Hence, our findings reveal that HBV can enhance the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin drug and it has cancer preventing effects.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization and gene flow between species appears to be common. Even though it is clear that hybridization is widespread across all surveyed taxonomic groups, the magnitude and consequences of introgression are still largely unknown. Thus it is crucial to develop the statistical machinery required to uncover which genomic regions have recently acquired haplotypes via introgression from a sister population. We developed a novel machine learning framework, called FILET (Finding Introgressed Loci via Extra-Trees) capable of revealing genomic introgression with far greater power than competing methods. FILET works by combining information from a number of population genetic summary statistics, including several new statistics that we introduce, that capture patterns of variation across two populations. We show that FILET is able to identify loci that have experienced gene flow between related species with high accuracy, and in most situations can correctly infer which population was the donor and which was the recipient. Here we describe a data set of outbred diploid Drosophila sechellia genomes, and combine them with data from D. simulans to examine recent introgression between these species using FILET. Although we find that these populations may have split more recently than previously appreciated, FILET confirms that there has indeed been appreciable recent introgression (some of which might have been adaptive) between these species, and reveals that this gene flow is primarily in the direction of D. simulans to D. sechellia.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYUnderstanding the extent to which species or diverged populations hybridize in nature is crucially important if we are to understand the speciation process. Accordingly numerous research groups have developed methodology for finding the genetic evidence of such introgression. In this report we develop a supervised machine learning approach for uncovering loci which have introgressed across species boundaries. We show that our method, FILET, has greater accuracy and power than competing methods in discovering introgression, and in addition can detect the directionality associated with the gene flow between species. Using whole genome sequences from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila sechellia we show that FILET discovers quite extensive introgression between these species that has occurred mostly from D. simulans to D. sechellia. Our work highlights the complex process of speciation even within a well-studied system and points to the growing importance of supervised machine learning in population genetics.",

Here, we combine barcode lineage tracking, sequencing of adaptive clones, and mathematical modelling of mutational dynamics to understand diversity changes during experimental evolution. We find that, despite differences in beneficial mutational mechanisms and fitness effects between two environments, early adaptive genetic diversity increases predictably, driven by the expansion of many single-mutant lineages. However, a crash in diversity follows, caused by highly-fit double-mutants fed from exponentially growing single-mutants, a process closely related to the classic Luria-Delbruck experiment. The diversity crash is likely to be a general feature of clonal evolution, however its timing and magnitude is stochastic and depends on the population size, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects, and patterns of epistasis.",

By 50K SNP genotyping we found a discontinuous distribution of taurine and indicine cattle ancestries with extremes of less than 10% indicine cattle in the north and more than 90% in the far south and southwest China. Model-based clustering and f4-statistics indicate introgression of both banteng and gayal into southern Chinese cattle while the sporadic yak influence in cattle in or near Tibetan area validate earlier findings of mitochondrial DNA analysis. Geographic patterns of taurine and indicine mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal DNA diversity largely agree with the autosomal cline. The geographic distribution of the genomic admixture of different bovine species is proposed to be the combined effect of prehistoric immigrations, gene flow, major rivers acting as genetic barriers, local breeding objectives and environmental adaptation. Whole-genome scan for genetic differentiation and association analyses with both environmental and morphological covariables are remarkably consistent with previous studies and identify a number of genes implicated in adaptation, which include TNFRSF19, RFX4, SP4 and several coat color genes.

    "abstract": "Few viruses have been documented in plants outside angiosperms. Endogenous viral elements (paleoviruses) provide  molecular fossils for studying the deep history and macroevolution of viruses. Endogenous plant pararetroviruses (EPRVs) are widespread across angiosperms, but little is known about EPRVs in earlier branching plants. Here we use a large-scale phylogenomic approach to investigate the diversity and macroevolution of plant pararetroviruses (formally known as Caulimoviridae). We uncover an unprecedented and unappreciated diversity of EPRVs in the genomes of gymnosperms and ferns. The known angiosperm viruses only constitute a minor part of the Caulimoviridae diversity. By characterizing the distribution of EPRVs, we show that no major euphyllophyte lineages escape the activity of Caulimoviridae, raising the possibility that many exogenous Caulimoviridae remain to be discovered in euphyllophytes. We find that the copy numbers of EPRVs are generally high, suggesting that EPRVs define a unique group of repetitive elements and represent major components of euphyllophyte genomes. Phylogenetic analyses reveal an ancient monilophyte origin of Caulimoviridae and at least three independent origins of Caulimoviridae in angiosperms by cross-division transmissions. Our findings uncover the remarkable diversity of Caulimoviridae and have important implications in understanding the origin and macroevolution of plant pararetroviruses.",

By analyzing DNA copy profiles of 1,000 DLBCLs, we identified gains of 18q21.2 as the most frequent genetic alteration in ABC-like DLBCL. We show that these alterations target the TCF4 (E2-2) transcription factor, and that over-expression of TCF4 leads to its occupancy on immunoglobulin gene enhancers and increased expression of IgM at the transcript and protein level. The TCF4 gene is one of the top BRD4-regulated genes in DLBCL. Using a BET proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) we show that TCF4 and IgM expression can be extinguished, and ABC-like DLBCL cells can be killed in vitro and in vivo. This highlights a novel genetic mechanism for promoting immunoglobulin signaling in ABC-like DLBCL and provides a functional rationale for the use of BET inhibitors in this disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThere has been a recent surge of interest in exploiting the process of reconsolidation to weaken maladaptive memories, in the hope this will drive the next wave of innovation in psychotherapy. Reconsolidation normally functions to stabilise and maintain memories in the long-term, and is critical in enabling memory updating. However, this process can be disrupted pharmacologically to weaken memories, or harnessed to allow destructive interference of a memory trace. Work has already begun to exploit this mechanism to disrupt pavlovian fear memories in the treatment of maladaptive anxiety and threat processing, and additionally being able to target instrumental memories may provide further clinical benefit.\\n\\nMETHODSExpanding our rat intravenous (i.v.) self-administration paradigm, we tested whether disruption of instrumental memory reconsolidation with the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 could reduce relapse of cocaine seeking in response to stress, drug-priming or presentation of a drug-associated cue.\\n\\nRESULTSSpontaneous responding for i.v. cocaine was reduced by reconsolidation-disruption. Furthermore, responding was not rescued by pharmacologically-induced stress. However, responding was restored following systemic administration of the drug, or presentation of a drug-associated cue.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThese data are consistent with hypothesis that there exist multiple  routes to relapse, and suggest that at least some of these routes could be blocked by reconsolidation-disruption. This work provides important proof-of-principle that reconsolidation based therapies are a viable means of reducing the rates of relapse in substance use disorders.",

    "abstract": "Network-level analysis based on anatomical, pairwise similarities (e.g., cortical thickness) has been gaining increasing attention recently. However, there has not been a systematic study of the impact of spatial scale and edge definitions on predictive performance. In order to obtain a clear understanding of relative performance, there is a need for systematic comparison. In this study, we present a histogram-based approach to construct subject-wise weighted networks that enable a principled comparison across different methods of network analysis. We design several weighted networks based on three large publicly available datasets and perform a robust evaluation of their predictive power under four levels of separability. An interesting insight generated is that changes in nodal size (spatial scale) have no significant impact on predictive power among the three classification experiments and two disease cohorts studied, i.e. mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimers disease from ADNI, and Autism from the ABIDE dataset. We also release an open source python package called graynet to enable others to implement the novel network feature extraction algorithm, which is applicable to other modalities as well (due to its domain- and feature-agnostic nature) in diverse applications of connectivity research. In addition, the findings from the ADNI dataset are replicated in the AIBL dataset using an open source machine learning tool called neuropredict.",

    "abstract": "Theories of Enactivism propose an action-oriented approach to understand human cognition. So far, however, empirical evidence supporting these theories has been sparse. Here, we investigate whether spatial navigation based on allocentric reference frames that are independent of the observers physical body can be understood within an action-oriented approach. Therefore, we performed three experiments testing the knowledge of the absolute orientation of houses and streets towards north, the relative orientation of two houses and two streets, respectively, and the location of houses towards each other in a pointing task. Our results demonstrate that under time pressure, the relative orientation of two houses can be retrieved more accurately than the absolute orientation of single houses. With infinite time for cognitive reasoning, the performance of the task using house stimuli increased greatly for the absolute orientation and surpassed the slightly improved performance in the relative orientation task. In contrast, with streets as stimuli participants performed under time pressure better in the absolute orientation task. Overall, pointing from one house to another house yielded the best performance. This suggests, firstly, that orientation and location information about houses are primarily coded in house-to-house relations, whereas cardinal information is deduced via cognitive reasoning. Secondly, orientation information for streets is preferentially coded in absolute orientations. Thus, our results suggest that spatial information about house and street orientation is coded differently and that house orientation and location is primarily learned in an action-oriented way, which is in line with an enactive framework for human cognition.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in memory research is how different forms of memory interact. Previous research has shown that people rely on working memory (WM) in short-term recognition tasks; a common view is that episodic memory (EM) only influences performance on these tasks when WM maintenance is disrupted. However, retrieval of memories from EM has been widely observed during brief periods of quiescence, raising the possibility that EM retrievals during maintenance-critically, before a response can be prepared-might affect short-term recognition memory performance even in the absence of distraction. We hypothesized that this influence would be mediated by the lingering presence of reactivated EM content in WM. We obtained support for this hypothesis in three experiments, showing that delay-period EM reactivation introduces incidentally-associated information (context) into WM, and that these retrieved associations negatively impact subsequent recognition, leading to substitution errors (Experiment 1) and slowing of accurate responses (Experiment 2). fMRI pattern analysis showed that slowing is mediated by the content of EM reinstatement (Experiment 3). These results expose a previously hidden influence of EM on WM, raising new questions about the adaptive nature of their interaction.",

    "abstract": "How to extract informative features from genome sequence is a challenging issue. Gapped k-mers frequency vectors (gkm-fv) has been presented as a new type of features in the last few years. Coupled with support vector machine (gkm-SVM), gkm-fvs have been used to achieve effective sequence-based predictions. However, the huge computation of a large kernel matrix prevents it from using large amount of data. And it is unclear how to combine gkm-fvs with other data sources in the context of string kernel. On the other hand, the high dimensionality, colinearity and sparsity of gkm-fvs hinder the use of many traditional machine learning methods without a kernel trick. Therefore, we proposed a flexible and scalable framework gkm-DNN to achieve feature representation from high-dimensional gkm-fvs using deep neural networks (DNN). We first proposed a more concise version of gkm-fvs which significantly reduce the dimension of gkm-fvs. Then we implemented an efficient method to calculate the gkm-fv of a given sequence at the first time. Finally, we adopted a DNN model with gkm-fvs as inputs to achieve efficient feature representation and a prediction task. Here, we took the transcription factor binding site prediction as an illustrative application. We applied gkm-DNN onto 467 small and 69 big human ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets to demonstrate its performance and compared it with the state-of-the-art method gkm-SVM. We demonstrated that gkm-DNN can not only improve the limitations of high dimensionality, colinearity and sparsity of gkm-fvs, but also make comparable overall performance compared with gkm-SVM using the same gkm-fvs. In addition, we used gkm-DNN to explore the representation power of gkm-fvs and provided more explanation on how gkm-fvs work.",

GeneClass is a boosting-based algorithm that learns gene regulatory networks from complementary paired feature sets such as transcription factor expression levels and binding motifs across conditions.

We present a parallelized, Python-based implementation of GeneClass, called PyBoost, along with a novel hierarchical implementation of the algorithm, called HiBoost. HiBoost allows regulatory logic to be constrained to a hierarchical group of conditions or cell types. The software can be used to dissect differentiation cascades, time courses or other perturbation data that naturally form a hierarchy or trajectory. We demonstrate the application of PyBoost and HiBoost to learn regulators of tadpole tail regeneration and hematopoeitic stem cell differentiation and validate learned regulators through an inducible CRISPR system.\\n\\nAvailability: The implementation is publicly available here: https://github.com/kundajelab/boosting2D/.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors (STKR1) transduce a wide spectrum of biological signals mediated by TGF-{beta} superfamily members. The STKR1 activity is tightly controlled by their regulatory glycine-serine rich (GS) domain adjacent to the kinase domain. Despite decades of studies, it remains unknown how physiological or pathological GS domain modifications are coupled to STKR1 kinase activity. Here, by performing molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation of Activin-Like Kinase 2 (ALK2), we found that GS domain phosphorylation, FKBP12 dissociation, and disease mutations all destabilize a D354-R375 salt-bridge, which normally acts as an electrostatic lock to prevent coordination of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the catalytic site. We developed a WAFEX-guided principal analysis and unraveled how phosphorylation destabilizes this highly conserved salt-bridge in temporal and physical space. Using current-flow betweenness scores, we identified an allosteric network of residue-residue contacts between the GS domain and the catalytic site that controls the formation and disruption of this salt bridge. Importantly, our novel network analysis approach revealed how certain disease-causing mutations bypass FKBP12-mediated kinase inhibition to produce leaky signaling in the absence of ligand. We further provide experimental evidence that this salt-bridge lock exists in other STKR1s, and acts as a general safety mechanism in STKR1 to prevent pathological leaky signaling. In summary, our study provides a compelling and unifying allosteric activation mechanism in STKR1 kinases that reconciles a large number of experimental studies and sheds light on a novel therapeutic avenue to target disease-related STKR1 mutants.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYKinases play central role in essential physiological process and are attractive therapeutic drug targets. One of the important kinase families is Type 1 Serine/Threonine Kinase Receptors (STKR1), which control gene expression in response to extracellular growth factors. The activities of STKR1 are tightly controlled by their regulatory domain, which is distant from the kinase catalytic site. The underlying molecular mechanism is elucidated here. We identified that formation or disruption of a highly conserved charge-charge interaction located near the ATP binding site, mediates the physiological inhibition or activation of STKR1. We find that the stability of this charge-charge interaction is remotely controlled by interactions propagated from the distant regulatory domain. Several disease-causing mutations are located at the regulatory domain. We demonstrate how those mutations bypass these endogenous STKR1 inhibition mechanisms to produce pathological phenotypes. This study provides a general activation mechanism in STKR1 kinases, thus may benefit understanding the molecular mechanism of diseases and drug development.",

Here we focus on the molecular machinery involved in the generation of endocytic vesicles of the clathrin and dynamin-independent CLIC/GEEC (CG) pathway. This pathway internalises many GPI-anchored proteins and a large fraction of the fluid-phase in different cell types. We developed a real-time TIRF assay using pH-sensitive GFP-GPI to identify nascent CG endocytic sites. The temporal profile of known CG pathway modulators showed that ARF1/GBF1 (GTPase/GEF pair) and CDC42 (RhoGTPase) are recruited sequentially to CG endocytic sites, [~]60s and [~]9s prior to scission. Using a limited RNAi screen, we found several BAR domain proteins affecting CG endocytosis and focused on IRSp53 and PICK1 that have interactions with CDC42 and ARF1 respectively. IRSp53, an I-BAR domain containing protein, was recruited to the plasma membrane at the site of forming CG endocytic vesicles and in its absence, nascent endocytic CLICs, did not form. The requirement for actin polymerization in the CG pathway suggested a role for nucleators of actin polymerization, and ARP2/3 was found enriched at the site of the forming endocytic vesicle. PICK1, a BAR domain containing protein and the ARP2/3 inhibitor is recruited at an early stage along with ARP2/3, but is removed from the endocytic site coincident with CDC42 recruitment and a burst of Factin polymerization. This study provides a spatio-temporal understanding of the molecular machinery necessary to build a CG endocytic vesicle.",

Relationships between Basidiomycota subphyla, the rusts (Pucciniomycotina), smuts (Ustilaginomycotina) and mushroom forming fungi (Agaricomycotina) represent a particularly challenging situation that posed problems to both traditional multigene and genome-scale phylogenetic studies. Here, we address basal Basidiomycota relationships using three different phylogenomic datasets, concatenated and gene tree-based analyses and examine the contribution of several potential sources of uncertainty, including fast-evolving sites, putative long-branch taxa, model violation and missing data. We inferred conflicting results with different datasets and under different models. Fast-evolving sites and oversimplified models of amino acid substitution favored the grouping of smuts with mushroom-forming fungi, often leading to maximal bootstrap support in both concatenation and Astral analyses. The most conserved datasets grouped rusts with mushroom forming fungi, although this relationship proved labile, sensitive to model choice, different data subsets and missing data. Excluding putative long branch taxa, genes with the highest proportions of missing data and/or genes with strong signal failed to reveal a consistent trend toward one or the other topology, suggesting that additional sources of conflict are at play too. Our analyses suggest that topologies uniting smuts with mushroom forming fungi can arise as a result of inappropriate modeling of amino acid sites that might be prone to systematic bias. While concatenated analyses yielded strong but conflicting support, individual gene trees mostly provided poor support for rusts, smuts and mushroom-forming fungi, suggesting that the true Basidiomycota tree might be in a part of the tree space that is difficult to access using both concatenation and gene tree based approaches. Thus, basal Basidiomycota relationships remain unresolved and might represent a phylogenetic problem that remains contentious even in the genomic era.",

    "abstract": "The cohesin complex topologically encircles chromosomes and mediates sister chromatid cohesion to ensure accurate chromosome segregation upon cell division. Cohesin also participates in DNA repair and gene transcription. The Nipped-B - Mau2 protein complex loads cohesin onto chromosomes and the Pds5 - Wapl complex removes cohesin. Pds5 is also essential for sister chromatid cohesion, indicating that it has functions beyond cohesin removal. The Brca2 DNA repair protein interacts with Pds5, but the roles of this complex beyond DNA repair are unknown. Here we show that Brca2 opposes Pds5 function in sister chromatid cohesion by assaying precocious sister chromatid separation in metaphase spreads of cultured cells depleted for these proteins. By genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation we find that Pds5 facilitates SA cohesin subunit association with DNA replication origins and that Brca2 inhibits SA binding, mirroring their effects on sister chromatid cohesion. Cohesin binding is maximal at replication origins and extends outward to occupy active genes and regulatory sequences. Pds5 and Wapl, but not Brca2, limit the distance that cohesin extends from origins, thereby determining which active genes, enhancers and silencers bind cohesin. Using RNA-seq we find that Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl influence the expression of most genes sensitive to Nipped-B and cohesin, largely in the same direction. These findings demonstrate that Brca2 regulates sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression in addition to its canonical role in DNA repair and expand the known functions of accessory proteins in cohesins diverse functions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe cohesin protein complex has multiple functions in eukaryotic cells. It ensures that when a cell divides, the two daughter cells receive the correct number of chromosomes. It does this by holding together the sister chromatids that are formed when chromosomes are duplicated by DNA replication. Cohesin also helps repair damaged DNA, and to regulate genes important for growth and development. Even minor deficiencies in some proteins that regulate cohesin cause significant human birth defects. Here we investigated in Drosophila cells how three proteins, Pds5, Wapl and Brca2, determine where cohesin binds to chromosomes, control cohesins ability to hold sister chromatids together, and participate in gene expression. We find that Pds5 and Wapl work together, likely during DNA replication, to determine which genes bind cohesin by controlling how far cohesin spreads out along chromosomes. Pds5 is required for cohesin to hold sister chromatids together, and Brca2 counteracts this function. In contrast to the opposing roles in sister chromatid cohesion, Pds5 and Brca2 work together to facilitate control of gene expression by cohesin. Brca2 plays a critical role in DNA repair, and these studies expand the known roles for Brca2 by showing that it also regulates sister chromatid cohesion and gene expression. BRCA2 mutations in humans increase susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, and these findings raise the possibility that changes in chromosome segregation or gene expression might contribute to the increased cancer risk associated with these mutations.",

To probe the mechanisms by which histone modifications are read out, we designed an obligate pair of H3 heterodimers, termed H3X and H3Y, which we extensively validated genetically and biochemically. Comparing the effects of asymmetric histone tail point mutants with those of symmetric double mutants revealed that a single methylated H3K36 per nucleosome was sufficient to silence cryptic transcription in vivo. We also demonstrate the utility of this system for analysis of histone modification crosstalk, using mass spectrometry to separately identify modifications on each H3 molecule within asymmetric nucleosomes. The ability to generate asymmetric nucleosomes in vivo and in vitro provides a powerful and generalizable tool to probe the mechanisms by which H3 tails are read out by effector proteins in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Inference of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (SCs) from the spike trains is poorly addressed in the literature due to the complexity of the problem. As recent technological advancements make recording spikes from multiple (neighbor) neurons of a behaving animal (in some rare cases from humans) possible, this paper tackles the problem of estimating SCs solely from the recorded spike trains. Given an ensemble of spikes corresponding to population of neighbor neurons, we aim to infer the average excitatory and inhibitory SCs underlying the shared neural activity. In this paper, we extended our previously established Kalman filtering (KF) based algorithm to incorporate the voltage-to-spike nonlinearity (mapping from membrane potential to spike rate). Having estimated the instantaneous spike rate using optimal linear filtering (Gaussian kernel), our proposed algorithm uses KF followed by expectation maximization (EM) algorithm in a recursive fashion to infer the average SCs. As the dynamics of SCs and membrane potential is included in our model, the proposed algorithm, unlike other related works, considers different sources of stochasticity, i.e., the variabilities of SCs, membrane potential, and spikes. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that our algorithm is blind to the external stimulus, and it performs only based on observed spikes. We validate the accuracy and practicality of our technique through simulation studies where leaky integrate and fire (LIF) model is used to generate spikes. We show that the estimated SCs can precisely track the original ones. Moreover, we show that the performance of our algorithm can be further improved given enough number of trials (spikes). As a rule of thumb, 50 trials of neurons with the average firing rate of 5 Hz can guarantee the accuracy of our proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Inferring neural mechanisms from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is challenging because the fMRI signal integrates over millions of neurons. One approach is to compare computational models that map neural activity to fMRI responses, to see which best predicts fMRI data. We used this approach to compare four possible neural mechanisms of fMRI adaptation to repeated stimuli (scaling, sharpening, repulsive shifting and attractive shifting), acting across three domains (global, local and remote). Six features of fMRI repetition effects were identified, both univariate and multivariate, from two independent fMRI experiments. After searching over parameter values, only the local scaling model could simultaneously fit all data features from both experiments. Thus fMRI stimulus repetition effects are best captured by down-scaling neuronal tuning curves in proportion to the difference between the stimulus and neuronal preference. These results emphasize the importance of formal modelling for bridging neuronal and fMRI levels of investigation.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between structure and function in the human brain is well established, but not yet well characterised. Large-scale biophysical models allow us to investigate this relationship, by leveraging structural information (e.g. derived from diffusion tractography) in order to couple dynamical models of local neuronal activity into networks of interacting regions distributed across the cortex. In practice however, these models are difficult to parametrise, and their simulation is often delicate and computationally expensive. This undermines the experimental aspect of scientific modelling, and stands in the way of comparing different parametrisations, network architectures, or models in general, with confidence. Here, we advocate the use of Bayesian optimisation for assessing the capabilities of biophysical network models, given a set of desired properties (e.g. band-specific functional connectivity); and in turn the use of this assessment as a principled basis for incremental modelling and model comparison. We adapt an optimisation method designed to cope with costly, high-dimensional, non-convex problems, and demonstrate its use and effectiveness. We find that this method is able to converge to regions of high functional similarity with real MEG data, with very few samples given the number of parameters, without getting stuck in local extrema, and while building and exploiting a map of uncertainty defined smoothly across the parameter space. We compare the results obtained using different methods of structural connectivity estimation from diffusion tractography, and find that one method leads to better simulations.",

Our recent theoretical development of modular cell (MODCELL) design principles can offer a promising solution for rapid generation of optimal strains by coupling a modular cell and exchangeable production modules in a plug-and-play fashion. In this study, we experimentally validated some designed properties of MODCELL by demonstrating: i) a modular (chassis) cell is required to couple with a production module, a heterologous ethanol pathway, as a testbed, ii) degree of coupling between the modular cell and production modules can be modulated to enhance growth and product synthesis, iii) a modular cell can be used as a host to select an optimal pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) of the ethanol production module and to help identify a hypothetical PDC protein, and iv) adaptive laboratory evolution based on growth selection of the modular cell can enhance growth and product synthesis rates. We envision that the MODCELL design provides a powerful prototype for modular cell engineering to rapidly create optimal strains for synthesis of a large space of biochemicals.",

To determine both the key conformations of OR to atomic resolution as well as the transitions between them, long timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted and analyzed. These simulations predict new and potentially druggable metastable states that have not been observed by crystallography. We applied cutting edge algorithms (e.g., tICA and Transfer Entropy) to guide our analysis and distill the key events and conformations from simulation, presenting a transferrable and systematic analysis scheme.

Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170159v15_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a55a1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bebb0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5b11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e735_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 0.1:C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Consistent decisions are intuitively desirable and theoretically important for utility maximization. Neuroeconomics has established the neurobiological substrate of value representation, but brain regions that provide input to the value-processing network is less explored. The constructed-preference tradition within behavioral decision research gives a critical role to cognitive processes that rely on associations, suggesting a role for the hippocampus in making decisions and to do so consistently. We compared the performance of 31 patients with mediotemporal lobe (MTL) epilepsy and hippocampal lesions, 30 patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy, and 30 healthy controls on two tasks: binary choices between candy bars based on their preferences and a number-comparison control task where the larger number is chosen. MTL patients make more inconsistent choices than the other two groups for the value-based choice but not the number-comparison task. These inconsistencies increase with the volume of compromised hippocampal tissue. These results suggest a critical involvement of the MTL in preference construction and value-based choices.\\n\\nSignificanceOur days are full of choices that reflect our preferences. Economics lays out models of how to optimally make these decisions. Neuroeconomics has identified a cortical value-processing network whose activity correlates with constructs related to valuation and choice in economic models. However open questions remain: How are these value signals formed, and what regions might be necessary for retrieving and computing these value signals? Inspired by cognitive models calling on associative processes in value-based decisions, this paper uses unique neuropsychological data to establish the critical role of the medial temporal lobe in making consistent choices and further informs our understanding of the value-processing network.",

Current data place the actin-junctional linker Canoe (mammalian Afadins homolog) at the top of the polarity hierarchy, where it directs Bazooka/Par3 and adherens junctions positioning. Here we define mechanisms regulating Canoe localization/function. Spatial organization of Canoe is multifaceted, involving membrane-localization, recruitment to nascent junctions and macromolecular assembly into cables at tricellular junctions. Our data suggest apical activation of the small GTPase Rap1 regulates all three events, but support multiple modes of regulation.

    "abstract": "Mechanisms initiating a branching process that can lead to new species are broadly classified as chromosomal and genic. Chromosomal mechanisms are supported by breeding studies involving exchanges of individual chromosomes or their segments between mouse subspecies. There are also studies of the rapidly mutating mouse PR/SET-domain 9 (prdm9) gene, which encodes PRDM9, a protein targeting DNA recombination hotspots. When PRDM9 is bound symmetrically with equal strength, the meiotic repair of mutations in one parental strand, based on information on the allelic strand (conversion), would seem to be unbiased in discriminating between strands. So mismatches detected between pairing paternal and maternal DNA strands (heteroduplexes) undergo unbiased conversions (to homoduplexes). This leaves uncertainty on whether a mutation has been corrected or compounded. However, it has been hypothesized that tagging of mismatch regions, so that both strands are epigenetically marked as uncertain, would make it possible over numerous generations for mutations to be corrected (biased conversions) whenever asymmetry is detected. Thus, variation would decrease and members of a species would remain within its bounds. Intriguingly, new experimental studies show that, when chromosomally interpreted, PRDM9 also works through asymmetrical epigenetic labelling to confine members to species bounds. To the extent that the experimentally observed and hypothetical anti-speciation asymmetries can be related, chromosomal mechanisms are further supported.",

We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For highly fluid social behaviour disease transmission is revealed to be density-dependent. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity.",

This most affected sets reveals 75 novel coding convergences in important genes that pattern a highly adapted organ: the cochlea, skin and lung in echolocating, aquatic and high-altitude mammals, respectively. Our test explicitly requires the enriched converged term to not be simultaneously enriched for divergent mutations, and correctly dismisses relaxation-based signals, such as those produced by vision genes in subterranean mammals. This novel test can be readily applied to birds, fish, flies, worms etc., to discover more of the fascinating contribution of protein coding convergence to phenotype convergence.",
