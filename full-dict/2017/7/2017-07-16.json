    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory changes have been shown to contribute to phenotypic differences between species, but many questions remain about how gene expression evolves. Here we report the first comparative study of nascent transcription in primates. We used PRO-seq to map actively transcribing RNA polymerases in resting and activated CD4+ T-cells in multiple human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque individuals, with rodents as outgroups. This approach allowed us to measure transcription separately from post-transcriptional processes. We observed general conservation in coding and non-coding transcription, punctuated by numerous differences between species, particularly at distal enhancers and non-coding RNAs. We found evidence that transcription factor binding sites are a primary determinant of transcriptional differences between species, that stabilizing selection maintains gene expression levels despite frequent changes at distal enhancers, and that adaptive substitutions have driven lineage-specific transcription. Finally, we found strong correlations between evolutionary rates and long-range chromatin interactions. These observations clarify the role of primary transcription in regulatory evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscriptional target genes show functional enrichment of genes. However, how many and how significantly transcriptional target genes include functional enrichments are still unclear. To address these issues, I predicted human transcriptional target genes using open chromatin regions, ChIP-seq data and DNA binding sequences of transcription factors in databases, and examined functional enrichment and gene expression level of putative transcriptional target genes.\\n\\nResultsGene Ontology annotations showed four times larger numbers of functional enrichments in putative transcriptional target genes than gene expression information alone, independent of transcriptional target genes. To compare the number of functional enrichments of putative transcriptional target genes between cells or search conditions, I normalized the number of functional enrichment by calculating its ratios in the total number of transcriptional target genes. With this analysis, native putative transcriptional target genes showed the largest normalized number of functional enrichments, compared with target genes including 5 - 60% of randomly selected genes. The normalized number of functional enrichments was changed according to the criteria of enhancer-promoter interactions such as distance from transcriptional start sites and orientation of CTCF-binding sites. Forward-reverse orientation of CTCF-binding sites showed significantly higher normalized number of functional enrichments than the other orientations. Journal papers showed that the top five frequent functional enrichments were related to the cellular functions in the three cell types. The median expression level of transcriptional target genes changed according to the criteria of enhancer-promoter assignments (i.e. interactions) and was correlated with the changes of the normalized number of functional enrichments of transcriptional target genes.\\n\\nConclusionsHuman putative transcriptional target genes showed significant functional enrichments. Functional enrichments were related to the cellular functions. The normalized number of functional enrichments of human putative transcriptional target genes changed according to the criteria of enhancer-promoter assignments and correlated with the median expression level of the target genes. These analyses and characters of human putative transcriptional target genes would be useful to examine the criteria of enhancer-promoter assignments and to predict the novel mechanisms and factors such as DNA binding proteins and DNA sequences of enhancer-promoter interactions.",

    "abstract": "The Gene Ontology (GO) database contains GO terms that describe biological functions of genes. Previous methods for comparing GO terms have relied on the fact that GO terms are organized into a tree structure. In this paradigm, the locations of two GO terms in the tree dictate their similarity score. In this paper, we introduce two new solutions for this problem, by focusing instead on the definitions of the GO terms. We apply neural network based techniques from the natural language processing (NLP) domain. The first method does not rely on the GO tree, whereas the second indirectly depends on the GO tree. In our first approach, we compare two GO definitions by treating them as two unordered sets of words. The word similarity is estimated by a word embedding model that maps words into an N-dimensional space. In our second approach, we account for the word-ordering within a sentence. We use a sentence encoder to embed GO definitions into vectors and estimate how likely one definition entails another. We validate our methods in two ways. In the first experiment, we test the models ability to differentiate a true protein-protein network from a randomly generated network. In the second experiment, we test the model in identifying orthologs from randomly-matched genes in human, mouse, and fly. In both experiments, a hybrid of NLP and GO-tree based method achieves the best classification accuracy.\\n\\nAvailabilitygithub.com/datduong/NLPMethods2CompareGOterms",

    "abstract": "It is a truism that antimicrobial drugs select for resistance, but explaining pathogen- and population-specific variation in patterns of resistance remains an open problem. Like other common commensals, Streptococcus pneumoniae has demonstrated persistent coexistence of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. Theoretically, this outcome is unlikely. We modeled the dynamics of competing strains of S. pneumoniae to investigate the impact of transmission dynamics and treatment-induced selective pressures on the probability of stable coexistence. We find that the outcome of competition is extremely sensitive to structure in the host population, although coexistence can arise from age-assortative transmission models with age-varying rates of antibiotic use. Moreover, we find that the selective pressure from antibiotics arises not so much from the rate of antibiotic use per se but from the frequency of treatment: frequent antibiotic therapy disproportionately impacts the fitness of sensitive strains. This same phenomenon explains why serotypes with longer durations of carriage tend to be more resistant. These dynamics may apply to other potentially pathogenic, microbial commensals and highlight how population structure, which is often omitted from models, can have a large impact.",

    "abstract": "Despite the great importance of RNA-protein interactions in cells, there is a very limited set of approaches available for identifying proteins that bind to a specific RNA. We report here combining the use of CRISPR technology with the yeast two-hybrid protein-protein interaction system in order to create an advantageous method for investigating RNA-protein interactions. In this CRISPR-assisted RNA/RBP yeast (CARRY) two-hybrid system, an RNA of interest is targeted to the promoters of standard yeast two-hybrid reporter genes by fusing it to the CRISPR guide RNA in a strain expressing catalytically deactivated Cas9 (dCas9). If the promoter-tethered RNA binds to a protein fused to Gal4 transcriptional activation domain (GAD), then the reporter genes become transcribed, just as in the standard protein-protein yeast two-hybrid assay. We used the CARRY two-hybrid system to analyze MS2 bacteriophage RNA hairpin binding to the MS2 coat protein (MCP). We tested MS2 hairpin mutants with a range of biochemically determined binding affinities for MCP and found that CARRY two-hybrid detected all binding interactions with dissociation constants [&le;]300 nM. In summary, this new CRISPR-based yeast two-hybrid system provides an easily operable, much-needed new tool for identifying proteins that bind to a particular RNA.",

    "abstract": "A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological \\\"atoms\\\". Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility of in-vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on one of two approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be more homogeneous than four previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured sub-areal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data. Multi-resolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal)",

Over the last century, the upward trend in HA-head glycosylation indicates glycan addition can increase fitness, but its role in viral evolution remains unclear. Here, we report glycan evolution follows a clock-like rhythm, pacing the timeline, trajectory, and replacement of HA. Following pandemic introduction, glycans are added to HA at 4- to 6-year intervals, until a functional glycan limit is reached, after which, at 9- to 12-year intervals, glycans are either swapped between different sites, or the HA is replaced by a novel pandemic virus. Using this, we predicted the appearance of the newest glycan on pH1N1 HA. Phylogeographic reconstruction suggests these highly fit strains originated in the Middle East, before rapidly replacing all strains globally. Going forward, we can use this simple algorithm to forecast future glycan evolution and identify seasons with higher pandemic potential.",

Mammalian Chk1 regulates replication origins, safeguards DNA replication forks and promotes fork progression. Conversely, yeast Chk1 acts only in G1 and G2. We report here that the mutation of serine 173 (S173A) in the activation loop of fission yeast Chk1 abolishes the G1-M and S-M checkpoints without affecting the G2-M arrest. Although Chk1-S173A is fully phosphorylated at serine 345 by the DNA damage sensor Rad3 (ATR) when DNA replication forks break, cells fail to stop the cell cycle. Mutant cells are uniquely sensitive to the DNA alkylation agent methyl- methanesulfate (MMS). This MMS sensitivity is genetically linked with the lagging strand DNA polymerase delta. Chk1-S173A is also unable to block mitosis when the G1 transcription factor Cdc10 is impaired. Serine 173 is equivalent to lysine 166 in human Chk1, an amino acid important for substrate specificity. We conclude that the removal of serine 173 impairs the phosphorylation of a Chk1 target that is important to protect cells from DNA replication stress.\\n\\nSummary statementMutation of serine-173 in the activation loop of Chk1 kinase may promote cancer as it abolishes the response to genetic alterations that arise while chromosomes are being copied.",

    "abstract": "Plant nuclear multisubunit RNA polymerase IV plays a key role in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway for transcriptional silencing of transposons, viruses and specific genes by synthesizing precursors of 24 nt siRNAs that guide the process. The Pol IV largest subunit, NRPD1 is derived from the Pol II largest subunit but has a unique carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of unknown function. We show that the NRPD1 CTD is critical for transcriptional silencing of target loci and for producing 24 nt siRNAs at high levels. However, the CTD is surprisingly dispensable for near wild-type levels of Pol IV-dependent genomic cytosine methylation. These results suggest that low levels of 24 nt siRNAs, produced at only 20-30% of wild-type levels, are sufficient for full RNA-directed DNA methylation, yet insufficient for silencing, suggesting additional roles for siRNAs beyond DNA methylation. Moreover, at a subset of target loci, neither siRNA levels nor cytosine methylation are impaired upon deletion of the CTD, yet silencing is lost. Collectively, the non-linear relationships between siRNA levels, cytosine methylation and silencing suggest the existence of additional mechanisms of silencing dependent on Pol IV transcription and mediated by the CTD, such as promoter occlusion to inhibit the activities of other polymerases.",

Hierarchical clustering analysis of co-regulated DEGs showed that dominant parent and F1 hybrid were clustered as the nearest neighbors, while recessive parent showed an apparent departure.

Two relevant types of phase transitions are sol-gel transitions (gelation) and phase separation plus gelation. Gelation refers to the formation of a system spanning molecular network. This can either be enabled by phase separation or it can occur independently. Despite relevance for the formation and selectivity of compositionally distinct protein and RNA assemblies, the determinants of gelation as opposed to phase separation plus gelation remain unclear. Here, we focus on linear multivalent proteins that consist of interaction domains that are connected by disordered linkers. Using results from computer simulations and theoretical analysis we show that the lengths and sequence-specific features of disordered linkers determine the coupling between phase separation and gelation. Thus, the precise nature of phase transitions for linear multivalent proteins should be biologically tunable through genetic encoding of or post-translational modifications to linker sequences.",

Violent victimization was associated with increases in MDD during late adolescence, but MDD was more associated with increased risk for violent victimization across young adulthood. Biometric analysis indicated that 20% and 30% of the association between MDD and single and chronic victimization, respectively, was accounted for by common genetic influences. Results from the current study suggest individuals who exhibit symptoms of MDD are at higher risk for chronic victimization rather than developing MDD as a result of victimization.

    "abstract": "In the clinical electrophisiologic practice, the reading and comparing electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings some times is insufficient and take to much time. That is why in the last years it has begun to introduce new methods of EEG analysis, that give a better and faster understanding of the EEG dynamics and allow a rapid intervention in the patients treatment. Tools coming from the information theory or nonlinear system as an entropy and complexity have been shown to be a very good alternative to address this problem. In this work we introduce a novel method -the permutation Lempel-ziv complexity vs permutation entropy map. This method was applied to EEG of two patients with specific diagnosed pathologies during respective follow up processes of pharmacological changes in order to detect changes that are not evident with the usual inspection method. Our results show that the proposed method are useful for observing an evolutionary retrospective clinical effects of pharmacological interventions in both patients, and from these, to follow the clinical response to the proposed treatment.",

    "abstract": "We used fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy to determine how binding of ATP, nucleation-promoting factors (NPF), actin monomers and actin filaments change the conformation of Arp2/3 complex during the process that nucleates an actin filament branch. We mutated subunits of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Arp2/3 complex for labeling with fluorescent dyes at either the C-termini of Arp2 and Arp3 or ArpC1 and ArpC3. We measured Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency (ETeff) between the dyes in the presence of the various ligands. We also computed class averages from electron micrographs of negatively stained specimens. ATP binding made small conformational changes of the nucleotide binding clefts of the Arp subunits. WASp-VCA, WASp-CA, and WASp-actin-VCA changed the ETeff between the dyes on the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits much more than between dyes on ArpC1 and ArpC3. Ensemble FRET detected a different structural change that involves bringing ArpC1 and ArpC3 closer together when Arp2/3 complex bound actin filaments. Each of the ligands that activates Arp2/3 complex changes the structure in different ways, each leading progressively to fully activated Arp2/3 complex on the side of a filament.",

    "abstract": "The sex chromosomes of the parental species, D. virilis and D. lummei were tested for the effect on trait dominance in the shape of the copulatory system in the interspecific crosses. The origin of the sex chromosome and the paternal genotype were found to affect the trait dominance in D. lummei x D. virilis progeny and backcross males heterozygous for the autosomes. A correlated variability analysis showed that the two sex chromosomes exert unidirectional effects, shifting dominance towards the conspecific phenotype. The effect of the X chromosome is to a great extent determined by epigenetic factors associated with the paternal genotype.",

    "abstract": "Exploring the properties of action potentials is a crucial step towards a better understanding of the computational properties of single neurons and neural networks. The voltage-gated sodium channel is a key player in action potential generation. A comprehensive grasp of the gating mechanism of this channel can shed light on the biophysics of action potential generation. Most models of voltage-gated sodium channels assume it obeys a concerted Hodgkin and Huxley kinetic gating scheme. Here we performed high resolution voltage-clamp experiments from nucleated patches extracted from the soma of layer 5 (L5) cortical pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. We show that the gating mechanism does not follow traditional Hodgkin and Huxley kinetics and that much of the channel voltage-dependence is probably due to rapid closed-closed transitions that lead to substantial onset latency reminiscent of the Cole-Moore effect observed in voltage-gated potassium conductances. This may have key implications for the role of sodium channels in synaptic integration and action potential generation.",

    "abstract": "Intraclass correlation (ICC) is a reliability metric that gauges similarity when, for example, entities are measured under similar, or even the same, well-controlled conditions, which in MRI applications include runs/sessions, twins, parent/child, scanners, sites, etc. The popular definition and interpretation of ICC are usually framed statistically under the conventional ANOVA platform. Here, we show that the ANOVA frame-work is often limited, rigid, and inflexible in modeling capabilities. Additionally we provide a comprehensive overview of ICC analysis in its prior usage in neuroimaging. These intrinsic limitations motivate several novel improvements. Specifically, we start with the conventional ICC model under the ANOVA platform, and extend it along two dimensions: first, fixing the failure in ICC estimation when negative values occur under degen-erative circumstance, and second, incorporating reliability information of effect estimates into the ICC model. These endeavors lead to four modeling strategies: linear mixed-effects (LME), Bayesian mixed-effects (BME), multilevel mixed-effects (MME), and Bayesian multilevel mixed-effects (BMME). Compared to ANOVA, each of these four models directly provides estimates for fixed effects as well as their statistical significances, in addition to the ICC estimate. These new modeling approaches can also accommodate missing data as well as fixed effects for confounding variables. More importantly, we show that the novel MME and BMME approaches offer more accurate characterization and decomposition among the variance components, leading to more robust ICC computation. Based on these theoretical considerations and model performance comparisons with a real experimental dataset, we offer the following general-purpose recommendations. First, ICC estimation through MME or BMME is preferable when precision information is available for the effect estimate; precision information provides weights that more accurately allocate the variances in the data. When precision information is unavailable, ICC estimation through LME or the novel BME is the preferred option. Second, even though the absolute agreement version, ICC(2,1), is presently more popular in the field, the consistency version, ICC(3,1), is a practical and informative choice for whole-brain ICC analysis that achieves a well-balanced compromise when all potential fixed effects are accounted for. Third, approaches for clear, meaningful, and useful result reporting in ICC analysis are discussed. All models, ICC formulations, and related statistical testing methods have been implemented in an open source program 3dICC, which is publicly available as part of the AFNI suite. Even though our work here focuses on the whole brain level, the modeling strategy and recommendations can be equivalently applied to other situations such as voxel, region, and network levels.",
