    "abstract": "Nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia via nitrite to nitrate, has always been considered to be catalyzed by the concerted activity of ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms. Only recently, complete ammonia oxidizers ( comammox), which oxidize ammonia to nitrate on their own, were identified in the bacterial genus Nitrospira, previously assumed to contain only canonical nitrite oxidizers. Nitrospira are widespread in nature, but for assessments of the distribution and functional importance of comammox Nitrospira in ecosystems, cultivation-independent tools to distinguish comammox from strictly nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira are required. Here we developed new PCR primer sets that specifically target the amoA genes coding for subunit A of the distinct ammonia monooxygenase of comammox Nitrospira. While existing primers capture only a fraction of the known comammox amoA diversity, the new primer sets cover as much as 95% of the comammox amoA clade A and 92% of the clade B sequences in a reference database containing 326 comammox amoA genes with sequence information at the primer binding sites. Application of the primers to 13 samples from engineered systems (a groundwater well, drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment plants) and other habitats (rice paddy and forest soils, rice rhizosphere, brackish lake sediment and freshwater biofilm) detected comammox Nitrospira in all samples and revealed a considerable diversity of comammox in most habitats. Excellent primer specificity for comammox amoA was achieved by avoiding the use of highly degenerate primer preparations and by using equimolar mixtures of oligonucleotides that match existing comammox amoA genes. Quantitative PCR with these equimolar primer mixtures was highly sensitive and specific, and enabled the efficient quantification of clade A and clade B comammox amoA gene copy numbers in environmental samples. The measured relative abundances of comammox Nitrospira, compared to canonical ammonia oxidizers, were highly variable across environments. The new comammox amoA-targeted primers will enable more encompassing studies of nitrifying microorganisms in diverse ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdult leg length is influenced by nutrition in the first few years of life. Adult head circumference is an indicator of brain growth. Cross-sectional studies indicate inverse associations with dementia risk, but there have been few prospective studies.\\n\\nMethodsPopulation-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic Puerto Rico and Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico and China. Sociodemographic and risk factor questionnaires were administered to all participants, and anthropometric measures taken, with ascertainment of incident 10/66 dementia, and mortality, three to five years later.\\n\\nResultsOf the original at risk cohort of 13,587 persons aged 65 years and over, 2,443 (18.0%) were lost to follow-up; 10,540 persons with skull circumference assessments were followed up for 40,466 person years, and 10,400 with leg length assessments were followed up for 39,954 person years. There were 1,009 cases of incident dementia, and 1,605 dementia free deaths. The fixed effect pooled meta-analysed adjusted subhazard ratio (ASHR) for leg length (highest vs. lowest quarter) was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66-0.97) and for skull circumference was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.84-1.25), with no heterogeneity of effect between sites (I2=0%). Leg length measurements tended to be shorter at follow-up, particularly for those with baseline cognitive impairment and dementia. However, leg length change was not associated with dementia incidence (ASHR, per cm 1.006, 95% CI 0.992-1.020), and the effect of leg length was little altered after adjusting for baseline frailty (ASHT 0.82, 95% CI 0.67-0.99). A priori hypotheses regarding effect modification by gender or educational level were not supported.\\n\\nConclusionsConsistent findings across settings provide quite strong support for an association between adult leg length and dementia incidence in late-life. Leg length is a relatively stable marker of early life nutritional programming, which may confer brain reserve and protect against neurodegeneration in later life through mitigation of cardiometabolic risk. Further clarification of these associations could inform predictive models for future dementia incidence in the context of secular trends in adult height, and invigorate global efforts to improve childhood nutrition, growth and development.",

    "abstract": "There is heightened interest to devise therapies that target the oncometabolome. We show that kinase inhibitors (KIs) and biguanides synergistically target melanoma, leukemia, and breast, colon and renal cancer cells, but not non-transformed cells. Metabolic profiling confirmed opposing effects of KIs and biguanides on glycolysis, but this was insufficient to explain the observed synergy between the drugs. Rather, we define a critical role for the synthesis of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) aspartate, asparagine and serine as well as reductive glutamine metabolism, in determining the sensitivity of cancer cells to KI - biguanide combinations. The mTORC1/4E-BP axis regulates aspartate, asparagine and serine synthesis by modulating translation of mRNAs encoding PC, ASNS, PHGDH and PSAT1. Ablation of 4E-BP1 and 2 results in a dramatic increase in serine, aspartate and asparagine levels and a substantial decrease in sensitivity of breast cancer and melanoma cells to KI - biguanide combinations. In turn, efficacy of KI - biguanide combinations is impeded by HIF1 and sustained reductive glutamine metabolism. These findings identify hitherto unappreciated translational reprograming of NEAA synthesis and HIF1-dependent stimulation of reductive glutamine metabolism as critical metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer that underpin synergy between KIs and biguanides.",

    "abstract": "Asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation is the most common protein modification in eukaryotes, affecting over two-thirds of the proteome. Glycosylation is also critical to the pharmacokinetic activity and immunogenicity of many therapeutic proteins currently produced in complex eukaryotic hosts. The discovery of a protein glycosylation pathway in the pathogen Campylobacter jejuni and its subsequent transfer into laboratory strains of Escherichia coli has spurred great interest in glycoprotein production in prokaryotes. However, prokaryotic glycoprotein production has several drawbacks, including insufficient availability of non-native glycan precursors. To address this limitation, we used a constraint-based model of E. coli metabolism in combination with heuristic optimization to design gene knockout strains that overproduced glycan precursors. First, we incorporated reactions associated with C. jejuni glycan assembly into a genome-scale model of E. coli metabolism. We then identified gene knockout strains that coupled optimal growth to glycan synthesis. Simulations suggested that these growth-coupled glycan overproducing strains had metabolic imbalances that rerouted flux toward glycan precursor synthesis. We then validated the model-identified knockout strains experimentally by measuring glycan expression using a flow cytometric-based assay involving fluorescent labeling of cell surface-displayed glycans. Overall, this study demonstrates the promising role that metabolic modeling can play in optimizing the performance of a next-generation microbial glycosylation platform.",

The recent adoption of next-generation sequencing technologies enables accurate profiling of not only gene expression but also alternatively-spliced transcripts in large-scale pharmacogenomic studies. Given that altered mRNA splicing has been shown to be prominent in cancers, linking this feature to drug response will open new avenues of research in biomarker discovery.\\n\\nMethodsTo address the lack of reproducibility of drug sensitivity measurements across studies, we developed a meta-analytical framework combining the pharmacological data generated within the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC). Predictive models are fitted with CCLE RNA-seq data as predictor variables, controlled for tissue type, and combined GDSC and CCLE drug sensitivity values as dependent variables.\\n\\nResultsWe first validated the biomarkers identified from GDSC and CCLE using an existing pharmacogenomic dataset of 70 breast cancer cell lines. We further selected four drugs with the most promising biomarkers to test whether their predictive value is robust to change in pharmacological assay. We successfully validated 10 isoform-based biomarkers predictive of drug response in breast cancer, including TGFA-001 for the MEK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AZD6244, DUOX-001 for the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, and CPEB4-001 transcript expression associated with lack of sensitivity to paclitaxel.\\n\\nConclusionThe results of our meta-analysis of pharmacogenomic data suggest that isoforms represent a rich resource for biomarkers predictive of response to chemo- and targeted therapies. Our study also showed that the validation rate for this type of biomarkers is low (<50%) for most drugs, supporting the requirements for independent datasets to identify reproducible predictors of response to anticancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic evolution and speciation depend on recombination in many ways. Within populations, recombination can promote adaptation by bringing together favorable mutations and decoupling beneficial and deleterious alleles. As populations diverge, cross-over can give rise to maladapted recombinants and impede or reverse diversification. Suppressed recombination due to genomic rearrangements, modifier alleles, and intrinsic chromosomal properties may offer a shield against maladaptive gene flow eroding co-adapted gene complexes. Both theoretical and empirical results support this relationship. However, little is known about this relationship in the context of behavioral isolation, where co-evolving signals and preferences are the major hybridization barrier. Here we examine the genomic architecture of recently diverged, sexually isolated Hawaiian swordtail crickets (Laupala). We assemble a de novo genome and generate three dense linkage maps from interspecies crosses. In line with expectations based on the species recent divergence and successful interbreeding in the lab, the linkage maps are highly collinear and show no evidence for large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. The maps were then used to anchor the assembly to pseudomolecules and estimate recombination rates across the genome. We tested the hypothesis that loci involved in behavioral isolation (song and preference divergence) are in regions of low interspecific recombination. Contrary to our expectations, a genomic region where a male song QTL co-localizes with a female preference QTL was not associated with particularly low recombination rates. This study provides important novel genomic resources for an emerging evolutionary genetics model system and suggests that trait-preference co-evolution is not necessarily facilitated by locally suppressed recombination.",

    "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) of 3 untranslated regions (3 UTRs) has been implicated in cancer development. Earlier reports on APA in cancer primarily focused on 3 UTR length modifications, and the conventional wisdom is that tumor cells preferentially express transcripts with shorter 3 UTRs. Here, we analyzed the APA patterns of 114 genes, a select list of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, in 9,939 tumor and 729 normal tissue samples across 33 cancer types using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and we found that the APA regulation machinery is much more complicated than what was previously thought. We report 77 cases (gene-cancer type pairs) of differential 3 UTR cleavage patterns between normal and tumor tissues, involving 33 genes in 13 cancer types. For 15 genes, the tumor-specific cleavage patterns are recurrent across multiple cancer types. While the cleavage patterns in certain genes indicate apparent trends of 3 UTR shortening in tumor samples, over half of the 77 cases imply 3 UTR length change trends in cancer that are more complex than simple shortening or lengthening. This work extends the current understanding of APA regulation in cancer, and demonstrates how large volumes of RNA-seq data generated for characterizing cancer cohorts can be mined to investigate this process.",

    "abstract": "One approach to the reconstruction of infectious disease transmission trees from pathogen genomic data has been to use a phylogenetic tree, reconstructed from pathogen sequences, and annotate its internal nodes to provide a reconstruction of which host each lineage was in at each point in time. If only one pathogen lineage can be transmitted to a new host (i.e. the transmission bottleneck is complete), this corresponds to partitioning the nodes of the phylogeny into connected regions, each of which represents evolution in an individual host. These partitions define the possible transmission trees that are consistent with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the mathematical properties of the transmission trees given a phylogeny remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe a procedure to calculate the number of possible transmission trees for a given phylogeny, and we show how to uniformly sample from these transmission trees. The procedure is outlined for situations where one sample is available from each host and trees do not have branch lengths, and we also provide extensions for incomplete sampling, multiple sampling, and the application to time trees in a situation where limits on the period during which each host could have been infected are known. The sampling algorithm is available as an R package (STraTUS).",

During meiosis centromeres are suppressed for crossovers, as recombination in these regions can cause chromosome mis-segregation. Plant centromeres are surrounded by repetitive, transposon-dense heterochromatin that is epigenetically silenced by histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), and DNA methylation in CG and non-CG sequence contexts. Here we show that disruption of Arabidopsis H3K9me2 and non-CG DNA methylation pathways increases meiotic DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) within centromeres, whereas crossovers increase within pericentromeric heterochromatin. Increased pericentromeric crossovers in H3K9me2/non-CG mutants occurs in both inbred and hybrid backgrounds, and involves the interfering crossover repair pathway. Epigenetic activation of recombination may also account for the curious tendency of maize transposon Ds to disrupt CHROMOMETHYLASE3 when launched from proximal loci. Thus H3K9me2 and non-CG DNA methylation exert differential control of meiotic DSB and crossover formation in centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin.",

Standard analyses test individual genetic variants, one at a time, for association with a trait.

Here we introduce a new model-based enrichment analysis method that requires only GWAS summary statistics, and has several advantages over existing methods. Applying this method to interrogate 3,913 biological pathways and 113 tissue-based gene sets in 31 human phenotypes identifies many previously-unreported enrichments. These include enrichments of the endochondral ossification pathway for adult height, the NFAT-dependent transcription pathway for rheumatoid arthritis, brain-related genes for coronary artery disease, and liver-related genes for late-onset Alzheimers disease. A key feature of our method is that inferred enrichments automatically help identify new trait-associated genes. For example, accounting for enrichment in lipid transport genes yields strong evidence for association between MTTP and low-density lipoprotein levels, whereas conventional analyses of the same data found no significant variants near this gene.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination initiates via DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) generated by SPO11 topoisomerase-like complexes. Recombination frequency varies extensively along eukaryotic chromosomes, with hotspots controlled by chromatin and DNA sequence. To map meiotic DSBs throughout a plant genome, we purified and sequenced Arabidopsis SPO11-1-oligonucleotides. DSB hotspots occurred in gene promoters, terminators and introns, driven by AT-sequence richness, which excludes nucleosomes and allows SPO11-1 access. A strong positive relationship was observed between SPO11-1 DSBs and final crossover levels. Euchromatic marks promote recombination in fungi and mammals, and consistently we observe H3K4me3 enrichment in proximity to DSB hotspots at gene 5-ends. Repetitive transposons are thought to be recombination-silenced during meiosis, in order to prevent non-allelic interactions and genome instability. Unexpectedly, we found strong DSB hotspots in nucleosome-depleted Helitron/Pogo/Tc1/Mariner DNA transposons, whereas retrotransposons were coldspots. Hotspot transposons are enriched within gene regulatory regions and in proximity to immunity genes, suggesting a role as recombination-enhancers. As transposon mobility in plant genomes is restricted by DNA methylation, we used the met1 DNA methyltransferase mutant to investigate the role of heterochromatin on the DSB landscape. Epigenetic activation of transposon meiotic DSBs occurred in met1 mutants, coincident with reduced nucleosome occupancy, gain of transcription and H3K4me3. Increased met1 SPO11-1 DSBs occurred most strongly within centromeres and Gypsy and CACTA/EnSpm coldspot transposons. Together, our work reveals complex interactions between chromatin and meiotic DSBs within genes and transposons, with significance for the diversity and evolution of plant genomes.",

    "abstract": "Number sense, a spontaneous ability to process approximate numbers, has been documented in human adults, infants and newborns, and many other animals. Species as distant as monkeys and crows exhibit number-selective neuronal activity. How number sense can emerge in the absence of learning or fine tuning is currently unknown. We introduce a random matrix theory of self-organised neural states where numbers are coded by vectors of activation across multiple units, and where the vector codes for successive integers are obtained through multiplication by a fixed but random matrix. This cortical implementation of the \\\"von Mises\\\" algorithm explains many otherwise disconnected observations ranging from neural tuning curves in monkeys to looking times in neonates and cortical numerotopy in adults. The theory clarifies the origin of Weber-Fechners law and yields a novel and empirically validated prediction of multi-peak number neurons. Random matrices constitute a novel mechanism for the emergence of brain states coding for quantity.",

    "abstract": "We recently presented a statistical comparison between two models of latent dynamics in macaque lateral intraparietal (LIP) area spike trains--a continuous  ramping (diffusion-to-bound) model, and a discrete  stepping model--and found that a substantial fraction of neurons (recorded in two different studies) were better supported by the stepping model (Latimer et al., 2015). Here, we respond to a recent challenge to the validity of these findings that focuses primarily on the possibility of a lower bound on LIP firing rates (Zylberberg & Shadlen, 2016). The paper in question proposed alternate formulations of the ramping model, and argued (via indirect analyses) that half the neurons in the population were better explained by the new model; if correct, this would lead to an even split in the number of neurons better explained by each model. These analyses, while interesting, do not alter the conclusions of our original paper. Here, we review the criticisms raised by Zylberberg & Shadlen and report several new analyses using models with lower bounds. First, we show that the stepping model continued to provide a better description of LIP spike trains when fit using only an early period of each trial. Second, we performed a direct model comparison between our stepping model and a ramping-with-baseline model proposed by Zylberberg & Shadlen; we found that (in a pleasing moment of agreement) roughly half the neurons were better explained by each model. Interestingly, inspection of the cells that switched classifications revealed that many did not strictly exhibit the classical ramping PSTHs that motivated these analyses in the first place. We also examined two other issues raised in recent discussions of LIP: (1) We show that a non-integrating model is consistent with some core aspects of behavioral data previously offered as evidence for continuous integration; and (2) We examine analyses based on the response covariance (\\\"CorCE\\\"), and show that it does not reliably distinguish ramping and stepping dynamics for our dataset. Taken together, these discussions highlight the value of data-driven characterizations of both neural and behavioral dynamics with appropriate statistical tools.",

    "abstract": "Smell dysfunction is a common and underdiagnosed medical condition that can have serious consequences. It is also an early biomarker of Alzheimers disease that precedes detectable memory loss. Clinical tests that evaluate the sense of smell face two major challenges. First, human sensitivity to individual odorants varies significantly, leading to potential misdiagnosis of people with an otherwise normal sense of smell but insensitivity to the test odorant. Second, prior familiarity with odor stimuli can bias smell test performance. We have developed new non- semantic tests for olfactory sensitivity (SMELL-S) and olfactory resolution (SMELL-R) that overcome these challenges by using mixtures of odorants that have unfamiliar smells. The tests can be self-administered with minimal training and showed high test-retest reliability. Because SMELL-S uses odor mixtures rather than a single molecule, odor-specific insensitivity is averaged out. Indeed, SMELL-S accurately distinguished people with normal and dysfunctional smell. SMELL-R is a discrimination test in which the difference between two stimulus mixtures can be altered stepwise. This is an advance over current discrimination tests, which ask subjects to discriminate monomolecular odorants whose difference cannot be objectively calculated. SMELL-R showed significantly less bias in scores between North American and Taiwanese subjects than conventional semantically-based smell tests that need to be adapted and translated to different populations. We predict that SMELL-S and SMELL-R will be broadly effective in diagnosing smell dysfunction, including that associated with the earliest signs of memory loss in Alzheimers disease.\\n\\nSignificance statementCurrently available smell testing methods can misdiagnose subjects with lack of prior experience or insensitivity to the odorants used in the test. This introduces a source of bias into clinical tests aimed at detecting patients with olfactory dysfunction. We have developed smell tests that use mixtures of 30 molecules that average out the variability in sensitivity to individual molecules. Because these mixtures have unfamiliar odors, and the tests are non-semantic, their use eliminates differences in test performance due to the familiarity with the smells or the words used to describe them. The SMELL-S and SMELL-R tests facilitate smell testing of diverse populations, without the need to adapt the test stimuli.",

    "abstract": "During cytokinesis, an equatorial actomyosin contractile ring constricts at a relatively constant overall rate despite its progressively decreasing size. Thus, the per-unit-length rate of ring closure increases as ring perimeter decreases. To understand this acceleration, we monitored cortical surface and ring component dynamics during the first division of the C. elegans embryo. We show that the polar cortex expands during ring constriction to provide the cortical surface area required for division. Polar expansion also allows ring myosin to compress cortical surface along the pole-to-pole axis, leading to a continuous flow of cortical surface into the ring. We propose that feedback between ring myosin and compression-driven cortical flow drives an exponential increase in the amount of ring myosin that maintains the high overall closure rate as ring perimeter decreases. We further show that an analytical mathematical formulation of the proposed feedback, called the Compression Feedback model, recapitulates the experimental observations.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTDuring cytokinesis, positive feedback between myosin motors in the contractile ring and compression-driven cortical flow along the axis perpendicular to the ring drives constriction rate acceleration to ensure timely cell separation.\\n\\nMAJOR SUBJECT AREASCell biology, Computational and Systems Biology",

    "abstract": "Side-streams in wastewater treatment plants can serve as concentrated sources of nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) to support the growth of photosynthetic organisms that ultimately serve as feedstock for production of fuels and chemicals. However, other chemical characteristics of these streams may inhibit growth in unanticipated ways. Here, we evaluated the use of liquid recovered from municipal anaerobic digesters via gravity belt filtration as a nutrient source for growing the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002. The gravity belt filtrate (GBF) contained high levels of complex dissolved organic matter (DOM), which seemed to negatively influence cells. We investigated the impact of GBF on physiological parameters such as growth rate, membrane integrity, membrane composition, photosystem composition, and oxygen evolution from photosystem II. At 37{degrees}C, we observed an inverse correlation between GBF concentration and membrane integrity. Radical production was also detected upon exposure to GBF at 37{degrees}C. However, at 27{degrees}C the dose dependent relationship between GBF concentration and lack of membrane integrity was abolished. Immediate resuspension of strains in high doses of GBF showed markedly reduced oxygen evolution rates relative to the control. Together, this suggests that one mechanism responsible for GBF toxicity to Synechococcus is the interruption of photosynthetic electron flow and subsequent phenomena. We hypothesize this is likely due to the presence of phenolic compounds within the DOM.\\n\\nIMPORTANCECyanobacteria are viewed as promising platforms to produce fuels and/or high-value chemicals as part of so-called \\\"bio-refineries\\\". Their integration into wastewater treatment systems is particularly interesting because removal of the nitrogen and phosphorus in many wastewater streams is an expensive but necessary part of wastewater treatment. In this study, we evaluated strategies for cultivating Synechococcus strain PCC 7002 on media comprised of two wastewater streams; treated secondary effluent supplemented with the liquid fraction extracted from sludge following anaerobic digestion. This strain is commonly used for metabolic engineering to produce a variety of valuable chemical products and product precursors (e.g. lactate). However, initial attempts to grow PCC 7002 under otherwise standard conditions of light and temperature failed. We thus systematically evaluated alternative cultivation conditions and then used multiple methods to dissect the apparent toxicity of the media under standard cultivation conditions.",
