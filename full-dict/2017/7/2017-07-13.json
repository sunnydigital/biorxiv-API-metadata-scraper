    "abstract": "Multiple and unpredictable numbers of actions are often required to achieve a goal. In order to organize behavior and allocate effort so that optimal behavioral policies can be selected, it is necessary to continually monitor ongoing actions. Real-time processing of information related to actions and outcomes is typically assigned to the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia, but also depends on midbrain regions, especially the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We were interested in how individual VTA neurons, as well as networks within the VTA, encode salient events when an unpredictable number of serial actions are required to obtain a reward. We recorded from ensembles of putative dopamine and non-dopamine neurons in the VTA as animals performed multiple cued trials in a recording session where, in each trial, serial actions were randomly rewarded. While averaging population activity did not reveal a response pattern, we observed that different neurons selectively tuned to low, medium, or high numbered actions in a trial. This preferential tuning of putative dopamine and non-dopamine VTA neurons to different subsets of actions in a trial allowed information about binned action number to be decoded from the ensemble activity. At the network level, tuning curve similarity was positively associated with action-evoked noise correlations, suggesting that action number selectivity reflects functional connectivity within these networks. Analysis of phasic responses to cue and reward revealed that the requirement to execute multiple and uncertain numbers of actions weakens both cue-evoked responses and cue-reward response correlation. The functional connectivity and ensemble coding scheme that we observe here may allow VTA neurons to cooperatively provide a real-time account of ongoing behavior. These computations may be critical to cognitive and motivational functions that have long been associated with VTA dopamine neurons.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) can be developed by computational approaches that infer regulator-target gene interactions from transcriptional assays. Successful algorithms that generate predictive, accurate TRNs enable the identification of regulator-target relationships in conditions where experimentally determining regulatory interactions is a challenge. Improving the ability of TRNs to successfully predict known regulator-target relationships in model species will enhance confidence in applying these approaches to determine regulator-target interactions in non-model species where experimental validation is challenging. Many transcriptional profiling experiments are performed across multiple time points; therefore we sought to improve regulator-target predictions by adjusting how time is incorporated into the network. We created ExRANGES, which incorporates Expression in a Rate-Normalized GEne Specific manner that adjusts how expression data is provided to the network algorithm. We tested this on a two different network construction approaches and found that ExRANGES prioritizes targets differently than traditional expression and improves the ability of these networks to accurately predict known regulator targets. ExRANGES improved the ability to correctly identify targets of transcription factors in large data sets in four different model systems: mouse, human, Arabidopsis, and yeast. Finally, we examined the performance of ExRANGES on a small data set from field-grown Oryza sativa and found that it also improved the ability to identify known targets even with a limited data set.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTo understand how organisms can turn a collection of genes into a physiological response, we need to understand how certain genes are turned on and off. In model organisms, the ability to identify direct targets of transcription factors via ChIP-Seq in a high-throughput manner has advanced our understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks and how organisms regulate gene expression. However, for non-model organisms, it remains a challenge to identify TF-target relationships through experimental approaches such as ChIP-Seq. Without this information, the ability to understand regulatory control is limited. Computational approaches to identify regulator-target relationships in silico from easily attainable transcriptional data offer a solution. Several approaches exist for identifying gene regulatory networks, including many that take advantage of time series data. Most of these approaches weigh the relationship between regulators and putative targets at all time points equally. However, many regulators may control a single target in response to different inputs. In our approach, we focus on the association between regulators and targets primarily at times when there is a significant change in expression. ExRANGES essentially weights the expression value of each time point by the slope change after that time point so that relationships between regulators and targets are emphasized at the time points when the transcript levels are changing. This change in input into network identification algorithms improves the ability to predict regulator-target interactions and could be applied to many different algorithms We hope this improvement will increase the ability to identify regulators of interest in non-model species.",

    "abstract": "The neural processing of a visual stimulus can be facilitated by attending to its position or by a co-occurring auditory tone. Using frequency-tagging we investigated whether facilitation by spatial attention and audio-visual synchrony rely on similar neural processes. Participants attended to one of two flickering Gabor patches (14.17 and 17 Hz) located in opposite lower visual fields. Gabor patches further \\\"pulsed\\\" (i.e. showed smooth spatial frequency variations) at distinct rates (3.14 and 3.63 Hz). Frequency-modulating an auditory stimulus at the pulse-rate of one of the visual stimuli established audio-visual synchrony. Flicker and pulsed stimulation elicited stimulus-locked rhythmic electrophysiological brain responses that allowed tracking the neural processing of simultaneously presented stimuli. These steady-state responses (SSRs) were quantified in the spectral domain to examine visual stimulus processing under conditions of synchronous vs. asynchronous tone presentation and when respective stimulus positions were attended vs. unattended. Strikingly, unique patterns of effects on pulse- and flicker driven SSRs indicated that spatial attention and audiovisual synchrony facilitated early visual processing in parallel and via different cortical processes. We found attention effects to resemble the classical top-down gain effect facilitating both, flicker and pulse-driven SSRs. Audio-visual synchrony, in turn, only amplified synchrony-producing stimulus aspects (i.e. pulse-driven SSRs) possibly highlighting the role of temporally co-occurring sights and sounds in bottom-up multisensory integration.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian clock is a critical regulator of metabolism and cell division. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that systemic disruption of the circadian clock can promote cancer, whether the clock is disrupted in primary human tumors is unknown. Here we used transcriptome data from mice to define a signature of the mammalian circadian clock based on the co-expression of 12 genes that form the core clock or are directly controlled by the clock. Our approach can be applied to samples that are not labeled with time of day and were not acquired over the entire circadian (24-h) cycle. We validated the clock signature in transcriptome data from healthy human tissues, then developed a metric we call the delta clock correlation distance ({Delta}CCD) to describe the extent to which the signature is perturbed in samples from one condition relative to another. We calculated the {Delta}CCD comparing human tumor and non-tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and eight independent datasets, discovering widespread dysregulation of clock gene co-expression in tumor samples. Subsequent analysis of data from clock gene knockouts in mice suggested that clock dysregulation in human cancer is not caused solely by loss of activity of clock genes. Furthermore, by analyzing a large set of genes previously inferred to be rhythmic in healthy human lung, we found that dysregulation of the clock in human lung cancer is accompanied by dysregulation of broader patterns of circadian co-expression. Our findings suggest that clock dysregulation is a common means by which human cancers achieve unrestrained growth and division, and that restoring clock function could be a viable therapeutic strategy in multiple cancer types. In addition, our approach opens the door to using publicly available transcriptome data to quantify clock disruption in a multitude of human phenotypes.

Here we present a targeted-exon next-generation sequencing approach for investigating the evolutionary relationships of cichlid fishes (Cichlidae), with focus on the Neotropical subfamily Cichlinae using a set of 923 primarily single-copy exons designed through mining of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) genome. Sequence capture and assembly were robust, leading to a complete dataset of 415 exons for 139 species (147 terminals) that consisted of 128 Neotropical species, six African taxa, and five Indo-Malagasy cichlids. Gene and species trees were calculated using alternative partitioning schemes and reconstruction methods. In general, all methods yielded similar topologies to previously hypothesized relationships within the Cichlinae and clarified several relationships that were previously poorly supported or in conflict. Additional work will be needed to fully resolve all aspects of Cichlinae phylogeny. Overall, this approach yielded a well-resolved phylogeny of Neotropical cichlids that will be of utility for future assessments of the evolutionary and ecological processes within this diverse group of fishes.

    "abstract": "While the vast majority of genome size variation in plants is due to differences in repetitive sequence, we know little about how selection acts on repeat content in natural populations. Here we investigate parallel changes in intraspecific genome size and repeat content of domesticated maize (Zea mays) landraces and their wild relative teosinte across altitudinal gradients in Mesoamerica and South America. We combine genotyping, low coverage whole-genome sequence data, and flow cytometry to test for evidence of selection on genome size and individual repeat abundance. We find that population structure alone cannot explain the observed variation, implying that clinal patterns of genome size are maintained by natural selection. Our modeling additionally provides evidence of selection on individual heterochromatic knob repeats, likely due to their large individual contribution to genome size. To better understand the phenotypes driving selection on genome size, we conducted a growth chamber experiment using a population of highland teosinte exhibiting extensive variation in genome size. We find weak support for a positive correlation between genome size and cell size, but stronger support for a negative correlation between genome size and the rate of cell production. Reanalyzing published data of cell counts in maize shoot apical meristems, we then identify a negative correlation between cell production rate and flowering time. Together, our data suggest a model in which variation in genome size is driven by natural selection on flowering time across altitudinal clines, connecting intraspecific variation in repetitive sequence to important differences in adaptive phenotypes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenome size in plants can vary by orders of magnitude, but this variation has long been considered to be of little to no functional consequence. Studying three independent adaptations to high altitude in Zea mays, we find that genome size experiences parallel pressures from natural selection, causing a linear reduction in genome size with increasing altitude. Though reductions in repetitive content are responsible for the genome size change, we find that only those individual loci contributing most to the variation in genome size are individually targeted by selection. To identify the phenotype influenced by genome size, we study how variation in genome size within a single teosinte population impacts leaf growth and cell division. We find that genome size variation correlates negatively with the rate of cell division, suggesting that individuals with larger genomes require longer to complete a mitotic cycle. Finally, we reanalyze data from maize inbreds to show that faster cell division is correlated with earlier flowering, connecting observed variation in genome size to an important adaptive phenotype.",

The competitive ability of various Trichoderma isolates was assessed by their germination rates, growth rates, and chlamydospore production; and the antagonism of P. noxius by Trichoderma was assessed by the interaction of these fungi in dual culture and on wood blocks. In this study, the Trichoderma isolates showed greater competitiveness and antagonism towards P. noxius compared to similar reports in the literature.

All Trichoderma isolates routinely antagonized P. noxius in the different bioassays, but there was significant variability in the antagonistic capacity of various isolates and in the susceptibility of the P. noxius isolates to confrontation with Trichoderma. Relative to the controls, P. noxius cultures grew significantly slower in the presence of volatile organic compounds emitted by most Trichoderma isolates, and a large majority of Trichoderma isolates caused a significant reduction to the dry weight loss of wood blocks inoculated with P. noxius.

    "abstract": "Mice use vision to navigate and avoid predators in natural environments. However, the spatial resolution of mouse vision is poor compared to primates, and mice lack a fovea. Thus, it is unclear how well mice can discriminate ethologically relevant scenes. Here, we examined natural scene discrimination in mice using an automated touch-screen system. We estimated the discrimination difficulty using the computational metric structural similarity (SSIM), and constructed psychometric curves. However, the performance of each mouse was better predicted by the population mean than SSIM. This high inter-mouse agreement indicates that mice use common and robust strategies to discriminate natural scenes. We tested several other image metrics to find an alternative to SSIM for predicting discrimination performance. We found that a simple, primary visual cortex (V1)-inspired model predicted mouse performance with fidelity approaching the inter-mouse agreement. The model involved convolving the images with Gabor filters, and its performance varied with the orientation of the Gabor filter. This orientation dependence was driven by the stimuli, rather than an innate biological feature. Together, these results indicate that mice are adept at discriminating natural scenes, and their performance is well predicted by simple models of V1 processing.",

    "abstract": "The ultimatum game (UG) is widely used in economic and anthropological research to investigate fairness by how one player proposes to divide a resource with a second player who can reject the offer. In these contexts, fairness is understood as offers that are more generous than predicted by the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE). A surprising and robust result of UG experiments is that proposers offer much more than the SPNE. These results have spawned many models aimed at explaining why players do not conform to the SPNE by showing how Nash equilibrium strategies can evolve far from the SPNE. However, empirical data from UG experiments indicate that players do not use Nash equilibrium strategies, but rather make generous offers while rejecting only very low offers. To better understand why people behave this way, we developed an agent-based model to investigate how generous strategies could evolve in the UG. Using agents with generic biological properties, we found that fair offers can readily evolve in structured populations even while rejection thresholds remain relatively low. We explain the evolution of fairness as a problem of the efficient conversion of resources into the production of offspring at the level of the group.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHuman generosity is widespread and far exceeds that of other social animals. Generosity is often studied experimentally with the ultimatum game, in which a proposer offers a split and a responder can either accept it or cancel the whole deal. A surprising result of ultimatum game experiments is that players are much more generous than predicted while only rejecting very low offers. This has presented a theoretical puzzle, since mathematical models have generally relied on high rejection levels--just below offer levels--to maintain generosity. Using evolutionary simulations, we explain both generous offers and the rejection of only low offers as a solution to the problem of how groups can efficiently convert resources into the production of offspring.",

    "abstract": "The cow rumen is a specialised organ adapted for the efficient breakdown of plant material into energy and nutrients, and it is the rumen microbiome that encodes the enzymes responsible. Many of these enzymes are of huge industrial interest. Despite this, rumen microbes are under-represented in the public databases. Here we present 220 high quality bacterial and archaeal genomes assembled directly from 768 gigabases of rumen metagenomic sequence data. Comparative analysis with current publicly available genomes reveals that the majority of these represent previously unsequenced strains and species of bacteria and archaea. The genomes contain over 13,000 proteins predicted to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism, over 90% of which do not have a good match in the public databases. Inclusion of the 220 genomes presented here improves metagenomic read classification by 2-3-fold, both in our data and in other publicly available rumen datasets. This release improves the coverage of rumen microbes in the public databases, and represents a hugely valuable resource for biomass-degrading enzyme discovery and studies of the rumen microbiome",

    "abstract": "In C4 plants, the enzymatic machinery underpinning photosynthesis can vary, with, for example, three distinct C4 acid decarboxylases being used to release CO2 in the vicinity of RuBisCO. For decades, these decarboxylases have been used to classify C4 species into three biochemical sub-types. However, more recently the notion that C4 species mix and match C4 acid decarboxylases has increased in popularity and, as a consequence, the validity of specific biochemical sub-types has been questioned. Using five species from the grass tribe Paniceae, we show that, while in some species transcripts encoding multiple C4 acid decarboxylases accumulate, in others, transcript abundance and enzyme activity is almost entirely from one decarboxylase. In addition, the development of a bundle sheath isolation procedure for a close C3 species in the Paniceae enables the preliminary exploration of C4 sub-type evolution.",

    "abstract": "The day we understand the time evolution of subcellular elements at a level of detail comparable to physical systems governed by Newtons laws of motion seems far away. Even so, quantitative approaches to cellular dynamics add to our understanding of cell biology, providing data-guided frameworks that allow us to develop better predictions about, and methods for, control over specific biological processes and system-wide cell behavior. In this paper, we describe an approach to optimizing the use of transcription factors (TFs) in the context of cellular reprogramming. We construct an approximate model for the natural evolution of a cell cycle synchronized population of human fibroblasts, based on data obtained by sampling the expression of 22,083 genes at several time points along the cell cycle. In order to arrive at a model of moderate complexity, we cluster gene expression based on the division of the genome into topologically associating domains (TADs) and then model the dynamics of the TAD expression levels. Based on this dynamical model and known bioinformatics, such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and functions, we develop a methodology for identifying the top transcription factor candidates for a specific cellular reprogramming task. The approach used is based on a device commonly used in optimal control. Our data-guided methodology identifies a number of transcription factors previously validated for reprogramming and/or natural differentiation. Our findings highlight the immense potential of dynamical models, mathematics, and data-guided methodologies for improving strategies for control over biological processes.\\n\\nSignificance StatementReprogramming the human genome toward any desirable state is within reach; application of select transcription factors drives cell types toward different lineages in many settings. We introduce the concept of data-guided control in building a universal algorithm for directly reprogramming any human cell type into any other type. Our algorithm is based on time series genome transcription and architecture data and known regulatory activities of transcription factors, with natural dimension reduction using genome architectural features. Our algorithm predicts known reprogramming factors, top candidates for new settings, and ideal timing for application of transcription factors. This framework can be used to develop strategies for tissue regeneration, cancer cell reprogramming, and control of dynamical systems beyond cell biology.",

    "abstract": "Syntaxins - a conserved family of SNARE proteins - contain C-terminal transmembrane anchors required for their membrane fusion activity. Here we show that syntaxin 3 (Stx3) unexpectedly also functions as a nuclear regulator of gene expression. Alternative splicing leads to a soluble isoform, termed Stx3S, lacking the transmembrane anchor. Soluble Stx3S binds to the nuclear import factor RanBP5, targets to the nucleus and interacts physically and functionally with several transcription factors, including ETV4 and ATF2. Stx3S is differentially expressed in normal human tissues, during epithelial cell polarization, and in breast cancer vs. normal breast tissue. Inhibition of endogenous Stx3S expression leads to changes in the expression of cancer-associated genes and promotes cell proliferation. Similar nuclear-targeted, soluble forms of other syntaxins were identified suggesting that nuclear signaling is a conserved, novel function common among these membrane trafficking proteins.",

    "abstract": "Telomeric small RNAs related to PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were discovered in different species, however, their role in germline-specific telomere function remains poorly understood. Using a Drosophila model, we show that the piRNA pathway provides a strong germline-specific mechanism of telomere homeostasis. We show that telomeric retrotransposon arrays belong to a unique class of dual-strand piRNA clusters whose transcripts, required for telomere elongation, serve simultaneously as piRNA precursors and their only targets. However, the ability to produce piRNAs and bind Rhino - a germline-specific homolog of heterochromatic protein 1 (HP1) - varies along telomeres. Most likely, this heterogeneity is determined by the peculiarities of telomeric retrotransposons themselves. piRNAs play a pivotal role in the establishment and maintenance of telomeric and subtelomeric chromatin in the germline facilitating loading of HP1 and histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation mark - highly conservative telomere components - at different telomeric regions. piRNA pathway disruption results in telomere dysfunction characterized by a loss of heterochromatic components and translocation of telomeres from the periphery to the nuclear interior but does not affect the telomere end capping.",

    "abstract": "Although many driver mutations are thought to promote carcinogenesis via abnormal splicing, the landscape of these splicing-associated variants (SAVs) remains unknown due to the complexity of splicing abnormalities. Here we developed a statistical framework to identify SAVs disrupting or newly creating splice site motifs and applied it to sequencing data from 8,976 samples across 31 cancer types. We constructed a catalog of 14,438 SAVs, approximately 50% of which consist of SAVs disrupting non-canonical splice sites (including the 3rd and 5th intronic bases of donor sites) or newly creating splice sites. Smoking-related signature substantially contributes to SAV generation. As many as 14.7% of samples harbor at least one SAVs in cancer-related genes, particularly in tumor suppressors. Importantly, in addition to previously reported intron retention, exon skipping or alternative splice site usage more frequently affected these genes. Our findings delineate a comprehensive portrait of SAVs, providing a basis for cancer precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a critical cytokine regulating hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and differentiation into the megakaryocytic lineage. However, the transcriptional and chromatin dynamics elicited by TPO signaling are poorly understood. Here, we study the immediate early transcriptional and cis-regulatory responses to TPO in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and use this paradigm of cytokine signaling to chromatin to dissect the relation between cis-regulatory activity and chromatin architecture. We show that TPO profoundly alters the transcriptome of HSPCs, with key hematopoietic regulators being transcriptionally repressed within 30 minutes of TPO. By examining cis-regulatory dynamics and chromatin architectures, we demonstrate that these changes are accompanied by rapid and extensive epigenome remodeling of cis-regulatory landscapes that is spatially coordinated within topologically associating domains (TADs). Moreover, TPO-responsive enhancers are spatially clustered and engage in preferential homotypic intra- and inter-TAD interactions that are largely refractory to TPO signaling. By further examining the link between cis-regulatory dynamics and chromatin looping, we show that rapid modulation of cis-regulatory activity is largely independent of chromatin looping dynamics. Finally, we show that, although activated and repressed cis-regulatory elements share remarkably similar DNA sequence compositions, transcription factor binding patterns accurately predict rapid cis-regulatory responses to TPO.",

By analyzing gene expression in primary visual cortex of wild-type and Otx2+/GFP mice at plastic and non-plastic ages, we identified several putative genes implicated in Otx2-dependent visual cortex plasticity for ocular dominance. Cortical OTX2 infusion in juvenile mice induced Gadd45b/g expression through direct regulation of transcription. Intriguingly, a reverse effect was found in the adult, where reducing cortical OTX2 resulted in Gadd45b/g up-regulation. Viral expression of Gadd45b in adult visual cortex directly induced ocular dominance plasticity with concomitant changes in MeCP2 foci within parvalbumin interneurons and in methylation states of several plasticity gene promoters, suggesting epigenetic regulation. This interaction provides a molecular mechanism for OTX2 to trigger critical period plasticity yet suppress adult plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The identities of axons and dendrites are acquired through the self-organization of distinct microtubule (MT) orientations during neuronal polarization. The axon is generally characterized by a uniform MT orientation with all plus-ends pointing outward to the neurite terminal ( plus-end-out pattern). On the other hand, the MT orientation pattern in the dendrites depends on species: vertebrate dendrites have a mixed alignment with both plus and minus ends facing either the terminal or the cell body ( mixed pattern), whereas invertebrate dendrites have a  minus-end-out pattern. However, how MT organizations are developed in the axon and the dendrites is largely unknown. To investigate the mechanism of MT organization, we developed a biophysical model of MT kinetics, consisting of polymerization/depolymerization and MT catastrophe coupled with neurite outgrowth. The model simulation showed that the MT orientation can be controlled mainly by the speed of neurite growth and the hydrolysis rate. With a low hydrolysis rate, vertebrate plus-end-out and mixed microtubule patterns emerged in fast- and slow-growing neurites, respectively. In contrast, with a high hydrolysis rate, invertebrate plus-end-out and minus-end-out microtubule patterns emerged in fast- and slow-growing neurites, respectively. Thus, our model can provide a unified understanding of distinct microtubule organizations by simply changing the parameters.",

Robust cancer-associated 5hmC signatures in cfDNA were identified with specificity for different cancers. 5hmC-based biomarkers of circulating cfDNA demonstrated highly accurate predictive value for patients with colorectal and gastric cancers versus healthy controls, superior to conventional biomarkers, and comparable to 5hmC biomarkers from tissue biopsies.

By analyzing plants representing eighteen independent origins of C4 photosynthesis, we quantified the extent to which this convergent trait utilises identical molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that biochemical changes that characterise C4 species are recovered by this process, and expand the paradigm by four metabolic pathways not previously associated with C4 photosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that expression of many genes that distinguish C3 and C4 species respond to low CO2, providing molecular evidence that reduction in atmospheric CO2 was a driver for C4 evolution.

With the exception of the well-studied yeast PIF1 helicases (e.g., ScPif1 and ScRrm3), however, very little is known about how these enzymes help maintain genome stability. Indeed, we lack a basic understanding of the protein domains found N- and C-terminal to the characteristic central PIF1 helicase domain in these proteins. Here, using chimeric constructs, we show that the ScPif1 and ScRrm3 helicase domains are interchangeable and that the N-terminus of ScRrm3 is important for its function in vivo. This suggests that PIF1 family helicases evolved functional modules fused to a generic motor domain. To investigate this hypothesis, we characterized the biochemical activities of the PIF1 helicase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga elfii (TePif1), which contains a C-terminal WYL domain of unknown function. Like helicases from other thermophiles, recombinant TePif1 was easily prepared, thermostable in vitro, and displayed activities similar to its eukaryotic homologs. We also found that the WYL domain was necessary for high-affinity single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding and affected both ATPase and helicase activities. Deleting the WYL domain from TePif1 or mutating conserved residues in the predicted ssDNA binding site uncoupled ATPase activity and DNA unwinding, leading to higher rates of ATP hydrolysis but less efficient DNA helicase activity. Our findings suggest that the domains of unknown function found in eukaryotic PIF1 helicases may also confer functional specificity and additional activities to these enzymes, which should be investigated in future work.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn the analysis of metabolism using omics data, two distinct and complementary approaches are frequently used: Principal component analysis (PCA) and Stoichiometric flux analysis. PCA is able to capture the main modes of variability in a set of experiments and does not make many prior assumptions about the data, but does not inherently take into account the flux mode structure of metabolism. Stoichiometric flux analysis methods, such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and Elementary Mode Analysis, on the other hand, produce results that are readily interpretable in terms of metabolic flux modes, however, they are not best suited for exploratory analysis on a large set of samples.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a new methodology for the analysis of metabolism, called Principal Metabolic Flux Mode Analysis (PMFA), which marries the PCA and Stoichiometric flux analysis approaches in an elegant regularized optimization framework. In short, the method incorporates a variance maximization objective form PCA coupled with a Stoichiometric regularizer, which penalizes projections that are far from any flux modes of the network. For interpretability, we also introduce a sparse variant of PMFA that favours flux modes that contain a small number of reactions.

    "abstract": "Knowledge of \\\"haplotypes\\\", i.e. phased and ordered marker alleles on a chromosome, is essential to answer many questions in genetics and genomics. By generating short pieces of DNA sequence, high-throughput modern sequencing technologies make estimation of haplotypes possible for single individuals. In polyploids, however, haplotype estimation methods usually require deep coverage to achieve sufficient accuracy. This often renders sequencing-based approaches too costly to be applied to large populations needed in studies of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL).\\n\\nWe propose a novel haplotype estimation method for polyploids, TriPoly, that combines sequencing data with Mendelian inheritance rules to infer haplotypes in parent-offspring trios. Using realistic simulations of short- read sequencing data for potato (Solanum tuberosum) and banana (Musa acuminata) trios, we show that TriPoly yields more accurate progeny haplotypes at low coverages compared to the existing methods that work on single individuals.",

    "abstract": "Second-generation sequencing techniques generate short reads that can result in fragmented genome assemblies. Third-generation sequencing platforms mitigate this limitation by producing longer reads that span across complex and repetitive regions. Currently, the usefulness of such long reads is limited, however, because of high sequencing error rates. To exploit the full potential of these longer reads, it is imperative to correct the underlying errors. We propose HECIL--Hybrid Error Correction with Iterative Learning--a hybrid error correction framework that determines a correction policy for erroneous long reads, based on optimal combinations of decision weights obtained from short read alignments. We demonstrate that HECIL outperforms state-of-the-art error correction algorithms for an overwhelming majority of evaluation metrics on diverse real data sets including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and the malaria vector mosquito A. funestus. We further improve the performance of HECIL by introducing an iterative learning paradigm that improves the correction policy at each iteration by incorporating knowledge gathered from previous iterations via confidence metrics assigned to prior corrections.\\n\\nAvailability and Implementationhttps://github.com/NDBL/HECIL\\n\\nContactsemrich@nd.edu",

Currently, however, the only way to interpret such a convolutional kernel is a heuristic construction of a position weight matrix (PWM) from fragments scored highly by that kernel.\\n\\nResultsInstead of using heuristics, we developed a novel, exact kernel-to-PWM transformation whose equivalency is theoretically proven: the log-likelihood of the resulting PWM generating any DNA/RNA sequence is exactly the sum of a constant and the convolution of the original kernel on the same sequence. Importantly, we further proved that the resulting PWMs performance on sequence classification/regression can be exactly the same as the original kernels under popular CNN frame-works. In simulation, the exact transformation rivals or outperforms the heuristic PWMs in terms of classifying sequences with sequence- or structure-motifs. The exact transformation also faithfully reproduces the output of CNN models on real-world cases, while the heuristic one fails, especially on the case with little prior knowledge on the form of underlying true motifs. Of note, the time complexity of the novel exact transformation is independent on the number of input sequences, enabling it to scale well for massive training sequences.\\n\\nAvailabilityPython scripts for the transformation from kernel to PWM, the inverted transformation from PWM to kernel, and a proof-of-concept for the maximum likelihood estimation of optimal PWM are available through https://github.com/gao-lab/kernel-to-PWM.\\n\\nContactgaog@mail.cbi.pku.edu.cn",

    "abstract": "A central question in ecology is to understand the ecological processes that shape community structure. Niche-based theories have emphasized the important role played by competition for maintaining species diversity. Many of these insights have been derived using MacArthurs consumer resource model (MCRM) or its generalizations. Most theoretical work on the MCRM has focused on small ecosystems with a few species and resources. However theoretical insights derived from small ecosystems many not scale up large ecosystems with many resources and species because large systems with many interacting components often display new emergent behaviors that cannot be understood or deduced from analyzing smaller systems. To address this shortcoming, we develop a sophisticated statistical physics inspired cavity method to analyze MCRM when both the number of species and the number of resources is large. We find that in this limit, species generically and consistently perturb their environments and significantly modify available ecological niches. We show how our cavity approach naturally generalizes niche theory to large ecosystems by accounting for the effect of this emergent environmental engineering on species invasion and ecological stability. Our work suggests that environmental engineering is a generic feature of large, natural ecosystems and must be taken into account when analyzing and interpreting community structure. It also highlights the important role that statistical-physics inspired approaches can play in furthering our understanding of ecology.",

Polyploids can arise through direct genome doubling within a species (autopolyploidization) or through the merging of genomes from distinct species after hybridization (allopolyploidization). The relative contribution of either mechanism in plant evolution is debated. Here we used phylogenomics to dissect the tempo and mode of duplications in the genome of the olive tree (Olea europaea), one of the first domesticated Mediterranean fruit trees.\\n\\nResultsOur results depict a complex scenario involving at least three past polyploidization events, of which two -at the bases of the family Oleaceae and the tribe Oleeae, respectively- are likely to be the result of ancient allopolyploidization. A more recent polyploidization involves specifically the olive tree and relatives.\\n\\nConclusionOur results show the power of phylogenomics to distinguish between allo- and auto- polyplodization events and clarify the conundrum of past duplications in the olive tree lineage.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA common form of cooperation in bacteria is based on the secretion of beneficial metabolites, shareable as public good among cells at the group level. Because cooperation can be exploited by \\\"cheat\\\" mutants, which contribute less or nothing to the public good, there has been great interest in understanding the conditions required for cooperation to remain evolutionarily stable. In contrast, much less is known about whether cheats, once fixed in the population, are able to revert back to cooperation when conditions change. Here, we tackle this question by subjecting experimentally evolved cheats of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, partly deficient for the production of the iron-scavenging public good pyoverdine, to conditions previously shown to favor cooperation.\\n\\nResultsFollowing approximately 200 generations of experimental evolution, we screened 720 evolved clones for changes in their pyoverdine production levels. We found no evidence for the re-evolution of full cooperation, even in environments with increased spatial structure, and reduced costs of cooperation - two conditions that have previously been shown to maintain cooperation. In contrast, we observed selection for complete abolishment of pyoverdine production. The patterns of complete trait degradation were likely driven by \\\"cheating on cheats\\\" in unstructured, iron-limited environments where pyoverdine is important for growth, and selection against a maladaptive trait in iron-rich environments where pyoverdine is superfluous.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study shows that the path to re-evolve cooperation seems constrained. One reason might be that the number of mutational targets potentially leading to reversion is limited. Alternatively, it could be that the selective conditions required for revertants to spread from rare are much more stringent than those needed to maintain cooperation.",

From low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 11,670 Han Chinese women we present a catalog of 25,057,223 variants, including 548,401 novel variants that are seen at least 10 times in our dataset. Individuals from our study come from 19 out of 22 provinces across China, allowing us to study population structure, genetic ancestry, and local adaptation in Han Chinese. We identify previously unrecognized population structure along the East-West axis of China and report unique signals of admixture across geographical space, such as European influences among the Northwestern provinces of China. Finally, we identified a number of highly differentiated loci, indicative of local adaptation in the Han Chinese. In particular, we detected extreme differentiation among the Han Chinese at MTHFR, ADH7, and FADS loci, suggesting that these loci may not be specifically selected in Tibetan and Inuit populations as previously suggested. On the other hand, we find that Neandertal ancestry does not vary significantly across the provinces, consistent with admixture prior to the dispersal of modern Han Chinese. Furthermore, contrary to a previous report, Neandertal ancestry does not explain a significant amount of heritability in depression. Our findings provide the largest genetic data set so far made available for Han Chinese and provide insights into the history and population structure of the worlds largest ethnic group.",

In particular, this has revealed that actinomycete genomes contain numerous orphan gene clusters that have the potential to specify many yet unknown bioactive specialized metabolites, representing a huge unexploited pool of chemical diversity. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel group of catecholate-hydroxamate siderophores termed qinichelins (2-5) from Streptomyces sp. MBT76. Correlation between the metabolite levels and the protein expression profiles identified the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC; named qch) most likely responsible for qinichelin biosynthesis. The structure of the molecules was elucidated by bioinformatics, mass spectrometry and NMR. Synthesis of the qinichelins requires the interplay between four gene clusters, for its synthesis and for precursor supply.

Only subtle deficits were found in a comparable spatial condition, with no associated differences in posteromedial EC between young and older adults.

    "abstract": "Studies show that while brain networks are remarkably robust to a variety of adverse events, such as injuries and lesions due to accidents or disease, they may be fragile when the disturbance takes place in specific locations. This seems to be the case for diseases in which accumulated changes in network topology dramatically affect certain sensitive areas. To this end, previous attempts have been made to quantify robustness and fragility of brain functionality in two broadly defined ways: (i) utilizing model-based techniques to predict lesion effects, and (ii) studying empirical effects from brain lesions due to injury or disease. Both directions aim at assessing functional connectivity changes resulting from structural network variations. In the present work, we follow a more geometric viewpoint that is based on a notion of curvature of networks, the so-called Ollivier-Ricci curvature. A similar approach has been used in recent studies to quantify financial market robustness as well as to differentiate biological networks corresponding to cancer cells from normal cells. The same notion of curvature, defined at the node level for brain networks obtained from MRI data, may help identify and characterize the effects of diseases on specific brain regions. In the present paper, we apply the Ollivier-Ricci curvature to brain structural networks to: i) Demonstrate its unique ability to identify robust (or fragile) brain regions in healthy subjects. We compare our results to previously published work which identified a unique set of regions (called structural core) of the human cerebral cortex. This novel characterization of brain networks, complementary to measures such as degree, strength, clustering or efficiency, may be particularly useful to detect and monitor candidate areas for targeting by surgery (e.g. deep brain stimulation) or pharmaco-therapeutic agents; ii) Illustrate the power our curvature-derived measures to track changes in brain connectivity with healthy development/aging and; iii) Detect changes in brain structural connectivity in people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) which are in agreement with previous morphometric MRI studies.",

    "abstract": "Many believe that the brain implements probabilistic reasoning and that it represents information via some form of population (distributed) code. Most prior probabilistic population coding (PPC) theories share basic properties: 1) continuous-valued units; 2) fully/densely distributed codes; 3) graded synap-ses; 4) rate coding; 5) units have innate low-complexity, usually unimodal, tuning functions (TFs); and 6) units are intrinsically noisy and noise is generally considered harmful. I describe a radically different theory that assumes: 1) binary units; 2) sparse distributed codes (SDC); 3) functionally binary synapses; 4) a novel, atemporal, combinatorial spike code; 5) units initially have flat TFs (all weights zero); and 6) noise is a resource generated/used, normatively, to cause similar inputs to map to similar codes. The theory, Sparsey, was introduced 25+ years ago as: a) an explanation of the physical/computational relationship of episodic and semantic memory for the spatiotemporal (sequential) pattern domain; and b) a canonical, mesoscale cortical probabilistic circuit/algorithm possessing fixed-time, unsupervised, single-trial, non-optimization-based, unsupervised learning and fixed-time best-match (approximate) retrieval; but was not described as an alternative to PPC-type theories. Here, we show that: a) the active SDC in a Sparsey coding field (CF) simultaneously represents not only the likelihood of the single most likely input but the likelihoods of all hypotheses stored in the CF; and b) the whole explicit distribution can be sent, e.g., to a downstream CF, via a set of simultaneous single spikes from the neurons comprising the active SDC.",

    "abstract": "In the 19th century Francis Galton first reported that humans represent numbers on a mental number line with smaller numbers on the left and larger numbers on the right. It has been suggested that this orientation emerges as a result of reading/writing habits for both words or numbers. Recent evidence in animals and infants in the first months of life has challenged the primary role of language in determining the left-to-right direction of spatial-numerical association, SNA. However, the possibility that SNA is learnt by early exposure to caregivers directional biases is still open. Here we show that 55-hour-old newborns, once habituated to a number (i.e., 12), spontaneously associated a smaller number (i.e., 4) with the left side and a larger number (i.e., 36) with the right side of space. Moreover, SNA in neonates was not absolute but relative. The same number (i.e., 12) was associated with the left side whenever the previously experienced number was larger (i.e., 36), but with the right side whenever the number was smaller (i.e., 4). Control on continuous physical variables showed that the effect was specific of discrete magnitudes. Hence, soon after birth humans associate smaller numbers with the left space and larger numbers with the right space. These results constitute strong evidence that in our species SNA originates from pre-linguistic and biologically precursors in the brain.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFor human adults, the representation of number and space is profoundly intertwined. Humans represent numbers on a left to right oriented Mental Number Line (MNL), with small numbers located on the left and larger ones on the right. How do these connections arise? Do we learn to associate numbers with space throughout cultural learning and social interactions or is this association rooted in the biology of the human brain? We showed that neonates spontaneously associate numbers with space. After being habituated to a certain number, neonates associated a smaller number with the left and a larger number with the right side. This evidence demonstrates that a predisposition to map numbers onto space is rooted in human neural systems.",

    "abstract": "Layer 5 (L5) cortical projection neurons innervate far-ranging brain areas to coordinate integrative sensory processing and adaptive behaviors. Here, we characterize a compensatory plasticity in L5 auditory cortex (ACtx) projection neurons with axons that innervate the inferior colliculus (IC), thalamus, lateral amygdala and striatum. We used widefield calcium imaging to monitor daily changes in sound processing from the dense plexus of corticocollicular (CCol) axon terminals in awake adult mice. CCol sound level growth functions were stable in control conditions but showed bi-phasic gain changes following damage to cochlear afferent synapses. Auditory nerve and CCol growth functions were sharply reduced hours after cochlear synaptopathy, but CCol response gain rebounded above baseline levels by the following day and remained elevated for 2 weeks despite a persistent reduction in auditory nerve input. Sustained potentiation of excitatory ACtx projection neurons that innervate multiple limbic and subcortical auditory centers may underlie hyperexcitability and aberrant functional coupling of distributed brain networks in tinnitus.",

    "abstract": "1.There is increasing interest in understanding how the phase and amplitude of distinct neural oscillations might interact to support dynamic communication within the brain. In particular, previous work has demonstrated a coupling between the phase of low frequency oscillations and the amplitude (or power) of high frequency oscillations during certain tasks, termed phase amplitude coupling (PAC). For instance, during visual processing in humans, PAC has been reliably observed between ongoing alpha (8-13Hz) and gamma-band (>40Hz) activity. However, the application of PAC metrics to electrophysiological data can be challenging due to numerous methodological issues and lack of coherent approaches within the field. Therefore, in this article we outline the various analysis steps involved in detecting PAC, using an openly available MEG dataset from 16 participants performing an interactive visual task. Firstly, we localised gamma and alpha-band power using the Fieldtrip toolbox, and extracted time courses from area V1, defined using a multimodal parcellation scheme. These V1 responses were analysed for changes in alpha-gamma PAC, using four common algorithms. Results showed an increase in gamma (40-100Hz) - alpha (7-13Hz) PAC in response to the visual grating stimulus, though specific patterns of coupling were somewhat dependent upon the algorithm employed. Additionally, post-hoc analyses showed that these results were not driven by the presence of non-sinusoidal oscillations, and that trial length was sufficient to obtain reliable PAC estimates. Finally, throughout the article, methodological issues and practical guidelines for ongoing PAC research will be discussed.",

Human exposure to Cd2+ occurs through food consumption, cigarette smoking, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Cd2+ has been shown to be nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, and osteotoxic, and is a known carcinogen. Animal studies and epidemiological studies have linked prenatal Cd2+ exposure to hyperactivity and balance disorders although the mechanisms remain unknown. In this study we show that zebrafish developmentally exposed to Cd2+ exhibit abnormal otolith development and show an increased tendency to swim in circles, observations that are consistent with an otolith-mediated vestibular defect, in addition to being hyperactive. We also demonstrate that the addition of calcium rescues otolith malformation and reduces circling behavior but has no ameliorating effect on hyperactivity, suggesting that hyperactivity and balance disorders in human populations exposed to Cd are manifestations of separate underlying molecular pathways.",

In this context, public Ig sequences shared by different individuals exposed to the same antigen could be valuable markers for tracing back infections, measuring vaccine immunogenicity, and perhaps ultimately allow the reconstruction of the immunological history of an individual. Here, we immunized groups of transgenic rats expressing human Ig against tetanus toxoid (TT), Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), measles virus hemagglutinin and fusion proteins expressed on MVA and the environmental carcinogen Benzo[a]Pyrene, coupled to TT. We showed that these antigens impose a selective pressure causing the Ig Heavy chain (IgH) repertoires of the rats to converge towards the expression of antibodies with highly similar IgH CDR3 amino acid sequences. We present a computational approach, similar to differential gene expression analysis, that selects for clusters of CDR3s with 80% similarity, significantly overrepresented within the different groups of immunized rats. These IgH clusters represent antigen-induced IgH signatures exhibiting stereotypic amino acid patterns including previously described TT and measles specific IgH sequences. Our data suggest, that with the presented methodology, transgenic Ig rats can be utilized as a model to identify antigen-induced, human IgH signatures to a variety of different antigens.",

    "abstract": "In their natural environment, animals often encounter complex mixtures of odours. It is an open question whether and how responses to complex mixtures of multi-component odours differ from those to simpler mixtures or single components. To approach this question, we built a full-size model of the early olfactory system of honeybees, which predicts responses to both single odorants and mixtures. The model is designed so that olfactory response patterns conform to the statistics derived from experimental data for a variety of their properties. It also takes into account several biophysical processes at a minimal level, including processes of chemical binding and activation in receptors, and spike generation and transmission in the antennal lobe network. We verify that key findings from other experimental data, not used in building the model, are reproduced in it. In particular, we replicate the strong correlation among receptor neurons and the weaker correlation among projection neurons observed in experimental data and show that this decorrelation is predominantly due to inhibition by interneurons. By simulation and mathematical analysis of our model, we demonstrate that the chemical processes of receptor binding and activation already lead to significant differences between the responses to mixtures and those to single component stimuli. On average, the response latency of olfactory receptor neurons at low stimulus concentrations is reduced and the response patterns become less variable across concentrations as the number of odour components in the stimulus increases. These effects are preserved in the projection neurons. Our results suggest that the early olfactory system of insects may be particularly efficient in processing mixtures, which corresponds well to the observation that chemical signalling in nature predominantly involves mixtures.",

    "abstract": "The proposed Minimum Information About Particle Tracking Experiments (MIAPTE) reporting guidelines described here aim to deliver a set of rules representing the minimal information required to report and support interpretation and assessment of data arising from intracellular multiple particle tracking (MPT) experiments. Examples of such experiments are those tracking viral particles as they move from the site of entry to the site of replication within an infected cell, or those following vesicular dynamics during secretion, endocytosis, or exocytosis. By promoting development of community standards, we hope that MIAPTE will contribute to making MPT data FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable). Ultimately, the goal of MIAPTE is to promote and maximize data access, discovery, preservation, re-use, and repurposing through efficient annotation, and ultimately to enable reproducibility of particle tracking experiments. This document introduces MIAPTE v0.2, which updates the version that was posted to Fairsharing.org in October 2016. MIAPTE v0.2 is presented with the specific intent of soliciting comments from the particle tracking community with the purpose of extending and improving the model. The MIAPTE guidelines are intended for different categories of users: 1) Scientists with the desire to make new results available in a way that can be interpreted unequivocally by both humans and machines. For this class of users, MIAPTE provides data descriptors to define data entry terms and the analysis workflow in a unified manner. 2) Scientists wishing to evaluate, replicate and re-analyze results published by others. For this class of users MIAPTE provides descriptors that define the analysis procedures in a manner that facilitates its reproduction. 3) Developers who want to take advantage of the schema of MIAPTE to produce MIAPTE compatible tools. MIAPTE consists of a list of controlled vocabulary (CV) terms that describe elements and properties for the minimal description of particle tracking experiments, with a focus on viral and vesicular traffic within cells. As part of this submission we provide entity relationship (ER) diagrams that show the relationship between terms. Finally, we also provide documents containing the MIAPTE-compliant XML schema describing the data model used by Open Microscopy Environment inteGrated Analysis (OMEGA), our novel particle tracking data analysis and management tool, which is reported in a separate manuscript. MIAPTE is structured in two sub-sections: 1) Section 1 contains elements, attributes and data structures describing the results of particle tracking, namely: particles, links, trajectories and trajectory segments. 2) Section 2 contains elements that provide details about the algorithmic procedure utilized to produce and analyze trajectories as well as the results of trajectory analysis. In addition MIAPTE includes those OME-XML elements that are required to capture the acquisition parameters and the structure of images to be subjected to particle tracking.",

Using a computational approach, we found that partial inhibition of transmission which involves multiple virions per cell could lead to increased numbers of live infected cells if the number of viral DNA copies remains above one after inhibition, as eliminating the surplus viral copies reduces cell death. Using a cell line, we observed increased numbers of live infected cells when infection was partially inhibited with the antiretroviral efavirenz or neutralizing antibody. We then used efavirenz at concentrations reported in lymph nodes to inhibit lymph node infection by partially resistant HIV mutants. We observed more live infected lymph node cells, but with fewer HIV DNA copies per cell, relative to no drug. Hence, counterintuitively, limited attenuation of HIV transmission per cell may increase live infected cell numbers in environments where the force of infection is high.",

    "abstract": "The packaging and budding of Gag polyprotein and viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a critical step in the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) lifecycle. High-resolution structures of the Gag polyprotein have revealed that the capsid (CA) and spacer peptide 1 (SP1) domains contain important interfaces for Gag self-assembly. However, the molecular details of the multimerization process, especially in the presence of RNA and the cell membrane, have remained unclear. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that work in concert between the polyproteins, RNA, and membrane to promote immature lattice growth. We develop a coarse-grained (CG) computational model that is derived from sub-nanometer resolution structural data. Our simulations recapitulate contiguous and hexameric lattice assembly driven only by weak anisotropic attractions at the helical CA-SP1 junction. Importantly, analysis from CG and single-particle tracking photoactivated localization (spt-PALM) trajectories indicates that viral RNA and the membrane are critical constituents that actively promote Gag multimerization through scaffolding, while over-expression of short competitor RNA can suppress assembly. We also find that the CA amino-terminal domain imparts intrinsic curvature to the Gag lattice. As a consequence, immature lattice growth appears to be coupled to the dynamics of spontaneous membrane deformation. Our findings elucidate a simple network of interactions that regulate the early stages of HIV-1 assembly and budding.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn order for human immunodeficiency virus to proliferate, viral proteins and genomic dimers are assembled at host cell membranes and released as immature virions. Disrupting this key intermediate step in viral replication is a potential target for treatment. However, a detailed molecular view of this process remains lacking. Here, we elucidate a network of constitutive interactions that regulate viral assembly dynamics through a combined computational and experimental approach. Specifically, our analysis reveals the active roles of nucleic acid and the membrane as scaffolds that promote the multimerization of Gag polyprotein which proceeds through multi-step and self-correcting nucleation. Our findings also illustrate the functional importance of the N-terminal, C-terminal, and spacer peptide 1 protein domains.",

    "abstract": "Summary ParagraphClathrin-mediated endocytosis internalizes membrane from the cell surface by reshaping flat regions of membrane into spherical vesicles(1, 2). The relationship between membrane bending and clathrin coatomer assembly has been inferred from electron microscopy and structural biology, without directly visualization of membrane bending dynamics (3-6). This has resulted in two distinct and opposing models for how clathrin bends membrane (7-10). Here, polarized Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy was improved and combined with electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and super-resolution imaging to measure membrane bending during endogenous clathrin and dynamin assembly in living cells. Surprisingly, and not predicted by either model, the timing of membrane bending was variable relative to clathrin assembly. Approximately half of the time, membrane bending occurs at the start of clathrin assembly, in the other half, the onset of membrane bending lags clathrin arrival, and occasionally completely assembled flat clathrin transitions into a pit. Importantly, once the membrane bends, the process proceeds to scission with similar timing. We conclude that the pathway of coatomer formation is versatile and can bend the membrane during or after the assembly of the clathrin lattice. These results highlight the heterogeneity in this fundamental biological process, and provide a more complete nanoscale view of membrane bending dynamics during endocytosis.",

Here, we report glycan evolution follows a clock-like rhythm, pacing the timeline, trajectory, and replacement of HA. Following pandemic introduction, glycans are added to HA at 4- to 6-year intervals, until a functional glycan limit is reached, after which, at 9- to 12-year intervals, glycans are either swapped between different sites, or the HA is replaced by a novel pandemic virus. Using this, we predicted the appearance of the newest glycan on pH1N1 HA. Phylogeographic reconstruction suggests these highly fit strains originated in the Middle East, before rapidly replacing all strains globally. Going forward, we can use this simple algorithm to forecast future glycan evolution and identify seasons with higher pandemic potential.",

Progeny from both of these lines showed the abnormal wheel-running behavior, with affected mice showing significantly lower daily activity levels than unaffected mice. They also exhibited low amplitude circadian rhythms, consisting of lower activity levels during the normal active phase, and increased levels of activity during the rest or light phase, but only a modest alteration in free-running period. Their activity is not consolidated into longer bouts, but is frequently interrupted with periods of inactivity throughout the dark phase of the light-dark (LD) cycle. As seen with the low body weight, expression of the behavioral phenotypes in offspring of strategic crosses was consistent with a recessive heritance pattern. Mapping of these phenotypic abnormalities showed linkage to a single locus on chromosome 11, and whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a single point mutation in the Slc2a4 gene encoding the GLUT4 insulin-responsive glucose transporter. The single nucleotide change (A to T) was found in the distal end of exon 10, and results in a premature stop (Y440*). To our knowledge, this is the first time a mutation in this gene has been shown to result in extensive changes in general behavioral patterns.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTChronic fatigue is a debilitating and devastating disorder with widespread consequences for both the patient and the persons around them, but effective treatment strategies are lacking. The identification of novel genetic mouse models of chronic fatigue may prove invaluable for the study of its underlying physiological mechanisms and for the testing of treatments and interventions. A novel mutation in Slc2a4 (GLUT4) was identified in a forward mutagenesis screen because affected mice showed abnormal daily patterns and levels of wheel running consistent with chronic fatigue. This new mouse model may shed light on the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) maintain hematopoietic output throughout an animal's lifespan. With age, however, they produce a myeloid-biased output that may lead to poor immune responses to infectious challenge and the development of myeloid leukemias. Here, we show that young and aged LT-HSCs respond differently to inflammatory stress, such that aged LT-HSCs produce a cell-intrinsic, myeloid-biased expression program. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we identify a myeloid-biased subset within the LT-HSC population (mLT-HSCs) that is much more common amongst aged LT-HSCs and is uniquely primed to respond to acute inflammatory challenge. We predict several transcription factors to regulate differentially expressed genes between mLT-HSCs and other LT-HSC subsets. Among these, we show that Klf5, Ikzf1 and Stat3 play important roles in age-related inflammatory myeloid bias. These factors may regulate myeloid versus lymphoid balance with age, and can potentially mitigate the long-term deleterious effects of inflammation that lead to hematopoietic pathologies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LILT-HSCs from young and aged mice have differential responses to acute inflammatory challenge.\\nC_LIO_LIHSPCs directly sense inflammatory stimuli in vitro and have a robust transcriptional response.\\nC_LIO_LIAged LT-HSCs demonstrate a cell-intrinsic myeloid bias during inflammatory challenge.\\nC_LIO_LISingle-cell RNA-seq unmasked the existence of two subsets within the LT-HSC population that was apparent upon stimulation but not steady-state.

    "abstract": "The host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, our data unveil a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe advent of \\\"omics\\\" science has brought new perspectives in contemporary biology through the high-throughput analyses of molecular interactions, providing new clues in protein/gene function and in the organization of biological pathways. Biomolecular interaction networks, or graphs, are simple abstract representations where the components of a cell (e.g. proteins, metabolites etc.) are represented by nodes and their interactions are represented by edges. An appropriate visualization of data is crucial for understanding such networks, since pathways are related to functions that occur in specific regions of the cell. The force-directed layout is an important and widely used technique to draw networks according to their topologies. Placing the networks into cellular compartments helps to quickly identify where network elements are located and, more specifically, concentrated. Currently, only a few tools provide the capability of visually organizing networks by cellular compartments. Most of them cannot handle large and dense networks. Even for small networks with hundreds of nodes the available tools are not able to reposition the network while the user is interacting, limiting the visual exploration capability.\\n\\nResultsHere we propose CellNetVis, a web tool to easily display biological networks in a cell diagram employing a constrained force-directed layout algorithm. The tool is freely available and open-source. It was originally designed for networks generated by the Integrated Interactome System and can be used with networks from others databases, like InnateDB.\\n\\nConclusionsCellNetVis has demonstrated to be applicable for dynamic investigation of complex networks over a consistent representation of a cell on the Web, with capabilities not matched elsewhere.",
