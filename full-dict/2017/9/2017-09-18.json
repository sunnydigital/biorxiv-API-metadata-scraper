    "abstract": "Bacteria and their viral pathogens face constant pressure for augmented immune and infective capabilities, respectively. Under this reciprocally imposed selective regime, we expect to see a runaway evolutionary arms race, ultimately leading to the extinction of one species. Despite this prediction, in many systems host and pathogen coexist with minimal coevolution even when well-mixed. Previous work explained this puzzling phenomenon by invoking fitness tradeoffs, which can diminish an arms race dynamic. Here we propose that the regular loss of immunity by the bacterial host can also produce host-phage coexistence. We pair a general model of immunity with an experimental and theoretical case study of the CRISPR-Cas immune system to contrast the behavior of tradeoff and loss mechanisms in well-mixed systems. We find that, while both mechanisms can produce stable coexistence, only immune loss does so robustly within realistic parameter ranges.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity plays a central role in tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. Experiments are shedding light on this diversity at ever finer scales, but interpretation is challenging. Using recent progress in numerical models, we simulate macroscopic tumors to investigate the interplay between growth dynamics, microscopic composition, and circulating tumor cell cluster diversity. We find that modest differences in growth parameters can profoundly change microscopic diversity. Simple outwards expansion leads to spatially segregated clones and low diversity, as expected. However, a modest cell turnover can result in an increased number of divisions and mixing among clones resulting in increased microscopic diversity in the tumor core. Using simulations to estimate power to detect such spatial trends, we find that multiregion sequencing data from contemporary studies is marginally powered to detect the predicted effects. Slightly larger samples, improved detection of rare variants, or sequencing of smaller biopsies or circulating tumor cell clusters would allow one to distinguish between leading models of tumor evolution. The genetic composition of circulating tumor cell clusters, which can be obtained from non-invasive blood draws, is therefore informative about tumor evolution and its metastatic potential.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LINumerical and theoretical models show interaction of front expansion, mutation, and clonal mixing in shaping tumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LICell turnover increases intratumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LISimulated circulating tumor cell clusters and microbiopsies exhibit substantial diversity with strong spatial trends.\\nC_LIO_LISimulations suggest attainable sampling schemes able to distinguish between prevalent tumor growth models.\\nC_LI",

The existence of persistent genetic variation within natural populations presents an evolutionary problem as natural selection and genetic drift tend to erode genetic diversity. Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the high and sometimes extreme levels of polymorphism found in many natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection may be the most powerful selective force maintaining balanced natural polymorphisms but it is also commonly misinterpreted. The aim of this review is to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of natural polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss observational and experimental data that can aid in accurately identifying the processes that generated or are maintain diversity in nature. Finally, I consider the importance of accurately describing the processes affecting genetic diversity within populations as it relates to research progress.",

    "abstract": "Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill in this gap, we present a deep learning (DL) based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We build the DL based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients data using RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and methylation data from TCGA, which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P=7.13e-6) and good model fitness (C-index=0.68). More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19, EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n=230, C-index=0.75), NCI cohort (n=221, C-index=0.67), Chinese cohort (n=166, C-index=0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n=40, C-index=0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n=27, C-index=0.82). This is the first study to employ deep learning to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of HCC patients. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction.",

Here we show that advisers managed their influence over their client strategically, by modulating the confidence of their advice, depending on the interaction between advisers level of influence on the client (i.e., being ignored or chosen by the client), and relative merit (i.e., their accuracy in comparison with a rival). Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that these sources of social information were tracked in distinct regions of the brains social and valuation systems: relative merit in the medial-prefrontal cortex, and selection by client in the temporo-parietal junction. In addition, increased functional connectivity between these two regions during positive merit trials predicted their effect on behaviour. Both sources of social information modulated the activity in the ventral striatum. These results further our understanding of human interactions and provide a framework for investigating the neurobiology of how we try to influence others.",

    "abstract": "The influence of oncogenic phenomena on the ecology and evolution of animal species is fast becoming an important research topic. Similar to host-pathogen interactions, cancer negatively affects host fitness, which should lead to the selection of host control mechanisms, including behavioral traits that best minimize the proliferation of malignant cells. Social behavior is one such trait, which is suggested to influence cancer progression. While the ecological benefits of sociality in gregarious species are widely acknowledged, only limited data are available on the role of the social environment on cancer progression. Here, we exposed adult Drosophila, with colorectal-like tumors, to different social environments. First, we show that cancerous flies kept in complete isolation exhibit increased tumor progression. Yet, more surprisingly, we find that cancerous flies, kept in groups with other noncancerous individuals, also develop tumors at a faster rate compared to those kept with other cancerous conspecifics, suggesting a strong impact of social group composition on cancer growth. Finally, we show that flies can discriminate between individuals at different stages of tumor growth and selectively choose their social environment accordingly. Control flies actively avoid flies with cancer but only at the later stages of tumor development, whereas cancerous flies display strong social interactions with cancerous flies in the early stages of tumor growth. Our study demonstrates the reciprocal links between cancer and social interactions, as well as highlighting how sociality impacts health and fitness in animals and its potential implications for disease ecology and ecosystem dynamics.",

Distraction has different impact on perceptual, cognitive and value-guided choices, giving rise to well-described behavioural phenomena such as the tilt illusion, conflict adaptation, or economic decoy effects. However, a single, unified model that can account for all these phenomena has yet to emerge. Here, we offer one such account, based on adaptive gain control, and additionally show that it successfully predicts a range of counterintuitive new behavioural phenomena on variants of a classic cognitive paradigm, the Eriksen flanker task. We also report that BOLD signals in a dorsal network prominently including the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), index a gain-modulated decision variable predicted by the model.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) in healthcare has provided vast new amounts of data for statistical machine learning researchers in their efforts to model and predict patient health status, potentially enabling novel advances in treatment. In the case of sepsis, a debilitating, dysregulated host response to infection, extracting subtle, uncataloged clinical phenotypes from the EMR with statistical machine learning methods has the potential to impact patient diagnosis and treatment early in the course of their hospitalization. However, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to extract these insights from EMR data. First, EMR datasets consist of both static and dynamic observations of discrete and continuous-valued variables, many of which may be missing, precluding the application of standard multivariate analysis techniques. Second, clinical populations observed via EMRs and relevant to the study and management of conditions like sepsis are often heterogeneous; properly accounting for this heterogeneity is critical. Here, we describe an unsupervised, probabilistic framework called a composite mixture model that can simultaneously accommodate the wide variety of observations frequently observed in EMR datasets, characterize heterogeneous clinical populations, and handle missing observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a large-scale sepsis cohort, developing novel techniques built on our model-based clusters to track patient mortality risk over time and identify physiological trends and distinct subgroups of the dataset associated with elevated risk of mortality during hospitalization.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "How did egalitarianism emerge in early human societies? In contrast to dominance hierarchies in non-human primates, human simple forager bands are typically egalitarian, with male hunters often serving as the collective alpha. Here we present a thermodynamics-inspired simple population model, based on stochastic optimization of dominance relationships, in which a dominance hierarchy of individuals with exclusively self-centered characteristics (the desire to dominate, resentment at being dominated) transitions spontaneously to egalitarianism as their capacity for language develops. Language, specifically gossip, allows resentment against being dominated to promote the formation of antidominance coalitions which destabilize the alpha position for individuals, leading to a phase transition in which a coalition of the full population suddenly becomes dominant. Thus, egalitarianism emerges suddenly as the optimal power sharing arrangement in a population of selfish individuals without any inherently altruistic qualities. We speculate that egalitarianism driven by punishment for exhibiting alpha-like behavior may then set the stage for genuinely altruistic traits to propagate as predicted by game theory models. Based on model simulations, we also predict that egalitarianism is a pre-condition for adaptation of tools as weapons. Potential implications for origins of human moral belief systems are discussed.",

While monitoring PSelL expression on activated CD8+ T cells (Tact) in adoptive transfer models, we observed two distinct PSelL on responding donor cells, the canonical cell-intrinsic PSelL PSGL1 and a second undocumented PSelL provisionally named PSL2. PSL2 is unusual among selectin ligands in that it is cell-extrinsic, loaded onto L-selectin (LSel) expressed by Tact but not LSel on resting naive CD8+ T cells. PSL2 expression is highest on Tact responding in peripheral lymph nodes and low on Tact responding in spleen suggesting that the original source of PSL2 is high endothelial venules, cells known to produce LSelL. When both PSGL1 and PSL2 were absent from the surface of Tact, no significant residual PSelL activity was detected. PSL2 is a ligand for both PSel and LSel and can physically bridge the two selectins. The LSel/PSL2 complex can mediate PSel-dependent adherence of Tact to immobilized PSel-hIgG or to activated platelets, either independently or cooperatively with PSGL1.

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo optimise fecal sampling and analysis yielding reproducible microbiome data, and gain further insight into sources of its variation, we compared different collection conditions and 16S rRNA gene sequencing protocols in two centers. Fecal samples were collected on three sequential days from six healthy adults and placed in commercial collection tubes (OMNIgeneGut OMR-200) at room temperature or in sterile 5 ml screw-top tubes in a home fridge or home freezer for 6-24 h, before transfer at 4{degrees}C to the laboratory and storage at - 80{degrees}C within 24 hours. Replicate samples were shipped on dry ice to centers in Australia and the USA for DNA extraction and sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, using different PCR protocols. Sequences were analysed with the QIIME pipeline and Greengenes database at the Australian center and with an in-house pipeline and SILVA database at the USA center.\\n\\nResultsVariation in gut microbiome composition and diversity was dominated by differences between individuals. Minor differences in the abundance of taxa were found between collection-processing methods and day of collection. Larger differences were evident between the two centers, including in the relative abundances of genus Akkermansia, in phylum Verrucomicrobiales, and Bifidobacteria in Actinobacteria.\\n\\nConclusionsCollection with storage and transport at 4{degrees}C within 24 h is adequate for 16S rRNA analysis of the gut microbiome. However, variation between sequencing centers suggests that cohort samples should be sequenced by the same method in one center. Differences in handling, shipping and methods of PCR gene amplification and sequence analysis in different centers introduce variation in ways that are not fully understood. These findings are particularly relevant as microbiome studies shift towards larger population-based and multicenter studies.",

Little is known, however, about the contributions of specific hippocampal sub-regions in this process, a critical issue given the functional and anatomical heterogeneity of this structure. Using a non-spatial cue-based paradigm in rats, we found that transient pharmacological inactivation of ventral CA1 produced an avoidance of a conflict cue imbued with both learned positive and negative outcomes, whereas inactivation of the ventral CA3 resulted in the opposite pattern of behavior, with significant preference for the conflict cue. In contrast, dorsal CA1- and CA3-inactivated rats showed no change in conflict behavior. Our findings provide important insight into the functions and circuitry of the ventral hippocampus by demonstrating that the ventral CA1 and CA3 subserve distinct and opposing roles in approach-avoidance conflict processing.",

Of the >23,000 diurnally rhythmic CpGs identified in wild-type cortex, 97% lost rhythmic methylation in PWS cortex. Circadian dysregulation of a second imprinted Snord cluster at the Temple/Kagami-Ogata syndrome locus was observed at the level of methylation, transcription, and chromatin, providing mechanistic evidence of crosstalk. Genes identified by diurnal epigenetic changes in PWS mice overlapped rhythmic and PWS-specific genes in human brain and were enriched for PWS-relevant obesity phenotypes and pathways. These results support the proposed evolutionary relationship between imprinting and sleep, and suggest possible chronotherapy in the treatment of PWS and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Countries vary in their geographical and cultural properties. Only a few studies have explored how such variations influence how humans navigate or reason about space [1-7]. We predicted that these variations impact human cognition, resulting in an organized spatial distribution of cognition at a planetary-wide scale. To test this hypothesis we developed a mobile-app-based cognitive task, measuring non-verbal spatial navigation ability in more than 2.5 million people, sampling populations in every nation state. We focused on spatial navigation due to its universal requirement across cultures. Using a clustering approach, we find that navigation ability is clustered into five distinct, yet geographically related, groups of countries. Specifically, the economic wealth of a nation was predictive of the average navigation ability of its inhabitants, and gender inequality was predictive of the size of performance difference between males and females. Thus, cognitive abilities, at least for spatial navigation, are clustered according to economic wealth and gender inequalities globally, which has significant implications for cross-cultural studies and multi-centre clinical trials using cognitive testing.",

    "abstract": "Cell morphogenesis is a fundamental process involved in tissue formation. One of the challenges in the fabrication of living tissues in vitro is to recapitulate the complex morphologies of individual cells. Despite tremendous progress in understanding biophysical principles underlying tissue/organ morphogenesis at the organ level, little work has been done to understand morphogenesis at the cellular and microtissue level. In this work, we developed a 2D computational model for studying cell morphogenesis in monolayer tissues. The model is mainly composed of four modules: mechanics of cytoskeleton, cell motility, cell-substrate interaction, and cell-cell interaction. The model integrates the biochemical and mechanical activities within individual cells spatiotemporally. Finite element method (FEM) is used to model the irregular shapes of cells and to solve the resulting system of reaction-diffusion-stress equations. Automated mesh generation is used to handle the element distortion in FEM due to the large shape changes of the cells. The computer program can simulate tens to hundreds of cells interacting with each other and with the elastic substrate on desktop workstations efficiently. The simulations demonstrated that our computational model can be used to study cell polarization, single cell migration, durotaxis, and morphogenesis in cell monolayers.",

RecBCD helicase in prokaryotes initiates processive and rapid DNA unzipping essential for break repair. Yet, the energetics of RecBCD during translocation along the DNA track needs to be quantitatively clarified. Specifically, its essential to understand how RecBCD switches between its binding states to enable its translocation. Here we determine, by systematic affinity measurements, the degree of coupling between DNA and nucleotide binding to RecBCD. We show that, in the presence of ADP, RecBCD binds weakly to DNA that harbors a double overhang mimicking an unwinding intermediate. Consistently, RecBCD binds weakly to ADP in the presence of the same DNA. We did not observe coupling between DNA and nucleotide binding for DNA molecules having only a single overhang, suggesting that RecBCD subunits must both bind DNA to \"sense\" the nucleotide state. Excitingly, we observed weak coupling for AMPpNp as RecBCD remains strongly bound to DNA in its presence. Detailed thermodynamic analysis of RecBCD reaction mechanism suggests an  energetic compensation between RecB and RecD, which may be essential for rapid unwinding. Our findings provide the basis for a  stepping mechanism during the processive translocation of RecBCD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent developments in sequencing technologies make it possible to obtain genome sequences from a large number of isolates in a very short time. Bayesian phylogenetic approaches can take advantage of these data by simultaneously inferring the phylogenetic tree, evolutionary timescale, and demographic parameters (such as population growth rates), while naturally integrating uncertainty in all parameters. Despite their desirable properties, Bayesian approaches can be computationally intensive, hindering their use for outbreak investigations involving genome data for a large numbers of pathogen isolates. An alternative to using full Bayesian inference is to use a hybrid approach, where the phylogenetic tree and evolutionary timescale are estimated first using maximum likelihood. Under this hybrid approach, demographic parameters are inferred from estimated trees instead of the sequence data, using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, or approximate Bayesian computation. This can vastly reduce the computational burden, but has the disadvantage of ignoring the uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree and evolutionary timescale.\\n\\nResultsWe compared the performance of a fully Bayesian and a hybrid method by analysing six whole-genome SNP data sets from a range of bacteria and simulations. The estimates from the two methods were very similar, suggesting that the hybrid method is a valid alternative for very large datasets. However, we also found that congruence between these methods is contingent on the presence of strong temporal structure in the data (i.e. clocklike behaviour), which is typically verified using a date-randomisation test in a Bayesian framework. To reduce the computational burden of this Bayesian test we implemented a date-randomisation test using a rapid maximum likelihood method, which has similar performance to its Bayesian counterpart.\\n\\nConclusionsHybrid approaches can produce reliable inferences of evolutionary timescales and phylodynamic parameters in a fraction of the time required for fully Bayesian analyses. As such, they are a valuable alternative in outbreak studies involving a large number of isolates.",

    "abstract": "Cross-validation (CV) is a technique to assess the generalizability of a model to unseen data. This technique relies on assumptions that may not be satisfied when studying genomics datasets. For example, random CV (RCV) assumes that a randomly selected set of samples, the test set, well represents unseen data. This assumption does not hold true where samples are obtained from different experimental conditions, and the goal is to learn regulatory relationships among the genes that generalize beyond the observed conditions. In this study, we investigated how the CV procedure affects the assessment of methods used to learn gene regulatory networks. We compared the performance of a regression-based method for gene expression prediction, estimated using RCV with that estimated using a clustering-based CV (CCV) procedure. Our analysis illustrates that RCV can produce over-optimistic estimates of generalizability of the model compared to CCV. Next, we defined the  distinctness of a test set from a training set and showed that this measure is predictive of the performance of the regression method. Finally, we introduced a simulated annealing method to construct partitions with gradually increasing distinctness and showed that performance of different gene expression prediction methods can be better evaluated using this method.",

Previous research links light-moderate alcohol consumption to a decreased risk of Alzheimers disease (AD), however, prior studies based on observational study designs may be biased due to unmeasured confounders influencing both alcohol consumption and AD risk.\\n\\nInterpretationWe used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluated the causal relationship between alcohol intake and AD. MR uses genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures to provide an estimate of the causal association between an intermediate exposure and a disease outcome. MR found evidence of a causal association between alcohol consumption and an earlier AD age of onset, suggesting that light-moderate alcohol consumption does not reduce risk of Alzheimers disease.\\n\\nFuture DirectionsFuture studies should use alterative study designs and account for additional confounders when evaluating the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and AD.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe evaluated causal relationships between alcohol intake and Alzheimers disease\\nC_LIO_LIAlcohol consumption is causally associated with an earlier Alzheimers age of onset\\nC_LIO_LINo evidence of causal assocations between alcohol intake and Alzheimers risk\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Differential Susceptibility Theory explains long-term associations between neurobiological sensitivity and cognitive outcomes, but no comparable theoretical framework exists to understand how neurobiological sensitivity and cognitive performance inter-relate on shorter time-frames. Here, we evaluate a framework proposed by Aston-Jones and colleagues, building on the Yerkes-Dodson model, to understand these associations. The framework describes how slow-moving (tonic) changes in autonomic arousal relate to fast (phasic) changes, as observed for example relative to experimenter-determined events, and how phasic changes relate to attention. Larger phasic changes, which associate with better selective attention, are most likely at mid-level tonic arousal. Smaller phasic changes, and worse selective attention, are observed at hypo-and hyper-arousal. We review the fit of this model to typical and atypical development, during infancy and childhood.",

    "abstract": "The ERA (E. coli RAS-like protein)-related GTPase (ERG) is a nuclear-encoded GTPase with two conserved domains: a GTPase domain and a K Homology domain. ERG plays a vital role in early seed development in Antirrhinum majus. However, the mechanism that regulates seed development remains unclear. Blasting the genome sequence revealed two homologies of ERG, AtERG1, and AtERG2 in Arabidopsis. In this study, we found that AtERG2 is localised in the mitochondria and binds mitochondrial 18S RNA. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that AtERG2 was mainly expressed in the leaf vein, trichome, mature pollen, and ovule. The mutants of AtERG2 showed recessive lethal, gametophytic maternal effects, silique shortage, and early seed abortion, in which some seeds arrested in the zygotic stage at 1.5 days after pollination (DAP) and aborted at 2.0 DAP in aterg2-1 +/-. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated at 1.5 DAP in the arrested seeds, and the transcription of several ROS-responsible genes, WRKY40, ANAC017, and AOXla, was up-regulated in the aterg2-1 +/- seeds which were arrested 1.5 and 2.0 DAP but not in wild-type (WT) and aterg2-1 +/- seeds. The cell death-related gene BAG6 was also transcriptionally activated in aterg2-1 +/- seeds arrested at 2.0 DAP. Chloramphenicol treatment during pollination induced a similar phenotype and gene expression pattern but showed no transcriptional changes of ANAC017 in WT. These results suggested that AtERG2 promotes early seed development by affecting the maturation of the mitochondria ribosome small subunit and mitochondrial protein translation in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome Bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has become the standard method for interrogating plant methylomes at base resolution. However, deep WGBS measurements remain cost prohibitive for large, complex genomes and for population-level studies. As a result, most published plant methylomes are sequenced far below saturation, with a large proportion of cytosines having either missing data or insufficient coverage. Here we present METHimpute, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based imputation algorithm for the analysis of WGBS data. Unlike existing methods, METHimpute enables the construction of complete methylomes by inferring the methylation status and level of all cytosines in the genome regardless of coverage. Application of METHimpute to maize, rice and Arabidopsis shows that the algorithm infers cytosine-resolution methylomes with high accuracy from data as low as 6X, compared to data with 60X, thus making it a cost-effective solution for large-scale studies. Although METHimpute has been extensively tested in plants, it should be broadly applicable to other species.",

Here we quantify bleaching and Symbiodinium photosynthetic performance of Siderastrea siderea from two reef zones after long-term exposure to thermal and CO2-acidification stress. Molecular response of in hospite Symbiodinium to these stressors was interrogated with RNAseq. Elevated temperatures reduced photosynthetic efficiency, which was highly correlated with bleaching status. However, photosynthetic efficiencies of forereef symbionts were more negatively affected by thermal stress than nearshore symbionts, indicating greater thermal tolerance in nearshore corals. At control temperatures, CO2-acidification had little effect on symbiont physiology, although forereef symbionts exhibited greater photosynthetic efficiencies than nearshore symbionts. Transcriptome profiling revealed that S. siderea were dominated by clade C Symbiodinium, except under thermal stress, which caused shifts to thermotolerant clade D. Comparative transcriptomics of conserved genes across symbiotic partners revealed few differentially expressed Symbiodinium genes when compared to corals. Instead of responding to stress, clade C transcriptomes varied by reef zone, with forereef Symbiodinium exhibiting enrichment of genes associated with photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that functional variation in photosynthetic architecture exists between forereef and nearshore Symbiodinium populations.",

    "abstract": "Natural populations display a variety of spatial arrangements, each potentially with a distinctive impact on genetic diversity and genetic differentiation among subpopulations. Although the spatial arrangement of populations can lead to intricate migration networks, theoretical developments have focused mainly on a small subset of such networks, emphasizing the island-migration and stepping-stone models. In this study, we investigate all small network motifs: the set of all possible migration networks among populations subdivided into at most four subpopulations. For each motif, we use coalescent theory to derive expectations for three quantities that describe genetic variation: nucleotide diversity, FST, and half-time to equilibrium diversity. We describe the impact of network properties on these quantities, finding that motifs with a large mean node degree have the largest nucleotide diversity and the longest time to equilibrium, whereas motifs with small density have the largest FST. In addition, we show that the motifs whose pattern of variation is most strongly influenced by loss of a connection or a subpopulation are those that can be split easily into several disconnected components. We illustrate our results using two example datasets--sky island birds of genus Brachypteryx and Indian tigers--identifying disturbance scenarios that produce the greatest reduction in genetic diversity; for tigers, we also compare the benefits of two assisted gene flow scenarios. Our results have consequences for understanding the effect of geography on genetic diversity and for designing strategies to alter population migration networks to maximize genetic variation in the context of conservation of endangered species.",

    "abstract": "Hop1 is a component of the meiosis-specific chromosome axis and belongs to the evolutionarily conserved family of HORMA domain proteins. Hop1 and its orthologs in higher eukaryotes are a major factor in promoting double-strand DNA break formation and inter-homolog recombination. In budding yeast and mammals they are also involved in a meiotic checkpoint kinase cascade monitoring the completion of double-strand DNA break repair. We used the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which lacks a canonical synaptonemal complex to test whether Hop1 has a role beyond supporting the generation of double-strand DNA breaks and facilitating inter-homolog recombination events. We determined how mutants of homologous recombination factors genetically interact with hop1, studied the role(s) of the HORMA domain of Hop1, and characterized a bio-informatically predicted interactor of Hop1, Aho1 (SPAC688.03c). Our observations indicate that in fission yeast, Hop1 does require its HORMA domain to support wild-type levels of meiotic recombination and localization to meiotic chromatin. Furthermore, we show that hop1{Delta} only weakly interacts genetically with mutants of homologous recombination factors, and in fission yeast likely has no major role beyond break formation and promoting inter-homolog events. We speculate that after the evolutionary loss of the synaptonemal complex, Hop1 likely has become less important for modulating recombination outcome during meiosis in fission yeast, and that this led to a concurrent rewiring of genetic pathways controlling meiotic recombination.",

AbstractTCTP is a highly conserved protein ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. Studies have reported TCTP to be involved in growth and development, cell cycle progression, protection against cellular stresses and apoptosis, indicating the multifunctional role of the protein. Here, for the first time we characterize the expression and function of TCTP in the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei. We identified two paralogue TCTP genes, which we named TbTCTP1 and TbTCTP2. They have identical 5UTRs and only ten single nucleotide polymorphisms in the open reading frames (ORFs). However, the 3UTRs differ dramatically in sequence and length. We found that the two TCTP mRNAs are differentially expressed during T. brucei life cycle. While procyclic form trypanosomes (PCF) express TCTP1, the bloodstream form trypanosomes (BSF), express TCTP2. We link the differential expression to the distinct 3UTRs of the paralogues. In PCF cells, the protein appears to localize in the cytosol. We show that TCTP1 is essential for normal cell growth and has pleiotropic effects on the cells including aberrant cell morphology, enlarged and reduced number of acidocalcisomes and appearance of accumulations in the mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics is increasingly popular for the study of many pathogens. For the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, both targeted and untargeted metabolite detection has improved our understanding of pathogenesis, host-parasite interactions, and antimalarial drug treatment and resistance. However, purification and analysis procedures for performing metabolomics on intracellular pathogens have not been explored. Here, we investigate the impact of host contamination on the metabolome when preparing samples using standard methods. We purified in vitro grown ring stage intra-erythrocytic P. falciparum parasites for untargeted metabolomics studies; the small size of this developmental stage amplifies the challenges associated with metabolomics studies as the ratio between host and parasite biomass is maximized. Following metabolite identification and data preprocessing, we investigated whether host contributions could be corrected post hoc using various normalization approaches (including double stranded DNA, total protein, or parasite number). We conclude that normalization parameters have large effects on differential abundance analysis and recommend the thoughtful selection of these parameters. However, normalization does not remove the contribution from the parasites extracellular environment (culture media and host erythrocyte). In fact, we found that extra-parasite material is as influential on the metabolome as treatment with a potent antimalarial drug with known metabolic effects (artemisinin). Because of this influence, we could not detect significant changes associated with drug treatment. Instead, we identified metabolites predictive of host and media contamination that can be used to assess sample purification. Our findings provide a basis for development of improved experimental and analytical methods for future metabolomics studies of intracellular organisms.",

We had previously shown that Ser65-phosphorylation results in a conformational change, in which Ub adopts a dynamic equilibrium between the known, common Ub conformation and a distinct, second conformation in which the last {beta}-strand is retracted to extend the Ser65 loop and shorten the C-terminal tail. We here show using Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) NMR experiments, that a similar, C-terminally retracted (Ub-CR) conformation exists in wild-type Ub. Ub point mutations in the moving {beta}5-strand and in neighbouring strands shift the Ub/Ub-CR equilibrium. This enabled functional studies of the two states, and we show that the Ub-CR conformation binds to the PINK1 kinase domain through its extended Ser65 loop and is a superior PINK1 substrate. Together our data suggest that PINK1 utilises a lowly populated yet more suitable Ub-CR conformation of Ub for efficient phosphorylation. Our findings could be relevant for many kinases that phosphorylate residues in folded proteins or domains.",

This approach identifies a critical step in the transformation of temperature representation between the sensory trigeminal ganglia and the hindbrain: A simple sustained trigeminal stimulus representation is transformed into a representation of absolute temperature as well as temperature changes in the hindbrain that explains the observed motor output. An activity constrained dynamic circuit model captures the most prominent aspects of these sensori-motor transformations and predicts both behavior and neural activity in response to novel heat stimuli.

    "abstract": "Numerous Zika virus vaccines are being developed. However, identifying sites to evaluate the efficacy of a Zika virus vaccine is challenging due to the general decrease in Zika virus activity. We compare results from three different modeling approaches to estimate areas that may have increased relative risk of Zika virus transmission during 2017. The analysis focused on eight priority countries (i.e., Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, and Peru). The models projected low incidence rates during 2017 for all locations in the priority countries but identified several subnational areas that may have increased relative risk of Zika virus transmission in 2017. Given the projected low incidence of disease, the total number of participants, number of study sites, or duration of study follow-up may need to be increased to meet the efficacy study endpoints.",

However, major questions remain regarding the identity of somatic progenitor cells and the transcriptional events driving cell differentiation. Using time course single cell RNA sequencing on XY mouse gonads during sex determination, we identified a single population of somatic progenitor cells prior sex determination. A subset of these progenitors differentiate into Sertoli cells, a process characterized by a highly dynamic genetic program consisting of sequential waves of gene expression. Another subset of multipotent cells maintains their progenitor state but undergo significant transcriptional changes that restrict their competence towards a steroidogenic fate required for the differentiation of fetal Leydig cells.

    "abstract": "Coding variants represent many of the strongest associations between genotype and phenotype, however they exhibit inter-individual differences in effect, known as variable penetrance. In this work, we study how cis-regulatory variation modifies the penetrance of coding variants in their target gene. Using functional genomic and genetic data from GTEx, we observed that in the general population, purifying selection has depleted haplotype combinations that lead to higher penetrance of pathogenic coding variants. Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of haplotype combinations that lead to higher penetrance of pathogenic coding variants in disease implicated genes, which provides direct evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of causal coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated that a regulatory variant can modify the penetrance of a coding variant by introducing a Mendelian SNP using CRISPR/Cas9 on distinct expression haplotypes and using the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout. Our results demonstrate that joint effects of regulatory and coding variants are an important part of the genetic architecture of human traits, and contribute to modified penetrance of disease-causing variants.",

    "abstract": "Structural variation, including large deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations, and other rearrangements, is common in human and cancer genomes. A number of methods have been developed to identify structural variants from Illumina short-read sequencing data. However, reliable identification of structural variants remains challenging because many variants have breakpoints in repetitive regions of the genome and thus are difficult to identify with short reads. The recently developed linked-read sequencing technology from 10X Genomics combines a novel barcoding strategy with Illumina sequencing. This technology labels all reads that originate from a small number (~5-10) DNA molecules ~50Kbp in length with the same molecular barcode. These barcoded reads contain long-range sequence information that is advantageous for identification of structural variants. We present Novel Adjacency Identification with Barcoded Reads (NAIBR), an algorithm to identify structural variants in linked-read sequencing data. NAIBR predicts novel adjacencies in a individual genome resulting from structural variants using a probabilistic model that combines multiple signals in barcoded reads. We show that NAIBR outperforms several existing methods for structural variant identification - including two recent methods that also analyze linked-reads - on simulated sequencing data and 10X whole-genome sequencing data from the NA12878 human genome and the HCC1954 breast cancer cell line. Several of the novel somatic structural variants identified in HCC1954 overlap known cancer genes.",

    "abstract": "Drpl is a dynamin GTPase important for mitochondrial and peroxisomal division. Drp1 oligomerization and mitochondrial recruitment are regulated by multiple factors, including interaction with mitochondrial receptors such as Mff, MiD49, MiD51 and Fis. In addition, both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and actin filaments play positive roles in mitochondrial division, but mechanisms for their roles are poorly defined. Here, we find that a population of Drp1 oligomers is ER-associated in mammalian cells, and is distinct from mitochondrial or peroxisomal Drp1 populations. Sub-populations of Mff and Fis1, which are tail-anchored proteins, also localize to ER. Drp1 oligomers assemble on ER, from which they can transfer to mitochondria. Suppression of Mff or inhibition of actin polymerization through the formin INF2 significantly reduces all Drp1 oligomer populations (mitochondrial, peroxisomal, ER-bound) and mitochondrial division, while Mff targeting to ER has a stimulatory effect on division. Our results suggest that ER can function as a platform for Drp1 oligomerization, and that ER-associated Drp1 contributes to mitochondrial division.\\n\\nSummaryAssembly of the dynamin GTPase Drp1 into constriction-competent oligomers is a key event in mitochondrial division.

    "abstract": "Genetic contributions of Neanderthals to the modern human genome have been evidenced by comparative analyses of present-day human genomes and paleogenomes. Current data indicate that Neanderthal introgression is higher in Asians and Europeans and lower in African lines of descent. Neanderthal signatures in extant human genomes are attributed to intercrosses between Neanderthals and ancient Homo sapiens lineages, or archaic Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH) that migrated from Africa into the Middle East and Europe in the last 50,000 years. It has been proposed however that there is no contribution of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA to contemporary human genomes. Here we show that the modern human mitochondrial genome might contains potential 66 Neanderthal signatures, or Neanderthal single nucleotide variants (N-SNVs) being 36 in coding regions (7 nonsynonymous), 5 in SSU rRNA, 4 in LSU rRNA, 3 in tRNAs and 18 in the D-loop. Also, 7 N-SNVs are associated with traits such as cycling vomiting syndrome and Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases and 2 N-SNVs associated with intelligence quotient. Based on our results with bootscan recombination tests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the complete absence of these N-SNVs in 41 archaic AMH mitogenomes recombination events cannot explain the presence of N-SNVs in present-day human mitogenomes. These results suggest that homoplasies alone and convergent evolution can explain N-SNVs. Our data also shows that African mtDNAs have Neanderthal SNVs as has been suggested for nuclear genome. Based on our data we conclude that most intercrosses might have occurred between Neanderthal males and archaic AMH females, crosses between archaic AMH males and Neanderthal females would be extremely rare and recombination was negligible, which explains the few Neanderthal marks (66 out of 16,569bp) in present day mitochondrial genomes of human populations. These 66 signatures are probably the result of homoplasies and convergent evolution.",

    "abstract": "We construct genomic predictors for heritable and extremely complex human quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational attainment) using modern methods in high dimensional statistics (i.e., machine learning). Replication tests show that these predictors capture, respectively, ~40, 20, and 9 percent of total variance for the three traits. For example, predicted heights correlate ~0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the \\\"missing heritability\\\" problem - i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The ~20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes. We also use other datasets and SNPs found in earlier GWAS for out-of-sample validation of our results.",

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for detecting the location of cells from two-photon calcium imaging data. In our framework, multiple coupled active contours evolve, guided by a model-based cost function, to identify cell boundaries. An active contour seeks to partition a local region into two subregions, a cell interior and ex-terior, in which all pixels have maximally  similar time courses. This simple, local model allows contours to be evolved predominantly independently. When contours are sufficiently close, their evolution is coupled, in a manner that permits overlap. We illustrate the ability of the proposed method to demix overlapping cells on real data. The proposed framework is flexible, incorporating no prior information regarding a cells morphology or stereotypical temporal activity, which enables the detection of cells with diverse properties. We demonstrate algorithm performance on a challenging mouse in vitro dataset, containing synchronously spiking cells, and a manually labelled mouse in vivo dataset, on which ABLE achieves a 67.5% success rate.\\n\\nSignificance statementTwo-photon calcium imaging enables the study of brain activity during learning and behaviour at single-cell resolution. To decode neuronal spiking activity from the data, algorithms are first required to detect the location of cells in the video. It is still common for scientists to perform this task manually, as the heterogeneity in cell shape and frequency of cellular overlap impede automatic segmentation algorithms. We developed a versatile algorithm based on a popular image segmentation approach (the Level Set Method) and demonstrated its capability to overcome these challenges. We include no assumptions on cell shape or stereotypical temporal activity. This lends our framework the flexibility to be applied to new datasets with minimal adjustment.",
