    "abstract": "Cellular information processing is generally attributed to the complex networks of genes and proteins that regulate cell behavior. It is still unclear, however, what are the main features of those networks that allow a cell to encode and interpret its ever changing environment. Here we address this question by studying the computational capabilities of the transcriptional regulatory networks of five evolutionary distant organisms. We identify in all cases a cyclic recurrent structure, formed by a small core of genes, that is essential for dynamical encoding and information integration. The recent history of the cell is encoded by the transient dynamics of this recurrent reservoir of nodes, while the rest of the network forms a readout layer devoted to decode and interpret the high-dimensional dynamical state of the recurrent core. This separation of roles allows for the integration of temporal information, while facilitating the learning of new environmental conditions and preventing catastrophic interference between those new inputs and the previously stored information. This resembles the reservoir-computing paradigm recently proposed in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Our results reveal that gene regulatory networks act as echo-state networks that perform optimally in standard memory-demanding tasks, and confirms that most of their memory resides in the recurrent reservoir. We also show that the readout layer can learn to decode the information stored in the reservoir via standard evolutionary strategies. Our work thus suggests that recurrent dynamics is a key element for the processing of complex time-dependent information by cells.\\n\\nSummaryCells must monitor the dynamics of their environment continuously, in order to adapt to present conditions and anticipate future changes. But anticipation requires processing temporal information, which in turn requires memory. Here we propose that cells can perform such dynamical information processing via the reservoir computing paradigm. According to this concept, a structure with recurrent (cyclic) paths, known as the reservoir, stores in its dynamics a record of the cells recent history. A much simpler feedforward structure then reads and decodes that information. We show that the transcriptional gene regulatory networks of five evolutionary distant organisms are organized in this manner, allowing them to store complex time-dependent signals entering the cell in a biologically realistic manner.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale knowledge bases and models become increasingly important to systematise and interpret empirical knowledge on cellular systems. In signalling networks, as opposed to metabolic networks, distinct modifications of and bonds between components combine into very large numbers of possible configurations, or microstates. These are essentially never measured in vivo, making explicit modelling strategies both impractical and problematic. Here, we present rxncon 2.0, the second generation rxncon language, as a tool to define signal transduction networks at the level of empirical data. By expressing both reactions and contingencies (contextual constraints on reactions) in terms of elemental states, both the combinatorial complexity and the discrepancy to empirical data can be minimised. It works as a higher-level language natural to biologists, which can be compiled into a range of graphical formats or executable models. Taken together, the rxncon language combines mechanistic precision with scalability in a composable and compilable language, that is designed for building executable knowledge bases on the molecular biology of signalling systems.",

    "abstract": "Quaking RNA binding protein (RBP) isoforms arise from a single Quaking gene, and bind the same RNA motif to regulate splicing, stability, decay, and localization of a large set of RNAs. However, the mechanisms by which the expression of this single gene is controlled to distribute appropriate amounts of each Quaking isoform to regulate such disparate gene expression processes are unknown. Here we explore the separate mechanisms that regulate expression of two isoforms, Quaking-5 (Qk5) and Quaking-6 (Qk6), in mouse muscle cells. We first demonstrate that Qk5 and Qk6 proteins have distinct functions in splicing and translation respectively, enforced primarily through differential subcellular localization. Using isoform-specific depletion, we find both Qk5 and Qk6 act through cis and trans post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms on their own and each others transcripts, creating a network of auto- and cross-regulatory controls. Qk5 has a major role in nuclear RNA stability and splicing, whereas Qk6 acts through translational regulation. In different cell types the cross-regulatory influences discovered here generate a spectrum of Qk5/Qk6 ratios subject to additional cell type and developmental controls. These unexpectedly complex feedback loops underscore the importance of the balance of Qk isoforms, especially where they are key regulators of development and cancer.",

The pure single model accuracy estimation methods outperform quasi-single (ModFOLD6 variations) and consensus methods (Pcons, ModFOLDclust2, Pcomb-domain and Wallner) in model selection, but are still not as good as those methods in absolute model quality estimation and predictions of local quality.

The key issue is that since parental lines were not available, might the reported variants have been inherited? To expand upon the limited available whole genome data on whether CRISPR-edited mice show more genetic variation, whole-genome sequencing was performed on two other mouse lines that had undergone a CRISPR-editing procedure. Again, parents were not available for either the Capn5 nor Fblim1 CRISPR-edited mouse lines, so strain controls were examined. Additionally, we also include verification of variants detected in the initial mouse line. Taken together, these whole-genome-sequencing-level results support the idea that in specific cases, CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations.",

    "abstract": "Dormancy is a bet-hedging strategy that allows organisms to persist through conditions that are sub-optimal for growth and reproduction by entering a reversible state of reduced metabolic activity. Dormancy allows a population to maintain a reservoir of genetic and phenotypic diversity (i.e., a seed bank) that can contribute to the long-term survival of a population. This strategy can be potentially adaptive and has long been of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. However, comparatively little is known about how dormancy influences the fundamental evolutionary forces of genetic drift, mutation, selection, recombination, and gene flow. Here, we investigate how seed banks affect the processes underpinning evolution by reviewing existing theory, implementing novel simulations, and determining how and when dormancy can influence evolution as a population genetic process. We extend our analysis to examine how seed banks can alter macroevolutionary processes, including rates of speciation and extinction. Through the lens of population genetic theory, we can understand the extent that seed banks influence microbial evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the causative agent of malaria has an iron-sulfur cluster-containing class I fumarate hydratase (FH) that catalyzes the interconversion of fumarate to malate, a well-known reaction in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In humans, the same reaction is catalyzed by class II FH that has no sequence or structural homology with the class I enzyme. Fumarate, generated in large quantities in the parasite as a byproduct of AMP synthesis is converted to malate by the action of FH, and subsequently used in the generation of the key metabolites oxaloacetate, aspartate and pyruvate. Here we report on the kinetic characterization of purified recombinant PfFH, functional complementation of fh deficiency in Escherichia coli and mitochondrial localization in the parasite. The substrate analog, mercaptosuccinic acid was found to be a potent inhibitor of PfFH with a Ki value in the nanomolar range. Knockout of the fh gene was not possible in P. berghei when drug-selection of the transfectants was performed in BALB/c mice while the gene was amenable to knockout when C57BL/6 mice were used as host, thereby indicating mouse-strain dependent essentiality of the fh gene to the parasite.",

    "abstract": "The joint analysis of species evolutionary relatedness and their morphological evolution has offered much promise in understanding the processes that underpin the generation of biological diversity. Disparity through time (DTT) is a popular method that estimates the relative trait disparity within and between subclades at each time point, and compares this to the null hypothesis that trait values follow an uncorrelated random walk along the time calibrated phylogenetic tree. A simulation envelope is normally created by calculating, at every time point, the 95% minimum and 95% maximum disparity values from multiple simulations of the null model on the phylogenetic tree. The null hypothesis is rejected whenever the empirical DTT curve falls outside of this envelope, and these time periods may then be linked to events that may have sparked non-random trait evolution. However, this method of envelope construction leads to multiple testing and a poor, uncontrolled, false positive rate. As a consequence it cannot be recommended. A recently developed method in spatial statistics is introduced that constructs a confidence envelope by giving each DTT curve a single ranking value based upon its most extreme disparity value. This method avoids the pitfalls of multiple testing whilst retaining a visual interpretation. Results using simulated data show this new test has desirable type 1 properties and is at least as powerful in correctly rejecting the null hypothesis as the morphological disparity index and node height test that lack a visual interpretation. Three example datasets are reanalyzed to show how the new test may lead to different inferences being drawn. Overall the results suggest the new rank envelope test should be used in null model testing for DTT analyses, and that there is no need to combine the envelope test with other tests such as has been done previously. Moreover, the rank envelope method can easily be adopted into recently developed posterior predictive simulation methods. More generally, the rank envelope test should be adopted when-ever a null model produces a vector of correlated values and the user wants to determine where the empirical data is different to the null model.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for 240,000 - 460,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age each year. Accurate identification of pneumococcal serotypes is important for tracking the distribution and evolution of serotypes following the introduction of effective vaccines. Recent efforts have been made to infer serotypes directly from genomic data but current software approaches are limited and do not scale well. Here, we introduce a novel method, SeroBA, which uses a hybrid assembly and mapping approach. We compared SeroBA against real and simulated data and present results on the concordance and computational performance against a validation dataset, the robustness and scalability when analysing a large dataset, and the impact of varying the depth of coverage in the cps locus region on sequence-based serotyping. SeroBA can predict serotypes, by identifying the cps locus, directly from raw whole genome sequencing read data with 98% concordance using a k-mer based method, can process 10,000 samples in just over 1 day using a standard server and can call serotypes at a coverage as low as 10x.

    "abstract": "Medium to large phylogenetic gene trees constructed from datasets of different species density and taxonomic range are rarely topologically consistent because of missing phylogenetic signal, non-phylogenetic signal and error. In this study, we first use simulations to show that taxon sampling unequally affects nodes in a gene tree, which likely contributes to controversial conclusions from taxon sampling experiments and contradicting species phylogenies such as for the boreoeutherians. Hence, because it is unlikely that a large gene tree can be reconstructed correctly based on a single optimized dataset, we take a two-step approach for the construction of model gene trees. First, stable and unstable clades are identified by comparing phylogenetic trees inferred from multiple datasets and data types (nucleotide, amino acid, codon) from the same gene family. Subsequently, data subsets are optimized for the analysis of individual uncertain clades. Results are summarized in form of a model tree that illustrates the evolutionary relationship of gene loci. A case study shows how a seemingly complex gene phylogeny becomes increasingly consistent with the reference species tree by attentive taxon sampling and subtree analysis. The procedure is progressively introduced to SwissTree (http://swisstree.vital-it.ch), a resource of high confidence model gene (locus) trees. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of SwissTree for orthology benchmarking.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are important contributors to gene regulation. They specifically bind to short DNA stretches known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), which are contained in regulatory regions (e.g. promoters), and thereby influence a target genes expression level. Computational biology has contributed substantially to understanding regulatory regions by developing numerous tools, including for discovering de novo motif. While those tools primarily focus on determining and studying TFBSs, the surrounding sequence context is often given less attention. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by adopting a so-called convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (cRBM) that captures redundant features from the DNA sequences. The model uses an unsupervised learning approach to derive a rich, yet interpretable, description of the entire sequence context. We evaluated the cRBM on a range of publicly available ChIP-seq peak regions and investigated its capability to summarize heterogeneous sets of regulatory sequences in comparison with MEME-Chip, a popular motif discovery tool. In summary, our method yields a considerably more accurate description of the sequence composition than MEME-Chip, providing both a summary of strong TF motifs as well as subtle low-complexity features.",

We conducted a long-term chemostat experiment where the marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus was challenged with a lytic phage under nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) limitation. This manipulation of nutrient stoichiometry altered the stability of host-parasite interactions and the underlying mode of coevolution. By assessing infectivity with >18,000 pairwise challenges, we documented directional selection for increased phage resistance, consistent with arms-race dynamics while phage infectivity fluctuated through time, as expected when coevolution is driven by negative frequency-dependent selection. The resulting infection networks were 50 % less modular under N-versus P-limitation reflecting host-range contraction and asymmetric coevolutionary trajectories.

    "abstract": "The visual system is characterized by a strict topographic organization from the retina towards multiple layers of synaptic integration. Recent studies in Drosophila have shown that in the transition from the optic lobes to the central brain, due to convergence of columnar neurons onto optic glomeruli, distinct synaptic units employed in the computation of different visual features, the retinotopic representation is lost in these circuits. However, functional imaging revealed a spatial representation of visual cues in the Drosophila central complex, raising the question about the underlying circuitry, which bypasses optic glomerulus convergence.\\n\\nWhile characterizing afferent arborizations within Drosophila visual glomeruli, we discovered a spatial segregation of topographic and non-topographic projections from distinct molecular classes of medulla projection neurons, medullo-tubercular (MeTu) neurons, into a specific central brain glomerulus, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu). Single cell analysis revealed that topographic information is organized by ensembles of MeTu neurons (type 1), forming parallel channels within the AOTu, while a separate class of MeTu neurons (type 2) displays convergent projection, associated with a loss of spatial resolution. MeTu afferents in the AOTu synapse onto a matching topographic field of output projection neurons, these tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons relay visual information towards dendritic fields of central complex ring neurons in the bulb neuropil. Within the bulb, neuronal proximity of the topographic AOTu map as well as channel identity is maintained despite the absence of a stereotyped map organization, providing the structural basis for spatial representation of visual information in the central complex (CX). TuBu neurons project onto dendritic fields of efferent ring neurons, where distinct sectors of the bulb correspond to a distinct ring domain in the ellipsoid body. We found a stereotypic circuitry for each analyzed TuBu class, thus the individual channels of peripheral topography are maintained in the central complex structure. Together with previous data showing rough topography within the lobula AOTu domain, our results on the organization of medulla projection neurons define the AOTu neuropil as the main relay station for spatial information from the optic lobes into the central brain.",

Based on this placement, we identify a massive gene loss thus far attributed to the nematodes which predates their split from the tardigrades. We provide a comprehensive catalog of protein domain expansions linked to stress response and show that previously identified tardigrade-unique proteins are erratically distributed across the genome of M. tardigradum. We further suggest alternative pathways to cope with high stress levels that are yet unexplored in tardigrades and further promote the phylum Tardigrada as a rich source of stress protection genes and mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a multifactorial disease that associates apoptosis, senescence and calcification of cartilage cells, inflammatory response and alterations in the extracellular matrix. Previous documents imply that estrogen and miR-221 may be involved in IDD. This study further investigated their regulatory mechanisms underlying IDD. Normal and degenerated cartilaginous endplates (CEP) tissues were isolated surgically from juvenile patients with idiopathic scoliosis and adult patients with IDD, respectively. PCR and western blot assays showed decreased aggrecan, Col2A1, TGF-{beta} and estrogen receptor (ER) levels in CEP, but increased MMP-3, adamts-5, IL-1{beta}, TNF-, IL-6 and miR-221 levels. CEP cells were harvested from degenerated CEP tissues and treated with doses of 17{beta}-E2. 17{beta}-E2 increased expression of aggrecan and Col2A1 levels in endplate chondrocytes and secretion of TGF-{beta}, but decreased IL-6 secretion. Moreover, 17{beta}-E2 inhibited the apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1, improving the cell viability. These data indicated estrogen confers protective effect against IDD. However, we found that ER was a target of miR-221 via luciferase assay. miR-221 up-regulation via the mimics or ER knockdown attenuated these protective effects conferred by estrogen, while intervention of miR-221 via the inhibitors promoted the protective effects. This study provided novel evidence that estrogen confers protective effects of CEP against IDD, however, up-regulated miR-221 in degenerated CEP decreased the protective effects via targeting ER, thus it may be an important cause for IDD.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of T cell functions seems to be closely linked to the reprogramming of the metabolic pathway. However, the impact of metabolic changes on the differentiation of helper T cell subsets remains unclear. We found that TCR-mediated activation of glutamine metabolism regulates Th2 cell differentiation via the supplementation of -ketogulutalate (-KG) and histone H3K27 demethylation. Deprivation of glutamine or pharmacological inhibition of glutamine metabolism blocks the induction of Th2 cell differentiation without affecting Stat6 phosphorylation. The methylation status of H3K27 at the Th2 cytokine gene locus was significantly increased in Th2 cells cultured under glutamine-deprived conditions. The inhibitory effect of glutamine-deprivation was antagonized by -KG, and the -KG-dependent induction of Th2 cell differentiation was reduced in utx- and jmjd3-deficient naive CD4 T cells. These findings show that the glutamine-a-ketoglutarate axis is crucial to regulating the epigenetic status at the Th2 cytokine gene locus and subsequent Th2 cell differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Negative feedback is known to endow biological and man-made systems with robust performance in the face of uncertainties and disturbances. To date, synthetic biological feedback circuits have relied upon protein-based, transcriptional regulation to control circuit output. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules which can inhibit translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In this paper, we designed, modelled and built two synthetic negative feedback circuits that use rationally-designed sRNAs for the first time. The first circuit builds upon the well characterised tet-based autorepressor, incorporating an externally-inducible sRNA to tune the effective feedback strength. This allows more precise fine-tuning of the circuit output in contrast to the sigmoidal input-output response of the autorepressor alone. In the second circuit, the output is a transcription factor that induces expression of an sRNA which negatively regulates the translation of the mRNA encoding this output, creating direct, closed-loop, negative feedback. Analysis of the noise profiles of both circuits showed that the use of sRNAs did not result in large increases in noise. Stochastic and deterministic modelling of both circuits agreed well with experimental data. Finally, simulations using fitted parameters allowed dynamic attributes of each circuit such as response time and disturbance rejection to be investigated.",

Here, we propose a new biophysical mechanism that can establish and maintain robust yet plastic epigenetic domains via genomic bookmarking (GBM). We model chromatin as a recolourable polymer whose segments bear non-permanent histone marks (or colours) which can be modified by \\\"writer\\\" proteins. The three-dimensional chromatin organisation is mediated by protein bridges, or \\\"readers\\\", such as Polycomb Repressive Complexes and Transcription Factors. The coupling between readers and writers drives spreading of biochemical marks and sustains the memory of local chromatin states across replication and mitosis. In contrast, GBM-targeted perturbations destabilise the epigenetic patterns. Strikingly, we demonstrate that GBM alone can explain the full distribution of Polycomb marks in a whole Drosophila chromosome. We finally suggest that our model provides a starting point for an understanding of the biophysics of cellular differentiation and reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdentification of functional elements of a genome often requires dividing a sequence of measurements along a genome into segments where adjacent segments have different properties, such as different mean values. This problem is often called the segmentation problem in the field of genomics, and the change-point problem in other scientific disciplines. Despite dozens of algorithms developed to address this problem in genomics research, methods with improved accuracy and speed are still needed to effectively tackle both existing and emerging genomic and epigenomic segmentation problems.\\n\\nResultsWe designed an efficient algorithm, called iSeg, for segmentation of genomic and epigenomic profiles. iSeg first utilizes dynamic programming to identify candidate segments and test for significance. It then uses a novel data structure based on two coupled balanced binary trees to detect overlapping significant segments and update them simultaneously during searching and refinement stages. Refinement and merging of significant segments are performed at the end to generate the final set of segments. By using an objective function based on the p-values of the segments, the algorithm can serve as a general computational framework to be combined with different assumptions on the distributions of the data. As a general segmentation method, it can segment different types of genomic and epigenomic data, such as DNA copy number variation, nucleosome occupancy, nuclease sensitivity, and differential nuclease sensitivity data. Using simple t-tests to compute p-values across multiple datasets of different types, we evaluate iSeg using both simulated and experimental datasets and show that it performs satisfactorily when compared with some other popular methods, which often employ more sophisticated statistical models. Implemented in C++, iSeg is also very computationally efficient, well suited for large numbers of input profiles and data with very long sequences.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have developed an effective and efficient general-purpose segmentation tool for sequential data and illustrated its use in segmentation of genomic and epigenomic profiles.",

To our knowledge, all the approaches developed so far for detecting such shifts from a quantitative character strongly involved stochastic models of evolution.\\n\\nWe propose here a novel method based on an asymmetric version of the linear parsimony (aka Wagner parsimony) for identifying the most parsimonious split of a tree into two parts between which the evolution of the character is allowed to differ. To this end, we evaluate the cost of splitting a phylogenetic tree at a given node as the integral, over all pairs of asymmetry parameters, of the most parsimonious cost which can be achieved by using the first parameter on the subtree pending from this node and the second parameter elsewhere. By testing all the nodes, we then get the most parsimonious split of a tree with regard to the character values at its tips.\\n\\nA study of the partial costs of the tree enabled us to develop a polynomial algorithm for determining the most parsimonious splits and their evolutionary costs. Applying this algorithm on two toy examples shows that using more than one asymmetry parameter does not always lower parsimonious costs. By using the approach on biological datasets, we obtained splits consistent with those identified by previous stochastic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Among many organisms, offspring are constrained to occur at sites adjacent to their parents. This applies to plants and animals with limited dispersal ability, to colonies of microbes in biofilms, and to other genetically heterogeneous aggregates of cells, such as cancerous tumors. The spatial structure of such populations leads to greater relatedness among proximate individuals while increasing the genetic divergence between distant individuals. In this study, we analyze a Moran coa-lescent in a one-dimensional spatial model where a randomly selected individual dies and is replaced by the progeny of an adjacent neighbor in every generation. We derive a recursive system of equations using the spatial distance among haplotypes as a state variable to compute coalescent probabilities and coalescent times. The coalescent probabilities near the branch termini are smaller than in the unstructured Moran model (except for t = 1, where they are equal), corresponding to longer branch lengths and greater expected pairwise coalescent times. The lower terminal coalescent probabilities result from a spatial separation of lineages, i.e. a coalescent event between a haplotype and its neighbor in one spatial direction at time t cannot co-occur with a coalescent event with a haplotype in the opposite direction at t + 1. The concomitant increased pairwise genetic distance among randomly sampled haplotypes in spatially constrained populations could lead to incorrect inferences of recent diversifying selection or of population bottlenecks when analyzed using an unconstrained coalescent model as a null hypothesis.",

Understanding the genetic basis of these phenotypes can lead to better tools to treat patients or detect reservoirs. To identify human genetic factors that contribute to symptoms diversity, we examined the range of disease severities caused by the parasite T. b. gambiense, the primary cause of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). We analyzed the transcriptomes of immune cells from both symptomatic HAT cases and individuals with latent infections. Our analysis identified several genes and pathways that associated with the latent phenotype, primarily suggesting increased T and B cell activation in HAT patients relative to latent infections. We also used these transcriptome data to conduct an exome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study. This suggested that SNPs in the human major histocompatibility locus (HLA) associate with severity, supporting the transcription data and suggesting that T cell activation is a determining factor in outcome. Finally, to establish if T cell activation controls disease severity, we blocked co-stimulatory dependent T cell activation in an animal model for HAT. This showed that reducing T cell activation during trypanosome infection improves symptoms and reduces parasitemia. Our data has used a combination of transcriptome-wide analysis and an in vivo model to reveal that T cell activation and the HLA locus associate with the development of symptoms during HAT.

Modules have been developed to serialize the linked data (RDF) and to generate a plain text format files.\\n\\nConclusionThe main rationale for applying formalized information models is to improve the exchange of information. GBOL uses and extends current ontologies to provide a formal representation of genomic entities, along with their properties and relations. The deliberate integration of data provenance in the ontology enables review of automatically obtained genome annotations at a large scale. The GBOL stack facilitates consistent usage of the ontology.",

    "abstract": "The folding and three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin in the nucleus critically impacts genome function. The past decade has witnessed rapid advances in genomic tools for delineating 3D genome architecture. Among them, chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based methods such as Hi-C are the most widely used techniques for mapping chromatin interactions. However, traditional Hi-C protocols rely on restriction enzymes (REs) to fragment chromatin and are therefore limited in resolution. We recently developed DNase Hi-C for mapping 3D genome organization, which uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation. DNase Hi-C overcomes RE-related limitations associated with traditional Hi-C methods, leading to improved methodological resolution. Furthermore, combining this method with DNA capture technology provides a high-throughput approach (targeted DNase Hi-C) that allows for mapping fine-scale chromatin architecture at exceptionally high resolution. Hence, targeted DNase Hi-C will be valuable for delineating the physical landscapes of cis-regulatory networks that control gene expression and for characterizing phenotype-associated chromatin 3D signatures. Here, we provide a detailed description of method design and step-by-step working protocols for these two methods.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDNase Hi-C, a method for comprehensive mapping of chromatin contacts on a whole-genome scale, is based on random chromatin fragmentation by DNase I digestion instead of sequence-specific restriction enzyme (RE) digestion.\\nC_LIO_LITargeted DNase Hi-C, which combines DNase Hi-C with DNA capture technology, is a high-throughput method for mapping fine-scale chromatin architecture of genomic loci of interest at a resolution comparable to that of genomic annotations of functional elements.\\nC_LIO_LIDNase Hi-C and targeted DNase Hi-C provide the first high-throughput way to overcome the RE-digestion-associated resolution limit of 3C-based methods.\\nC_LIO_LIStep-by-step whole-genome and targeted DNase Hi-C protocols for mapping global and local 3D genome architecture, respectively, are described.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Learning from rewards and punishments is essential to survival, and facilitates flexible human behavior. It is widely appreciated that multiple cognitive and reinforcement learning systems contribute to behavior, but the nature of their interactions is elusive. Here, we leverage novel methods for extracting trial-by-trial indices of reinforcement learning (RL) and working memory (WM) in human electroencephalography to reveal single trial computations beyond that afforded by behavior alone. Within-trial dynamics confirmed that increases in neural expectation were predictive of reduced neural surprise in the following feedback period, supporting central tenets of RL models. Cross-trial dynamics revealed a cooperative interplay between systems for learning, in which WM contributes expectations to guide RL, despite competition between systems during choice. Together, these results provide a deeper understanding of how multiple neural systems interact for learning and decision making, and facilitate analysis of their disruption in clinical populations.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryDecoding of dynamical neural signals in humans reveals cooperation between cognitive and habit learning systems.",

    "abstract": "Computational models of classical conditioning have made significant contributions to the theoretic understanding of associative learning, yet they still struggle when the temporal aspects of conditioning are taken into account. Interval timing models have contributed a rich variety of time representations and provided accurate predictions for the timing of responses, but they usually have little to say about associative learning. In this article we present a unified model of conditioning and timing that is based on the influential Rescorla-Wagner conditioning model and the more recently developed Timing Drift-Diffusion model. We test the model by simulating 10 experimental phenomena and show that it can provide an adequate account for 8, and a partial account for the other 2. We argue that the model can account for more phenomena in the chosen set than these other similar in scope models: CSC-TD, MS-TD, Learning to Time and Modular Theory. A comparison and analysis of the mechanisms in these models is provided, with a focus on the types of time representation and associative learning rule used.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHow does the time of events affect the way we learn about associations between these events? Computational models have made great contributions to our understanding of associative learning, but they usually do not perform very well when time is taken into account. Models of timing have reached high levels of accuracy in describing timed behaviour, but they usually do not have much to say about associations. A unified approach would involve combining associative learning and timing models into a single framework. This article takes just this approach. It combines the influential Rescorla-Wagner associative model with a timing model based on the Drift-Diffusion process, and shows how the resultant model can account for a number of learning and timing phenomena. The article also compares the new model to others that are similar in scope.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsThe intestinal epithelium is maintained by intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which produce post-mitotic absorptive and secretory epithelial cells. Initial fate specification toward enteroendocrine, goblet, and Paneth cell lineages is dependent on Atoh1, a master regulator of secretory differentiation. However, the origin of tuft cells, which participate in Type II immune responses to parasitic infection, is less clear and appears to occur in an Atoh1-independent manner. Here we examine the role of Sox4 in ISC proliferation and differentiation.\\n\\nMethodsWe used mice with intestinal epithelial-specific conditional knockout of Sox4 (Sox4fl/fl:vilCre; Sox4cKO) to study the role of Sox4 in the small intestine. Crypt- and single cell-derived organoids were used to assay proliferation and ISC potency between control and Sox4cKO mice. Lineage allocation and genetic consequences of Sox4 ablation were studied by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and RNA-seq. In vivo infection with helminths and in vitro cytokine treatment in primary intestinal organoids were used to assess tuft cell hyperplasia in control and Sox4cKO samples. Atoh1GFP reporter mice and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) were used to determine co-localization of SOX4 and Atoh1. Wild-type and inducible Atoh1 knockout (Atoh1fl/fl:vilCreER; Atoh1iKO) organoids carrying an inducible Sox4 overexpression vector (Sox4OE) were used to determine the role of Atoh1 in Sox4 driven secretory differentiation.\\n\\nResultsLoss of Sox4 impairs ISC function and secretory differentiation, resulting in decreased numbers of enteroendocrine and tuft cells. In wild-type mice, SOX4+ cells are significantly upregulated following helminth infection coincident with tuft cell hyperplasia. Sox4 is activated by IL13 in vitro and Sox4cKO knockout mice demonstrate impaired tuft cell hyperplasia and parasite clearance following infection with helminths. A subset of Sox4-expressing cells colocalize with Atoh1 and enteroendocrine markers by scRNA-seq, while Sox4+/Atoh1-cells correlate strongly with tuft cell populations. Gain-of-function studies in primary organoids demonstrate that Sox4 is sufficient to drive both enteroendocrine and tuft cell differentiation, and can do so in the absence of Atoh1.\\n\\nConclusionOur data demonstrate that Sox4 promotes enteroendocrine and tuft cell lineage allocation independently of Atoh1. These results challenge long-standing views of Atoh1 as the sole regulator of secretory differentiation in the intestine and are relevant for understanding host epithelial responses to parasitic infection.",

We show that CRISPR-Cas9 induced exon 2 mutations in Bicyclus anynana leads to exon skipping and ectopic eyespots on the wing. Exon 3 mutations, however, lead to null/missense transcripts, missing eyespots, lighter wing coloration, loss of scales, and a variety of other phenotypes implicating Dll in the process of eyespot differentiation. Reaction-diffusion modeling enabled exploration of the function of Dll in eyespot formation, and accurately replicated a wide-range of mutant phenotypes.

Along the fresh-brackish-saline water gradient within the C-43 canal/Caloosahatchee River estuary (CRE) the quantity, timing and distribution of water and associated water quality significantly influences ecosystem function. Long-term trends of water quality and quantity were assessed from Lake Okeechobee to the CRE between May 1978 to April 2016. Significant changes to monthly flow volumes were detected between the lake and the estuary which correspond to changes in upstream management. and climatic events. Across the 37-year period total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean (FWM) concentration significantly increased at the lake, meanwhile total nitrogen (TN) FMW concentrations significantly declined at both the lake and estuary headwaters. Between May 1999 and April 2016, TN, TP and total organic carbon (TOC), ortho-P and ammonium conditions were assessed within the estuary at several monitoring locations. Generally nutrient concentrations decreased from upstream to downstream with shifts in TN:TP from values >20 in the freshwater portion, ~20 in the estuarine portion and <20 in the marine portion indicating a spatial shift in nutrient limitations along the continuum. Aquatic productivity analysis suggests that the estuary is net heterotrophic with productivity being negatively influenced by TP, TN and TOC likely due to a combination of effects including shading by high color dissolved organic matter. We conclude that rainfall patterns, land use and the resulting discharges of run-off drives the ecology of the C-43/CRE aquatic continuum and associated biogeochemistry rather than water management associated with Lake Okeechobee.",

Integral projection models (IPMs) are data-driven models widely used to study population dynamics and life history evolution of structured populations in temporally variable environments. However, many data sets have insufficient temporal replication for the environmental drivers of vital rates to be identified with confidence, limiting their use for evaluating population level responses to environmental change.\\nC_LIO_LIParameter selection, where the kernel is constructed at each time step by randomly selecting the time-varying parameters from their joint probability distribution, is one approach to including stochasticity in IPMs. We consider a factor analytic (FA) approach for modelling the covariance matrix of time-varying parameters, whereby latent variable(s) describe the covariance among vital rate parameters. This decreases the number of parameters to estimate and, where the covariance is positive, the latent variable can be interpreted as a measure of environmental quality. We demonstrate this using simulation studies and two case studies.\\nC_LIO_LIThe simulation studies suggest the FA approach provides similarly accurate estimates of stochastic population growth rate to estimating an unstructured covariance matrix. We demonstrate how the latent parameter can be perturbed to show how selection on reproductive delays in the monocarp Carduus nutans changes under different environmental conditions. We develop a demographic model of the fire dependent herb Eryngium cuneifolium to show how a causal indicator (i.e. a driver of the changes in the environmental quality) can be incorporated with the addition of a single parameter. Using perturbation analyses we determine optimal management strategies for this species.\\nC_LIO_LIThis approach estimates fewer parameters than previous approaches and allows novel eco-evolutionary insights. Predictions on population dynamics and life history evolution under different environmental conditions can be made without necessarily identifying causal factors. Environmental drivers can be incorporated with relatively few parameters, allowing for predictions on how populations will be affected by changes to these drivers.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a common and life-threatening heart disease with no drug that can stop or delay its progression. Elucidating the genetic factors underpinning CAVS is an urgent priority to find new therapeutic targets1. Major landmarks in genetics of CAVS include the discoveries of NOTCH12 and LPA3. However, genetic variants in these genes accounted for a small number of cases and low population-attributable risk. Here we mapped a new susceptibility locus for CAVS on chromosome 1p21.2 and identified PALMD (palmdelphin) as the causal gene. PALMD was revealed using a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)4, which combines a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,009 cases and 1,017 ethnically-matched controls with the first large-scale expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping study on human aortic valve tissues (n=233). The CAVS risk alleles and increasing disease severity were both associated with lowered mRNA expression levels of PALMD in valve tissues. The top variant explained up to 12.5% of the population-attributable risk and showed similar effect and strong association with CAVS (P=1.53 x 10-10) in UK Biobank comparing 1,391 cases and 352,195 controls. The identification of PALMD as a susceptibility gene for CAVS provides new insights about the genetic nature of this disease and opens new avenues to investigate its etiology and develop much-needed therapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "Cells adapt to environmental changes, including fluctuations in oxygen levels, through the induction of specific gene expression programs. To identify genes regulated by hypoxia at the transcriptional level, we pulse-labeled HUVEC cells with 4-thiouridine and sequenced nascent transcripts. Then, we searched genome-wide binding profiles from the ENCODE project for factors that correlated with changes in transcription and identified binding of several components of the Sin3A co-repressor complex, including SIN3A, SAP30 and HDAC1/2, proximal to genes repressed by hypoxia. SIN3A interference revealed that it participates in the downregulation of 75% of the hypoxia-repressed genes in endothelial cells. Unexpectedly, it also blunted the induction of 47% of the upregulated genes, suggesting a role for this corepressor in gene induction. In agreement, ChIP-seq experiments showed that SIN3A preferentially localizes to the promoter region of actively transcribed genes and that SIN3A signal was enriched in hypoxia-repressed genes, prior exposure to the stimulus. Importantly, SINA3 occupancy was not altered by hypoxia in spite of changes in H3K27ac signal. In summary, our results reveal a prominent role for SIN3A in the transcriptional response to hypoxia and suggest a model where modulation of the associated histone deacetylase activity, rather than its recruitment, determines the transcriptional output.",

    "abstract": "The hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) neuropeptide system regulates feeding, arousal state, stress responses, and reward, especially under conditions of enhanced motivational relevance. In particular, HCRT neurotransmission facilitates drug-seeking behavior in circumstances that demand increased effort and/or motivation to take the drug. The present study used a shRNA-encoding adeno-associated viral vector to knockdown Hcrt expression throughout the dorsal hypothalamus in adult rats and determine the role of HCRT in cocaine self-administration. Longterm Hcrt silencing did not impact cocaine self-administration under short-access conditions, but robustly attenuated cocaine intake during extended self-administration access, a model that mimics key features of compulsive cocaine-taking. In addition, Hcrt silencing decreased motivation for both cocaine and palatable food (i.e., sweetened condensed milk; SCM) under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, but did not alter responding for SCM under a fixed ratio schedule. Importantly, Hcrt silencing did not affect food or water consumption, and had no consequence to general measures of arousal-dependent behaviors. At the molecular level, longterm Hcrt knockdown moderately reduced the downstream expression of dynorphin (DYN) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in the dorsal hypothalamus. These original findings support the hypothesis that HCRT neurotransmission promotes operant responding for both drug and non-drug rewards, preferentially under conditions requiring a high degree of motivation. Furthermore, the current study provides compelling evidence for the involvement of the HCRT system in cocaine self-administration also under low-effort conditions in rats allowed extended access, possibly via functional interactions with DYN and MCH signaling.",

    "abstract": "Local moment-to-moment variability exists at every level of neural organization, but its driving forces remain opaque. Based on animal work showing that within-region variability can be a primary function of synaptic input, we used fMRI to test in humans whether greater temporal variability in local brain regions was associated with higher functional network integration. We found that individuals with higher local temporal variability had a more integrated (lower-dimensional) network fingerprint, with temporal variability in the thalamus showing the strongest association with network dimensionality. Beyond animal findings showing that local variability should upregulate from thalamus to visual cortex, we found that local variability upregulated from thalamus to all structurally connected cortical targets. Critically, greater within-person thalamo-cortical upregulation was associated with higher integration in 12 of 13 examined networks. Our findings indicate that local variability primarily reflects functional integration, with the thalamus acting as a relay or modulator of variability in cortex.",

    "abstract": "Adipogenesis is facilitated by a complex signaling network requiring strict temporal and spatial organization of effector molecules. Molecular scaffolds, such as 14-3-3 proteins, coordinate such events, and we have previously identified 14-3-3{zeta} as an essential scaffold in adipocyte differentiation. The interactome of 14-3-3{zeta} is large and diverse, and it is possible that novel adipogenic factors may be present within it. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from mice over-expressing a TAP-epitope-tagged 14-3-3{zeta} molecule were generated, and following the induction of adipogenesis, TAP-14-3-3{zeta} complexes were purified, followed by mass spectrometry analysis to determine the 14-3-3{zeta} interactome. Over 100 proteins were identified as being unique to adipocyte differentiation, of which 56 were novel interacting partners. Previously established regulators of adipogenesis (ie, Ptrf/Cavin1 and Phb2) were found within the 14-3-3{zeta} interactome, confirming the ability of this approach to identify regulators of adipocyte differentiation. An enrichment of proteins in the interactome related to RNA metabolism, processing, and splicing was identified, and analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that 14-3-3{zeta} depletion in 3T3-L1 cells affected the alternative splicing of mRNA during adipocyte differentiation. Of the RNA splicing factors within the 14-3-3{zeta} interactome, depletion of Hnrnpf, Hnrnpk, Ddx6, and Sfpq by siRNA revealed essential roles of these proteins in adipogenesis and their roles in the alternative splicing of Lpin1. In summary, novel adipogenic factors can be detected within the 14-3-3{zeta} interactome, and further characterization of additional proteins within the 14-3-3{zeta} interactome has the potential of identifying novel targets to block the expansion of adipose tissue mass that occurs in obesity.",

    "abstract": "Millions of subsistence farmers cultivate crops on terraces. These farmers face unique challenges including severe shortages of arable land and remoteness leading to poor access to inputs including nitrogen fertilizer. These challenges contribute to human and livestock malnutrition. Terrace walls (risers) as a vertical surface to grow climbing or trailing legumes represents an opportunity to help overcome these challenges. These crops are rich in minerals and protein, and their associated microbes produce nitrogen fertilizer. Rice bean is already grown on terrace risers in South Asia. This paper reviews the literature concerning crops that are currently farmed on terrace walls (FTW), then surveys climbing legume species that have potential for FTW, focusing on crops that are nutritious and tolerate shade (caused by the terrace wall) and resist drought (many terrace farms experience an extended dry season). A total of 29 legume species are discussed including climbing varieties of jack bean, common bean, cowpea, winged bean, horse gram and velvet bean. The review concludes by discussing the practical challenges of farmer adoption of FTW and makes concrete recommendations. Terrace wall cultivation of legumes represents an opportunity to intensify agriculture and increase resiliency in remote mountainous areas.",

    "abstract": "Rational design and directed evolution have proved to be successful approaches to increase catalytic efficiencies of both natural and artificial enzymes1-3. However, a comprehensive understanding of how evolution shapes the energy landscape of catalysis remains a fundamental challenge. Protein dynamics is widely recognized as important, but due to the inherent flexibility of biological macromolecules it is often difficult to distinguish which conformational changes are directly related to function. Here, we used directed evolution on an impaired mutant of the human proline isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) and identify two second-shell mutations that partially restore its catalytic activity. We show both kinetically, using NMR spectroscopy, and structurally, by room-temperature X-ray crystallography, how local perturbations propagate through a large allosteric network to facilitate conformational dynamics. The increased catalysis selected for in the evolutionary screen could be rationalized entirely by accelerated interconversion between the two catalytically essential conformational sub-states, which are both captured in the high-resolution X-ray ensembles at room temperature. Our data provide a glimpse of the evolutionary trajectory of an enzymes energy landscape and shows how subtle changes can fine-tune its function.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropic effects occur when a single genetic variant independently influences multiple phenotypes. In genetic epidemiological studies, multiple endo-phenotypes or correlated traits are commonly tested separately in a univariate statistical framework to identify associations with genetic determinants. Subsequently, a simple look-up of overlapping univariate results is applied to identify pleiotropic genetic effects. However, this strategy offers limited power to detect pleiotropy. In contrast, combining correlated traits into a composite test provides a powerful approach for detecting pleiotropic genes. Here, we propose a two-stage approach to identify potential pleiotropic effects by utilizing aggregated results from large-scale genome-wide association (GWAS) meta-analyses. In the first stage, we developed two novel approaches (direct linear combining, dLC; and empirical combining, eLC) combining correlated univariate test statistics to screen potential pleiotropic variants on a genome-wide scale, using either individual-level or aggregated data. Our simulations indicated that dLC and eLC outperform other popular multivariate approaches (such as principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), canonical correlation (CCA), generalized estimation equations (GEE), linear mixed effects models (LME) and OBrien combining approach). In particular, eLC provides a notable increase in power when the genetic variant exhibits both protective and deleterious effects. In the second stage, we developed a unique approach, conditional pleiotropy testing (cPLT), to examine pleiotropic effects using individual-level data for candidate variants identified in Stage 1. Simulation demonstrated reduced type 1 error for cPLT in identifying pleiotropic genetic variants compared to the typical conditional strategy. We validated our two-stage approach by performing a bivariate GWA study on two correlated quantitative traits, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides (TG), in the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 (GAW16) simulation dataset. In summary, the proposed two-stage approach allows us to leverage aggregated summary statistics from univariate GWAS and improves the power to identify potential pleiotropy while maintaining valid false-positive rates.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPleiotropy, occurring when a single genetic variant contributes to multiple phenotypes, remains difficult to identify in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To leverage data for multiple phenotypes and incorporate univariate GWAS summary results, we propose a novel two-stage approach for discovering potential pleiotropic variants. In the first stage, two novel combining approaches were developed to screen potential pleiotropic variants on a genome-wide scale. Simulations demonstrated the superior statistical power of these approaches over other multivariate methods. In the second stage, our approach was used to identify potential pleiotropy in the candidate marker sets generated from the first stage. The proposed two-stage approach was applied to the GAW16 simulation dataset to discover pleiotropic variants associated with high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides. In summary, we demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach can be applied as a viable and robust strategy to accommodate phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity for discovering potential pleiotropy on genome-wide scale.",
