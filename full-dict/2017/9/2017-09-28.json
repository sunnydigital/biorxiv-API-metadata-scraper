    "abstract": "Environmental variation is commonplace, but unpredictable. Populations that encounter a deleterious environment can sometimes avoid extinction by rapid evolutionary adaptation. Phenotypic variability, whereby a single genotype can express multiple different phenotypes, might play an important role in rescuing such populations from extinction. This type of evolutionary bet-hedging need not confer a direct benefit to a single individual, but it may increase the chance of long-term survival of a lineage. Here we develop a population-genetic model to explore how partly heritable phenotypic variability influences the probability of evolutionary rescue and the mean duration of population persistence in changing environments. We find that the probability of population persistence depends non-monotonically on the degree of phenotypic heritability between generations: some heritability can help avert extinction, but too much heritability removes any benefit of phenotypic variability. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of therapies designed to eradicate populations of pathogens or aberrant cellular lineages.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences, colloquially known as  jumping genes because of their ability to replicate to new genomic locations. Given a vector of transfer (e.g. tick or virus), TEs can jump further: between organisms or species in a process known as horizontal transfer (HT). Here we propose that LINE-1 (L1) and Bovine-B (BovB), the two most abundant TE families in mammals, were initially introduced as foreign DNA via ancient HT events. Using a 503-genome dataset, we identify multiple ancient L1 HT events in eukaryotes and provide evidence that L1s infiltrated the mammalian lineage after the monotreme-therian split. We also extend the BovB paradigm by increasing the number of estimated transfer events compared to previous studies, finding new potential blood-sucking parasite vectors and occurrences in new lineages (e.g. bats, frog). Given that these TEs make up nearly half of the genome sequence in todays mammals, our results provide the first evidence that HT can have drastic and long-term effects on the new host genomes. This revolutionizes our perception of genome evolution to consider external factors, such as the natural introduction of foreign DNA. With the advancement of genome sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, we anticipate our study to be the first of many large-scale phylogenomic analyses exploring the role of HT in genome evolution.\\n\\nSignificance statementLINE-1 (L1) elements occupy about half of most mammalian genomes (1), and they are believed to be strictly vertically inherited (2). Mutagenic L1 insertions are thought to account for approximately 1 of every 1000 random, disease-causing insertions in humans (4-7). Our research indicates that the very presence of L1s in humans, and other therian mammals, is due to an ancient transfer event - which has drastic implications for our perception of genome evolution. Using a machina analyses over 503 genomes, we trace the origins of L1 and BovB retrotransposons across the tree of life, and provide evidence of their long-term impact on eukaryotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe three-dimensional structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ.\\n\\nResultsHere we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach we develop a method for the simulation of chromatin packing in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess algorithm performance under realistic experimental constraints. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve chromosome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path in chromatin based on super-resolution microscopy images.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal determines gene flow among groups in a population and so plays a major role in many ecological and evolutionary processes, from biological invasions to species extinctions. Because patterns of gene flow shape kin structure, dispersal is also important to the evolution of social behaviours that influence reproduction and survival within groups. Conversely, dispersal patterns depend on kin structure and social behaviour. Dispersal and social behaviour therefore co-evolve but the nature and consequences of this interplay are not well understood. Here, we model this co-evolution and show that it readily leads to the emergence and maintenance of two broadly-defined social morphs: a sessile, benevolent morph expressed by individuals who tend to increase the fecundity of others within their group relative to their own; and a dispersive, selfserving morph expressed by individuals who tend to increase their own fecundity relative to others within their group. This social polymorphism arises as a consequence of a positive linkage between the loci responsible for dispersal and social behaviour, leading to benevolent individuals preferentially interacting with relatives and self-serving individuals with non-relatives. We find that this positive linkage is favoured under a large spectrum of conditions, which suggests that an association between dispersal proclivity and other social traits should be common in nature. In line with this prediction, dispersing individuals across a wide range of organisms have been reported to differ in their social tendencies from non-dispersing individuals.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian clock is a critical regulator of metabolism and cell division. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that systemic disruption of the circadian clock can promote cancer, whether the clock is disrupted in primary human tumors is unknown. Here we used transcriptome data from mice to define a signature of the mammalian circadian clock based on the co-expression of 12 genes that form the core clock or are directly controlled by the clock. Our approach can be applied to samples that are not labeled with time of day and were not acquired over the entire circadian (24-h) cycle. We validated the clock signature in transcriptome data from healthy human tissues, then developed a metric we call the delta clock correlation distance ({Delta}CCD) to describe the extent to which the signature is perturbed in samples from one condition relative to another. We calculated the {Delta}CCD comparing human tumor and non-tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and eight independent datasets, discovering widespread dysregulation of clock gene co-expression in tumor samples. Subsequent analysis of data from clock gene knockouts in mice suggested that clock dysregulation in human cancer is not caused solely by loss of activity of clock genes. Furthermore, by analyzing a large set of genes previously inferred to be rhythmic in healthy human lung, we found that dysregulation of the clock in human lung cancer is accompanied by dysregulation of broader patterns of circadian co-expression. Our findings suggest that clock dysregulation is a common means by which human cancers achieve unrestrained growth and division, and that restoring clock function could be a viable therapeutic strategy in multiple cancer types. In addition, our approach opens the door to using publicly available transcriptome data to quantify clock disruption in a multitude of human phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Complex cognitive behaviors, such as context-switching and rule-following, are thought to be supported by prefrontal cortex (PFC). Neural activity in PFC must thus be specialized to specific tasks while retaining flexibility. Nonlinear  mixed selectivity is an important neurophysiological trait for enabling complex and context-dependent behaviors. Here we investigate (1) the extent to which PFC exhibits computationally relevant properties such as mixed selectivity and (2) how such properties could arise via circuit mechanisms. We show that PFC cells recorded from male and female rhesus macaques during a complex task show a moderate level of specialization and structure that is not replicated by a model wherein cells receive random feedforward inputs. While random connectivity can be effective at generating mixed selectivity, the data shows significantly more mixed selectivity than predicted by a model with otherwise matched parameters. A simple Hebbian learning rule applied to the random connectivity, however, increases mixed selectivity and allows the model to match the data more accurately. To explain how learning achieves this, we provide analysis along with a clear geometric interpretation of the impact of learning on selectivity. After learning, the model also matches the data on measures of noise, response density, clustering, and the distribution of selectivities. Of two styles of Hebbian learning tested, the simpler and more biologically plausible option better matches the data. These modeling results give intuition about how neural properties important for cognition can arise in a circuit and make clear experimental predictions regarding how various measures of selectivity would evolve during animal training.\\n\\nSignificance StatementPrefrontal cortex (PFC) is a brain region believed to support the ability of animals to engage in complex behavior. How neurons in this area respond to stimuli--and in particular, to combinations of stimuli (\\\"mixed selectivity\\\")--is a topic of interest. Despite the fact that models with random feedforward connectivity are capable of creating computationally-relevant mixed selectivity, such a model does not match the levels of mixed selectivity seen in the data analyzed in this study. Adding simple Hebbian learning to the model increases mixed selectivity to the correct level and makes the model match the data on several other relevant measures. This study thus offers predictions on how mixed selectivity and other properties evolve with training.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100033). Much of the immense present day biological diversity of Neotropical rainforests originated from the Miocene onwards, a period of geological and ecological upheaval in South America. We assess the impact of the Andean orogeny, drainage of lake Pebas, and closure of the Panama Isthmus on two clades of trees (Cremastosperma, c. 31 spp.; and Mosannona, c. 14 spp.; both Annonaceae) found in humid forest distributed across the transition zones between the Andes and Western (lowland) Amazonia and between Central and South America. We inferred phylogenies based on c. 80% of recognised species of each clade using plastid and nuclear encoded sequence markers, revealing similar patterns of geographically restricted clades. Using molecular dating we showed that diversifications in the different areas occurred in parallel, with timing consistent with Andean vicariance and Central American geodispersal. In apparent contradiction of high dispersal abilities of rainforest trees, Cremastosperma clades within Amazonia are also geographically restricted, with a southern/montane clade that appears to have diversified along the foothills of the Andes sister to one of more northern/lowland species that diversified in a region once inundated by lake Pebas. Ecological niche modelling approaches show phylogenetically conserved niche differentiation, particularly within Cremastosperma. Niche similarity and recent common ancestry of Amazon and Guianan Mosannona species contrasts with dissimilar niches and more distant ancestry of Amazon, Venezuelan and Guianan species of Cremastosperma suggesting that this element of the similar patterns of disjunct distributions in the two genera is instead a biogeographic parallelism, with differing origins. The results provide further independent evidence for the importance of the Andean orogeny, the drainage of Lake Pebas, and the formation of links between South and Central America in the evolutionary history of Neotropical lowland rainforest trees.",

    "abstract": "In natural populations, individuals of a given genotype may belong to different classes. Such classes can for instance represent different age groups, developmental stages, or habitats. Class structure has important evolutionary consequences because the fitness of individuals with the same genetic background may vary depending on their class. As a result, demographic transitions between classes can cause fluctuations that need to be removed when estimating selection on a trait. Intrinsic differences between classes are classically taken into account by weighting individuals by class-specific reproductive values, defined as the relative contribution of individuals in a given class to the future of the population. These reproductive values are generally constant weights calculated from a constant projection matrix. Here, I show, for large populations and clonal reproduction, that reproductive values can be defined as time-dependent weights satisfying dynamical demographic equations that only depend on the average between-class transition rates over all genotypes. Using these time-dependent demographic reproductive values yields a simple Price equation where the non-selective effects of between-class transitions are removed from the dynamics of the trait. This generalises previous theory to a large class of ecological scenarios, taking into account densitydependence, ecological feedbacks and arbitrary distributions of the trait. I discuss the role of reproductive values for prospective and retrospective analyses of the dynamics of phenotypic traits.\\n\\nNote on this versionCompared to the previous version of the manuscript, some changes have been made to improve the readability and structure of the text, and to clarify the connections with the existing literature. One reviewer pointed out inconsistencies in some of the numerical simulations, and in the mutation term in appendix A2, which have now been fixed. When checking the calculations, I have also identified a missing term in the equation for the dynamics of individual reproductive values. The new equation makes much more sense. Additional results are also presented, in particular for discrete-time models and populations with a continuous age structure, for which Fishers original definition of reproductive value can be recovered.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical regions are organized into columns and layers. Connections between layers run mostly perpendicular to the surface suggesting a columnar functional organization. Some layers have long-range excitatory lateral connections suggesting interactions between columns. Similar patterns of connectivity exist in all regions but their exact role remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. Each column integrates its changing input over time to learn complete predictive models of observed objects. Excitatory lateral connections across columns allow the network to more rapidly infer objects based on the partial knowledge of adjacent columns. Because columns integrate input over time and space, the network learns models of complex objects that extend well beyond the receptive field of individual cells. Our network model introduces a new feature to cortical columns. We propose that a representation of location relative to the object being sensed is calculated within the sub-granular layers of each column. The location signal is provided as an input to the network, where it is combined with sensory data. Our model contains two layers and one or more columns. Simulations show that using Hebbian-like learning rules small single-column networks can learn to recognize hundreds of objects, with each object containing tens of features. Multi-column networks recognize objects with significantly fewer movements of the sensory receptors. Given the ubiquity of columnar and laminar connectivity patterns throughout the neocortex, we propose that columns and regions have more powerful recognition and modeling capabilities than previously assumed.",

We constructed a catalog of 14,438 SAVs, approximately 50% of which consist of SAVs disrupting non-canonical splice sites (including the 3rd and 5th intronic bases of donor sites) or newly creating splice sites. Smoking-related signature substantially contributes to SAV generation. As many as 14.7% of samples harbor at least one SAVs in cancer-related genes, particularly in tumor suppressors. Importantly, in addition to previously reported intron retention, exon skipping or alternative splice site usage more frequently affected these genes.

    "abstract": "Understanding morphological diversity--and morphological constrainto--has been a central question in evolutionary biology since its inception. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis, which contains the well-studied model system C. elegans, display remarkable morphological consistency in the face of extensive genetic divergence. Here, we provide a description of the broad developmental patterns of a recently discovered species, C. sp. 34, which was isolated from fresh figs in Okinawa and which is among the closest known relatives of C. elegans. C. sp. 34 displays an extremely large body size and can grow to be nearly twice as long as C. elegans and all other known members of the genus. Observations of the timing of developmental milestones reveal that C. sp. 34 develops about twice as slowly as C. elegans. Measurements of embryo and larval size show that the size difference between C. sp. 34 and C. elegans is largely due to post-embryonic events, particularly during the transition from larval to adult stages. This difference in size is not attributable to differences in germ line chromosome number or the number of somatic cells. The overall difference in body size is therefore largely attributable to changes in cell size via increased cytoplasmic volume. Because of its close relationship to C. elegans, the distinctness of C. sp. 34 provides an ideal system for the detailed analysis of evolutionary diversification. The context of over forty years of C. elegans developmental genetics also reveals clues into how natural selection and developmental constraint act jointly to promote patterns of morphological stasis and divergence in this group.",

    "abstract": "Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics1-4: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is irrelevant for the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and brain regions necessary for computing and using such priors are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory Parametric Working Memory (PWM) task, and found that rats displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioral effects of sensory stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans5,6 and monkeys7. Earlier proposals that PPC supports working memory8,9 predict that optogenetic silencing of this region would impair behavior in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, silencing PPC significantly improved performance. Quantitative analyses of behavior revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about sensory stimuli of previous trials than about stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of a given rats PPC, the greater the behavioral effect of sensory history in that rat, suggesting a tight link between behavior and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory stimulus history, and open a window for neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information.",

    "abstract": "A common experimental approach for studying signal transduction networks (STNs) is to measure the steady state concentrations of their components following perturbations to individual components. Such data is frequently used to reconstruct topological models of STNs, but, are rarely used for calibrating kinetic models of these networks. This is because, existing calibration algorithms operate by assigning different sets of values to the parameters of the kinetic models, and for each set of values simulating all perturbations performed in the biochemical experiments. This process is highly computation intensive and may be infeasible when molecular level information of the perturbation experiments is unavailable. Here, I propose an algorithm which can calibrate ordinary differential equation (ODE) based kinetic models of STNs using steady-state perturbation responses (SSPRs) without simulating perturbation experiments. The proposed algorithm uses modular response analysis (MRA) to calculate the scaled Jacobian matrix of the ODE model of an STN using SSPR data. The model parameters are then calibrated to fit the scaled Jacobian matrix calculated in the above step. This procedure does not require simulating the perturbation experiments. Therefore, it is significantly less computation intensive than existing algorithms and can be implemented without molecular level knowledge of the mechanism of perturbations. It is also parallelizable, i.e. can explore multiple sets of parameter values simultaneously, and therefore is scalable. The capabilities and shortcomings of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using both simulated and real perturbation responses of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) STN.\\n\\nAvailabilityAll source codes and data needed to replicate the results in this manuscript are available from https://github.com/SBIUCD/MRA_SMC_ABC1",

    "abstract": "O_LIAnalysis of ecological networks is a valuable approach to understanding the vulnerability of systems to environmental change. The tolerance of ecological networks to co-extinctions, resulting from sequences of primary extinctions, is a widely-used tool for modelling network  robustness. Previously, these  extinction models have been developed for and applied mostly to binary networks and recently used to predict cascades of co-extinctions in plant-pollinator networks. There is a need for robustness models that can make the most of the weighted data available and most importantly there is a need to understand how the structure of a network affects its robustness.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we developed a framework of extinction models for bipartite ecological networks (specifically plant-pollinator networks). In previous models co-extinctions occurred when nodes lost all their links, but by relaxing this rule (according to a set threshold) our models can be applied to binary and weighted networks, and can permit structurally correlated extinctions, i.e. the potential for avalanches of extinctions. We tested how the average and the range of robustness values is impacted by network structure and the impact of structurally-correlated extinctions sampling non-uniformly from the distribution of random extinction sequences.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that the way that structurally-correlated extinctions are modelled impacts the results; our two ecologically-plausible models produce opposing effects which shows the importance of understanding the model. We found that when applying the models to networks with weighted interactions, the effects are amplified and the variation in robustness increases. Variation in robustness is a key feature of these extinction models and is driven by the structural heterogeneity (i.e. the skewness of the degree distribution) of nodes (specifically, plant nodes) in the network.\\nC_LIO_LIOur new framework of models enables us to calculate robustness with weighted, as well as binary, bipartite networks, and to make direct comparisons between models and between networks. This allows us to differentiate effects of the model and of the data (network structure) which is vital for those making ecological inferences from robustness models. The models can be applied to mutualistic and antagonistic networks, and can be extended to food webs.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for detecting the location of cells from two-photon calcium imaging data. In our framework, multiple coupled active contours evolve, guided by a model-based cost function, to identify cell boundaries. An active contour seeks to partition a local region into two subregions, a cell interior and ex-terior, in which all pixels have maximally  similar time courses. This simple, local model allows contours to be evolved predominantly independently. When contours are sufficiently close, their evolution is coupled, in a manner that permits overlap. We illustrate the ability of the proposed method to demix overlapping cells on real data. The proposed framework is flexible, incorporating no prior information regarding a cells morphology or stereotypical temporal activity, which enables the detection of cells with diverse properties. We demonstrate algorithm performance on a challenging mouse in vitro dataset, containing synchronously spiking cells, and a manually labelled mouse in vivo dataset, on which ABLE achieves a 67.5% success rate.\\n\\nSignificance statementTwo-photon calcium imaging enables the study of brain activity during learning and behaviour at single-cell resolution. To decode neuronal spiking activity from the data, algorithms are first required to detect the location of cells in the video. It is still common for scientists to perform this task manually, as the heterogeneity in cell shape and frequency of cellular overlap impede automatic segmentation algorithms. We developed a versatile algorithm based on a popular image segmentation approach (the Level Set Method) and demonstrated its capability to overcome these challenges. We include no assumptions on cell shape or stereotypical temporal activity. This lends our framework the flexibility to be applied to new datasets with minimal adjustment.",

Using a multiple-metrics approach, challenging MAP across the spectrum of physiological extremes (i.e. spontaneous through forced MAP oscillations), we characterized dynamic cerebral autoregulatory capacity in 19 male endurance athletes and 8 controls via three methods: [1] onset of regulation (i.e., time delay before an increase in middle cerebral artery (MCA) conductance [MCA flow velocity (MCAv)/mean arterial pressure (MAP)] and rate of regulation, after transient hypotension induced by sit-to-stand, and transfer function analysis (TFA) of MAP and MCAv responses during [2] spontaneous and [3] forced oscillations (5-min of squat-stand maneuvers performed at 0.05 and 0.10 Hz). Reductions in MAP and mean MCAv (MCAVmean) during initial orthostatic stress (0-30 s after sit-to-stand) and the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension were also determined. Onset of regulation was delayed after sit-to-stand in athletes (3.1{+/-}1.7 vs. 1.5{+/-}1.0 s; p=0.03), but rate of regulation was not different between groups (0.24{+/-}0.05 vs. 0.21{+/-}0.09 s-1; p=0.82). While both groups had comparable TFA metrics during spontaneous oscillations, athletes had higher TFA gain during 0.10 Hz squat-stand vs. recreational controls (p=0.01). Reductions in MAP (p=0.15) and MCAVmean (p=0.11) during orthostatic stress and the prevalence of initial orthostatic hypotension (p=0.65) were comparable between groups.

Here, by use of a mouse model in which NPR2 cannot be dephosphorylated, we show that bone elongation is opposed when NPR2 is dephosphorylated and thus produces less cyclic GMP. By developing an in vivo imaging system to measure cyclic GMP levels in intact tibia, we show that FGF-induced dephosphorylation of NPR2 decreases its guanylyl cyclase activity in growth plate chondrocytes in living bone. Thus FGF signaling lowers cyclic GMP in the growth plate, which counteracts bone elongation. These results define a new component of the signaling network by which activating mutations in the FGF receptor inhibit bone growth.",

As these assays move beyond the prototyping stage and into biological and clinical research environments, there is a need to produce microscale culture platforms more rapidly, cost-effectively, and reproducibly.  Rapid injection molding is poised to meet this need as it enables some of the benefits of traditional high volume injection molding at a fraction of the cost. However, rapid injection molding has limitations due to the material and methods used for mold fabrication. Here, we characterize advantages and limitations of rapid injection molding for microfluidic device fabrication through measurement of key features for cell culture applications including channel geometry, feature consistency, floor thickness, and surface polishing. We demonstrate phase contrast and fluorescence imaging of cells grown in rapid injection molded devices and provide design recommendations to successfully utilize rapid injection molding methods for microscale cell-based assay development in academic laboratory settings.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative transportation behavior in ants has attracted attention from a wide range of researchers, from behavioral biologists to roboticists. Ants can accomplish complex tasks as a group whereas individual ants are not intelligent (in the context of thisstudys tasks). In this study, group transportation and obstacle navigation in Formica japonica, an ant species exhibiting  uncoordinated transportation (primitive group transportation), are observed using two differently conditioned colonies. Analysesfocus on the effect of group size on two key quantities: transportation speed and obstacle navigation period. Additionally, this study examines how these relationships differ between colonies. The tendencies in transportation speed differ between colonies whereas the obstacle navigation period is consistently reduced irrespective of the colony. To explain this seemingly inconsistent result in transportation speed, we focus on behavioral diversity in  directivity, defined as the tendency of individual ants totransport a food item toward their own preferential direction. Directivity is not always toward the nest, but rather is distributed around it. The diversity of the first colony is less than that of the second colony. Based on the above results, a mechanical model is constructed. Using the translational and rotational motion equations of a rigid rod, the model mimics a food item being pulled by single or multiple ants. The directions of pulling forces exerted by individual ants are assumed to be distributed around the direction pointing toward the nest. The simulation results suggest that, as diversity in directivity increases, so does the success rate in more complicated obstacle navigation. In contrast, depending on group size, the speed of group transportation increases in the case of lower diversity while it is almost constant in the case of higher diversity. Transportation speed and obstacle navigation success rate are in a trade-off relationship.",

Both are complex morphological traits and both can be easily assessed from frontal and lateral projection of a human face. Interestingly, examination of mutual relations between the frontal and lateral dimensions of these markers has so far received little attention in published research.\\n\\nMethodsIn our cross-cultural study, we used geometric morphometric data from male and female faces from Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, and the Czech Republic, and analysed correlations between frontal and lateral measurements of averageness and degree of maleness/femaleness, i.e. individual variation in features that characterize sexual dimorphism. We also analysed whether the association between frontal and lateral measurements differs in men and women.\\n\\nResultsIn general, our results showed a moderate correlation in sexually dimorphic features between lateral and frontal facial configuration in both sexes, while frontal and lateral facial averageness was moderately correlated only in women. This pattern was less consistent when individual populations were analysed separately.\\n\\nConclusionsReferring to the multiple signalling theory, we propose that especially in women, lateral/frontal correlations support a hypothesis of redundancy of information provided by the frontal and lateral dimension of a given facial attractiveness marker. The absence of a significant correlation in male facial averageness suggests that frontal and lateral averageness may convey different information about an individual.",

    "abstract": "Many organisms face a wide variety of biotic and abiotic stressors which reduce individual survival, interacting synergistically to further reduce fitness. Here we studied the effects of two such synergistically interacting stressors; immunotoxicant exposure and parasite infection. We model the dynamics of a within-host infection and the associated immune response of an individual. We consider both the indirect sub-lethal effects on immunosuppression and the direct effects on health and mortality of individuals exposed to toxicants. We demonstrate that sub-lethal exposure to toxicants can promote infection through the suppression of the immune system. This happens through the depletion of the immune response which causes rapid proliferation in parasite load. In addition, high toxicant exposure can alter cellular regulation and cause the breakdown of normal healthy tissue, from which we infer higher mortality risk of the host. We classify this breakdown into three phases of increasing toxicant stress, and demonstrate the range of conditions under which toxicant exposure causes failure at the within-host level. These phases are determined by the relationship between the immunity status, overall cellular health and the level of toxicant exposure. We discuss the implications of our model in the context of individual honey bee health. Our model provides an assessment of how pesticide stress and infection interact to cause the synergistic breakdown of the within-host dynamics of individual honey bees.",

Canonical SLs contain the ABCD ring system, and non-canonical SLs lack the A, B, or C ring but have the enol ether-D ring moiety which is essential for biological activities. The simplest non-canonical SL is the SL biosynthetic intermediate carlactone (CL). In plants, CL and its oxidized metabolites such as carlactonoic acid and methyl carlactonoate, are present in root and shoot tissues. In some plant species including black oat (Avena strigosa), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), and maize (Zea mays), non-canonical SLs are major germination stimulants in the root exudates. Various plant species such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) release carlactonoic acid, and poplar (Populus spp.) was found to exude methyl carlactonoate into the rhizosphere. These results suggest that both canonical and non-canonical SLs are active as host recognition signals in the rhizosphere. In contrast, limited distribution of canonical SLs in the plant kingdom and structure- and stereo-specific transportation of canonical SLs from roots to shoots suggest that plant hormones inhibiting shoot branching are not canonical SLs but are rather non-canonical SLs.\\n\\nSupplemental files: Synthesis of 7-hydroxy-5-deoxystrigol stereoisomers, spectroscopic data of synthetic compounds and the natural stimulant in dokudami root exudates.\\n\\nScheme S1.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring emerging epidemics of highly fatal diseases, rapid development and testing of new vaccines may be critical to curbing transmission and saving lives. However, the design of vaccine efficacy trials in such contexts may face considerable logistical, epidemiological, or ethical impediments. Three different vaccine efficacy trials were conducted during the 2014-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, each with different designs. At the time, there was vigorous debate on the tradeoff between a trials ability to yield information of scientific and societal value versus the perceived ethical dilemma of withholding potentially life-saving vaccines from control participants. Whereas the scientific value of a trial is often estimated in terms of statistical power, speed, and rigor, we lack similar metrics for the ethical costs of withholding interventions.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsHere, we introduce a conceptual framework that fills this gap and allows quantitative assessment of both the scientific value of a study and the risks incurred by trial participants. We show that even untested vaccines against severe diseases may be probabilistically beneficial--i.e. after accounting for realistic uncertainty in their safety and efficacy, trial participants are expected to be better off vaccinated than not. While accounting for this uncertainty, we estimate trial participant risk under a hypothetical, idealized vaccine rollout scenario and compare it to risk under various candidate trial designs, in order to elucidate specific quantitative tradeoffs between cumulative risk to trial participants and information gained. Through an illustrative simulation example, we highlight specific trial-design modifications that allow for conscientious balance between minimizing participant risk and acquiring information of societal value. These include modifications that affect the speed with which a trial would detect an efficacious vaccine (greater sample size or enrollment rate, interim analyses, or risk-prioritized vaccine rollout), which leads to earlier vaccination of control participants should the vaccine be efficacious, and those that systematically limit the risk \\\"spent\\\" by unvaccinated individuals (e.g., providing vaccination to controls after a delay, or presumptive vaccination of subjects above a risk threshold).\\n\\nConclusionWe advocate this conceptual approach as a means of clarifying the tensions between opposing viewpoints and facilitating transparent discussion to aid ethical and efficient responses to future emerging epidemics.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCopy number variation is an important and abundant source of variation in the human genome, which has been associated with a number of diseases, especially cancer. Massively parallel next-generation sequencing allows copy number profiling with fine resolution. Such efforts, however, have met with mixed successes, with setbacks arising partly from the lack of reliable analytical methods to meet the diverse and unique challenges arising from the myriad experimental designs and study goals in genetic studies. In cancer genomics, detection of somatic copy number changes and profiling of allele-specific copy number (ASCN) are complicated by experimental biases and artifacts as well as normal cell contamination and cancer subclone admixture. Furthermore, careful statistical modeling is warranted to reconstruct tumor phylogeny by both somatic ASCN changes and single nucleotide variants.

    "abstract": "The neurovascular mechanisms underpinning the local regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen transport remain elusive. In this study we have combined novel in vivo imaging of cortical microvascular and mural cell architecture with mathematical modelling of blood flow and oxygen transport, to provide new insights into CBF regulation that would be inaccessible in a conventional experimental context. Our study implicates vasomotion of smooth muscle actin-covered vessels, rather than pericyte-covered capillaries, as the main mechanism for modulating tissue oxygenation. We also resolve seemingly paradoxical observations in the literature around reduced blood velocity in response to arteriolar constrictions and deduce the cause to be propagation of constrictions to upstream penetrating arterioles. We provide support for pericytes acting as signalling conduits for upstream smooth muscle activation, and erythrocyte deformation as a complementary regulatory mechanism. Finally, we caution against the use of blood velocity as a proxy measurement for flow. Our combined imaging-modelling platform complements conventional experimentation allowing cerebrovascular physiology to be probed in unprecedented detail.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells have been found to frequently express genes that are normally restricted to the testis, often referred to as cancer/testis (CT) antigens or genes1, 2. Because germ cell specific antigens are not recognized as \\\"self\\\" by the innate immune system3, CT-genes have previously been suggested as ideal candidate targets for cancer therapy4. The use of CT- genes in cancer therapy has thus far been unsuccessful, most likely because their identification has relied on gene expression in whole testis, including the testicular somatic cells, precluding the detection of true germ cell specific genes. By comparing the transcriptomes of micro-dissected germ cell subtypes, representing the main developmental stages of human spermatogenesis5, with the publicly accessible transcriptomes of 2.617 samples from 49 different healthy somatic tissues6 and 9.232 samples from 33 tumor types7, we here discover hundreds of true germ cell specific cancer expressed genes. Strikingly, we found these germ cell cancer genes (GC-genes) to be widely expressed in all analyzed tumors. Many GC-genes appeared to be involved in processes that are likely to actively promote tumor viability, proliferation and metastasis. Targeting these true GC-genes thus has the potential to inhibit tumor growth with infertility being the only possible side effect. Moreover, we identified a subset of GC-genes that are not expressed in spermatogonial stem cells. Targeting of this GC-gene subset is predicted to only lead to temporary infertility, as untargeted spermatogonial stem cells can recover spermatogenesis after treatment. Our GC- gene dataset enables improved understanding of tumor biology and provides multiple novel targets for cancer treatment.",

Little is known about the cells-of-origin for non-functional neuroendocrine tumors. Here, we genotyped 64 PanNETs for mutations in ATRX, DAXX, and MEN1 and found 37 tumors (58%) carry mutations in these three genes (A-D-M mutant PanNETs) and this correlates with a worse clinical outcome than tumors carrying the wild-type alleles of all three genes (A-D-M WT PanNETs). We performed RNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis on 33 randomly selected cases to reveal two distinct subgroups with one group consisting entirely of A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Two biomarkers differentiating A-D-M mutant from A-D-M WT PanNETs were high ARX gene expression and low PDX1 gene expression with PDX1 promoter hyper-methylation in the A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Moreover, A-D-M mutant PanNETs had a gene expression signature related to that of alpha cells (pval < 0.009) of pancreatic islets including increased expression of HNF1A and its transcriptional target genes. This gene expression profile suggests that A-D-M mutant PanNETs originate from or transdifferentiate into a distinct cell type similar to alpha cells.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent therapeutic advances in the management of BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, there is still a compelling need for more effective treatments for patients who developed BRAF/NRAS wild type disease. Since the activity of single targeted agents is limited by innate and acquired resistance, we performed a high-throughput drug screen using 180 drug combinations to generate over 18,000 viability curves, with the aim of identifying agents that synergise to kill BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma cells. From this screen we observed strong synergy between the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib and MEK inhibitors and validated this combination in an independent cell line collection. We found that AXL expression was associated with synergy to the nilotinib/MEK inhibitor combination, and that both drugs work in concert to suppress pERK. This finding was supported by genome-wide CRISPR screening which revealed that resistance mechanisms converge on regulators of the MAPK pathway. Finally, we validated the synergy of nilotinib/trametinib combination in vivo using patient-derived xenografts. Our results indicate that a nilotinib/MEK inhibitor combination may represent an effective therapy in BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic instability promotes evolution and heterogeneity of tumors. Unraveling its mechanistic basis is essential to design appropriate therapeutic strategies. In a recent study we reported an unexpected oncogenic property of p21WAF1/Cip1 showing that its chronic expression, in a p53-deficient environment, causes genomic instability by deregulating the replication licensing machinery.\\n\\nResultsExtending on this work we now demonstrate that p21WAF1/Cip1 can further fuel genomic instability by suppressing the repair capacity of low and high fidelity pathways that deal with nucleotide abnormalities. Consequently, fewer single nucleotide substitutions (SNSs) occur, while formation of highly deleterious DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is enhanced, crafting a characteristic mutational signature landscape. Guided by the mutational signatures formed, we found at the mechanistic level that the DSBs were repaired by Rad52-dependent Break-Induced Replication (BIR) and Single-Strand Annealing (SSA). Conversely, the error-free synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) repair route was deficient. Surprisingly, Rad52 was activated transcriptionally in an E2F1-dependent manner, rather than post-translationally as is common for DNA repair factor activation.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results signify the importance of mutational signatures as guides to disclose the \\\"repair history\\\" leading to genomic instability. In this vein, following this approach we unveiled how chronic p21WAF1/Cip1 expression rewires the repair process, identifying Rad52 as a source of genomic instability and a candidate therapeutic target.",

We here unravel two clearly distinct meiotic arrest mechanisms that act during the prophase of human male meiosis. Type I arrested spermatocytes display severe asynapsis of the homologous chromosomes, disturbed XY-body formation and increased expression of the Y-chromosome encoded gene ZFY and seem to activate a DNA damage pathway leading to induction of p63 mediated spermatocyte elimination. Type II arrested spermatocytes display normal chromosome synapsis, normal XY-body morphology and meiotic crossover formation but have a lowered expression of several cell cycle regulating genes and fail to properly silence the X-chromosome encoded gene ZFX. Discovery and understanding of these meiotic arrest mechanisms increases our knowledge on how genomic stability is guarded during human germ cell development.",

    "abstract": "The HIV/AIDS pandemic remains an important threat to human health. We have recently demonstrated that a novel microRNA (miR-128) represses retrotransposon (LINE-1 or L1) by a dual mechanism, by directly targeting the coding region of the L1 RNA and by repressing a required nuclear import factor (TNPO1). We have further determined that miR-128 represses the expression of all three isoforms of TNPO proteins (transportins, TNPO1,-2 and TNPO3). Here, we establish that miR-128 also controls HIV-1 replication by repressing TNPO3. TNPO3 is well established to regulate HIV-1 nuclear import and viral replication. Here, we report that the type I interferon inducible miR-128 directly targets two sites in the TNPO3 mRNA, significantly down-regulating TNPO3 mRNA and protein expression levels. Manipulation of miR-128 levels in HIV target cell lines and in primary human CD4 T-cells by over-expression or knockdown showed that modulation of TNPO3 by miR-128 affects HIV-1 replication but not MLV infection. In addition, we found that miR-128 modulation of HIV-1 replication is reduced with TNPO3-independent HIV-1 virus and in cells depleted of CPSF6, suggesting that miR-128-indued TNPO3 repression is partly required for miR-128-induced inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Finally, challenging miR-modulated Jurkat cells or primary CD4 T-cells with wildtype, replication-competent HIV-1 shows that miR-128 significantly delays spreading infection. Thus, we have established a novel role of miR-128 in anti-viral defense in human cells, inhibiting HIV-1 replication partly by targeting TNPO3.",

During limb development, the telomeric TAD controls the early transcription of Hoxd gene in forearm cells, whereas the centromeric TAD subsequently regulates more posterior Hoxd genes in digit cells. Therefore, the TAD boundary prevents the terminal Hoxd13 gene to respond to forearm enhancers, thereby allowing proper limb patterning. To assess the nature and function of this CTCF-rich DNA region in embryo, we compared chromatin interaction profiles between proximal and distal limb bud cells isolated from mutant stocks where various parts or this boundary region were removed. The resulting progressive release in boundary effect triggered inter-TAD contacts, favored by the activity of the newly accessed enhancers. However, the boundary was highly resilient and only a 400kb large deletion including the whole gene cluster was eventually able to merge the neighboring TADs into a single structure. In this unified TAD, both proximal and distal limb enhancers nevertheless continued to work independently over a targeted transgenic reporter construct. We propose that the whole HoxD cluster is a dynamic TAD border and that the exact boundary position varies depending on both the transcriptional status and the developmental context.",

Models of population growth based on a depletable resources have been studied previously, but relatively few consider metapopulation effects. Here we analyze a socio-ecological metapopulation model where resources grow logistically on each patch. Each population harvests resources on its own patch to support population growth, but can also harvest resources from other patches when their own patch resources become scarce. We find that allowing populations to harvest from other patches significantly accelerates collapse and also increases the parameter regime for which collapse occurs, compared to a model where populations are not able to harvest resources from other patches. As the number of patches in the metapopulation increases, collapse is more sudden, more severe, and occurs sooner. These effects also persist under scenarios of asymmetry and inequality between patches. We conclude that metapopulation effects in socio-ecological systems can be both helpful and harmful and therefore require urgent study.",

Here, we quantify the changes in the global agricultural land footprint if the world were to adhere to the dietary guidelines put forth by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), while accounting for the land use change incurred by import/export required to meet those guidelines. We analyze data at country, continent, and global levels. USDA guidelines are viewed as an improvement on the current land-intensive diet of the average American, but despite this our results show that global adherence to USDA guidelines would require up to 1 gigahectare of additional agricultural land--roughly the size of Canada. The results also show a strong divide between Eastern and Western hemispheres. Because countries increasingly import most of their food, meeting USDA guidelines could cause a Tragedy of the Commons, where self-interested actors race to over-exploit the shared resource of global agricultural lands. National dietary guidelines and practices thus need to be coordinated internationally in order to spare our remaining natural lands, in much the same way that countries are coordinating greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "abstract": "The goal of Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (PCMs) is to study the distribution of quantitative traits among related species. The observed traits are often seen as the result of a Brownian Motion (BM) along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. Reticulation events such as hybridization, gene flow or horizontal gene transfer, can substantially affect a species traits, but are not modeled by a tree. Phylogenetic networks have been designed to represent reticulate evolution. As they become available for downstream analyses, new models of trait evolution are needed, applicable to networks. One natural extension of the BM is to use a weighted average model for the trait of a hybrid, at a reticulation point. We develop here an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the phylogenetic variance matrix of a trait on a network, in only one preorder traversal of the network. We then extend the standard PCM tools to this new framework, including phylogenetic regression with covariates (or phylogenetic ANOVA), ancestral trait reconstruction, and Pagels {lambda} test of phylogenetic signal. The trait of a hybrid is sometimes outside of the range of its two parents, for instance because of hybrid vigor or hybrid depression. These two phenomena are rather commonly observed in present-day hybrids. Transgressive evolution can be modeled as a shift in the trait value following a reticulation point. We develop a general framework to handle such shifts, and take advantage of the phylogenetic regression view of the problem to design statistical tests for ancestral transgressive evolution in the evolutionary history of a group of species. We study the power of these tests in several scenarios, and show that recent events have indeed the strongest impact on the trait distribution of present-day taxa. We apply those methods to a dataset of Xiphophorus fishes, to confirm and complete previous analysis in this group. All the methods developed here are available in the Julia package PhyloNetworks.",

    "abstract": "Condensins are broadly conserved chromosome organizers that function in chromatin compaction and transcriptional regulation, but to what extent these two functions are linked has remained unclear. Here, we analyzed the effect of condensin inactivation on genome compaction and global gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Spike-in-controlled 3C-seq analysis revealed that acute condensin inactivation leads to a global decrease in close-range chromosomal interactions as well as more specific losses of homotypic tRNA gene clustering. In addition, a condensin-rich topologically associated domain between the ribosomal DNA and the centromere on chromosome XII is lost upon condensin inactivation. Unexpectedly, these large-scale changes in chromosome architecture are not associated with global changes in transcript levels as determined by spike-in-controlled mRNA-seq analysis. Our data suggest that the global transcriptional program of S. cerevisiae is resistant to condensin inactivation and the associated profound changes in genome organization.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGene expression occurs in the context of higher-order chromatin organization, which helps compact the genome within the spatial constraints of the nucleus. To what extent higher-order chromatin compaction affects gene expression remains unknown. Here, we show that gene expression and genome compaction can be uncoupled in the single-celled model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Inactivation of the conserved condensin complex, which also organizes the human genome, leads to broad genome decompaction in this organism. Unexpectedly, this reorganization has no immediate effect on the transcriptome. These findings indicate that the global gene expression program is robust to large-scale changes in genome architecture in yeast, shedding important new light on the evolution and function of genome organization in gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "The use of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods has enjoyed this past decade a rapid increase in popularity among neuroscientists. More recently, similarity-based multivariate methods aiming not only to extract information regarding the class membership of stimuli from their associated brain patterns, say, decode a face from a potato, but to understand the form of the underlying representational structure associated with stimulus dimensions of interest, say, 2D grating or 3D face orientation, have flourished under the name of Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). However, data-preprocessing steps implemented prior to RSA can significantly change the covariance (and correlation) structure of the data, hence possibly leading to representational confusion--i.e., a researcher inferring that brain area A encodes information according to representational scheme X, and not Y, when the opposite is true. Here, I demonstrate with simulations that time-series demeaning (including z-scoring) can plausibly lead to representational confusion. Further, I expose potential interactions between the effects of data demeaning and how the brain happens to encode information. Finally, I emphasize the importance in the context of similarity analyses of at least occasionally explicitly considering the direction of pattern vectors in multivariate space, rather than focusing exclusively on the relative location of their endpoints. Overall, I expect this article will promote awareness of the impact of data demeaning on inferences regarding representational structure and neural coding.",

We coupled cluster analysis with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to discover connectivity subtypes in healthy older adults and patients with cognitive disorders related to Alzheimers disease, noting associations between subtypes and cognitive symptoms in the default-mode, limbic and salience networks. In an independent asymptomatic cohort with a family history of Alzheimers dementia, the connectivity subtypes had good test-retest reliability across all tested networks. We found that a limbic subtype was overrepresented in these individuals, which was previously associated with symptoms. Other limbic subtypes showed associations with cerebrospinal fluid A{beta}1-42 levels and ApoE4 genotype. Our results demonstrate the existence of reliable subtypes of functional brain networks in older adults and support future investigations in limbic connectivity subtypes as early biomarkers of Alzheimers degeneration.",

We evaluated acute and late neuropathological and behavioral consequences of ZIKV infection in a neonatal immunocompetent mouse model. ZIKV showed brain tropism, causing post-natal microcephaly and several behavioral dysfunctions. During the acute phase of infection, mice developed very frequent epileptic seizures, which are consistently reduced by TNF- neutralization. Although adult animals recover from seizures, they become more susceptible to chemically-induced crises. Intriguingly, the virus remained actively replicating in adult animals, which show persistent necrosis and calcifications in the mice brain. Altogether the results reveal late consequences of neonatal ZIKV exposure and suggest the early inhibition of neuroinflammation as a potential treatment.",

    "abstract": "The ability to discriminate modulation frequencies is important for speech intelligibility because speech has amplitude and frequency modulations. Neurophysiological responses assessed by envelope following responses (EFRs) significantly decline at faster amplitude modulation frequencies (AMF) in older subjects. A typical assumption is that a decline in EFRs will necessarily result in corresponding perceptual deficits. To test this assumption, we investigated young and aged Fischer-344 rats behavioral AMF discrimination abilities and compared to their EFRs. A modified version of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle reflex (ASR) was used to obtain behavioral performance. A PPI trial contains pulses of sinusoidal AM (SAM) at 128 Hz presented sequentially, a SAM prepulse with different AMF and a startle-eliciting-stimulus. To account for hearing threshold shift or age-related synaptopathy, stimulus levels were presented at 10-dB lower or match to the aged peripheral neural activation (using auditory brainstem response wave I amplitude). When AMF differences and modulation depths were large, young and aged animals behavioral performances were comparable. Aged animals AMF discrimination abilities declined as the AMF difference or the modulation depth reduced, even compared to the young with peripheral matching. Young animals showed smaller relative decreases in EFRs with reduced modulation depths. The correlation of EFRs and AM perception was identified to be more consistent in young animals. The overall results revealed larger age-related deficits in behavioral perception compared to EFRs, suggesting additional factors that affect perception despite smaller degradation in neural responses. Hence, behavioral and physiological measurements are critical in unveiling a more complete picture on the auditory function.",

Deciphering the physiological basis of species-species and species-environment interactions in spatially organized environment requires reductionist approaches using ecologically and functionally relevant species. To this end, we focus here on a specific defined system to study the metabolic interactions in a spatial context among a plant-beneficial endophytic fungus Serendipita indica, and the soil-dwelling model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Focusing on the growth dynamics of S. indica under defined conditions, we identified an auxotrophy in this organism for thiamine, which is a key co-factor for essential reactions in the central carbon metabolism. We found that S. indica growth is restored in thiamine-free media, when co-cultured with B. subtilis. The success of this auxotrophic interaction, however, was dependent on the spatial and temporal organization of the system; the beneficial impact of B. subtilis was only visible when its inoculation was separated from that of S. indica either in time or space. These findings describe a key auxotrophic interaction in the soil among organisms that are shown to be important for plant ecosystem functioning, and point to the potential importance of spatial and temporal organization for the success of auxotrophic interactions. These points can be particularly important for engineering of minimal functional synthetic communities as plant-seed treatments and for vertical farming under defined conditions.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive elements, including LINE-1 (L1), comprise approximately half of the human genome. These elements can potentially destabilize the genome by initiating their own replication and reintegration into new sites (retrotransposition). In somatic cells, transcription of L1 elements are repressed by distinct molecular mechanisms including DNA methylation and histone modifications to repress transcription. Under conditions of hypomethylation (e.g. in tumor cells) a window of opportunity for L1 de-repression arises and additional restriction mechanisms become crucial. We recently demonstrated that the microRNA miR-128 represses L1 activity by directly binding to L1 ORF2 RNA. In this study, we tested whether miR-128 can also control L1 activity by repressing cellular proteins important for L1 retrotransposition. We found that miR-128 targets the 3UTR of the nuclear import factor transportin 1 (TNPO1) mRNA. Manipulation of miR-128 and TNPO1 levels demonstrated that induction or depletion of TNPO1 affects L1 retrotransposition and nuclear import of an L1-RNP complex (using L1-encoded ORF1p as a proxy for L1-RNP complexes). Moreover, TNPO1 overexpression partially reversed the repressive effect of miR-128 on L1 retrotransposition. Our study represents the first description of a protein factor involved in nuclear import of the L1 element and demonstrates that miR-128 controls L1 activity in somatic cells through two independent mechanisms: direct binding to L1 RNA, and regulating a cellular factor necessary for L1 nuclear import and retrotransposition.",

The kDNA largely consists of concatenated minicircles and a few maxicircles that are also interlocked into the kDNA disc. More than 30 proteins involved in kDNA replication have been described, however several mechanistic questions are only poorly understood. Here, we describe and characterize MiRF172, a novel mitochondrial genome replication factor, which is essential for proper cell growth and kDNA maintenance. Using super-resolution microscopy, we localize MiRF172 to the antipodal sites of the kDNA. We demonstrate that depletion of MiRF172 leads to continuous loss of mini- and maxicircles during the cell division cycle. Detailed analysis suggests that MiRF172 is likely involved in the reattachment of replicated minicircles to the kDNA disc. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the localization of the replication factor MiRF172 not only depends on the kDNA itself, but also on the mitochondrial genome segregation machinery suggesting a tight interaction between the two essential entities.\\n\\nSummary StatementMiRF172 is a novel protein involved in the reattachment of replicated minicircles in Trypanosoma brucei, which requires the mitochondrial segregation machinery for proper localization.",

A second set of 156 unselected HCH pancreatic cancer cases were sequenced on an expanded 59-gene panel (n=95) or with a custom 14-gene clinical panel (n=61). Sequencing data from both sets of pancreatic cancer cases, the pancreatic cancer cases of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and an unselected pancreatic cancer screen from the Mayo Clinic were combined in a meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of carriers with pathogenic and variants of uncertain significance.\\n\\nResultsApproximately 8.9% of unselected pancreatic cancer cases at the HCH carried a variant with potential HBOC or CRC screening recommendations. A meta-analysis of unselected pancreatic cancer cases revealed that approximately 10.5% carry a pathogenic variant or HiP-VUS.\\n\\nConclusionWith the inclusion of both HBOC and CRC susceptibility genes in a panel test, unselected pancreatic cancer cases have a high enough percentage of carriers to rationalize genetic testing for identification of variants that could be further used in cascade testing of healthy relatives to increase HBOC and CRC surveillance measures.",

Stark.\\n\\nAbstractAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria and associated human morbidity and mortality is increasing. Use of antimicrobials in livestock selects for AMR that can subsequently be transferred to humans. This flow of AMR between reservoirs demands surveillance in livestock as well as in humans. As part of the EFFORT project (www.effort-against-amr.eu), we have quantified and characterized the acquired resistance gene pools (resistomes) of 181 pig and 178 poultry farms from nine European countries, generating more than 5,000 gigabases of DNA sequence, using shotgun metagenomics. We quantified acquired AMR using the ResFinder database and a database constructed for this study, consisting of AMR genes identified through screening environmental DNA. The pig and poultry resistomes were very different in abundance and composition. There was a significant country effect on the resistomes, more so in pigs than poultry. We found higher AMR loads in pigs, while poultry resistomes were more diverse. We detected several recently described, critical AMR genes, including mcr-1 and optrA, the abundance of which differed both between host species and countries. We found that the total acquired AMR level, was associated with the overall country-specific antimicrobial usage in livestock and that countries with comparable usage patterns had similar resistomes. Novel, functionally-determined AMR genes were, however, not associated with total drug use.",

    "abstract": "Filopodia are dynamic membrane protrusions driven by polymerization of an actin filament core, mediated by formin molecules at the filopodia tips. Filopodia can adhere to the extracellular matrix and experience both external and cell generated pulling forces. The role of such forces in filopodia adhesion is however insufficiently understood. Here, we induced sustained growth of filopodia by applying pulling force to their tips via attached fibronectin-coated beads trapped by optical tweezers. Strikingly, pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of myosin IIA, which localized to the base of filopodia, resulted in weakening of filopodia adherence strength. Inhibition of formins, which caused detachment of actin filaments from formin molecules, produced similar effect. Thus, myosin IIA-generated centripetal force transmitted to the filopodia tips through interactions between formins and actin filaments are required for filopodia adhesion. Force-dependent adhesion led to preferential attachment of filopodia to rigid versus fluid substrates, which may underlie cell orientation and polarization.",

    "abstract": "Meta-analysis is now an essential tool for genetic association studies, allowing these to combine large studies and greatly accelerating the pace of genetic discovery. Although the standard meta-analysis methods perform equivalently as the more cumbersome joint analysis under ideal settings, they result in substantial power loss under unbalanced settings with various case-control ratios. Here, we investigate why the standard meta-analysis methods lose power under unbalanced settings, and further propose a novel meta-analysis method that performs as efficiently as joint analysis under general settings. Our proposed method can accurately approximate the score statistics obtainable by joint analysis, for both linear and logistic regression models, with and without covariates. In addition, we propose a novel approach to adjust for population stratification by correcting for known population structures through minor allele frequencies (MAFs). In the simulated gene-level association studies under unbalanced settings, our method recovered up to 85% power loss caused by the standard method. We further showed the power gain of our method in gene-level association studies with 26 unbalanced real studies of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). In addition, we took the meta-analysis of three studies of type 2 diabetes (T2D) as an example to discuss the challenges of meta-analyzing multi-ethnic samples. In summary, we propose improved single-variant score statistics in meta-analysis, requiring \\\"accurate\\\" population-specific MAFs for multi-ethnic studies. These improved score statistics can be used to construct both single-variant and gene-level association studies, providing a useful framework for ensuring well-powered, convenient, cross-study analyses.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive genetic diversity of HIV-1 in chronic infection, infant HIV-1 infection involves selective transmission of a single or few maternal virus variants. These transmitted/founder (T/F) variants are of particular interest, as a maternal or infant HIV vaccine should raise envelope (Env)-specific IgG responses capable of blocking this group of viruses. However, the maternal or infant factors that contribute to selection of infant T/F viruses are not well understood. In this study, we isolated HIV-1 env genes by single genome amplification from 16 mother-infant transmitting pairs from the U.S. pre-antiretroviral era Women Infant Transmission Study (WITS). Infant T/F and representative maternal non-transmitted Env variants from plasma were identified and used to generate pseudoviruses for paired maternal plasma neutralization sensitivity analysis. Eighteen out of 21 (85%) infant T/F Env pseudoviruses were neutralization resistant to paired maternal plasma. Yet, all infant T/F viruses were neutralization sensitive to a panel of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies and variably sensitive to heterologous plasma neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, infant T/F pseudoviruses were overall more neutralization resistant compared to maternal non-transmitted plasma variants (p=0.012). Altogether, our findings suggest that autologous neutralization of circulating viruses by maternal plasma antibodies select for neutralization-resistant viruses that initiate peripartum transmission, raising the spector that enhancement of this response at the end of pregnancy could further reduce infant HIV infection risk.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 can occur during pregnancy (in utero), at the time of delivery (peripartum) or by breastfeeding (postpartum). With the availability of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), rate of MTCT of HIV-1 have been significantly lowered. However, significant implementation challenges remains in resource-poor areas, making it difficult to eliminate pediatric HIV. An improved understanding of the viral population (escape variants from autologous neutralizing antibodies) that lead to infection of infants at time of transmission will help in designing immune interventions to reduce vertical HIV-1 transmission. Here, we selected 16 HIV-1-infected mother-infant pairs from WITS cohort (from pre anti-retroviral era), where infants became infected peripartum. HIV-1 env gene sequences were obtained by the single genome amplification method. The sensitivity of these infant Env pseudoviruses against paired maternal plasma and a panel of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) was analyzed. We demonstrated that the infant T/F viruses were more resistant against maternal plasma than non-transmitted maternal variants, but sensitive to most (bNAbs). Signature sequence analysis of infant T/F and non-transmitted maternal variants revealed the potential importance of V3 and MPER region for resistance against to paired maternal plasma. These findings provide insights for the design of maternal immunization strategies to enhance neutralizing antibodies that target V3 region of autologous virus populations, which could work synergistically with maternal ARVs to further reduce the rate of peripartum HIV-1 transmission.",

    "abstract": "Somewhere along the cortical hierarchy, behaviorally relevant information is distilled from raw sensory inputs. We examined how this transformation progresses along multiple levels of the hierarchy by comparing neural representations in visual, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices in monkeys categorizing across three visual domains (shape, motion direction, color). Representations in visual areas MT and V4 were tightly linked to external sensory inputs. In contrast, lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) largely represented the abstracted behavioral relevance of stimuli (task rule, motion category, color category). Intermediate-level areas--posterior inferotemporal (PIT), lateral intraparietal (LIP), and frontal eye fields (FEF)--exhibited mixed representations. While the distribution of sensory information across areas aligned well with classical functional divisions--MT carried stronger motion information, V4 and PIT carried stronger color and shape information--categorical abstraction did not, suggesting these areas may participate in different networks for stimulus-driven and cognitive functions. Paralleling these representational differences, the dimensionality of neural population activity decreased progressively from sensory to intermediate to frontal cortex. This shows how raw sensory representations are transformed into behaviorally relevant abstractions and suggests that the dimensionality of neural activity in higher cortical regions may be specific to their current task.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe earliest stages of processing in cerebral cortex reflect a relatively faithful copy of sensory inputs, but intelligent behavior requires abstracting behaviorally relevant concepts and categories. We examined how this transformation progresses through multiple levels of the cortical hierarchy by comparing neural representations in six cortical areas in monkeys categorizing across three visual domains. We found that categorical abstraction occurred in a gradual fashion across the cortical hierarchy and reached an apex in prefrontal cortex. Categorical coding did not respect classical models of large-scale cortical organization. The dimensionality of neural population activity was reduced in parallel with these representational changes. Our results shed light on how raw sensory inputs are transformed into behaviorally relevant abstractions.",

    "abstract": "While anatomical pathways between forebrain cognitive and brainstem autonomic nervous centers are well defined, autonomic-central interactions during sleep and their contribution to waking performance are not understood. Here, we analyzed simultaneous central activity via electroencephalography (EEG) and autonomic heart beat-to-beat intervals (RR intervals) from electrocardiography (ECG) during wake and daytime sleep. We identified bursts of ECG activity that lasted 4-5 seconds and predominated in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM). Using event-based analysis of NREM sleep, we found an increase in delta (0.5-4Hz) and sigma (12-15Hz) power and an elevated density of slow oscillations (0.5-1Hz) about 5 secs prior to peak of the heart rate burst, as well as a surge in vagal activity, assessed by high-frequency (HF) component of RR intervals. Using regression framework, we show that these Autonomic/Central Events (ACE) positively predicted post-nap improvement in a declarative memory task after controlling for the effects of spindles and slow oscillations from sleep periods without ACE. No such relation was found between memory performance and a control nap. Additionally, NREM ACE negatively correlated with REM sleep and learning in a non-declarative memory task. These results provide the first evidence that coordinated autonomic and central events play a significant role in declarative memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory studies of value-based decision-making often involve choosing among a few discrete actions. Yet in natural environments, we encounter a multitude of options whose values may be unknown or poorly estimated. Given that our cognitive capacity is bounded, in complex environments, it becomes hard to solve the challenge of whether to exploit an action with known value or search for even better alternatives. In reinforcement learning, the intractable exploration/exploitation tradeoff is typically handled by controlling the temperature parameter of the softmax stochastic exploration policy or by encouraging the selection of uncertain options.\\n\\nWe describe how selectively maintaining high-value actions in a manner that reduces their information content helps to resolve the exploration/exploitation dilemma during a reinforcement-based timing task. By definition of the softmax policy, the information content (i.e., Shannons entropy) of the value representation controls the shift from exploration to exploitation. When subjective values for different response times are similar, the entropy is high, inducing exploration. Under selective maintenance, entropy declines as the agent preferentially maps the most valuable parts of the environment and forgets the rest, facilitating exploitation. We demonstrate in silico that this memory-constrained algorithm performs as well as cognitively demanding uncertainty-driven exploration, even though the latter yields a more accurate representation of the contingency.\\n\\nWe found that human behavior was best characterized by a selective maintenance model. Information dynamics consistent with selective maintenance were most pronounced in better-performing subjects, in those with higher non-verbal intelligence, and in learnable vs. unlearnable contingencies. Entropy of value traces shaped human exploration behavior (response time swings), whereas uncertainty-driven exploration was not supported by Bayesian model comparison. In summary, when the action space is large, strategic maintenance of value information reduces cognitive load and facilitates the resolution of the exploration/exploitation dilemma.\\n\\nAuthor summaryA much-debated question is whether humans explore new options at random or selectively explore unfamiliar options. We show that uncertainty-driven exploration recovers a more accurate picture of simulated environments, but typically does not lead to greater success in foraging. The alternative approach of mapping the most valuable parts of the world accurately while having only approximate knowledge of the rest is just as successful, requires less representational capacity, and provides a better explanation of human behavior. Furthermore, when searching among a multitude of response times, people cannot indefinitely maintain information about every experience. A good strategy for someone with limited memory capacity is to selectively maintain a valuable subset of options and gradually forget the rest. In simulated worlds, a player with this strategy was as successful as a player that represented all previous experiences. When learning a time-varying contingency, humans behaved in a manner consistent with a selective maintenance account. The amount of information retained under this strategy is high early in learning, encouraging exploration, and declines after one has discovered valuable response times.",

    "abstract": "Spindle oscillations are brief oscillatory activity during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Spindle density and synchronization properties are different in MEG versus EEG recordings in humans and also vary with learning performance, suggesting spindle involvement in memory consolidation. Using computational models, we identified network mechanisms that may explain differences in spindle properties across cortical structures. First, we report that differences in spindle occurrence between MEG and EEG data may arise from the properties of the core vs. matrix thalamocortical systems. The matrix system, projecting superficially, has wider thalamocortical fanout compared to the core system, projecting to the middle layers, and requires the recruitment of a larger population of neurons to initiate a spindle. Our model demonstrates that this property is sufficient to explain lower spindle density and higher spatial synchrony of spindles in the superficial cortical layers, as observed in the EEG signal. In contrast, spindles in the core system occurred more frequently but less synchronously, as observed in the MEG recordings. Futhermore, consistent with human recordings, in the model, spindles occurred independently in the core system but matrix system spindles commonly co-occurred with core one. We found that the intracortical excitatory connections from layer III/IV to layer V promote spindle propagation from the core to the matrix system, leading to widespread spindle activity. Our study predicts that plasticity of the intra and inter cortical connectivity can potentially be a mechanism for increasing in spindle density as observed during learning.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe density of sleep spindles has been shown to correlate with memory consolidation. Further, sleep spindles occur more often in human MEG than EEG. We developed thalamocortical network model that is capable of spontaneous generation of spindles across cortical layers and that captures the essential statistical features of spindles observed in experiments. We predict that differences in thalamo-cortical connectivity, known from anatomical studies, lead to the differences in the spindle properties between EEG and MEG as observed in human recordings. Further, we predict that the intracortical connectivity between cortical layers, a property influenced by sleep preceding learning, increases spindle density. Results from our study highlight the role of cortical and thalamic projections on the occurrence and properties of spindles.",

Since the underlying metabolic effects of these drugs are yet unknown, we investigated their synergism at the metabolome level in MCF-7 cells. As xenoestrogens interact with the ER, we additionally aimed at deciphering the impact of the phytoestrogen genistein, and the estrogenic mycotoxin zearalenone on this treatment. A global metabolomics approach was applied to unravel metabolite and pathway modifications. The results clearly showed that the combined effects of palbociclib and letrozole on cellular metabolism were far more pronounced than that of each agent alone and potently influenced by xenoestrogens. This behavior was confirmed in proliferation experiments and functional assays.

    "abstract": "Cell size control requires mechanisms that link cell growth with Cdk1 activity. In fission yeast, the protein kinase Cdr2 forms cortical nodes that include the Cdk1 inhibitor Wee1, along with the Wee1-inhibitory kinase Cdr1. We investigated how nodes inhibit Wee1 during cell growth. Biochemical fractionation revealed that Cdr2 nodes were megadalton structures enriched for activated Cdr2, which increases in level during interphase growth. In live-cell TIRF movies, Cdr2 and Cdr1 remained constant at nodes over time, but Wee1 localized to nodes in short bursts. Recruitment of Wee1 to nodes required Cdr2 kinase activity and the noncatalytic N-terminus of Wee1. Bursts of Wee1 localization to nodes increased 20-fold as cells doubled in size throughout G2. Size-dependent signaling was due in part to the Cdr2 inhibitor Pom1, which suppressed Wee1 node bursts in small cells. Thus, increasing Cdr2 activity during cell growth promotes Wee1 localization to nodes, where inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1 by Cdr1 and Cdr2 kinases promotes mitotic entry.\\n\\nSummaryCells turn off the mitotic inhibitor Wee1 to enter into mitosis.

    "abstract": "The interrelationship between microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in mechanoregulation of integrin-mediated adhesions is poorly understood. Here, we show that the effects of microtubules on two major types of cell-matrix adhesions, focal adhesions and podosomes, are mediated by KANK family proteins connecting the adhesion protein talin with microtubule tips. Both total microtubule disruption and microtubule uncoupling from adhesions by manipulations with KANKs trigger a massive assembly of myosin-IIA filaments. Myosin-IIA filaments, augmenting the focal adhesions and disrupting the podosomes, are indispensable effectors in the microtubule-dependent regulation of integrin-mediated adhesions. Myosin-IIA filament assembly depends on Rho activation by the RhoGEF, GEF-H1, which is trapped by microtubules when they are connected with integrin-mediated adhesions via KANK proteins but released after their disconnection. Thus, microtubule capturing by integrin-mediated adhesions modulates the GEF-H1-dependent effect of microtubules on the myosin-IIA filaments. Subsequent actomyosin reorganization then remodels the focal adhesions and podosomes, closing the regulatory loop.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrecipitation is predicted to become more variable in the western United States, meaning years of above and below average precipitation will become more common. Periods of extreme precipitation are major drivers of interannual variability in ecosystem functioning in water limited communities, but how ecosystems respond to these extremes over the long-term may shift with precipitation means and variances. Long-term changes in ecosystem functional response could reflect compensatory changes in species composition or species reaching physiological thresholds at extreme precipitation levels.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a five year precipitation manipulation experiment in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem in Idaho, United States. We used drought and irrigation treatments (approximately 50% decrease/increase) to investigate whether ecosystem functional response remains consistent under sustained high or low precipitation. We recorded data on aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), species abundance, and soil moisture. We fit a generalized linear mixed effects model to determine if the relationship between ANPP and soil moisture differed among treatments. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling to quantify community composition over the five years.\\n\\nResultsEcosystem functional response, defined as the relationship between soil moisture and ANPP, was similar among irrigation and control treatments, but the drought treatment had a greater slope than the control treatment. However, all estimates for the effect of soil moisture on ANPP overlapped zero, indicating the relationship is weak and uncertain regardless of treatment. There was also large spatial variation in ANPP within-years, which contributes to the uncertainty of the soil moisture effect. Plant community composition was remarkably stable over the course of the experiment and did not differ among treatments.\\n\\nDiscussionDespite some evidence that ecosystem functional response became more sensitive under sustained drought conditions, the response of ANPP to soil moisture was consistently weak and community composition was stable. The similarity of ecosystem functional responses across treatments was not related to compensatory shifts at the plant community level, but instead may reflect the insensitivity of the dominant species to soil moisture. These species may be successful precisely because they have evolved life history strategies which buffer them against precipitation variability.",

    "abstract": "A new approach to the coalescent, the fractional coalescent (f-coalescent), is introduced. Two derivations are presented: first, the f-coalescent is based on an extension of the discrete-time Wright-Fisher model. In this extension, for the population of size N, the probability that two randomly selected individuals have the same parent in the previous generation depends on the variable . Second, the f-coalescent is based on an extension of the discrete-time Canning population model that the variance of the number of offspring is assumed as a random variable which depends on the variable . In the second derivation, the f-coalescent emerges also as a continuous-time semi-Markov process. The additional parameter  affects the variability in the patterns of the waiting times; values of  < 1 lead to an increase of short time intervals, but allows occasionally for very long time intervals. When  = 1, the f-coalescent and Kingmans n-coalescent are equivalent. The mode of the distribution of the time of the most recent common ancestor in the f-coalescent is lower than n-coalescent when the number of sample size increases, and the time which modes happen on that is smaller compare to n-coalescent. Also, this distribution showed that the f-coalescent leads to distributions with heavier tails than the n-coalescent. Also, the probability that n genes descend from m ancestral genes for f-coalescent is derived. The f-coalescent has been implemented in the population genetic model inference software MO_SCPCAPIGRATEC_SCPCAP. Simulation studies suggest that it is possible to infer the correct  values from data that was generated with known  values. When data is simulated using models with  < 1 or for three example datasets (H1N1 influenza, Malaria parasites, Humpback whales), Bayes factor comparisons show an improved model fit of the f-coalescent over the n-coalescent.",

We dissect the contributions of each method to the improved understanding of relationships and functions within the well-characterized family of AGAMOUS floral development genes. The results obtained with the two methods largely agreed with one another. In particular, we show how network approaches can provide improved interpretations of branches with low support in a conventional gene tree.

    "abstract": "Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US. While environment has undeniable impact, evidence suggests genetic factors play a significant role in completed suicide. We linked a resource of >4,500 DNA samples from completed suicides obtained from the Utah Medical Examiner to genealogical records and medical records data available on over 8 million individuals. This linking has resulted in the identification of high-risk extended families (7-9 generations) with significant familial risk of completed suicide. Familial aggregation across distant relatives minimizes effects of shared environment, provides more genetically homogeneous risk groups, and magnifies genetic risks through familial repetition. We analyzed Illumina PsychArray genotypes from suicide cases in 43 high-risk families, identifying 30 distinct shared genomic segments with genome-wide evidence (p=2.02E-07 to 1.30E-18) of segregation with completed suicide. The 207 genes implicated by the shared regions provide a focused set of genes for further study; 18 have been previously associated with suicide risk. While PsychArray variants do not represent exhaustive variation within the 207 genes, we investigated these for specific segregation within the high-risk families, and for association of variants with predicted functional impact in ~1300 additional Utah suicides unrelated to the discovery families. None of the limited PsychArray variants explained the high-risk family segregation; sequencing of these regions will be needed to discover segregating risk variants, which may be rarer or regulatory. However, additional association tests yielded four significant PsychArray variants (SP110, rs181058279; AGBL2, rs76215382; SUCLA2, rs121908538; APH1B, rs745918508), raising the likelihood that these genes confer risk of completed suicide.",

Therefore, the causes of these mutations need to be further investigated. In 2015, Iyer et al.3 (referred to as Study_2) used Cas9 and a pair of sgRNAs to mutate the Ar gene in vivo and off-target mutations were investigated by comparison the control mice and the offspring of the modified mice. After analyzing the whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the offspring and the control mice, they claimed that off-target mutations are rare from CRISPR-Cas9 engineering.

Unfortunately, most genome-wide association studies use genotyping arrays and European samples. Here, we integrate whole genome sequence data from global populations, results from thousands of GWAS, and extensive computer simulations to identify how genetic disease risks can be misestimated.\\n\\nResultsIn contrast to null expectations, we find that risk allele frequencies at known disease loci are significantly different for African populations compared to other continents. Strikingly, ancestral risk alleles are found at 9.51% higher frequency in Africa and derived risk alleles are found at 5.40% lower frequency in Africa. By simulating GWAS with different study populations, we find that non-African cohorts yield disease associations that have biased allele frequencies and that African cohorts yield disease associations that are relatively free of bias. We also find empirical evidence that genotyping arrays and SNP ascertainment bias contribute to continental differences in risk allele frequencies. Because of these causes, polygenic risk scores can be grossly misestimated for individuals of African descent. Importantly, continental differences in risk allele frequencies are only moderately reduced if GWAS use whole genome sequences and hundreds of thousands of cases and controls. Finally, comparisons between uncorrected and corrected genetic risk scores reveal the benefits of considering whether risk alleles are ancestral or derived.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results imply that caution must be taken when extrapolating GWAS results from one population to predict disease risks in another population.",

When H. pylori encounters host cells, however, the bacterium elaborates rigid, membranous tubes perforated by lateral ports.

Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels are increasingly popular for this application due to their low cost and ease of use. PEG hydrogels can elicit chronic inflammation upon implantation, but recent evidence has suggested that extremely hydrophilic, zwitterionic hydrogels can reduce the FBR to particles and gels. To expand on this approach, we synthesized hydrogels of co-monomers PEG and the zwitterion phosphorylcholine (PC) to quantify the combinatorial effects of modulus and hydrophilicity on the FBR. Surprisingly, hydrogels with the highest amount of zwitterionic co-monomer elicited the highest FBR we observed. Lowering the hydrogel modulus (165 kPa to 3 kPa), or PC content (20 wt% to 0 wt%), mitigated this effect. A high density of macrophages was found at the surface of implants associated with a high FBR, and mass spectrometry analysis of the proteins adsorbed to these gels implicated extracellular matrix, immune response, and cell adhesion protein categories as drivers of macrophage recruitment to these hydrogels. Overall, we show that modulus regulates macrophage adhesion to zwitterionic-PEG hydrogels, and demonstrate that chemical modifications to hydrogels should be studied in parallel with their physical properties to optimize implant design.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIModulus and zwitterion content independently modulate the foreign body response to soft hydrogels\\nC_LIO_LISoft PEG hydrogels synthesized with the zwitterionic PC co-monomer are pro-inflammatory as modulus is increased\\nC_LIO_LIThe chemical and physical properties of hydrogels influence the foreign body response via macrophage recruitment and protein adsorption\\nC_LI",

Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli genome specifically implicates avoidance of intra-molecular base-pairing with the SD sequence.

    "abstract": "BackgroundTargeted therapies are based on exploiting cancer-cell-specific genetic features or phenotypic traits to selectively kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unaffected. Oxidative stress is a cancer hallmark phenotype. Given that free nucleotide pools are particularly vulnerable to oxidation, the nucleotide pool sanitising enzyme, MTH1, is potentially conditionally essential in cancer cells. However, findings from previous MTH1 studies have been contradictory, meaning the relevance of MTH1 in cancer is still to be determined. Here we ascertained the role of MTH1 specifically in lung cancer cell maintenance, and the potential of MTH1 inhibition as a targeted therapy strategy to improve lung cancer treatments.\\n\\nMethodUsing siRNA-mediated knockdown or small-molecule inhibition, we tested the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of MTH1 deficiency on H23 (p53-mutated), H522 (p53-mutated) and A549 (wildtype p53) non-small cell lung cancer cell lines relative to normal MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. We also assessed if MTH1 inhibition augments current therapies.\\n\\nResultsMTH1 knockdown increased levels of oxidatively damaged DNA and DNA damage signaling alterations in all lung cancer cell lines but not normal fibroblasts, despite no detectable differences in reactive oxygen species levels between any cell lines. Furthermore, MTH1 knockdown reduced H23 cell proliferation. However, unexpectedly, it did not induce apoptosis in any cell line or enhance the effects of gemcitabine, cisplatin or radiation in combination treatments. Contrastingly, TH287 and TH588 MTH1 inhibitors induced apoptosis in H23 and H522 cells, but only increased oxidative DNA damage levels in H23, indicating that they kill cells independently of DNA oxidation and seemingly via MTH1-distinct mechanisms.\\n\\nConclusionsMTH1 has a NSCLC-specific p53-independent role for suppressing DNA oxidation and genomic instability, though surprisingly the basis of this may not be reactive-oxygen-species-associated oxidative stress. Despite this, overall our cell viability data indicates that targeting MTH1 will likely not be an across-the-board effective NSCLC therapeutic strategy; rather it induces non-cytotoxic DNA damage that could promote cancer heterogeneity and evolution.",
