    "abstract": "Gene conversion is the copying of genetic sequence from a \\\"donor\\\" region to an \\\"acceptor\\\". In non-allelic gene conversion (NAGC), the donor and the acceptor are at distinct genetic loci. Despite the role NAGC plays in various genetic diseases and the concerted evolution of gene families, the parameters that govern NAGC are not well-characterized. Here, we survey duplicate gene families and identify converted tracts in 46% of them. These conversions reflect a large GC-bias of NAGC. We develop a sequence evolution model that leverages substantially more information in duplicate sequences than used by previous methods and use it to estimate the parameters that govern NAGC in humans: a mean converted tract length of 250bp and a probability of 2.5x10-7 per generation for a nucleotide to be converted (an order of magnitude higher than the point mutation rate). Despite this high baseline rate, we show that NAGC slows down as duplicate sequences diverge--until an eventual \\\"escape\\\" of the sequences from its influence. As a result, NAGC has a small average effect on the sequence divergence of duplicates. This work improves our understanding of the NAGC mechanism and the role that it plays in the evolution of gene duplicates.",

    "abstract": "Over 80% of multiple tested siRNAs and shRNAs targeting CD95 or CD95 ligand (CD95L) induce a form of cell death characterized by simultaneous activation of multiple cell death pathways preferentially killing transformed and cancer stem cells. We now show these si/shRNAs kill cancer cells through canonical RNAi by targeting the 3UTR of critical survival genes in a unique form of off-target effect we call DISE (death induced by survival gene elimination). Drosha and Dicer deficient cells, devoid of most miRNAs, are hypersensitive to DISE, suggesting cellular miRNAs protect cells from this form of cell death. By testing 4666 shRNAs derived from the CD95 and CD95L mRNA sequences and an unrelated control gene, Venus, we have identified many toxic sequences - most of them located in the open reading frame of CD95L. We propose that using specific toxic RNAi-active sequences present in the genome can kill cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "From foraging for food to learning complex games, many aspects of human behaviour can be framed as a search problem with a vast space of possible actions. Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using a variety of bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, where the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across a variety of diifferent probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian Process function learning--combined with an optimistic Upper Confidence Bound sampling strategy--provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable, and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Despite widespread taxonomic representation, the function of gene body methylation (GBM) remains uncertain. One hypothesis is that GBM mediates phenotypic plasticity. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed whole-genome methylation and transcriptome profiling on reciprocally transplanted colony fragments of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora. GBM was only slightly affected by transplantation but these small changes correlated with coral fitness in the new environment. Specifically, for transplanted corals, similarity in GBM patterns to native corals positively correlated with growth rate, as well as carbohydrate, protein, lipid and endosymbiont content. Between populations, elevated GBM positively correlated with transcription, supporting previous findings that GBM is associated with stable and active transcription. Contrary to expectations however, changes in transcription as a result of transplantation did not correlate with changes in GBM and did not predict fitness. This indicates that on physiological time scales GBM is not directly coupled to transcription, leaving open the question about the mechanism linking GBM to fitness during acclimatization.",

    "abstract": "Memory reprocessing following acquisition enhances memory consolidation. Specifically, neural activity during encoding is thought to be  replayed during subsequent slow-wave sleep (SWS). This natural tendency of memory replay can be induced by external cueing, known as \\\"targeted memory reactivation\\\". Here, we analyzed data from a published study (van Dongen, Takashima, et al. 2012), where auditory cues reactivated learned visual object-location memories during SWS. Memory replay during sleep presumably involves a shift in connectivity across the brain. Therefore, we characterized the effects of memory reactivation on brain network connectivity using graph-theory. We found that cue presentation during SWS introduced increased network integration of the occipital cortex, a visual region that was also active during the object retrieval task. Importantly, enhanced network integration of the occipital cortex showed a behavioural benefit and predicted overnight memory stabilization. Furthermore, occipital cortex displayed enhanced connectivity with mnemonic regions, namely the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex during cue versus control sound presentation. Finally, network integration of early occipital cortex during cueing in SWS was related to increased activation of the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, a region involved in coding for spatial associative information, at the post-sleep test. Together, these results support a neural mechanism where cue-induced replay during sleep promotes memory consolidation by increased integration of task-relevant perceptual regions with mnemonic regions.",

We analyzed RADseq data for the protected foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii) throughout its native range in California and Oregon, including many of the same localities included in an earlier study based on mitochondrial DNA. We recovered five primary clades that correspond to geographic regions within California and Oregon, with better resolution and more spatially consistent patterns than the previous study, confirming the increased resolving power of genomic approaches compared to single-locus analyses. Bayesian clustering, PCA and population differentiation with admixture analyses all indicated that approximately half the range of R. boylii consists of a single, relatively uniform population, while regions in the Sierra Nevada and Central Coast Range of California are deeply differentiated genetically. Additionally, a major methodological challenge for large genome organisms, including many amphibians, is deciding on sequence similarity clustering thresholds for population genetic analyses using RADseq data, and we develop a novel set of metrics that allow researchers to set a sequence similarity threshold that maximizes the separation of paralogous regions while minimizing the oversplitting of naturally occurring allelic variation within loci.",

    "abstract": "Reef-building corals are highly sensitive to rising ocean temperatures, and substantial adaptation will be required for animals and the ecosystems they support to persist in changing ocean conditions. Genetic variation that might support adaptive responses has been measured in larval stages of some corals, but these estimates remain unavailable for adult corals and the functional basis of this variation remains unclear. In this study, we focused on the potential for adaptation in Orbicella faveolata, a dominant reef-builder in the Caribbean. We conducted thermal stress experiments using corals collected from natural populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama, and used multilocus SNP genotypes to estimate genetic relatedness among samples. This allowed us to estimate narrow-sense heritability of variation in bleaching responses, revealing that this variation was highly heritable (h2=0.91). This estimate suggests substantial potential for adaptive responses to warming by natural populations of O. faveolata in this region. To investigate the functional basis for this variation, we applied genomic and transcriptomic approaches enabled by expanding sequence resources for this species. We used a genetic linkage map we have recently developed to map associations between SNP genotypes and bleaching responses, and identified four genetic markers associated with bleaching. We also profiled gene expression in corals with contrasting bleaching phenotypes, uncovering substantial variation in responses to thermal stress between heat-tolerant and heat-susceptible corals. Integrating these genomic and transcriptomic data with quantitative genetic analysis provides a new perspective on the mechanistic basis for thermal tolerance phenotypes and the potential for adaptation to rising ocean temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina, Mane) are important models for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) studies. Their infectability with minimally modified HIV makes them a uniquely valuable animal model to mimic human infection with HIV and progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, variation in the pig-tailed macaque major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and the impact of individual transcripts on the pathogenesis of HIV and other infectious diseases is understudied compared to rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. In this study, we used Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time circular consensus sequencing to describe full-length MHC class I (MHC-I) transcripts for 194 pig-tailed macaques from three breeding centers. We then used the full-length sequences to infer Mane-A and Mane-B haplotypes containing groups of MHC-I transcripts that co-segregate due to physical linkage. In total, we characterized full-length open reading frames (ORFs) for 313 Mane-A, Mane-B, and Mane-I sequences that defined 86 Mane-A and 106 Mane-B MHC-I haplotypes. Pacific Biosciences technology allows us to resolve these Mane-A and Mane-B haplotypes to the level of synonymous allelic variants. The newly defined haplotypes and transcript sequences containing full-length ORFs provide an important resource for infectious disease researchers as certain MHC haplotypes have been shown to provide exceptional control of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication and prevention of AIDS-like disease in nonhuman primates. The increased allelic resolution provided by Pacific Biosciences sequencing also benefits transplant research by allowing researchers to more specifically match haplotypes between donors and recipients to the level of nonsynonymous allelic variation, thus reducing the risk of graft-versus-host disease.",

We have sequenced 300 genomes from Niger-Congo populations from six sub-Saharan African countries (Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Guinea) and a Nilo-Saharan population from Uganda. Of these, we analysed 289 samples for population structure, genetic admixture, population history and signatures of selection. These samples were collected as part of the TrypanoGEN consortium project [1].\\n\\nResultsThe population genetic structure of the 289 individuals revealed four clusters, which correlated with ethno-linguistic group and geographical latitude. These were the West African Niger-Congo A, Central African Niger-Congo B, East African Niger-Congo B and the Nilo-Saharan. We observed a spatial distribution of positive natural selection signatures in genes previously associated with AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and Human African Trypanosomiasis among the TrypanoGEN samples. Having observed a marked difference between the Nilo-Saharan Lugbara and Niger-Congo populations, we identified four genes (APOBEC3G, TOP2B, CAPN9, LANCL2), which are highly differentiated between the two ethnic groups and under positive selection in the Lugbara population (_iHS -log p > 3.0, Rsb -log p > 3.0, Fst > 0.1 bonferroni p > 1.8x10e4).\\n\\nConclusionThe signatures that differentiate ethnically distinct populations could provide information on the specific ecological adaptations with respect to disease history and susceptibility/resistance.

In the A(X)nB rule, A and B items are linked but assigned to different positional categories and separated by distractor items. Open questions are how widespread is the ability to extract positional regularities from A(X)nB patterns, which strategies are used to encode positional regularities and whether individuals exhibit preferences for absolute or relative position encoding. We used visual arrays to investigate whether cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) can learn this rule and which strategies they use. After training on a subset of exemplars, half of the tested monkeys successfully generalized to novel combinations. These tamarins discriminated between categories of tokens with different properties (A, B, X) and detected a positional relationship between non-adjacent items even in the presence of novel distractors. Generalization, though, was incomplete, since we observed a failure with items that during training had always been presented in reinforced arrays. The pattern of errors revealed that successful subjects used visual similarity with training stimuli to solve the task, and that tamarins extracted the relative position of As and Bs rather than their absolute position, similarly to what observed in other species. Relative position encoding appears to be the default strategy in different tasks and taxa.",

    "abstract": "The PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain is highly expanded and diversified in metazoan where it is known to assemble diverse signalling components by virtue of interactions with other proteins in sequence-specific manner. In contrast, in bacteria it monitors protein quality control during stress response. The distribution, functions and origin of PDZ domain-containing proteins in prokaryotes are largely unknown. We analyzed 7,852 PDZ domain-containing proteins in 1,474 prokaryotes and fungi. PDZ domains are abundant in eubacteria; and, this study confirms their occurrence also in archaea and fungi. Of all eubacterial PDZ domain-containing proteins, 89% are predicted to be membrane and periplasmic, explaining the depletion of bacterial domain forms in metazoan. Planctomycetes, myxobacteria and other eubacteria occupying terrestrial and aquatic niches encode more domain copies, which may have contributed towards multi-cellularity and prokaryotic-eukaryotic transition. Over 93% of the 7,852 PDZ-containing proteins classified into 12 families including 6 novel families. Out of these 88% harbour eight different protease domains, suggesting their substrate-specificity is guided by PDZ domains. The genomic context provides tantalizing insight towards the functions associated with PDZ domains and reinforces their involvement in protein synthesis. We propose that the highly variable PDZ domain of the uncharacterized Fe-S oxidoreductase superfamily, exclusively found in gladobacteria and several anaerobes and acetogens, may have preceded all existing PDZ domains.",

Here we report on some of the particular challenges experienced while creating and using a ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon library for an ecological study. Two significant complications were encountered. First, artificial differences in read abundances among OTUs were observed, apparently resulting from bias at two stages: PCR amplification of genomic DNA with ITS-region Illumina-sequence-adapted-primers, and during Illumina sequencing. These differential read abundances were only partially corrected by a common variance-stabilization method. Second, tag-switching (or the shifting of amplicons to incorrect sample indices) occurred at high levels in positive mock-community controls. An example of a bioinformatic method to estimate the rate of tag switching is shown, some recommendations on the use of positive controls and primer choice are given, and one approach to reducing potential false positives resulting from these technological biases is presented.",

The death receptor CD95 and its ligand CD95L contain multiple sequences that when expressed as either si-or shRNAs kill cancer cells through a defined OTE that targets critical survival genes. Death induced by survival gene elimination (DISE) is characterized by specific morphological changes such as elongated cell shapes, senescence-like enlarged cells, appearance of large intracellular vesicles, release of mitochondrial ROS followed by activation of caspase-2, and induction of a necrotic form of mitotic catastrophe. Using genome-wide shRNA lethality screens with eight different cancer cell lines, we recently identified 651 genes as critical for the survival of cancer cells. To determine whether the toxic shRNAs targeting these 651 genes contained shRNAs that kill cancer cell through DISE rather than by silencing their respective target genes, we tested all shRNAs in the TRC library derived from a subset of these genes targeting tumor suppressors (TS). We now report that only by monitoring the responses of cancer cells following expression of shRNAs derived from these putative TS it was possible to identify DISE-inducing shRNAs in five of the genes. These data indicate that DISE in general is not an undefined toxic response of cells caused by a random OTE but rather a specific cellular response with shared features that points at a specific biological function involving multiple genes in the genome.",

    "abstract": "Off-target effects (OTE) are an undesired side effect of RNA interference (RNAi) caused by partial complementarity between the targeting siRNA and mRNAs other than the gene to be silenced. The death receptor CD95 and its ligand CD95L contain multiple sequences that when expressed as either si-or shRNAs kill cancer cells through a defined OTE that targets critical survival genes. Death induced by survival gene elimination (DISE) is characterized by specific morphological changes such as elongated cell shapes, senescence-like enlarged cells, appearance of large intracellular vesicles, release of mitochondrial ROS followed by activation of caspase-2, and induction of a necrotic form of mitotic catastrophe. Using genome-wide shRNA lethality screens with eight different cancer cell lines, we recently identified 651 genes as critical for the survival of cancer cells. To determine whether the toxic shRNAs targeting these 651 genes contained shRNAs that kill cancer cell through DISE rather than by silencing their respective target genes, we tested all shRNAs in the TRC library derived from a subset of these genes targeting tumor suppressors (TS). We now report that only by monitoring the responses of cancer cells following expression of shRNAs derived from these putative TS it was possible to identify DISE-inducing shRNAs in five of the genes. These data indicate that DISE in general is not an undefined toxic response of cells caused by a random OTE but rather a specific cellular response with shared features that points at a specific biological function involving multiple genes in the genome.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAnalysis of ecological networks is a valuable approach to understanding the vulnerability of systems to environmental change. The tolerance of ecological networks to co-extinctions, resulting from sequences of primary extinctions, is a widely-used tool for modelling network  robustness. Previously, these  extinction models have been developed for and applied mostly to binary networks and recently used to predict cascades of co-extinctions in plant-pollinator networks. There is a need for robustness models that can make the most of the weighted data available and most importantly there is a need to understand how the structure of a network affects its robustness.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we developed a framework of extinction models for bipartite ecological networks (specifically plant-pollinator networks). In previous models co-extinctions occurred when nodes lost all their links, but by relaxing this rule (according to a set threshold) our models can be applied to binary and weighted networks, and can permit structurally correlated extinctions, i.e. the potential for avalanches of extinctions. We tested how the average and the range of robustness values is impacted by network structure and the impact of structurally-correlated extinctions sampling non-uniformly from the distribution of random extinction sequences.\\nC_LIO_LIWe found that the way that structurally-correlated extinctions are modelled impacts the results; our two ecologically-plausible models produce opposing effects which shows the importance of understanding the model. We found that when applying the models to networks with weighted interactions, the effects are amplified and the variation in robustness increases. Variation in robustness is a key feature of these extinction models and is driven by the structural heterogeneity (i.e. the skewness of the degree distribution) of nodes (specifically, plant nodes) in the network.\\nC_LIO_LIOur new framework of models enables us to calculate robustness with weighted, as well as binary, bipartite networks, and to make direct comparisons between models and between networks. This allows us to differentiate effects of the model and of the data (network structure) which is vital for those making ecological inferences from robustness models. The models can be applied to mutualistic and antagonistic networks, and can be extended to food webs.\\nC_LI",

Previous work showed that recombination did not increase adaptation, despite increasing variation relative to asexual controls. The effects of recombination were highly variable: one lineage was mostly derived from the donors, while another acquired almost no donor DNA. In most lineages, some regions showed repeated introgression and others almost none. Regions with high introgression tended to be near the donors origin of transfer sites. To determine whether introgressed alleles imposed a genetic load, we extended the experiment for 200 generations without recombination and sequenced whole-population samples. Beneficial alleles in the recipient populations were occasionally driven extinct by maladaptive donor-derived alleles. On balance, our analyses indicate that the plasmid-mediated recombination was sufficiently frequent to drive donor alleles to fixation without providing much, if any, selective advantage.",

Here we present a rainfall-manipulation experiment with 517 whole-genome sequenced natural accessions of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana spanning the global distribution of the species. The experiments were conducted in two field stations in contrasting climates, in the Mediterranean and in Central Europe, where we built rainout shelters and simulated high and low rainfall. Using custom image analysis we quantified fitness- and phenology-related traits for 23,154 pots, which contained about 14,500 plants growing independently, and over 310,000 plants growing in small populations (max. 30 plants). This large field experiment dataset, which associates fitness and ecologically-relevant traits with genomes, will provide an important resource to test eco-evolutionary genetic theories and to understand the potential evolutionary impacts of future climates on an important plant model species.",

    "abstract": "Crop improvement must accelerate to feed an increasing human population in the face of environmental changes. Breeding programs can include anticipated climatic changes and genetic architecture to optimize improvement strategies. We analyzed the genetic architecture underlying the response of Zea mays to combinations of water and nitrogen stresses. Recombinant inbreds were subjected to nine combinations of the two stresses using an optimized response surface design, and their growth was measured. Three-dimensional dose response surfaces were fit globally and to each polymorphic allele to determine which genetic markers were associated with different response surfaces. Three quantitative trait loci that produced nonlinear surfaces were mapped. Alleles that performed better in combinations of mid-range stresses were typically not the alleles that performed best under combinations of extreme stresses. To develop physiologically relevant models for future genetic analyses, we modeled the network that explains the response surfaces. The network contains two components, an elliptical paraboloid and a plane, that each combine the nitrogen and water inputs. The relative weighting of the two components and the inputs is governed by five parameters. We estimated parameter values for the smoothed surfaces from the experimental lines using a set of points that covered the most distinctive regions of the three-dimensional surfaces. Surfaces computed using these values reproduced the smoothed experimental surfaces well, especially in the neighborhood of the peaks, as judged by three different criteria. The parameters exaggerated the amplitudes of the simulated surfaces. Experiments using single stresses could misestimate responses to their combinations and disguise loci that respond nonlinearly. The three-dimensional shape evaluation strategy used here more thoroughly compares nonlinear, nonplanar responses. We encourage the application of our findings and methods to experiments that mix crop protection measures, stresses, or both, on elite and landrace germplasm.",

Both resting stages arise without mutation and both have been linked to chronic infections; however, persister cells revive rapidly whereas the cell population called VBNC is reported to not resuscitate. Here we investigated the relatedness of the two stress-induced phenotypes at the single-cell level by using transmission electron microscopy and fluorescent microscopy to examine cell morphology and by quantifying cell resuscitation. Using the classic starvation conditions to create VBNC cells, we found that the majority of the remaining Escherichia coli population are spherical, have empty cytosol, and fail to resuscitate; however, some of the spherical cells under these classic VBNC-inducing conditions resuscitate immediately (most probably those with dense cytosol). Critically, all the culturable cells became persister cells within 14 days of starvation. We found that the persister cells initially are rodlike, have clear but limited membrane damage, can resuscitate immediately, and gradually become spherical by aging. After 24 h, only rod-shaped persister cells survive, and all the spherical cells lyse. Both cell populations formed under the VBNC-inducing conditions and the persister cells are metabolically inactive. Therefore, the bacterial population consists of dead cells and persister cells in the VBNC-inducing conditions; i.e., the non-lysed particles that do not resuscitate are dead, and the dormant cells that resuscitate are persister cells. Hence, \\\"VBNC\\\" and \\\"persister\\\" describe the same dormant phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a common environmental yeast and opportunistic pathogen responsible for 15% of AIDS-related deaths worldwide. Mortality primarily results from meningoencephalitis, which occurs when fungal cells disseminate from the initial pulmonary infection site and spread to the brain. A key C. neoformans virulence trait is the polysaccharide capsule. Capsule shields C. neoformans from immune-mediated recognition and destruction. The main capsule component, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), is found both attached to the cell surface and free in the extracellular space (as exo-GXM). Exo-GXM accumulates in patient serum and cerebrospinal fluid at g/mL concentrations, has well-documented immunosuppressive properties, and correlates with poor patient outcomes. However, it is poorly understood whether exo-GXM release is regulated or the result of shedding during normal capsule turnover. We demonstrate that exo-GXM release is regulated by environmental cues and inversely correlates with surface capsule levels. We identified genes specifically involved in exo-GXM release that do not alter surface capsule thickness. The first mutant, liv7{triangleup}, released less GXM than wild-type cells when capsule is not induced. The second mutant, cnag_00658{triangleup}, released more exo-GXM under capsule-inducing conditions. Exo-GXM release observed in vitro correlated with polystyrene adherence, virulence, and fungal burden during murine infection. Additionally, we find that exo-GXM reduces cell size and capsule thickness in capsule-inducing conditions, potentially influencing dissemination. Finally, we demonstrated that exo-GXM prevents immune cell infiltration into the brain during disseminated infection and highly inflammatory intracranial infection. Our data suggest that exo-GXM performs a different role from capsule GXM during infection, altering cell size and suppressing inflammation.\\n\\nImportanceCryptococcus neoformans is a leading cause of life-threatening meningoencephalitis in humans. C. neoformans cells produce an immunosuppressive polysaccharide, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), that is the main component of a protective surface capsule. GXM is also released free into extracellular space as exo-GXM, although the distinction between cell-attached GXM and exo-GXM has been unclear. Exo-GXM influences the outcome of infection, is the basis for current diagnostic tools, and has potential therapeutic applications. This study increases our basic understanding of the fungal biology that regulates polysaccharide release, suggesting that the release of cell-attached GXM and exo-GXM are distinctly regulated. We also introduce a new concept that exo-GXM may alter cell body and capsule size, thereby influencing dissemination in the host. Finally, we provide experimental evidence to confirm clinical observations that exo-GXM influences inflammation during brain infection.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of feedback into a persons body schema is well established. The crossmodal congruency effect (CCE) task is used to objectively quantify incorporation without being susceptible to experimenter biases. This visual-tactile interference task is used to calculate the CCE score as a difference in response time for incongruent and congruent trials. Here we show that this metric is susceptible to a learning effect that causes attenuation of the CCE score due to repeated task exposure sessions. We demonstrate that this learning effect is persistent, even after a 6 month hiatus in testing. Two mitigation strategies are proposed: 1. Only use CCE scores that are taken after learning has stabilized, or 2. Use a modified CCE protocol that decreases the task exposure time. We show that the modified and shortened CCE protocol, which may be required to meet time or logistical constraints in laboratory or clinical settings, reduced the impact of the learning effect on CCE results. Importantly, the CCE scores from the modified protocol were not significantly more variable than results obtained with the original protocol. This study highlights the importance of considering exposure time to the CCE task when designing experiments and suggests two mitigation strategies to improve the utility of this psychophysical assessment.",

Sixteen patients with schizophrenia and sixteen controls were exposed to peripheral digits with various degrees of visibility, under conditions of either focused attention or distraction by another task. In the distraction condition, the brain activity evoked by masked digits was drastically reduced in both groups, but early bottom-up visual activation could still be detected and did not differ between patients and controls. By contrast, under focused top-down attention, a major impairment was observed: in patients, contrary to controls, the late non-linear ignition associated with the P3 component was reduced. Interestingly, the patients showed an essentially normal attentional amplification of the PI and N2 components. These results suggest that some but not all top-down attentional amplification processes are impaired in schizophrenia, while bottom-up processing seems to be preserved.",

These pathways are known to be critical for the acquisition of complex sensorimotor skills, such as the ability to learn a coordinated sequence of actions. Thus, individual differences in obesity should be associated with reduced efficiency of learning sequential skills. Here we measured long-term sequence learning across five days of training on the serial reaction time task in a cohort of neurologically healthy adults (N=30) with body types ranging from lean to obese. As expected, individuals with a greater degree of central adiposity, measured as central waist circumference, exhibited slower rates of learning, across all training days, than their leaner counterparts. This association between learning and central adiposity was restricted to response speeds, but not accuracy. These findings show that obesity is negatively associated with the efficiency of learning a long-term sequential skill, possibly due to previously observed associations between obesity and general basal ganglia function.",

Although there is no widely accepted definition of propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS), PRIS is defined as the development of metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, hepatomegaly, renal failure, arrhythmia, and progressive cardiac failure. In vitro evidence suggests that PRIS is related to the impaired mitochondrial function. There are indications that preexisting mitochondrial disorders predispose to PRIS. However, the precise molecular mechanisms, including mitochondrial defects and a metabolic conversion by propofol, are largely unknown as yet. To elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of PRIS, we investigated the effects of propofol on the cellular metabolic mode and cell death. We demonstrated that clinically relevant concentrations of propofol, used within a clinically relevant exposure time, suppressed the mitochondrial function, caused the generation of reactive oxygen species, and induced a metabolic switch, from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, by targeting complexes I and III of mitochondria. The data also indicated that a predisposition to mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by a genetic mutation or pharmacological suppression of the electron transport chain by biguanides such as metformin and phenformin, promoted the cell death and caspase activation induced by propofol.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication occurs in a defined temporal order known as the replication-timing (RT) program and is regulated during development, coordinated with 3D genome organization and transcriptional activity. However, transcription and RT are not sufficiently coordinated to predict each other, suggesting an indirect relationship. Here, we exploit genome-wide RT profiles from 15 human cell types and intermediate differentiation stages derived from human embryonic stem cells to construct different types of RT regulatory networks. First, we constructed networks based on the coordinated RT changes during cell fate commitment to create highly complex RT networks composed of thousands of interactions that form specific functional sub-network communities. We also constructed directional regulatory networks based on the order of RT changes within cell lineages and identified master regulators of differentiation pathways. Finally, we explored relationships between RT networks and transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), by combining them into more complex circuitries of composite and bipartite networks, revealing novel trans interactions between transcription factors and downstream RT changes that were validated with ChIP-seq data. Our findings suggest a regulatory link between the establishment of cell type specific TRNs and RT control during lineage specification.",

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin is the paradigm of cooperative protein-ligand binding. Cooperativity is the consequence of inter-subunit allosteric communication: binding at one site increases the affinity of the others. Despite half a century of studies, the mechanism behind oxygen binding in hemoglobin is not fully understood yet. In particular, it is not clear if cooperativity arises from preferential inter-subunit channels and which residues propagate the allosteric signal from one heme to the others. In this work, the heme-heme dynamical interactions have been mapped through a network-based analysis of residue conformational fluctuations, as described by molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, it was possible to suggest which inter-subunit interactions are mostly responsible of allosteric signalling and, within each pair of subunits, which protein fragments convey such signalling process.",

We recently found that these sh/siRNAs kill cancer cells in the absence of the target by targeting the 3UTRs of critical survival genes through canonical RNAi. We have named this unique form of off-target effect DISE (for death induced by survival gene elimination). DISE preferentially kills transformed cells and cancer stem cells. We demonstrate that DISE induction occurs in cancer cells in vivo after introducing a lentiviral CD95L derived shRNA (shL3) into HeyA8 ovarian cancer cells grown as i.p. xenografts in mice, when compared to a scrambled shRNA. To demonstrate the possibility of therapeutically inducing DISE, we coupled siRNAs to templated lipoprotein nano particles (TLP). In vitro, TLPs loaded with a CD95L derived siRNA (siL3) selectively silenced a biosensor comprised of Venus and CD95L ORF and killed ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, two siRNA-TLPs (siL2-TLP and siL3-TLP) reduced tumor growth similarly as observed for cells expressing the shL3 vector. These data suggest that it is possible to kill ovarian cancer cells in vivo via DISE induction using siRNA-TLPs.",

    "abstract": "Ambient temperature influences plant growth and development and minor changes can substantially impact crop yields. The underlying mechanisms for temperature perception and response are just beginning to emerge. Chromatin remodeling via the eviction of the histone variant H2A.Z in nucleosomes that alters gene expression is a critical component of thermal response in plants. However, whether chromatin-remodeling processes such as histone modifications play a global role in thermal response remains unknown. Using a combination of genetic analysis, chemical inhibition studies and RNA-seq analysis coupled with meta-analysis, here we identify POWERDRESS (PWR), a SANT-domain containing protein that is known to interact with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9 (HDA9), as a novel key factor required for thermomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identify that mutations in PWR impede thermomorphogenesis exemplified by severely attenuated temperature-induced hypocotyl/petiole elongation and early flowering. We show that inhibitors of histone deacetylases diminish temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation, which demonstrates for the first time a requirement for histone deacetylation in thermomorphogenesis. Genes that are misregulated in pwr mutants showed enrichment for GO terms associated with \\\"response\\\". Our expression studies coupled with meta-analysis revealed a significant overlap between genes misregulated in pwr mutants and genes that are enriched for H2A.Z in their gene bodies. Meta-analyses reveal that genes misregulated in pwr mutants in diverse conditions also overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in the mutants of the components of the SWR1 complex that mediates H2A.Z nucleosome dynamics. Our findings thus uncover a role for PWR in facilitating thermal response and suggest a potential link between histone deacetylation and H2A.Z nucleosome dynamics in regulation of gene expression in plants.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPlant growth and development is influenced by a variety of external environmental cues. Ambient temperature affects almost all stages of plant development but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this paper, the authors show that histone deacetylation, one of the major chromatin remodeling processes, is essential for eliciting growth temperature-induced responses in plants. The authors identify POWERDRESS, a protein known to interact with HISTONE DEACETYLASE 9, as a novel key player essential for eliciting high temperature induced responses in Arabidopsis. Another chromatin remodeling mechanism that is known to play a role in thermal response is the eviction of histone variant H2A.Z from nucleosomes. Through transcriptome studies the authors demonstrate an overlap between gene regulations conferred through PWR-mediated histone H3 deacetylation and that conferred via histone H2A.Z eviction/incorporation dynamics. This study identifies a key novel gene that is essential for plants to elicit high temperature responses and reveals close links between two seemingly distinct chromatin-remodeling processes in regulating gene expression in plants.",

    "abstract": "Computations on proteome sequence databases show that most proteins can be identified from a proteins isoelectric point (IEP) and digitized linear sequence volume (equal to the total volume of its residues). This is illustrated with four proteomes: H. pylori (1553 proteins), E. coli (4306 proteins), S. cerevisiae (6721 proteins), and H. sapiens (20207 proteins); the identification rate exceeds 90% in all four cases for appropriate parameter values. IEP can be obtained with 1-d gel electrophoresis (GE), whose accuracy is better than 0.01. Linear protein sequence volumes of unbroken proteins can be obtained with a sub-nanometer diameter nanopore that can measure residue volume with a resolution of 0.07-0.1 nm3 (Kennedy et al., Nature Nanotech., 2016, 11, 968-976; Dong et al., ACS Nano, 2017, doi: 10.1021/acsnano.6b08452); the blockade current due to a translocating protein is roughly proportional to the volume it excludes in the pore. There is no need to identify any of the residues. More than 90% of all the proteins have estimated translocation times higher than 1 s, which is within the time resolution of available detectors. This is a minimalist proteolysis-free GE-and nanopore-based single-molecule approach requires very small samples, is non-destructive (the sample can be recovered for reuse), and can be translated with currently available technology into a portable device for possible use in the field, an academic lab, or a pre-screening step preceding conventional mass spectrometry.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the rate of evolutionary change and the genetic architecture that facilitates rapid adaptation is a current challenge in evolutionary biology. Comparative studies show that genes with immune function are among the most rapidly evolving genes in a range of taxa. Here, we use immune defense in natural populations of D. melanogaster to understand the rate of evolution in natural populations and the genetics underlying the rapid change. We probed the immune system using the natural pathogens Enterococcus faecalis and Providencia rettgeri to measure post-infection survival and bacterial load of wild D. melanogaster populations collected across seasonal time along a latitudinal transect on the eastern North America (Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia). There are pronounced and repeatable changes in the immune response over approximately 10 generations between the spring and fall populations with a significant but less distinct difference among geographic locations. Genes with known immune function are not enriched among alleles that cycle with seasonal time, but the immune function of a subset of seasonally cycling alleles in immune genes was tested using reconstructed outbred populations. We find that flies containing seasonal alleles in Thioester-containing protein 3 (Tep3) have different functional responses to infection and that epistatic interactions among seasonal Tep3 and Drosomycin-like 6 (Dro6) alleles produce the immune phenotypes observed in natural populations. This rapid, cyclic response to seasonal environmental pressure broadens our understanding of the complex ecological and genetic interactions determining the evolution of immune defense in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Human information processing is limited in capacity. To prevent sensory overload, expectation of upcoming events has been suggested to allocate processing resources to task-relevant regions (e.g., visual system), at the expense of processing in task-irrelevant regions (e.g., auditory system). In support of this, for tasks involving a high visual perceptual load (e.g. visual target search within physically similar distractors), auditory evoked responses were found to be attenuated1. This EEG study aimed to further elucidate the neural mechanisms by which the brain prepares for sensory overload. We investigated how expectancy about visual load modulated neural activity, prior to the onset of visual stimuli. Visual load in a letter search task was manipulated by varying the target letters similarity to the remaining letters and the letter set size from which flankers were randomly drawn. Importantly, audio-visual cues signaled the likely visual load of the upcoming stimulus-array, manipulating expectancy about visual task load. Cues signaling high visual load elicited attenuated auditory-evoked responses and increased alpha activity over task-irrelevant (auditory) regions, suggesting a functional inhibition of those regions already prior to the arrival of the visual array to suppress auditory cue processing. We also observed a sustained posterior positivity in the ERPs after high perceptual load cues, whose amplitude correlated with reaction times, suggestive of resource allocation for the upcoming visual targets. Expectation about visual load may thus prepare the attentional system both by facilitating target processing and task execution and inhibiting irrelevant sensory processing, thus providing efficient means to overcome attentional limits in situations with complex visual input.",

We addressed this issue by comparing the neural pattern similarities among object-evoked fMRI responses with behavior-based models that independently captured the visual and conceptual similarities among these stimuli. Our results revealed evidence for distinctive coding of visual features in lateral occipital cortex, and conceptual features in the temporal pole and parahippocampal cortex. By contrast, we found evidence for integrative coding of visual and conceptual object features in perirhinal cortex. The neuroanatomical specificity of this effect was highlighted by results from a searchlight analysis. Taken together, our findings suggest that perirhinal cortex uniquely supports the representation of fully-specified object concepts through the integration of their visual and conceptual features.",

We demonstrate that phasic optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons throughout the midbrain, when presented in temporal association with discrete sensory cues, is sufficient to instantiate those cues as conditioned stimuli that subsequently both evoke dopamine neuron activity on their own, and elicit cue-locked conditioned behaviors. Critically, we identify highly parcellated behavioral functions for dopamine neuron subpopulations projecting to discrete regions of striatum, revealing dissociable mesostriatal systems for the generation of incentive value and movement invigoration. These results show that dopamine neurons orchestrate Pavlovian conditioning via functionally heterogeneous, circuit-specific motivational signals to shape cue-controlled behavior.",

    "abstract": "Murid rodents (Rodentia: Myomorpha: Muroidea: Muridae) represent the most diverse and abundant mammalian group. In this study, we reconstruct a dated phylogeny of the family using a multilocus dataset (six nuclear and nine mitochondrial gene fragments) encompassing 160 species representing 82 distinct murid genera from four extant subfamilies (Deomyinae, Gerbillinae, Lophiomyinae, and Murinae). In comparison with previous studies on murid or muroid rodents, our work stands out for the implementation of multiple fossil constraints within the Muridae thanks to a thorough review of the fossil record. Before being assigned to specific nodes of the phylogeny, all potential fossil constraints were carefully assessed; they were also subjected to several cross-validation analyses. The resulting phylogeny is consistent with previous phylogenetic studies on murids, and recovers the monophyly of all sampled murid subfamilies and tribes. Based on nine controlled fossil calibrations, our inferred temporal timeframe indicates that the murid family likely originated in the course of the Early Miocene, 23.0-16.0 million years ago (Ma), and that most major lineages (i.e. tribes) have started diversifying ca. 10 Ma. Historical biogeography analyses support the Paleotropical origin for the family, with an initial internal split (vicariance event) followed by subsequent migrations between Afrotropical and Indomalayan lineages. During the course of their diversification, the biogeographic pattern of murids is marked by several dispersal events toward the Australasian and the Palearctic regions, mostly from the Indomalaya. The Afrotropical region was also secondarily colonized at least three times from the Indomalaya, indicating that the latter region has acted as a major centre of diversification for the family.",

To employ CNN, the input DNA sequences are required to be encoded as numerical values and represented as either vectors or multi-dimensional matrices. This paper evaluates a simple and more compact ordinal encoding method versus the popular one-hot encoding for DNA sequences. We compare the performances of both encoding methods using three sets of datasets enriched with DNA motifs. We found that the ordinal encoding performs comparable to the one-hot method but with significant reduction in training time. In addition, the one-hot encoding performances are rather consistent across various datasets but would require suitable CNN configuration to perform well. The ordinal encoding with matrix representation performs best in some of the evaluated datasets. This study implies that the performances of CNN for DNA motif discovery depends on the suitable design of the sequence encoding and representation. The good performances of the ordinal encoding method demonstrates that there are still rooms for improvement for the one-hot encoding method.",

    "abstract": "Chronic infection by oncogenic Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) leads to cancers. Public health interventions, such as cancer screening and mass vaccination, radically change the ecological conditions encountered by circulating viruses. It is currently unclear how HPVs communities may respond to these environmental changes, because little is known about their ecology. Predicting the impact on viral diversity by the introduction of HPV vaccines requires answering the unresolved question of how HPVs interact. Although it is commonly believed that they do not interact (neutral theory), there are suggestions that HPV types may compete for resources or via the immune response (niche-based or non-neutral theory). Here, we applied for the first time established biodiversity measures and methods to epidemiological data in order to assess whether niche-partitioning or neutral processes are shaping HPV diversity patterns at the population level. We find that as infections progress toward cancer, HPVs communities become more uneven and a few HPVs play a stronger dominance role. By fitting species abundance distributions, we found that neutral models were always out-performed by non-neutral distributions, both in asymptomatic infections and in cancers. Our results suggest that temporally moving from a more even to a less even community implies an increase in competition, probably due to environmental changes linked to infection progression. More ecological thinking will be required to understand present-day interactions and to anticipate the future of the long lasting interactions between HPVs and humans.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHuman papillomaviruses (HPVs) are very diverse. Infections by HPVs are very common and chronic infections may lead to cancers. The more oncogenic HPVs are now targetted by effective vaccines, and this has raised the question of whether there may be a viral replacement if these dominant types were removed. This is a medical version of a classical ecological controversy, namely how much biodiversity distributions and community dynamics are explained by neutral theory plays out across ecosystems. For HPVs, epidemiologic studies before and after the vaccination have led to the widespread belief that these viruses do not interact. Here, we apply different methods developed in macroecology to the best available epidemiologic data to address this issue. Consistently, we find that HPVs form non-neutral communities. Instead, competitive niche-partitioning process and dominance explain best HPVs communities. We also find that the vaccine might not change such competitive niche processes. Beyond clinical implications, this garners support that niche processes often best explain biodiversity patterns, even in human viral communities.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has induced pronounced shifts in the reproductive phenology of plants, with the timing of first flowering advancing in most species. Indeed, population persistence may be threatened by the inability to track climate change phenologically. Nevertheless, substantial variation exists in biological responses to climate change across taxa. Here, we explore the consequences of climate change for flowering phenology by integrating data from a long-term observational study and a manipulative experiment under contemporary conditions. Dissecting the environmental factors that influence phenological change will illuminate why interspecific variation exists in responses to climate change. We examine a 43-year record of first flowering for six species in subalpine meadows of Colorado in conjunction with a 3-year snow manipulation experiment on the perennial mustard Boechera stricta from the same site. We analyze shifts in the onset of flowering in relation to environmental drivers known to influence phenology: the timing of snowmelt, the accumulation of growing degree days, and photoperiod. At our study site, climate change is reducing snowpack and advancing the timing of spring snowmelt. We found that variation in phenological responses to climate change depended on the sequence in which species flowered, with early-flowering species flowering faster, at a lower heat sum, and under increasingly disparate photoperiods in comparison to species that flower later in the season. Furthermore, climate change is outpacing phenological change for all species. Early snow removal treatments confirm that the timing of snowmelt governs observed trends in flowering phenology of B. stricta and that climate change can reduce the probability of flowering, thereby depressing fitness. Shorter-term studies would not have captured the trends that we document in our observational and experimental datasets. Accurate predictions of the biological responses to climate change require a thorough understanding of the specific environmental factors driving shifts in phenology.",

Fish were sampled twice a year between 2004 and 2015. We found that in 3 out of 4 populations, a few years of data (3 or 4 sampling occasions, between 300 and 500 tagged individuals for survival, 100 to 200 for growth) provided the same estimates of average survival and growth as those obtained with data from more than 15 sampling occasions, while the estimation of the range of survival required more sampling occasions (up to 22 for marble trout), with little reduction of uncertainty around the point estimates. Predictions of mean density and variation in density over time did not change with more data collected after the first 5 years (i.e., 10 sampling occasions) and overall were within 10% of the observed mean and variation in density over the whole monitoring program.",

    "abstract": "The biota of the Japanese Archipelago is divided into the Palearctic and Oriental realms by the Watase line (Tokara gap), a major biogeographic boundary of Japan. This boundary is generally placed between Akusekijima and Kodakarajima Islands of the Tokara Archipelago, and has been the subject of many biogeographic debates. However, despite being widely accepted, the position of the boundary is doubtful because of a lack of clear evidence. Here, to verify the definition and existence of the biogeographic boundary, we performed a documentary search and beta diversity analysis of multiple taxa. Our documentary search suggested that the Watase line (Tokara gap) should be put between Yakushima/Tanegashima and Amamioshima Islands, but recent references to it clearly deviate from its original definition, and that the placement of the boundary line between Akusekijima and Kodakarajima Islands is based on limited and biased evidence. Our beta diversity analyses found no common biogeographic boundary dividing the Tokara Archipelago into two realms, and showed that the beta diversity pattern of this region is explained by the areas and geographic distances of the islands in agreement with the general principles of island biogeography. The widespread misunderstanding of biogeography in this region could have been perpetuated by preconception and the citation of references without verification. Our study proposes that revision of the biogeography in the Tokara Archipelago, a gap region between the Palearctic and Oriental realms, is necessary and demonstrates the negative influence of preconception in biogeographic debate.",

    "abstract": "Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is a Neglected Tropical Disease. Long regarded as an invariably fatal disease, there is increasing evidence that infection by T. b. gambiense can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes, including latent infections, which are long lasting infections with no parasites detectable by microscopy. The determinants of this clinical diversity are not well understood but could be due in part to parasite or host genetic diversity in multiple genes, or their interactions. A candidate gene association study was conducted in Cote dIvoire using a case-control design which included a total of 233 subjects (100 active HAT cases, 100 controls and 33 latent infections). All three possible pairwise comparisons between the three phenotypes were tested using 96 SNPs in16 candidate genes (IL1, IL4, IL4R, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, IL12R, TNFA, INFG, MIF, APOL1, HPR, CFH, HLA-A and HLA-G). Data from 77 SNPs passed quality control. There were suggestive associations at three loci in IL6 and TNFA in the comparison between active cases and controls, one SNP in each of APOL1, MIF and IL6 in the comparison between latent infections and active cases and seven SNP in IL4, HLA-G and TNFA between latent infections and controls. No associations remained significant after Bonferroni correction, but the Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate test indicated that there were strong probabilities that at least some of the associations were genuine.\\n\\nThe excess of associations with latent infections despite the small number of samples available suggests that these subjects form a distinct genetic cluster different from active HAT cases and controls, although no clustering by phenotype was observed by principle component analysis. This underlines the complexity of the interactions existing between host genetic polymorphisms and parasite diversity.\\n\\nAuthor summarySince it was first identified, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness has been described as invariably fatal. Recent data however suggest that infection by T. b. gambiense can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes in its human host including long lasting infections, that can be detected by the presence of antibodies, but in which parasites cannot be seen by microscopy; these cases are known as latent infections. While the factors determining this varied response have not been clearly characterized, the effectors of the immune responses have been partially implicated as key players. We collected samples from people with active HAT, latent infections and controls in endemic foci in the Cote dIvoire. We tested the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 genes on susceptibility/resistance to HAT by means of a candidate gene association study. There was some evidence that variants of the genes for IL4, IL6, APOL1, HLAG, MIF and TNFA modified the risk of developing HAT. These proteins regulate the inflammatory response to many infections or are directly involved in killing the parasites. In this study, the results were statistically weak and would be inconclusive on their own, however other studies have also found associations in these genes, increasing the chance that the variants that we have identified play a genuine role in the response to trypanosome infection in Cote DIvoire.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genome assembly remains a challenge in part because of the prevalence of complex DNA repeats. This is a particularly acute problem for holocentric nematodes because of the large number of satellite DNA sequences found throughout their genomes. These have been recalcitrant to most genome sequencing methods. At the same time, many nematodes are parasites and some represent a serious threat to human health. There is a pressing need for better molecular characterization of animal and plant parasitic nematodes. The advent of long-read DNA sequencing methods offers the promise of resolving complex genomes. Using Nippostrongylus brasiliensis as a test case, applying improved base-calling algorithms and assembly methods, we demonstrate the feasibility of de novo genome assembly matching current community standards using only MinION long reads. In doing so, we uncovered an unexpected diversity of very long and complex DNA repeat sequences, including massive tandem repeats of tRNA genes. The method has the added advantage of preserving haplotypic variants and so has the potential to be used in population analyses.",

    "abstract": "The behavioral effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) are often nonlinear; factors such as stimulation intensity and brain state can modulate the impact of TMS on observable behavior in qualitatively different manner. Here we propose a theoretical framework to account for these effects. In this model, there are distinct intensity ranges for facilitatory and suppressive effects of TMS: low intensities facilitate neural activity and behavior whereas high intensities induce suppression. The key feature of the model is that these ranges are shifted by changes in neural excitability: consequently, a TMS intensity, which normally induces suppression, can have a facilitatory effect if the stimulated neurons are being inhibited. For example, adaptation reduces excitability of adapted neurons; the outcome is that TMS intensities which inhibit non-adapted neurons induce a facilitation on adapted neural representations, leading to reversal of adaptation effects. In conventional virtual lesion paradigms, similar effects occur because neurons not tuned to the target stimulus are inhibited. The resulting reduction in excitability can turn high intensity inhibitory TMS to low intensity facilitatory TMS for these neurons (whereas neurons tuned to the target stimulus are inhibited), leading to a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio. Thus differential excitability levels of neural populations contributing to behavior, combined with nonlinear neural effects, can explain how TMS modulates behavior.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently emerged as promising models of human vision based on their ability to predict hemodynamic brain responses to visual stimuli measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the degree to which CNNs can predict temporal dynamics of visual object recognition reflected in neural measures with millisecond precision is less understood. Additionally, while deeper CNNs with higher numbers of layers perform better on automated object recognition, it is unclear if this also results into better correlation to brain responses. Here, we examined 1) to what extent CNN layers predict visual evoked responses in the human brain over time and 2) whether deeper CNNs better model brain responses. Specifically, we tested how well CNN architectures with 7 (CNN-7) and 15 (CNN-15) layers predicted electro-encephalography (EEG) responses to several thousands of natural images. Our results show that both CNN architectures correspond to EEG responses in a hierarchical spatio-temporal manner, with lower layers explaining responses early in time at electrodes overlying early visual cortex, and higher layers explaining responses later in time at electrodes overlying lateral-occipital cortex. While the explained variance of neural responses by individual layers did not differ between CNN-7 and CNN-15, combining the representations across layers resulted in improved performance of CNN-15 compared to CNN-7, but only after 150 ms after stimulus-onset. This suggests that CNN representations reflect both early (feed-forward) and late (feedback) stages of visual processing. Overall, our results show that depth of CNNs indeed plays a role in explaining time-resolved EEG responses.",
