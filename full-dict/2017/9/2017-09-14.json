    "abstract": "Chemical cues are arguably the most fundamental means of animal communication and play an important role in mate choice and kin recognition. Consequently, gas chromatography (GC) in combination with either mass spectrometry (MS) or flame ionisation detection (FID) are commonly used to characterise complex chemical samples. Both GC-FID and GC-MS generate chromatograms comprising peaks that are separated according to their retention times and which represent different substances. Across chromatograms of different samples, homologous substances are expected to elute at similar retention times. However, random and often unavoidable experimental variation introduces noise, making the alignment of homologous peaks challenging, particularly with GC-FID data where mass spectral data are lacking. Here we present GCalignR, a user-friendly R package for aligning GC-FID data based on retention times. The package also implements dynamic visualisations to facilitate inspection and fine-tuning of the resulting alignments, and can be integrated within a broader workflow in R to facilitate downstream multivariate analyses. We demonstrate an example workflow using empirical data from Antarctic fur seals and explore the impact of user-defined parameter values by calculating alignment error rates for multiple datasets. The resulting alignments had low error rates for most of the explored parameter space and we could also show that GCalignR performed equally well or better than other available software. We hope that GCalignR will help to simplify the processing of chemical datasets and improve the standardization and reproducibility of chemical analyses in studies of animal chemical communication and related fields.",

    "abstract": "Reticulate species evolution, such as hybridization or introgression, is relatively common in nature. In the presence of reticulation, species relationships can be captured by a rooted phylogenetic network, and orthologous gene evolution can be modeled as bifurcating gene trees embedded in the species network. We present a Bayesian approach to jointly infer species networks and gene trees from multilocus sequence data. A novel birth-hybridization process is used as the prior for the species network. We assume a multispecies network coalescent (MSNC) prior for the embedded gene trees. We verify the ability of our method to correctly sample from the posterior distribution, and thus to infer a species network, through simulations. We reanalyze a large dataset of genes from closely related spruces, and verify the previously suggested homoploid hybridization event in this clade. Our method is available within the BEAST 2 add-on SpeciesNetwork, and thus provides a general framework for Bayesian inference of reticulate evolution.",

Previous phenomenological studies of the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria have demonstrated strong positive sexual and fecundity selection on male and female size. Nevertheless, the body size of flies from a Swiss study population has declined by almost 10% from 1993 to 2009. Given substantial heritability of body size, this negative evolutionary response of an evidently positively selected trait suggests important selective factors being missed (e.g. size-selective predation or parasitism). A periodic epidemic outbreak of the fungus Entomophthora scatophagae allowedassessment of selection exerted by this parasite fatal to adult flies. Fungal infection varied over the season from ca. 50% in the cooler and more humid spring and autumn to almost 0% in summer. The probability of dying from fungal infection increased with adult body size. All infected females died before laying eggs, so there was no fungus impact on female fecundity beyond its impact on mortality. Large males showed the typical mating advantage in the field, but this pattern of positive sexual selection was nullified by fungal infection. Mean fluctuating asymmetry of paired appendages (legs, wings) did not affect the viability, fecundity or mating success of yellow dung flies in the field. This study demonstrates rare parasite-mediated disadvantages of large adult body size in the field. Reduced ability to combat parasites such as Entomophthora may be an immunity cost of large size in dung flies, although the hypothesized trade-off between fluctuating asymmetry, a presumed indicator of developmental instability and environmental stress, and immunocompetence was not found here.",

Although such theories have become very influential, evidence that physically attractive and unattractive women have different hormonal profiles is equivocal. Consequently, we investigated hypothesized relationships between salivary estradiol and progesterone and two aspects of womens physical attractiveness that are commonly assumed to be correlated with levels of these hormones: facial attractiveness (N=249) and waist-to-hip ratio (N=247). Our analyses revealed no evidence that women with more attractive faces or lower (i.e., more attractive) waist-to-hip ratios had higher levels of estradiol or progesterone. These results do not support the influential hypothesis that between-woman differences in physical attractiveness are related to estradiol and/or progesterone.",

We now show these si/shRNAs kill cancer cells through canonical RNAi by targeting the 3UTR of critical survival genes in a unique form of off-target effect we call DISE (death induced by survival gene elimination). Drosha and Dicer deficient cells, devoid of most miRNAs, are hypersensitive to DISE, suggesting cellular miRNAs protect cells from this form of cell death. By testing 4666 shRNAs derived from the CD95 and CD95L mRNA sequences and an unrelated control gene, Venus, we have identified many toxic sequences - most of them located in the open reading frame of CD95L.

    "abstract": "The evolutionary benefits of simultaneous polyandry (female multiple mating within a single reproductive event) remain elusive. One potential benefit could arise if polyandry alters sibship structures and consequent relationships and relatedness among females descendants, and thereby intrinsically reduces future inbreeding risk (the  indirect inbreeding avoidance hypothesis). However such effects have not been quantified in naturally complex reproductive systems that also encompass iteroparity, overlapping generations, sequential polyandry, and polygyny. We used long-term social and genetic pedigree data from song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify cross-generational consequences of simultaneous polyandry for offspring sibship structures and distributions of relationships and relatedness among possible mates. Simultaneous polyandry decreased full-sibships and increased half-sibships on average, but such effects varied among females and were smaller than would occur in the absence of sequential polyandry or polygyny. Further, while simultaneous polyandry decreased the overall frequencies of possible matings among adult full-sibs, it increased the frequencies of possible matings among adult half-sibs and more distant relatives. These results imply that the intrinsic consequences of simultaneous polyandry for inbreeding risk could cause weak indirect selection on polyandry, but the magnitude and direction of such effects will depend on complex interactions with other mating system components and the form of inbreeding depression.",

    "abstract": "Most breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis and treatment options beyond radiation and cytotoxic drugs, which have severe side effects, and hormonal treatments, which are or become ineffective for many patients, are urgently needed. This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), which had been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance.\\n\\nResults from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Healths \\\"Up For A Challenge\\\" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids via alpha-cyclodextrins (CD) as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of {beta}1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells).\\n\\nBeta-cyclodextrins ({beta}CD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller CDs also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-CD to be twice as effective as HP{beta}CD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.\\n\\nIf the previous successful animal studies with {beta}CDs are replicated with the safer and more effective CDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with CDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPCD, but women with triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively.",

Here, we reconcile this apparent contradiction by demonstrating that the generation of dendritic spikes, the emergence of an excitatory ramp in somatic voltage responses and sharp tuning of place-cell responses are all attainable even when iso-feature synapses are randomly dispersed across the dendritic arbor. We found this tuning sharpness to be critically reliant on dendritic sodium and transient potassium channels and on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Importantly, we demonstrate that synaptic potentiation targeted to afferents from one specific place field is sufficient to effectuate place-field selectivity even when intrinsically disparate neurons received randomly dispersed afferents from multiple place-field locations.

    "abstract": "Combining sensory inputs over space and time is fundamental to vision. Population receptive field models have been successful in characterizing spatial encoding throughout the human visual pathways. A parallel question--how visual areas in the human brain process information distributed over time--has received less attention. One challenge is that the most widely used neuroimaging method--fMRI--has coarse temporal resolution compared to the time-scale of neural dynamics. Here, via carefully controlled temporally modulated stimuli, we show that information about temporal processing can be readily derived from fMRI signal amplitudes in male and female subjects. We find that all visual areas exhibit sub-additive summation, whereby responses to longer stimuli are less than the linear prediction from briefer stimuli. We also find fMRI evidence that the neural response to two stimuli is reduced for brief interstimulus intervals (indicating adaptation). These effects are more pronounced in visual areas anterior to V1-V3. Finally, we develop a general model that shows how these effects can be captured with two simple operations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. This model operates for arbitrary temporal stimulation patterns and provides a simple and interpretable set of computations that can be used to characterize neural response properties across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, compressive temporal summation directly parallels earlier findings of compressive spatial summation in visual cortex describing responses to stimuli distributed across space. This indicates that for space and time, cortex uses a similar processing strategy to achieve higher-level and increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.\\n\\nSignificance statementCombining sensory inputs over time is fundamental to seeing. Two important temporal phenomena are summation, the accumulation of sensory inputs over time, and adaptation, a response reduction for repeated or sustained stimuli. We investigated these phenomena in the human visual system using fMRI. We built predictive models that operate on arbitrary temporal patterns of stimulation using two simple computations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. Our new temporal compressive summation model captures (1) subadditive temporal summation, and (2) adaptation. We show that the model accounts for systematic differences in these phenomena across visual areas. Finally, we show that for space and time, the visual system uses a similar strategy to achieve increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of brain tumors with distinct biological and clinical properties. Despite advances in surgical techniques and clinical regimens, treatment of high-grade glioma remains challenging and carries dismal rates of therapeutic success and overall survival. Challenges include the molecular complexity of gliomas, as well as inconsistencies in histopathological grading, resulting in an inaccurate prediction of disease progression and failure in the use of standard therapy. The updated 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system reflects a refinement of tumor diagnostics by integrating the genotypic and phenotypic features, thereby narrowing the defined subgroups. The new classification recommends the molecular diagnosis of the IDH mutational status in gliomas. IDH-mutant gliomas manifest the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (G-CIMP). Notably, the recent identification of clinically relevant subsets of G-CIMP tumors (G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low) provide a further refinement in glioma classification that is independent of grade and histology. This scheme may be useful for predicting patient outcome and may be translated into effective therapeutic strategies tailored to each patient. In this review, we highlight the evolution of our understanding of the G-CIMP subsets and how recent advances in characterizing the genome and epigenome of gliomas may influence future basic and translational research.\\n\\nConflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest",

We further implement an online BCI system for control of a virtual 3 degree-of-freedom prosthetic manipulator and test it with our 3 best participants. The participants ability to control the BCI is quantified by using the percentage of successfully completed BCI tasks, the time required to complete a task, and the error rate. 2 participants were able to successfully complete 100% of the test tasks, demonstrating on average the error rate of 80% and requiring 5-10 seconds to execute a manipulator move. 1 participant failed to demonstrate a satisfactory performance in online trials.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma exhibits profound intratumoral heterogeneity in blood perfusion, which may cause inconsistent therapy response. Particularly, low perfusion may create hypoxic microenvironment and induce resistant clones. Thus, developing validated imaging approaches that define low perfusion compartments is crucial for clinical management.\\n\\nMethodsA total of 112 newly-diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma patients were prospectively recruited for maximal safe resection. Preoperative MRI included anatomical, dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and chemical shift imaging (CSI). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were calculated from DTI and DSC respectively. Using thresholding methods, two low perfusion compartments (ADCH-rCBVL and ADCL-rCBVL) were identified. Volumetric analysis was performed. Lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels were determined from multivoxel spectroscopy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses.\\n\\nResultsTwo compartments displayed higher lactate and macromolecule/lipid levels than normal controls (each P < 0.001), suggesting hypoxic and pro-inflammatory microenvironment. The proportional volume of ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a larger infiltration area (P < 0.001, rho = 0.42). Lower lactate in this compartment was associated with a less invasive phenotype visualized on DTI. Multivariate Cox regression showed higher lactate level in the ADCL-rCBVL compartment was associated with a worse survival (PFS: HR 2.995, P = 0.047; OS: HR 4.974, P = 0.005).\\n\\nConclusionsThe ADCL-rCBVL compartment represent a treatment resistant sub-region associated with glioblastoma invasiveness.

    "abstract": "Pathogens are a driving force in evolution, giving rise to a diversity of host immune defenses. In order for a pathogen to spread in a population a sufficient number of its members must be susceptible to infection, as resistant individuals can prevent the spread of a pathogen among susceptible hosts in a process known as herd immunity. While herd immunity has been extensively studied in vertebrate populations, little is known about its role, if any, in the dynamics between bacteria and their phage pathogens. Here we explore the dynamics of T7 phage epidemics in structured and unstructured Escherichia coli populations consisting of differing mixtures of susceptible and resistant individuals harboring CRISPR immunity to the phage. Using both experiments and mathematical modelling we describe the conditions under which herd immunity arises in bacterial populations. Notably, the effects of herd immunity depend strongly on the presence of spatial structure in the population, the bacterial growth rate, and phage replication rate. The results of our model can apply to other host-pathogen systems to determine the herd immunity threshold from the relative speed of an epidemic wave in partially resistant populations. In addition, our findings suggest that herd immunity plays an important role in bacterial communities, as seen in other host-pathogen systems, allowing for stable coexistence of bacteria and their phages and the maintenance of polymorphism in bacterial immunity.",

    "abstract": "We all vary in our mental health, even among healthy (undiagnosed) individuals. Understanding this variability may reveal factors driving the onset of mental illness, as well as factors driving sub-clinical mental health problems that can still influence quality of life. To better understand the large-scale brain network mechanisms underlying this variability in mental health we examined the relationship between mental health symptoms and resting-state functional connectivity patterns in cognitive control systems. The frontoparietal cognitive control network (FPN) consists of flexible hubs that can regulate distributed systems depending on current goals, and dysfunction in the FPN has been identified in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Alterations in FPN connectivity may influence mental health by disrupting the ability to regulate symptoms in a goal-directed manner. This suggests that the FPN may play an important role in the promotion and maintenance of mental health generally. Here we test the hypothesis that disruptions in FPN connectivity are related to mental health (depression) symptoms even among healthy individuals. This hypothesis is consistent with a general role of FPN in the regulation of mental health symptoms. We found that depression symptoms were negatively correlated with between-network global connectivity (BGC) of the FPN as well as the default mode network (DMN). This suggests that decreased connectivity between the FPN (and, separately, DMN) and the rest of the brain is related to increased depression symptoms among undiagnosed individuals. These findings complement previous clinical studies to support the hypothesis that global FPN connectivity contributes to the regulation of mental health symptoms across both mentally healthy and unhealthy individuals.",

    "abstract": "Clonal populations of cells exhibit cell-to-cell variation in the transcription of individual genes. In addition to this \\\"noise\\\" in gene expression, heterogeneity in the proteome and the proteostasis network expands the phenotypic diversity of a population. Heat shock transcription factor (Hsf1) regulates chaperone gene expression, thereby coupling transcriptional noise to proteostasis. Here we show that cell-to-cell variation in Hsf1 activity is an important determinant of phenotypic plasticity. Budding yeast cells with high Hsf1 activity were enriched for the ability to acquire resistance to an antifungal drug, and this enrichment depended on Hsp90 - a known \\\"phenotypic capacitor\\\" and canonical Hsf1 target. We show that Hsf1 phosphorylation promotes cell-to-cell variation, and this variation - rather than absolute Hsf1 activity - promotes antifungal resistance.

    "abstract": "While it is a well-established finding that subjects own names (SON) or familiar voices are salient during wakefulness, we here investigated processing of environmental stimuli during sleep including deep N3 and REM sleep. Besides the effects of sleep depth we investigated how sleep-specific EEG patterns (i.e. sleep spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]) relate to stimulus processing. Using 256-channel EEG we studied processing of auditory stimuli by means of event-related oscillatory responses (de-/ synchronisation, ERD/ERS) and potentials (ERPs) in N = 17 healthy sleepers. We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (SON vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic emotional relevance (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice, FV/UFV). Results reveal that evaluation of voice familiarity continues during all NREM sleep stages and even REM sleep suggesting a  sentinel processing mode of the human brain in the absence of wake-like consciousness. Especially UFV stimuli elicit larger responses in a 1-15 Hz range suggesting they continue being salient. Beyond this, we find that sleep spindles and the negative slope of SOs attenuate information processing. However, unlike previously suggested they do not uniformly inhibit information processing, but inhibition seems to be scaled to stimulus salience.\\n\\nFundingCB is supported by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V. and CB, MW and DPJH are supported by a grant from the Austrian Science Fund FWF (Y-777).

    "abstract": "There are several functions that hikers can use to predict walking time based on elevation change or slope of the ground. The most commonly used is the Naismith function that was first published over 100 years ago. The availability of GPS devices to record tracks now make it possible to evaluate the performance of walking time functions. Four data sources were used: 98 tracks downloaded from the Wikiloc web site; 55 tracks recorded by the author; 19 tracks recorded by the blogger Iron Hiker; and 20 tracks recorded by the blogger Hiking Guy. The .gpx files were processed to generate segements of ~100m in length, with the associated segment duration and elevation change. The association between walking pace and elevation change was assessed in the Wikiloc data using linear spline regression. The performance of the linear spline function was then compared with the Naismith, Tobler and Laingmuir functions. The linear spline performed the best, but all four performed reasonably well. While the linear spline function could easily be programmed into the software of standard GPS devices, the Naismith function provides a simple-to-use rule-of-thumb for estimating walking time for a typical hike in the mountains.\\n\\nFundingNone\\n\\nAcknowledgementsI thank Chris Hazzard and Keith Wilson for sharing their hiking records and for helpful comments on the manuscript.\\n\\nDisclosure of interestsThe authors have no interest to disclose",

Modern sequencing technologies have led to an increased interest in MA experiments. By sequencing whole genomes from MA lines, researchers can directly study the rate and molecular spectra of spontaneous mutations and use these results to understand how mutation contributes to biological processes. At present there is no software designed specifically for identifying mutations from MA lines. Studies that combine MA with whole genome sequencing use custom bioinformatic pipelines that implement heuristic rules to identify putative mutations.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe O_SCPLOWACCUC_SCPLOWMUO_SCPLOWLATEC_SCPLOW, a program that is designed to detect mutations from MA experiments. O_SCPLOWACCUC_SCPLOWMUO_SCPLOWLATEC_SCPLOW implements a probabilistic model that reflects the design of a typical MA experiments while being flexible enough to accommodate properties unique to any particular experiment. For each putative mutation identified from this model O_SCPLOWACCUC_SCPLOWMUO_SCPLOWLATEC_SCPLOW calculates a set of summary statistics that can be used to filter sites that may be false positives. A companion tool, O_SCPLOWDENOMINATEC_SCPLOW, can be used to apply filtering rules based on these statistics to simulated mutations and thus identify the number of callable sites per sample.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code and releases available from https://github.com/dwinter/accuMUlate.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic islands play an important role in microbial genome evolution, providing a mechanism for strains to adapt to new ecological conditions. A variety of computational methods, both genome-composition based and comparative have been developed to identify them. Some of these methods are explicitly designed to work in single strains, while others make use of multiple strains. In general, existing methods do not identify islands in the context of the phylogeny in which they evolved. Even multiple strain approaches are best suited to identifying genomic islands that are present in one strain but absent in others. They do not automatically recognize islands which are shared between some strains in the clade or determine the branch on which these islands inserted within the phylogenetic tree.\\n\\nResultsWe have developed a software package, xenoGI, that identifies genomic islands and maps their origin within a clade of closely related bacteria, determining which branch they inserted on. It takes as input a set of sequenced genomes and a tree specifying their phylogenetic relationships. Making heavy use of synteny information, the package builds gene families in a species-tree-aware way, and then attempts to combine into islands those families whose members are adjacent and whose most recent common ancestor is shared. The package provides a variety of text-based analysis functions, as well as the ability to export genomic islands into formats suitable for viewing in a genome browser. We demonstrate the capabilities of the package with several examples from enteric bacteria, including an examination of the evolution of the acid fitness island in the genus Escherichia. In addition we use output from simulations and a set of known genomic islands from the literature to show that xenoGI can accurately identify genomic islands and place them on a phylogenetic tree.\\n\\nConclusionsxenoGI is an effective tool for studying the history of genomic island insertions in a clade of microbes. It identifies genomic islands, and determines which branch they inserted on within the phylogenetic tree for the clade. Such information is valuable because it helps us understand the adaptive path that has produced living species. Given the large and growing number of sequenced microbial genomes, this sort of analysis will become increasingly useful in the future.",

We analyze the distribution of somatic rearrangements across the cancer genome, using whole-genome sequencing data from 2,693 tumor-normal pairs. We observe substantial variation in the density of rearrangement breakpoints, with enrichment in open chromatin and sites with high densities of repetitive elements. After accounting for these patterns, we identify significantly recurrent breakpoints (SRBs) at 52 loci, including novel SRBs near BRD4 and AKR1C3. Taking into account both loci fused by a rearrangement, we observe different signatures resembling either single breaks followed by strand invasion or two separate breaks that become joined. Accounting for these signatures, we identify 90 pairs of loci that are significantly recurrently juxtaposed (SRJs). SRJs are primarily tumor-type specific and tend to involve genes with tissue-specific expression. SRJs were frequently associated with disruption of topology-associated domains, juxtaposition of enhancer elements, and increased expression of neighboring genes. Lastly, we find that the power to detect SRJs decreases for short rearrangements, and that reliable detection of all driver SRJs will require whole-genome sequencing data from an order of magnitude more cancer samples than currently available.",

Though widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical SNP dataset to demonstrate the impacts of minor allele frequency (MAF) thresholds on inference of population structure. We find that model-based inference of population structure is confounded when singletons are included in the alignment, and that both model-based and multivariate analyses infer less distinct clusters when more stringent MAF cutoffs are applied. We propose that this behavior is caused by the combination of a drop in the total size of the data matrix and by correlations between allele frequencies and mutational age. We recommend a set of best practices for applying MAF filters in studies seeking to describe population structure with genomic data.",

Detailed functional analysis has been performed for many types of motif in isolation, but less is known about how motifs work together to perform complex tasks. To address this issue we measure the aggregation of network motifs via methods that extract precisely how these structures are connected. Applying this approach to a broad spectrum of networked systems and focusing on the widespread feed-forward loop motif, we uncover striking differences in motif organisation. The types of connection are often highly constrained, differ between domains, and clearly capture architectural principles. We show how this information can be used to effectively predict functionally important nodes in the metabolic network of Escherichia coli.

While BRAF and MEK inhibitors are effective in many patients with oncogenic BRAF V600E, there are no effective targeted therapies for individuals with cancers driven by other pathway alterations, including oncogenic KRAS, non-V600E BRAF, and NF1 loss. Here, we show that targeting the PTPN11/SHP2 phosphatase with a novel small molecule allosteric inhibitor is effective against cancers bearing nucleotide-cycling oncogenic RAS (e.g. KRAS G12C), RAS-GTP dependent oncogenic BRAF (e.g. class 3 BRAF mutants), or NF1 loss in multiple preclinical models in vitro and in vivo. SHP2 inhibition suppressed the levels of RAS-GTP and phosphorylated ERK in these models and induced growth inhibition. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of the RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 rescued cells from the effects of SHP2 inhibition, suggesting that SHP2 blockade decreases oncogenic RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling by disrupting SOS1-mediated RAS-GTP loading. Our findings illuminate a critical function for SHP2 in promoting oncogenic RAS activation and downstream signaling in cancers with nucleotide-cycling oncogenic RAS, RAS-GTP dependent oncogenic BRAF, and NF1 loss. SHP2 inhibition thus represents a rational, biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy to be tested in patients with cancers of diverse origins bearing these oncogenic drivers and for which current treatments are largely ineffective.",

    "abstract": "The size of all cells, from bacteria to vertebrates, is proportional to the growth rate set by nutrient availability, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that nutrients modulate TORC2 signaling, and that cell size is proportional to TORC2 signaling in budding yeast. The TORC2 network controls production of ceramide lipids, which play roles in signaling. We discovered that ceramide-dependent signals control both growth rate and cell size. Thus, cells that can not make ceramides fail to modulate their growth rate or size in response to changes in nutrients. PP2A associated with the Rts1 regulatory subunit (PP2ARts1) is embedded in a feedback loop that controls TORC2 signaling and plays an important role in mechanisms that modulate TORC2 signaling in response to nutrients. Together, the data suggest a model in which growth rate and cell size are mechanistically linked by ceramide-dependent signals arising from the TORC2 network.",

    "abstract": "A central aim of ecology is understanding the mechanisms of community assembly. To address this problem, community assembly is often modeled as a sampling process, in which species are selected from a pool of available species, possibly with effects of interspecific interactions, habitat filtering, and other ecological mechanisms. However, the fundamental stochastic sampling process by which species are selected from the pool remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate the distinctness of four canonical sampling processes, the Bernoulli, Plackett-Luce, multinomial, and fractional multinomial processes. Each process can be affected by ecological mechanisms or it can occur in their absence. Although all four of the processes are a priori plausible and the first two are widely used in ecological models, we show that the multinomial and fractional multinomial processes broadly underlie community assembly.",

A major component of the response is a reduction in ribosome synthesis, which is accomplished by the synergistic action of DksA and ppGpp bound to RNA polymerase (RNAP) inhibiting transcription of rRNAs. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of E. coli RNAP holoenzyme in complex with DksA alone and with ppGpp. The structures show that DksA accesses the template strand at the active site and the downstream DNA binding site of RNAP simultaneously and reveal that binding of the allosteric effector ppGpp reshapes the RNAP-DksA complex. The structural data support a model for transcriptional inhibition in which ppGpp potentiates the destabilization of open complexes on rRNA promoters by DksA. We also determined the structure of RNAP-TraR complex, which reveals the mechanism of ppGpp-independent transcription inhibition by TraR.

Here we determined the functional impact of single mossy fibre (MF) synapses on MC firing in mouse entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures. We stimulated single MF boutons and recorded Ca2+ transients in the postsynaptic spine and unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) at the MC soma. Synaptic responses to single presynaptic stimuli varied strongly between different MF synapses, even if they were located on the same MC dendrite. Synaptic strengths ranged from subthreshold EPSPs to direct postsynaptic action potential (AP) generation. Induction of synaptic plasticity at these individual MF synapses resulted in potentiation or depression depending on the initially encountered synaptic state, indicating that synaptic transmission at MF synapses on MCs is determined by their previous functional history. With these unique functional properties MF-MC synapses control MC firing individually thereby enabling modulation of the dentate network by single granule cells.",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific discovery depends on collecting large heterogeneous datasets with many sources of variability, and applying domain-specific pipelines from which one can draw insight or clinical utility. For example, macroscale connectomics studies require complex pipelines to process raw functional or diffusion data and estimate connectomes. Individual studies tend to customize pipelines to their needs, raising concerns about their reproducibility, which add to a longer list of factors that may differ across studies and result in failures to replicate (including sampling, experimental design, and data acquisition protocols). Mitigating these issues requires multi-study datasets and the development of pipelines that can be applied across them. We developed NeuroDatas MRI to Graphs (NDMG) pipeline using several functional and diffusion studies, including the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducability, to estimate connectomes. Without any manual intervention or parameter tuning, NDMG ran on 25 different studies ({approx}6,000 scans) from 19 sites, with each scan resulting in a biologically plausible connectome (as assessed by multiple quality assurance metrics at each processing stage). For each study, the connectomes from NDMG are more similar within than across individuals, indicating that NDMG is preserving biological variability. Moreover, the connectomes exhibit near perfect consistency for certain connectional properties across every scan, individual, study, site and modality; these include stronger ipsilateral than contralateral connections and stronger homotopic than heterotopic connections. Yet, the magnitude of the differences varied across individuals and studies--much more so when pooling data across sites, even after controlling for study, site, and basic demographic variables (i.e., age, sex, and ethnicity). This indicates that other experimental variables (possibly those not measured or reported) are contributing to this variability, which if not accounted for can limit the value of aggregate datasets, as well as expectations regarding the accuracy of findings and likelihood of replication. We therefore provide a set of principles to guide the development of pipelines capable of pooling data across studies while maintaining biological variability and minimizing measurement error. This open science approach provides us with an opportunity to understand and eventually mitigate spurious results for both past and future studies.",

    "abstract": "The red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis) is an endangered and large-bodied crane native to East Asia. It is a traditional symbol of longevity and its long lifespan has been confirmed both in captivity and in the wild. Lifespan in birds is positively correlated with body size and negatively correlated with metabolic rate; although the genetic mechanisms for the red-crowned cranes long lifespan have not previously been investigated. Using whole genome sequencing and comparative evolutionary analyses against the grey-crowned crane and other avian genomes, we identified candidate genes that are correlated with longevity. Included among these are positively selected genes with known associations with longevity in metabolism and immunity pathways (NDUFA5, NDUFA8, NUDT12 IL9R, SOD3, NUDT12, PNLIP, CTH, and RPA1). Our analyses provide genetic evidence for low metabolic rate and longevity, accompanied by possible convergent adaptation signatures among distantly related large and long-lived birds. Finally, we identified low genetic diversity in the red-crowned crane, consistent with its listing as an endangered species, and we hope this genome will provide a useful genetic resource for future conservation studies of this rare and iconic species.",

Genome editing technology has now made this powerful approach routinely applicable to mammalian cells and many other model systems, opening up the possibility to systematically and quantitatively map the cellular proteome in four dimensions. 3D time-lapse confocal microscopy (4D imaging) is an essential tool to investigate spatial and temporal protein dynamics, however it lacks the required quantitative power to make absolute and comparable measurements required for systems analysis. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) on the other hand provides quantitative proteomic and biophysical parameters such as protein concentration, hydrodynamic radius and oligomerization but lacks the ability for high-throughput application in 4D spatial and temporal imaging. Here, we present an automated experimental and computational workflow that integrates both methods and delivers quantitative 4D imaging data in high-throughput. These data is processed to yield a calibration curve relating the fluorescence intensities of image voxels to absolute protein abundance. The calibration curve allows the conversion of the arbitrary fluorescence intensities to protein amounts for all voxels of 4D imaging stacks. With our workflow the users can acquire and analyze hundreds of FCS-calibrated image series to map their proteins of interest in four dimensions. Compared to other protocols, the current protocol does not require additional calibration standards and provides an automated acquisition pipeline for FCS and imaging data. The protocol can be completed in 1 day.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBrain-mapping of the congenitally blind human reveals extensive plasticity(1). The visual cortex of the blind has been observed to support higher cognitive functions including language and numerical processing(2, 3). This functional shift is hypothesized to reflect a metamodal cortical function, where computations are defined by the local network. In the case of developmental deafferentation, local circuits are considered to implement higher cognitive functions by accommodating diverse long-distance inputs(4-7). However, the extent to which visual deprivation triggers a reorganization of the large-scale network in the cortex is still controversial(8). Here we show that early prenatal ablation of the retina, an experimental model of anophthalmia in macaque, leads to a major reduction of area V1 and the creation of a default extrastriate cortex (DEC)(9, 10). Anophthalmic and normal macaques received retrograde tracer injections in DEC, as well as areas V2 and V4 post-natally. This revealed a six-fold expansion of the spatial extent of local connectivity in the DEC and a surprisingly high location of the DEC derived from a computational model of the cortical hierarchy(11). In the anophthalmic the set of areas projecting to the DEC, area V2 and V4 does not differ from that of normal adult controls, but there is a highly significant increase in the relative cumulative weight of the ventral stream areas input to the early visual areas. These findings show that although occupying the territory that would have become primary visual cortex the DEC exhibits features of a higher order area, thus reflecting a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on cortical specification. Understanding the interaction of these contributing factors will shed light on cortical plasticity during primate development and the neurobiology of blindness.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThis paper describes a heuristic method for allocating low-coverage sequencing resources by targeting haplotypes rather than individuals. Low-coverage sequencing assembles high-coverage sequence information for every individual by accumulating data from the genome segments that they share with many other individuals into consensus haplotypes. Deriving the consensus haplotypes accurately is critical for achieving a high phasing and imputation accuracy. In order to enable accurate phasing and imputation of sequence information for the whole population we allocate the available sequencing resources among individuals with existing phased genomic data by targeting the sequencing coverage of their haplotypes.\\n\\nResultsOur method, called AlphaSeqOpt, prioritizes haplotypes using a score function that is based on the frequency of the haplotypes in the sequencing set relative to the target coverage. AlphaSeqOpt has two steps: (1) selection of an initial set of individuals by iteratively choosing the individuals that have the maximum score conditional to the current set, and (2) refinement of the set through several rounds of exchanges of individuals. AlphaSeqOpt is very effective for distributing a fixed amount of sequencing resources evenly across haplotypes, which results in a reduction of the proportion of haplotypes that are sequenced below the target coverage. AlphaSeqOpt can provide a greater proportion of haplotypes sequenced at the target coverage by sequencing less individuals, as compared with other methods that use a score function based on the haplotypes population frequency. A refinement of the initially selected set can provide a larger more diverse set with more unique individuals, which is beneficial in the context of low-coverage sequencing. We extend the method with an approach to filter rare haplotypes based on their flanking haplotypes, so that only those that are likely to derive from a recombination event are targeted.\\n\\nConclusionsWe present a method for allocating sequencing resources so that a greater proportion of haplotypes are sequenced at a coverage that is sufficiently high for population-based imputation with low-coverage sequencing. The haplotype score function, the refinement step, and the new approach of filtering rare haplotypes make AlphaSeqOpt more effective for that purpose than methods reported previously for reducing sequencing redundancy.",

CRISPR/Cas9 technology is a powerful tool for inserting fluorescent markers into all alleles of the gene of interest (GOI) and permits functionality and physiological expression of the fusion protein. It is essential to evaluate such genome-edited cell lines carefully in order to preclude off-target effects caused by either (i) incorrect insertion of the fluorescent protein, (ii) perturbation of the fusion protein by the fluorescent proteins or (iii) non-specific genomic DNA damage by CRISPR/Cas9.

    "abstract": "Memory is stored in neural networks via changes in synaptic strength mediated in part by NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). There is evidence that entorhinal cortex enables neocortical neuroplasticity through cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing neocortical projections. Here we show that a CCKB antagonist blocks high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in the auditory cortex, whereas local infusion of CCK induces LTP. CCK-/- mice lacked neocortical LTP and showed deficits in a cue-cue associative learning paradigm; administration of CCK rescued associative learning. HFS of CCK-containing entorhino-neocortical projection neurons in anesthetized mice enabled cue-cue associative learning. Furthermore, when one cue was pre-conditioned to footshock, the mouse showed a freezing response to the other cue, indicating that the mice had formed an association. HFS-induced neocortical LTP was completely blocked by either NMDA antagonist or CCK-BR antagonist, while application of either NMDA or CCK induced LTP after low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Moreover, in the presence of CCK LTP was still induced, even after blockade of NMDA receptors. Local application of NMDA induced CCK release in the neocortex. To identify how NMDA receptor switches LTP, a stimulation protocol of 25 pulse-pairs was adopted to replace HFS; NMDA-dependent LTP was induced with the inter-pulse intervals between 10 and 100 ms, but not with those of 5 and 200 ms. LTP-mediated plasticity was linked to localization of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2a on cortical CCK terminals originating in the entorhinal cortex. These novel findings suggest that presynaptic NMDA receptors on CCK terminals control the release of CCK, which enables neocortical LTP and formation of cue-cue associative memory.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPresynaptic NMDA receptors switches the release of CCK from entorhinal neurons, which enables neocortical LTP and formation of sound-sound associative memory.",

    "abstract": "Honeybee Apis mellifera swarms form clusters made solely of bees attached to each other, forming pendant structures on tree branches (1). These clusters can be hundreds of times the size of a single organism. How these structures are stably maintained under the influence of static gravity and dynamic stimuli (e.g. wind) is unknown. To address this, we created pendant conical clusters attached to a board that was shaken with varying amplitude, frequency and total duration. Our observations show that horizontally shaken clusters spread out to form wider, flatter cones, i.e. the cluster adapts to the dynamic loading conditions, but in a reversible manner - when the loading is removed, the cluster recovers its original shape, slowly. Measuring the response of a cluster to a sharp pendular excitation before and after it adapted shows that the flattened cones deform less and relax faster than the elongated ones, i.e. they are more stable mechanically. We use particle-based simulations of a passive assemblage to suggest a behavioral hypothesis that individual bees respond to local variations in strain. This behavioral response improves the collective stability of the cluster as a whole at the expense of increasing the average mechanical burden experienced by the individual. Simulations using this rule explain our observations of adaptation to horizontal shaking. The simulations also suggest that vertical shaking will not lead to significant differential strains and thus no adaptation. To test this, we shake the cluster vertically and find that indeed there is no response to this stimulus. Altogether, our results show how an active, functional super-organism structure can respond adaptively to dynamic mechanical loading by changing its morphology to achieve better load sharing.",

The current approach to represent a species or a population with a single reference sequence and a set of variations cannot represent their full diversity and introduces bias towards the chosen reference. There is a need for the representation of multiple sequences in a composite way that is compatible with existing data sources for annotation and suitable for established sequence analysis methods. At the same time, this representation needs to be easily accessible and extendable to account for the constant change of available genomes.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce seq-seq-pan, a framework that provides methods for adding or removing new genomes from a set of aligned genomes and uses these to construct a whole genome alignment.

    "abstract": "Effective cancer treatment is crucially dependent on the identification of the biological processes that drive a tumor. However, multiple processes may be active simultaneously in a tumor. Clustering is inherently unsuitable to this task as it assigns a tumor to a single cluster. In addition, the wide availability of multiple data types per tumor provides the opportunity to profile the processes driving a tumor more comprehensively.\\n\\nHere we introduce Functional Sparse-Factor Analysis (funcSFA) to address these challenges. FuncSFA integrates multiple data types to define a lower dimensional space capturing the relevant variation. A tailor-made module associates biological processes with these factors. FuncSFA is inspired by iCluster, which we improve in several key aspects. First, we increase the convergence efficiency significantly, allowing the analysis of multiple molecular datasets that have not been pre-matched to contain only concordant features. Second, FuncSFA does not assign tumors to discrete clusters, but identifies the dominant driver processes active in each tumor. This is achieved by a regression of the factors on the RNA expression data followed by a functional enrichment analysis and manual curation step.\\n\\nWe apply FuncSFA to the TCGA breast and lung datasets. We identify EMT and Immune processes common to both cancer types. In the breast cancer dataset we recover the known intrinsic subtypes and identify additional processes. These include immune infiltration and EMT, and processes driven by copy number gains on the 8q chromosome arm. In lung cancer we recover the major types (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and processes active in both of these types. These include EMT, two immune processes, and the activity of the NFE2L2 transcription factor.\\n\\nIn summary, FuncSFA is a robust method to perform discovery of key driver processes in a collection of tumors through unsupervised integration of multiple molecular data types and functional annotation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn order to select effective cancer treatment, we need to determine which biological processes are active in a tumor. To this end, tumors have been quantified by high dimensional molecular measurements such as RNA sequencing and DNA copy number profiling. In order to support decision making, these measurements need to be condensed into interpretable summaries. Such summaries can be made interpretable by connecting them to biological processes.\\n\\nBiological process activity is continuous and multiple biological processes are taking place in a single tumor. Therefore, the biological processes associated with a tumor are misrepresented by clustering, which tries to put every tumor in a single cluster. In the method introduced in this paper (funcSFA), molecular measurements are summarized into a small number factors. A factor is a continuous value per tumor that aims to represent the activity of a biological process.\\n\\nWhen applied to breast and lung cancer, funcSFA identifies factors covering well known biology of these tumor types. FuncSFA also finds novel factors covering biology whose importance is not yet widely recognized in these tumor types. Some of the factors suggest treatment opportunities that can be further investigated in cell lines and mice.",

However, the complexity of this process makes it extremely challenging to obtain structural characterizations of co-translational folding pathways.

We create a detailed description of chain length-dependent free energy landscapes associated with folding of the FLN5 filamin domain, in isolation and on the ribosome. By using this approach we identify and characterize two folding intermediates, including a partially folded intermediate associated with the isomerization of a conserved proline residue, which, together with measurements of folding kinetics, raises the prospect that neighboring unfolded domains might accumulate during biosynthesis. We develop a simple model to quantify the risk of misfolding in this situation, and show that catalysis of folding by peptidyl-prolyl isomerases is essential to eliminate this hazard.",

    "abstract": "Most functional transcription factor (TF) binding sites deviate from their \\\"consensus\\\" recognition motif, although their sites and flanking sequences are often conserved across species. Here, we used single-molecule DNA unzipping with optical tweezers to study how Egr-1, a TF harbouring 3 zinc fingers (ZF1,ZF2 and ZF3), is modulated by the sequence and context of its functional sites in the Lhb gene promoter. We find that both the core 9 base pairs bound to Egr-1 in each of the sites, and the base pairs flanking them, modulate the affinity and structure of the protein-DNA complex. The effect of the flanking sequences is asymmetric, with a stronger effect for the sequence flanking ZF3. Characterization of the dissociation time of Egr-1 revealed that a local, mechanical perturbation of the interactions of ZF3 destabilizes the complex more effectively than a perturbation of the ZF1 interactions. Our results reveal a novel role for ZF3 in the interaction of Egr-1 with other proteins and the DNA, providing insight on the regulation of Lhb and other genes by Egr-1. Moreover, our findings reveal the potential of small changes in DNA sequence to alter transcriptional regulation, and may shed light on the organization of regulatory elements at promoters.",

Setting the upper and lower limits of MSW requires an understanding of the dependence of selection coefficient of arising mutations to antimicrobial concentration. In this work, we employed a biophysics-based and experimentally calibrated fitness model to estimate MSW in the case of Ampicillin and Cefotaxime resistance in E.coli TEM-1 beta lactamase. In line with experimental observations, we show that selection is active at very low levels of antimicrobials. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of MSW to catalytic efficiency of mutants, fraction of mutants in the population and discuss the role of population genetic parameters such as population size and mutation rate. Altogether, our analysis and formalism provide a predictive model of MSW with direct implications in the design of dosage strategies.",

    "abstract": "Hi-C is currently the most widely used assay to investigate the 3D organization of the genome and to study its role in gene regulation, DNA replication, and disease. However, Hi-C experiments are costly to perform and involve multiple complex experimental steps; thus, accurate methods for measuring the quality and reproducibility of Hi-C data are essential to determine whether the output should be used further in a study. Using real and simulated data, we profile the performance of several recently proposed methods for assessing reproducibility of population Hi-C data, including HiCRep, GenomeDISCO, HiC-Spector and QuASAR-Rep. By explicitly controlling noise and sparsity through simulations, we demonstrate the deficiencies of performing simple correlation analysis on pairs of matrices, and we show that methods developed specifically for Hi-C data produce better measures of reproducibility. We also show how to use established (e.g., ratio of intra to interchromosomal interactions) and novel (e.g., QuASAR-QC) measures to identify low quality experiments. In this work, we assess reproducibility and quality measures by varying sequencing depth, resolution and noise levels in Hi-C data from 13 cell lines, with two biological replicates each, as well as 176 simulated matrices. Through this extensive validation and benchmarking of Hi-C data, we describe best practices for reproducibility and quality assessment of Hi-C experiments.

    "abstract": "While the impact of common genetic variants on gene expression response to cellular stimuli has been analyzed in depth, less is known about how stimulation modulates the genetic control of isoform usage. Analyzing RNA-seq profiles of monocyte-derived dendritic cells from 243 individuals, we uncovered thousands of unannotated isoforms synthesized in response to viral infection and stimulation with type I interferon. We identified more than a thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with isoform usage (isoQTLs), > 40% of which are independent of expression QTLs for the same gene. Compared to eQTLs, isoQTLs are enriched for splice sites and untranslated regions, and depleted of sequences upstream of annotated transcription start sites. Both eQTLs and isoQTLs in stimulated cells explain a significant proportion of the disease heritability attributed to common genetic variants. At the IRF7 locus, we found alternative promoter usage in response to influenza as a possible mechanism by which DNA variants previously associated with immune-related disorders mediate disease risk. At the ERAP2 locus, we shed light on the function of the major haplotype that has been maintained under long-term balancing selection. At baseline and following type 1 interferon stimulation, the major haplotype is associated with absence of ERAP2 expression while the minor haplotype, known to increase Crohns disease risk, is associated with high ERAP2 expression. Surprisingly, in response to influenza infection, the major haplotype results in the expression of two uncharacterized, alternatively transcribed, spliced and translated short isoforms. Thus, genetic variants at a single locus could modulate independent gene regulatory processes in the innate immune response, and in the case of ERAP2, may confer a historical fitness advantage in response to virus.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome is divided into chromosomal domains of heterochromatin and euchromatin. Transcriptionally silent heterochromatin is found at subtelomeric regions, leading to the telomeric position effect (TPE) in yeast, fly and man. Heterochromatin generally initiates and spreads from defined loci, and diverse mechanisms prevent the ectopic spread of heterochromatin into euchromatin. Here, we overexpressed the silencing factor Sir3 at various levels in yeast, and found that Sir3 spreading into Extended Silent Domains (ESD) eventually reached saturation at subtelomeres. We observed that Sir3 spreading into ESDs covered zone associated with specific histone marks in wild-type cells and stopped at zones of histone mark transitions including H3K79 tri-methylation levels. The conserved enzyme Dot1 deposits H3K79 methylation, and we found that it is essential for viability upon overexpression of Sir3, but not of a spreading-defective mutant Sir3A2Q. These data suggest that H3K79 methylation actively blocks Sir3 spreading. Lastly, our meta-analysis uncovers previously uncharacterized discrete subtelomeric domains associated with specific chromatin features offering a new viewpoint on how to separate subtelomeres from the core chromosome.",

    "abstract": "Prestimulus subsequent memory effects (preSMEs) - differences in neural activity elicited by a task cue at encoding that are predictive of later memory performance - are thought to reflect differential engagement of preparatory processes that benefit episodic memory encoding. We investigated age differences in preSMEs indexed by differences in ERP amplitude just prior to the onset of a study item. Young and older adults incidentally encoded words for a subsequent memory test. Each study word was preceded by a task cue that signaled the judgment to perform on the word. Words were presented for either a short (300 ms) or a long (1000 ms) duration with the aim of placing differential benefits on engaging preparatory processes initiated by the task cue. ERPs associated with subsequent successful and unsuccessful recollection, operationalized here by source memory accuracy, were estimated time-locked to the onset of the task cue. In a late time-window (1000-2000 ms following onset of the cue), young adults demonstrated frontally distributed preSMEs for both the short and the long study durations, albeit with opposite polarities in the two conditions. This finding suggests that preSMEs in young adults are sensitive to perceived task demands. Although older adults showed no evidence of preSMEs in the same late time window, significant preSMEs were observed in an earlier time window (500-1000 ms) that were invariant with study duration. These results are broadly consistent with the proposal that older adults differ from their younger counterparts in how they engage preparatory processes during memory encoding.",

While this sequence emulates some real-world situations (e.g., swatting a fly upon landing) movements are commonly made at a moment of ones choosing (reaching for a coffee cup) or are made reactively (intercepting a falling cup). To ascertain whether neural events are conserved across such contexts, we examined motor cortex population-level responses in monkeys when reaches were initiated either after an imposed delay, at a self-chosen time, or reactively with very low latency. We found that the same preparatory and movement-related events were conserved. However, preparation was temporally flexible and could be remarkably brief. Our findings support the existing hypothesis that preparation is an obligatory stage that achieves a consistent state prior to movement. Yet our results reveal that preparation can unfold more rapidly than previously supposed.",

Similar to classical meta-analyses, coordinate based meta-analyses may be subject to different forms of publication bias which impacts results and possibly invalidates findings. We develop a tool that assesses the robustness to potential publication bias on cluster level. We investigate the possible influence of the file-drawer effect, where studies that do not report certain results fail to get published, by determining the number of noise studies that can be added to an existing fMRI meta-analysis before the results are no longer statistically significant. In this paper we illustrate this tool through an example and test the effect of several parameters through extensive simulations. We provide an algorithm for which code is freely available to generate noise studies and enables users to determine the robustness of meta-analytical results.",

    "abstract": "Memory traces and associations between them are fundamental for cognitive brain function. Neuron recordings suggest that distributed assemblies of neurons in the brain serve as memory traces for spatial information, real-world items, and concepts. How-ever, there is conflicting evidence regarding neural codes for associated memory traces. Some studies suggest the emergence of overlaps between assemblies during an association, while others suggest that the assemblies themselves remain largely unchanged and new assemblies emerge as neural codes for associated memory items. Here we study the emergence of neural codes for associated memory items in a generic computational model of recurrent networks of spiking neurons with a data-constrained rule for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The model depends critically on two parameters, which control the excitability of neurons and the scale of initial synaptic weights. By modifying these two parameters, the model can reproduce both experimental data from the human brain on the fast formation of associations through emergent overlaps between assemblies, and rodent data where new neurons are recruited to encode the associated memories. Hence our findings suggest that the brain can use both of these two neural codes for associations, and dynamically switch between them during consolidation.",

However, the degree to which filamentous microbes establish pathogenic interactions with early divergent land plants is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the broad host-range oomycete pathogen Phytophthora palmivora colonizes liverworts, the earliest divergent land plant lineage. We show that P. palmivora establishes a complex tissue-specific interaction with Marchantia polymorpha, where it completes a full infection cycle within air chambers of the dorsal photosynthetic layer. Remarkably, P. palmivora invaginates M. polymorpha cells with haustoria-like structures that accumulate host cellular trafficking machinery and the membrane-syntaxin MpSYP13B but not the related MpSYP13A.

While the volume of RNA-seq data is rapidly increasing, the currently publicly available RNA-seq data is provided mostly in raw form, with small portions processed non- uniformly. This is mainly because the computational demand, particularly for the alignment step, is a significant barrier for global and integrative retrospective analyses. To address this challenge, we developed all RNA-seq and ChIP-seq sample and signature search (ARCHS4), a web resource that makes the majority of previously published RNA-seq data from human and mouse freely available at the gene count level. Such uniformly processed data enables easy integration for downstream analyses. For developing the ARCHS4 resource, all available FASTQ files from RNA-seq experiments were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and aligned using a cloud-based infrastructure. In total 137,792 samples are accessible through ARCHS4 with 72,363 mouse and 65,429 human samples. Through efficient use of cloud resources and dockerized deployment of the sequencing pipeline, the alignment cost per sample is reduced to less than one cent. ARCHS4 is updated automatically by adding newly published samples to the database as they become available. Additionally, the ARCHS4 web interface provides intuitive exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualization, and gene landing pages that provide average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes, and predicted biological functions and protein-protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression. Benchmarking the quality of these predictions, co-expression correlation data created from ARCHS4 outperforms co-expression data created from other major gene expression data repositories such as GTEx and CCLE.\\n\\nARCHS4 is freely accessible at: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4",

In the Bacillus subtilis biofilm matrix the extracellular fibres of TasA are essential. Here a recombinant expression system allows interrogation of TasA, revealing that monomeric and fibre forms of TasA have identical secondary structure, suggesting that fibrous TasA is a linear assembly of globular units. Recombinant TasA fibres form spontaneously, and share the biological activity of TasA fibres extracted from B. subtilis, whereas a TasA variant restricted to a monomeric form is inactive and subjected to extracellular proteolysis. The biophysical properties of both native and recombinant TasA fibres indicate that they are not functional amyloid-like fibres. A gel formed by TasA fibres can recover after physical shear force, suggesting that the biofilm matrix is not static and that these properties may enable B. subtilis to remodel its local environment in response to external cues. Using recombinant fibres formed by TasA orthologues we uncover species variability in the ability of heterologous fibres to cross-complement the B. subtilis tasA deletion. These findings are indicative of specificity in the biophysical requirements of the TasA fibres across different species and/or reflect the precise molecular interactions needed for biofilm matrix assembly.\\n\\nContributionsConceived and designed the experiments: CE, EE, RG, CEM, RJM, MS, NSW; Performed the experiments: KB, LC, CE, EE, PKF, RG, CEM, RJM, MS, TS; Contributed new analytical tools: CE, EE, RG, TS; Analysed the data: CE, EE, CEM, RJM, MS, LCS, NSW; Wrote the paper: EE, RJM, CEM, MS, NSW.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic regulation is a powerful tool utilized by virtually all biological systems, brain included. Broadly speaking, each homeostatic process embodies two components: the sensing component, whereby a deviation is detected and quantified, and the effecting component that executes the homeostatic adjustment with the goal of alleviating the deviation. In the central nervous system, homeostatic plasticity has been suggested to play an important role in shaping the dynamics of single neurons and neuronal networks. However, existing \\\"biophysical\\\" models of homeostatic plasticity are exceedingly simplistic. These models usually describe the sensor component in terms of simple averaging over neuronal activity and offer no explanation of the relevant biochemical pathways. Here, we attempt to fill this gap in our understanding of homeostatic plasticity by proposing a biophysical framework to explain detection of prolonged synaptic inactivity that may occur in some scenarios of brain injury. We propose that sensing of, and response to, synaptic inactivity involves detection of the extracellular glutamate level and occurs via the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), while the inactivity-induced synthesis of one of the homeostatic plasticity effectors, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), serves as an effecting component of the system. This model can help to explain the experimental observations linking prolonged neuronal inactivity to TNF signaling. Importantly, the proposed signaling scheme is not limited to mGluRs and astrocytes, but rather is potentially applicable to any cells expressing receptors that activate the relevant G protein units. The proposed signaling scheme is likely to be useful for developing pharmacological interventions targeting homeostatic plasticity pathways.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHomeostatic regulation refers to the self-regulation ability of a system aimed at remaining in the same (or nearly the same) state. Homeostatic plasticity, a form of homeostatic regulation that arises in the context of neural dynamics, has been shown to shape neuronal and network dynamics by attempting to maintain physiological levels of neuronal activity in brain networks. Thus, it changes the excitation-inhibition balance in a network when sufficiently large and long-lasting deviations from physiological levels of activity are detected. However, the biophysical mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity and in particular those related to the ability to sense neuronal inactivity, remain elusive. We propose a feasible biophysical model of a homeostatic sensor, in which the sensing of inactivity depends on the presence and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors with different activation thresholds. In this model, the activation of the higher-threshold receptor suppresses the detection of inactivity, while the activation of the lower-threshold receptor promotes the detection of inactivity. The proposed model helps to explain a growing body of experimental data relating synaptic inactivity to production of homeostatic plasticity effectors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha. Although we consider a specific case study of metabotropic glutamate receptors on astrocytes, the model conclusions are likely to be applicable to any cells expressing receptors that activate the relevant G protein units.",

    "abstract": "Developmental genes can have complex c/s-regulatory regions, with multiple enhancers scattered across stretches of DNA spanning tens or hundreds of kilobases. Early work revealed remarkable modularity of enhancers, where distinct regions of DNA, bound by combinations of transcription factors, drive gene expression in defined spatio-temporal domains. Nevertheless, a few reports have shown that enhancer function may be required in multiple developmental stages, implying that regulatory elements can be pleiotropic. In these cases, it is not clear whether the pleiotropic enhancers employ the same transcription factor binding sites to drive expression at multiple developmental stages or whether enhancers function as chromatin scaffolds, where independent sets of transcription factor binding sites act at different stages. In this work we have studied the activity of the enhancers of the shavenbaby gene throughout D. melanogaster development. We found that all seven shavenbaby enhancers drive gene expression in multiple tissues and developmental stages at varying levels of redundancy. We have explored how this pleiotropy is encoded in two of these enhancers. In one enhancer, the same transcription factor binding sites contribute to embryonic and pupal expression, whereas for a second enhancer, these roles are largely encoded by distinct transcription factor binding sites. Our data suggest that enhancer pleiotropy might be a common feature of c/s-regulatory regions of developmental genes and that this pleiotropy can be encoded through multiple genetic architectures.",
