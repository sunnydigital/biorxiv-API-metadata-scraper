    "abstract": "In the study of connectivity in large-scale networks of brain regions, a standard assumption is made that the statistical dependence between regions is univariate and linear. However, brain regions encode information in multivariate responses, and neural computations are nonlinear. Multivariate and nonlinear statistical dependence between regions is likely ubiquitous, but it is not captured by current methods. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel analysis framework: fMRI responses are characterized as points in multidimensional spaces, and nonlinear dependence is modeled using artificial neural networks. Converging evidence from multiple experiments shows that nonlinear dependence 1) models mappings between brain regions more accurately than linear dependence, explaining more variance in left-out data; 2) reveals functional subdivisions within cortical networks, and 3) is modulated by the task participants are performing.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100020). Predicting and managing contemporary adaption requires a proper understanding of the determinants of genetic variation. Spatial heterogeneity of the environment may stably maintain polymorphism when habitat contribution to the next generation can be considered independent of the degree of adaptation of local populations within habitats (i.e., under soft selection). In contrast, when habitats contribute proportionally to the mean fitness of the populations they host (hard selection), polymorphism is not expected to be maintained by selection. Although mathematically established decades ago, this prediction had never been properly explored. Here we provide an experimental test in which polymorphic populations of Escherichia coli growing in heterogeneous habitats were exposed to hard and soft selection regimes. As predicted by theory, polymorphism was longer preserved under soft selection. Complementary tests established that soft selection slowed down fixation processes and could even protect polymorphism on the long term by providing a systematic advantage to rare genotypes.",

Some of them exhibit an extraordinarily long lag, as pathogenic persisters do. It remains unknown on what determines lag time duration. Here, we unveiled a subcellular structure, termed quiescent body, that is formed in bacterial cells entering non-growing state and sequesters selected proteins essential for cell growth. Their formation occurs progressively in each cell and heterogeneously among individual cells. They only dissolve in re-growing cells to release proteins for immediate re-functioning when conditions become fit. Quiescent body, whose degree of formation is highly correlated with duration of lag time or level of antibiotic tolerance, apparently functions as a biological timer for bacterial growth resumption. Further, suppressing their formation, which directly relies on cellular respiration complexes, or promoting their dissolution might be a viable strategy to eradicate persisters.",

    "abstract": "The thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), one of Australias most characteristic megafauna, was the largest marsupial carnivore until hunting, and potentially disease, drove them to extinction in 1936. Current knowledge suggests that thylacines became extinct on mainland Australia two millennia prior to their extirpation on Tasmania, but recent \\\"plausible\\\" sightings on the Cape York Peninsula have emerged, leading some to speculate the species may persist, undetected. Here we show that the continued survival of the thylacine is entirely implausible based on most current mathematical theories of extinction. We present a dataset including physical evidence, expert-validated sightings, and unconfirmed sightings leading up to the present day, and use a Bayesian framework that takes all three types of data into account by modelling them as independent processes, to evaluate the likelihood of the thylacines persistence. Although the last captive thylacine died in 1936, our model suggests the most likely extinction date would be 1940, or at the latest the 1950s. We validated this result by using other extinction estimator methods, all of which confirmed that the thylacines extinction likely fell between 1936 and 1943; even the most optimistic scenario suggests the species did not persist beyond 1956. The search for the thylacine, much like similar efforts to \\\"rediscover\\\" other recently extinct charismatic species, is likely to be fruitless, especially given that persistence on Tasmania would have been no guarantee the species could reappear in regions that had been unoccupied for millennia. The search for the thylacine may become a rallying point for conservation and wildlife biology, and could indirectly help fund and support critical research in understudied areas like Cape York. However, our results suggest that attempts to rediscover the thylacine will likely be unsuccessful.",

    "abstract": "Cell polarity has a fundamental role in shaping the morphology of cells and growing tissues. Polarity is commonly thought to be established in response to extracellular signals. Here we used a minimal in vitro assay that enabled us to monitor the determination of cell polarity in myogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in the absence of external signalling gradients. We demonstrate that the initiation of cell polarity is regulated by melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM). We found highly polarized localization of MCAM, Moesin (MSN), Scribble (SCRIB) and Van-Gogh-like 2 (VANGL2) at the distal end of elongating myotubes. Knockout of MCAM or elimination of its endocytosis motif does not impair the initiation of myogenesis or myoblast fusion, but prevents myotube elongation. MSN, SCRIB and VANGL2 remain uniformly distributed in MCAM knockout cells. We show that MCAM is also required at early stages of chondrogenic differentiation. In both myogenic and chondrogenic differentiation MCAM knockout leads to transcriptional downregulation of Scrib and enhanced MAP kinase activity. Our data demonstrates the importance of cell autonomous polarity in differentiation.",

Finding the right balance between the two is important for controlling overall cortical excitation and network dynamics. However, it is unclear how the correct number of cortical interneurons (CIs) is established in the mammalian forebrain. CIs are generated in excess from basal forebrain progenitors and their final numbers are adjusted via an intrinsically determined program of apoptosis that takes place during an early postnatal window. Here, we provide evidence that the extent of CI apoptosis during this critical period is plastic, cell type specific and can be reduced in a cell autonomous manner by acute increases in neuronal activity. We propose that the physiological state of the emerging neural network controls the activity levels of local CIs to modulate their numbers in a homeostatic manner.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive behavior depends on the ability to accurately introspect about ones own performance. Whether this metacognitive ability is supported by the same mechanisms across different tasks has thus far been investigated with a focus on correlating metacognitive accuracy between perception and long-term memory paradigms. Here, we investigated the relationship between metacognition of visual perception and metacognition of visual short-term memory (VSTM), a cognitive function thought to be more intimately related to visual processing. Experiments 1 and 2 required subjects to estimate the perceived or remembered orientation of a grating stimulus and rate their confidence. We observed strong positive correlations between individual differences in metacognitive accuracy between the two tasks. This relationship was not accounted for by individual differences in task performance or average confidence, and was present across two different metrics of metacognition and in both experiments. A model-based analysis of data from a third experiment showed that a cross-domain correlation only emerged when both tasks shared the same task-relevant stimulus feature. That is, metacognition for perception and VSTM were correlated when both tasks required orientation judgments, but not when the perceptual task was switched to require contrast judgments. In contrast to previous results comparing perception and long-term memory, which have largely provided evidence for domain-specific metacognitive processes, the current findings suggest that metacognition of visual perception and VSTM is supported by a domain-general metacognitive architecture, but only when both domains share the same task-relevant stimulus feature.",

    "abstract": "Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic invertebrates thought to have evolved for millions of years without sexual reproduction. They have attracted the attention of biologists puzzled by the maintenance of sex among nearly all other eukaryotes. Bdelloid genomes have an unusually high proportion of horizontally acquired non-metazoan genes. This well-substantiated finding has invited speculation that homologous horizontal transfer between rotifers also may occur, perhaps even 'replacing' sex. A 2016 study in Current Biology claimed to supply evidence for this hypothesis. The authors sampled rotifers of the genus Adineta from natural populations and sequenced one mitochondrial and four nuclear loci. For several samples, species assignments were incongruent among loci, which the authors interpreted as evidence of \\\"interspecific genetic exchanges\\\". Here, we use sequencing chromatograms supplied by the authors to demonstrate that samples treated as individuals actually contained two or more divergent mitochondrial and ribosomal sequences, indicating contamination with DNA from additional animals belonging to the supposed \\\"donor species\\\". We also show that \\\"exchanged\\\" molecules share only 75% sequence homology, a degree of divergence incompatible with established mechanisms of recombination and genomic features of Adineta. These findings are parsimoniously explained by cross-contamination of tubes with animals or DNA from different species. Given the proportion of tubes contaminated in this way, we show by calculation that evidence for \\\"intraspecific horizontal exchange\\\" in the same dataset is explained by contamination with conspecific DNA. On the clear evidence of these analyses, the 2016 study provides no reliable support for the hypothesis of horizontal genetic transfer between or within these bdelloid species.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decision-making, studied using two-alternative forced-choice tasks, is explained by sequential sampling models of evidence accumulation, which correspond to the dynamics of neurons in sensorimotor structures of the brain12. Response inhibition, studied using stop-signal (countermanding) tasks, is explained by a race model of the initiation or canceling of a response, which correspond to the dynamics of neurons in sensorimotor structures34. Neither standard model accounts for performance of the other task. Sequential sampling models incorporate response initiation as an uninterrupted non-decision time parameter independent of task-related variables. The countermanding race model does not account for the choice process. Here we show with new behavioral, neural and computational results that perceptual decision making of varying difficulty can be countermanded with invariant efficiency, that single prefrontal neurons instantiate both evidence accumulation and response inhibition, and that an interactive race between two GO and one STOP stochastic accumulator fits countermanding choice behavior. Thus, perceptual decision-making and response control, previously regarded as distinct mechanisms, are actually aspects of more flexible behavior supported by a common neural and computational mechanism. The identification of this aspect of decision-making with response production clarifies the component processes of decision-making.",

Centrosomes comprise centrioles that organize a micron-scale mass of protein called pericentriolar material (PCM) from which microtubules nucleate. During each cell cycle, PCM accumulates around centrioles through phosphorylation-mediated assembly of PCM scaffold proteins. During mitotic exit, PCM swiftly disassembles by an unknown mechanism. Here, we used Caenorhabditis elegans embryos to determine the mechanism and importance of PCM disassembly in dividing cells. We found that the phosphatase PP2A and its regulatory subunit SUR-6 (PP2ASUR-6), together with cortically directed microtubule pulling forces, actively disassemble PCM. In embryos depleted of these activities, [~]25% of PCM persisted from one cell cycle into the next, resulting in cytokinetic furrow ingression errors, excessive centrosome accumulation, and embryonic death. Purified PP2ASUR-6 could dephosphorylate the major PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 in vitro. Our data suggest that PCM disassembly occurs through a combination of dephosphorylation of PCM components and catastrophic rupture of the PCM scaffold.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of HIV during acute infection is often considered a neutral process. Recent analysis of sequencing data from this stage of infection, however, showed high levels of shared mutations between independent viral populations. This suggests that selection might play a role in the early stages of HIV infection. We adapted an existing model for random evolution during acute HIV-infection to include selection. Simulations of this model were used to fit a global mutational fitness effects distribution (MFED) to sequencing data of the env gene of individuals with acute HIV infection. Measures of sharing between viral populations were used as summary statistics to compare the data to the simulations. We confirm that evolution during acute infection is significantly different from neutral. The distribution of mutational fitness effects is best fit by distribution with a low, but significant fraction of beneficial mutations and a high fraction of deleterious mutations. While most mutations are neutral or deleterious in this model, about 5% of mutations is beneficial. These beneficial mutations will, on average, result in a small but significant increase in fitness. When assuming no epistasis, this indicates that at the moment of transmission HIV is near, but not on the fitness peak for early infection.",

    "abstract": "Crop improvement must accelerate to feed an increasing human population in the face of environmental changes. Breeding programs can include anticipated climatic changes and genetic architecture to optimize improvement strategies. We analyzed the genetic architecture underlying the response of Zea mays to combinations of water and nitrogen stresses. Recombinant inbreds were subjected to nine combinations of the two stresses using an optimized response surface design, and their growth was measured. Three-dimensional dose response surfaces were fit globally and to each polymorphic allele to determine which genetic markers were associated with different response surfaces. Three quantitative trait loci that produced nonlinear surfaces were mapped. Alleles that performed better in combinations of mid-range stresses were typically not the alleles that performed best under combinations of extreme stresses. To develop physiologically relevant models for future genetic analyses, we modeled the network that explains the response surfaces. The network contains two components, an elliptical paraboloid and a plane, that each combine the nitrogen and water inputs. The relative weighting of the two components and the inputs is governed by five parameters. We estimated parameter values for the smoothed surfaces from the experimental lines using a set of points that covered the most distinctive regions of the three-dimensional surfaces. Surfaces computed using these values reproduced the smoothed experimental surfaces well, especially in the neighborhood of the peaks, as judged by three different criteria. The parameters exaggerated the amplitudes of the simulated surfaces. Experiments using single stresses could misestimate responses to their combinations and disguise loci that respond nonlinearly. The three-dimensional shape evaluation strategy used here more thoroughly compares nonlinear, nonplanar responses. We encourage the application of our findings and methods to experiments that mix crop protection measures, stresses, or both, on elite and landrace germplasm.",

    "abstract": "As the primary microtubule-organizing center, centrosomes play a key role in establishing mitotic bipolar spindles that secure correct transmission of genomic content. For the fidelity of cell division, centrosome number must be strictly controlled by duplicating only once per cell cycle. Proper levels of centrosome proteins are shown to be critical for normal centrosome number and function. Overexpressing core centrosome factors leads to extra centrosomes, while depleting these factors results in centrosome duplication failure. In this regard, protein turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasome system provides a vital mechanism for the regulation of centrosome protein levels. Here, we report that FZR-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of Cdh1/Hct1/Fzr, a co-activator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, functions as a negative regulator of centrosome duplication in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. During mitotic cell division in the early embryo, FZR-1 is associated with centrosomes and enriched at nuclei. Loss of fzr-1 function restores centrosome duplication and embryonic viability to the hypomorphic zyg-1(it25) mutant, in part, through elevated levels of SAS-5 at centrosomes. Our data suggest that the APC/CFZR-1 regulates SAS-5 levels by directly recognizing the conserved KEN-box motif, contributing to proper centrosome duplication. Together, our work shows that FZR-1 plays a conserved role in regulating centrosome duplication in Caenorhabditis elegans.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionGlioblastoma exhibits profound tumor heterogeneity, which causes inconsistent treatment response. The aim of this study was to propose an interpretation method of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using joint histogram analysis of DTI-p and-q. With this method we explored the patterns of tumor infiltration which causes disruption of brain microstructure, and examined the prognostic value of tumor infiltrative patterns for patient survival.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsA total of 115 primary glioblastoma patients (mean age 59.3 years, 87 males) were prospectively recruited from July 2010 to August 2015. Patients underwent preoperative MRI scans and maximal safe resection. DTI was processed and decomposed into p and q components. The univariate and joint histograms of DTI-p and-q were constructed using the voxels of contrast-enhancing and non-enhancing regions respectively. Eight joint histogram features were obtained and correlated with tumor progression and patient survival. Their prognostic values were compared with clinical factors using receiver operating characteristic curves.\\n\\nResultsThe subregion of increased DTI-p and decreased DTI-q accounted for the largest proportion. Additional diffusion patterns can be identified via joint histogram analysis. Particularly, higher proportion of decreased DTI-p and increased DTI-q in non-enhancing region contributed to worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.08, p< 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.11, p < 0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsJoint histogram analysis of DTI can provide a comprehensive measure of tumor infiltration and microstructure change, which showed prognostic values. The subregion of decreased DTI-p and increased DTI-q in non-enhancing regions may indicate a more invasive habitat.",

As a result of this, the exponential growth in sequencing data in public databases allows us to explore ever growing large collections of genome sequences. However, it is less known that the majority of available sequenced genome sequences in public databases are not complete, drafts of varying qualities. We have calculated quality scores for around 100,000 bacterial genomes from all major genome repositories and put them in a fast and easy-to-use database.\\n\\nResultsProkaryotic genomic data from all sources were collected and combined to make a non-redundant set of bacterial genomes. The genome quality score for each was calculated by four different measurements: assembly quality, number of rRNA and tRNA genes, and the occurrence of conserved functional domains. The dataBase of Bacterial Quality scores (dBBQs) was designed to store and retrieve quality scores. It offers fast searching and download features which the result can be used for further analysis. In addition, the search results are shown in interactive JavaScript chart framework using DC.js. The analysis of quality scores across major public genome databases find that around 68% of the genomes are of acceptable quality for many uses.\\n\\nConclusionsdBBQs (available at http://arc-gem.uams.edu/dbbqs) provides genome quality scores for all available prokaryotic genome sequences with a user-friendly Web-interface. These scores can be used as cut-offs to get a high-quality set of genomes for testing bioinformatics tools or improving the analysis. Moreover, all data of the four measurements that were combined to make the quality score for each genome, which can potentially be used for further analysis. dBBQs will be updated regularly and is freely use for non-commercial purpose.",

    "abstract": "In species with large population sizes such as Drosophila, natural selection may have substantial effects on genetic diversity and divergence. However, the implications of this widespread nonneutrality for standard population genetic assumptions and practices remain poorly resolved. Here, we assess the consequences of recurrent hitchhiking (RHH), in which selective sweeps occur at a given rate randomly across the genome. We use forward simulations to examine two published RHH models for D. melanogaster, reflecting relatively common/weak and rare/strong selection. We find that unlike the rare/strong RHH model, the common/weak model entails a slight degree of Hill-Robertson interference in high recombination regions. We also find that the common/weak RHH model is more consistent with our genome-wide estimate of the proportion of substitutions fixed by natural selection between D. melanogaster and D. simulans (19%). Finally, we examine how these models of RHH might bias demographic inference. We find that these RHH scenarios can bias demographic parameter estimation, but such biases are weaker for parameters relating recently-diverged populations, and for the common/weak RHH model in general. Thus, even for species with important genome-wide impacts of selective sweeps, neutralist demographic inference can have some utility in understanding the histories of recently-diverged populations.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput DNA sequencing allows efficient discovery of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-model species. Population genetic theory predicts that this large number of independent markers should provide detailed insights into population structure, even when only a few individuals are sampled. Still, sampling design can have a strong impact on such inferences. Here, we use simulations and empirical SNP data to investigate the impacts of sampling design on estimating genetic differentiation among populations that represent three species of Galapagos giant tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.). Though microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA analyses have supported the distinctiveness of these species, a recent study called into question how well these markers matched with data from genomic SNPs, thereby questioning decades of studies in non-model organisms. Using >20,000 genome-wide SNPs from 30 individuals from three Galapagos giant tortoise species, we find distinct structure that matches the relationships described by the traditional genetic markers. Furthermore, we confirm that accurate estimates of genetic differentiation in highly structured natural populations can be obtained using thousands of SNPs and 2-5 individuals, or hundreds of SNPs and 10 individuals, but only if the units of analysis are delineated in a way that is consistent with evolutionary history. We show that the lack of structure in the recent SNP-based study was likely due to unnatural grouping of individuals and erroneous genotype filtering. Our study demonstrates that genomic data enable patterns of genetic differentiation among populations to be elucidated even with few samples per population, and underscores the importance of sampling design. These results have specific implications for studies of population structure in endangered species and subsequent management decisions.\\n\\n\\\"Modern molecular techniques provide unprecedented power to understand genetic variation in natural populations.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSmoking and alcohol use behaviors in humans have been associated with common genetic variants within multiple genomic loci. Investigation of rare variation within these loci holds promise for identifying causal variants impacting biological mechanisms in the etiology of disordered behavior. Microarrays have been designed to genotype rare nonsynonymous and putative loss of function variants. Such variants are expected to have greater deleterious consequences on gene function than other variants, and significantly contribute to disease risk.\\n\\nMethodsIn the present study, we analyzed [~]250,000 rare variants from 17 independent studies. Each variant was tested for association with five addiction-related phenotypes: cigarettes per day, pack years, smoking initiation, age of smoking initiation, and alcoholic drinks per week. We conducted single variant tests of all variants, and gene-based burden tests of nonsynonymous or putative loss of function variants with minor allele frequency less than 1%.\\n\\nResultsMeta-analytic sample sizes ranged from 70,847 to 164,142 individuals, depending on the phenotype. Known loci tagged by common variants replicated, but there was no robust evidence for individually associated rare variants, either in gene based or single variant tests. Using a modified method-of-moment approach, we found that all low frequency coding variants, in aggregate, contributed 1.7% to 3.6% of the phenotypic variation for the five traits (p<.05).\\n\\nConclusionsThe findings indicate that rare coding variants contribute to phenotypic variation, but that much larger samples and/or denser genotyping of rare variants will be required to successfully identify associations with these phenotypes, whether individual variants or gene- based associations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCentral African hunter-gatherer Pygmy populations have reduced body size compared with their often much larger agricultural non-Pygmy neighbors, potentially reflecting adaptation to the anatomical and physiological constraints of their lifestyle in tropical rainforests. Earlier studies investigating the genetics of the pygmy phenotype have focused on standing height, one aspect of this complex phenotype that is itself a composite of skeletal components with different growth patterns. Here, we extend the investigations of standing height to the variability and genetic architecture of sitting height and subischial leg length as well as body mass index (BMI) in a sample of 406 unrelated West Central African Pygmies and non-Pygmies.\\n\\nResultsIn addition to their significantly reduced standing height compared with non-Pygmies, we find Pygmies to have significantly shorter sitting heights and subischial leg lengths as well as higher sitting/standing height ratios than non-Pygmies. However, while male Pygmies had significantly lower BMI compared with male non-Pygmies, the BMI of females were instead similar. Consistent with prior observations with standing height, sitting height and subischial leg length were strongly correlated with inferred levels of non-Pygmy genetic admixture while BMI was instead weakly correlated, likely reflecting the greater contribution of non-genetic factors to the determination of body weight compared with height. Using 196,725 SNPs on the Illumina Cardio-MetaboChip with genotypes on 358 Pygmy and 169 non-Pygmy individuals together with single-and multi-marker association approaches, we identified a single genomic region and seven genes associated with Pygmy/non-Pygmy categorization as well as 9, 10, 9, and 10 genes associated with standing and sitting height, sitting/standing height ratio, and subischial leg length, respectively. Many of the genes identified have putative functions consistent with a role in determining their associated trait as well as the complex Central African pygmy phenotype.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings highlight the potential of modestly sized datasets of Pygmies and non-Pygmies to detect biologically meaningful associations with traits contributing to the Central African pygmy phenotype. Moreover, they provide new insights into the phenotypic and genetic bases of the complex pygmy phenotype and offer new opportunities to facilitate our understanding of its complex evolutionary origins.",

    "abstract": "Genome engineering in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent an opportunity to examine the contribution of pathogenic and disease modifying alleles to molecular and cellular phenotypes. However, the practical application of genome-editing approaches in human iPSCs has been challenging. We have developed a precise and efficient genome-editing platform that relies on allele-specific guideRNAs (gRNAs) paired with a robust method for culturing and screening the modified iPSC clones. By applying an allele-specific gRNA design strategy, we have demonstrated greatly improved editing efficiency without the introduction of additional modifications of unknown consequence in the genome. Using this approach, we have modified nine independent iPSC lines at five loci associated with neurodegeneration. This genome-editing platform allows for efficient and precise production of isogenic cell lines for disease modeling. Because the impact of CRISPR/Cas9 on off-target sites remains poorly understood, we went on to perform thorough off-target profiling by comparing the mutational burden in edited iPSC lines using whole genome sequencing. The bioinformatically predicted off-target sites were unmodified in all edited iPSC lines. We also found that the numbers of de novo genetic variants detected in the edited and unedited iPSC lines were similar. Thus, our CRISPR/Cas9 strategy does not specifically increase the mutational burden. Furthermore, our analyses of the de novo genetic variants that occur during iPSC culture and genome-editing indicate an enrichment of de novo variants at sites identified in dbSNP. Taken together, we propose that this enrichment represents regions of the genome more susceptible to mutation. Herein, we present an efficient and precise method for allele-specific genome-editing in iPSC and an analyses pipeline to distinguish off-target events from de novo mutations occurring with culture.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic accumulator models provide a comprehensive framework for how neural activity could produce behavior. Neural activity within the frontal eye fields (FEF) and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) support such models for saccade initiation, by relating variations in saccade reaction time (SRT) to variations in parameters such as baseline, rate of accumulation of activity, or threshold. Here, by recording iSC activity during reversible cryogenic inactivation of the FEF in non-human primates, we causally test which parameter(s) best explains concomitant increases in SRT. While FEF inactivation decreased all aspects of ipsilesional iSC activity, decreases in accumulation rate and threshold poorly predicted accompanying increases in SRT. Instead, SRT increases best correlated with delays in the onset of saccade-related accumulation. We conclude that FEF signals govern the onset of saccade-related accumulation within the iSC, and that the onset of accumulation is a relevant parameter for stochastic accumulation models of saccade initiation.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe superior colliculus (SC) and frontal eye fields (FEF) are two of the best-studied areas in the primate brain. Surprisingly, little is known about what happens in the SC when the FEF is temporarily inactivated. Here, we show that temporary FEF inactivation decreases all aspects of functionally-related activity in the SC. This combination of techniques also allowed us to relate changes in SC activity to concomitant increases in saccadic reaction time (SRT). Although stochastic accumulator models relate SRT increases to reduced rates of accumulation or increases in threshold, such changes were not observed in the SC. Instead, FEF inactivation delayed the onset of saccade-related accumulation, emphasizing the importance of this parameter in biologically-plausible models of saccade initiation.",

    "abstract": "All animals must detect noxious stimuli to initiate protective behavior, but the evolutionary origin of nociceptive systems is not well understood. Here, we show that a remarkably conserved signaling mechanism mediates the detection of noxious stimuli in animals as diverse as flatworms and humans. Planarian flatworms are amongst the simplest bilateral animals with a centralized nervous system, and capable of directed behavior. We demonstrate that noxious heat and irritant chemicals elicit robust escape behaviors in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, and that the conserved ion channel TRPA1 is required for these responses. TRPA1 mutant fruit flies (Drosophila) are also defective in the avoidance of noxious heat 1-3. Unexpectedly, we find that either the planarian or the human TRPA1 can restore noxious heat avoidance to TRPA1 mutant Drosophila, even though neither is directly activated by heat. Instead, our data suggest that TRPA1 activation is mediated by H2O2/Reactive Oxygen Species, early markers of tissue damage rapidly produced as a result of heat exposure. Together, our data reveal a core function for TRPA1 in noxious heat transduction, demonstrate its conservation from planarians to humans, and imply that human nociceptive systems may share a common ancestry with those of most extant animals, tracing back their origin to a progenitor that lived more than 500 million years ago.",

    "abstract": "Artificial selection has produced varieties of domesticated maize which thrive in temperate climates around the world. However, the direct progenitor of maize, teosinte, is indigenous only to a relatively small range of tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and grows poorly or not at all outside of this region. Tripsacum, a sister genus to maize and teosinte, is naturally endemic to the majority of areas in the western hemisphere where maize is cultivated. A full-length reference transcriptome for Tripsacum dactyloides generated using long-read isoseq data was used to characterize independent adaptation to temperate climates in this clade. Genes related to phospholipid biosynthesis, a critical component of cold acclimation on other cold adapted plant lineages, were enriched among those genes experiencing more rapid rates of protein sequence evolution in T. dactyloides. In contrast with previous studies of parallel selection, we find that there is a significant overlap between the genes which were targets of artificial selection during the adaptation of maize to temperate climates and those which were targets of natural selection in temperate adapted T. dactyloides. This overlap between the targets of natural and artificial selection suggests genetic changes in crop-wild relatives associated with adaptation to new environments may be useful guides for identifying genetic targets for breeding efforts aimed at adapting crops to a changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have shown that visual cognition blends current visual input with that from the recent past to guide ongoing decision making. This serial dependence is tuned to the similarity between consecutive stimuli and appears to exploit the temporal autocorrelation normally present in visual scenes to promote perceptual stability. While these benefits have been assumed, evidence that serial dependence directly alters stimulus perception has been limited. In the present study, we parametrically vary the delay between stimulus and response in a spatial delayed response task to explore the trajectory of serial dependence from the moment of perception into post-perceptual visual working memory. We find that behavioral responses made immediately after viewing a stimulus show evidence of adaptation, but not attractive serial dependence. Only as the memory period lengthens is a blending of past and present information apparent in behavior, reaching its maximum with a memory delay of six seconds. These results dovetail with other recent findings to bolster the interpretation that serial dependence is a phenomenon of mnemonic rather than perceptual processes. We also demonstrate that when leading mathematical models of visual working memory are adjusted to account for this trial-history effect, their fit to behavioral data is substantially improved.",

Visualization and statistical analysis of Hi-C data is made difficult by the extreme variation in the background frequencies of chromosomal contacts between elements at short and long genomic distances. Here we introduce SHAMAN for performing Hi-C analysis at dynamic scales, without predefined resolution, and while minimizing biases over very large datasets. Algorithmically, we devise a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-like procedure for randomizing contact matrices such that coverage and contact distance distributions are preserved. We combine this strategy with bin-free assessment of contact enrichment using a K-nearest neighbor approach. We show how to use the new method for visualizing contact hotspots and for quantifying differential contacts in matching Hi-C maps. We demonstrate how contact preferences among regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers and insulators can be assessed with minimal bias by comparing pooled empirical and randomized matrices.

Here we introduce Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE) for the analysis of mass cytometry datasets. HSNE constructs a hierarchy of non-linear similarities that can be interactively explored with a stepwise increase in detail up to the single-cell level. We applied HSNE to a study on gastrointestinal disorders and three other available mass cytometry datasets. We found that HSNE efficiently replicates previous observations and identifies rare cell populations that were previously missed due to downsampling. Thus, HSNE removes the scalability limit of conventional t-SNE analysis, a feature that makes it highly suitable for the analysis of massive high-dimensional datasets.",

The multi-compartment protein p32 is overexpressed and present at cell surfaces in a variety of tumors, including TNBC, specifically in the malignant cells and endothelial cells, and in macrophages localized in hypoxic areas of the tumor. Herein we used polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone polymersomes that were affinity targeted with the p32-binding tumor penetrating peptide LinTT1 (AKRGARSTA) for imaging of TNBC lesions. A tyrosine residue was added to the peptide to allow for 124I labeling and PET imaging. In a TNBC model in mice, systemic LinTT1-targeted polymersomes accumulated in early tumor lesions more than twice as efficiently as untargeted polymersomes with up to 20% ID/cc at 24 h after administration. The PET-imaging was very sensitive, allowing detection of tumors as small as [~]20mm3. Confocal imaging of tumor tissue sections revealed a high degree of vascular exit and stromal penetration of LinTT1-targeted polymersomes and co-localization with tumor-associated macrophages.

The TB produces highly motile cells forming the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), a tissue playing an important role in elongation movements. PSM cells establish an anterior-posterior cell motility gradient which parallels the degradation of a specific cellular signal (Fgf8) known to be implicated in cell motility. Here, we combine electroporation of fluorescent reporters in the PSM to time-lapse imaging in the chicken embryo to quantify cell diffusive movements along the motility gradient. We show that simple microscopic and macroscopic mechano-chemical models for tissue extension that couple Fgf activity, cell motility and tissue rheology at both the cellular and continuum levels suffice to capture the speed and extent of elongation. These observations explain how the continuous addition of cells that exhibit a gradual reduction in motility combined with lateral confinement can be converted into an oriented movement that drives body elongation. The results of the models compare well with our experimental results, with implications for other elongation processes in the embryo.",

However, these signals are qualitative and cannot quantify the critical points. Here, we propose a method to estimate critical points quantitatively from spatial data. We employ a spatial model of vegetation that shows a transition from vegetated to bare state. We show that the critical point can be estimated as the ecosystem state and the driver values at which spatial variance and autocorrelation are maximum.

    "abstract": "The variation in degree of offspring dependence in parents where parental care has evolved is striking, from feeding independence at birth to complete dependence on parents for all nutritional resources. This presents an evolutionary puzzle. Why lose the ability to feed as a contingency when parents may die or abandon broods? Comparisons of altricial and precocial vertebrates suggest that there may be life-history and developmental costs to early independence1-3. The generality of this beyond vertebrates is unclear, but we can extend the comparison as invertebrate species also vary in the level of independence in early life-history stages. For example, larvae of several burying beetle species (Nicrophorus), a genus in which parents regurgitate pre-digested food to begging larvae, have lost the ability to self-feed thus creating complete parental dependency for first instars4. Here, we ask whether variation in dependency amongst burying beetles is related to heterochrony in development of a more complex morphological structures. We show that the rate of development and allometry of mandibles of precocial larvae that can self-feed from birth are the same as those in altricial larvae that cannot survive without parenting. Instead, self-feeding is associated with shape variation in mandibles. In altricial species first instar larvae have smooth mandibles, whereas in precocial species mandibles are serrated. Later instars, which can self-feed in all species, have serrated mandibles. Serrations on teeth generally function to \\\"grip and rip\\\"5, whereas smooth blades function more to puncture6, and broods of altricial but not precocial Nicrophorus larvae show evidence for siblicide. We therefore suggest that altricial first-instar mandibles function more as weapons than feeding tools when released from self-feeding. This study presents a novel coevolution between developmental timing and parenting potentially mediated by sibling competition.",

    "abstract": "Experiments show that evolutionary fitness landscapes can have a rich combinatorial structure due to epistasis. For some landscapes, this structure can produce a computational constraint that prevents evolution from finding local fitness optima - thus overturning the traditional assumption that local fitness peaks can always be reached quickly if no other evolutionary forces challenge natural selection. Here, I introduce a distinction between easy landscapes of traditional theory where local fitness peaks can be found in a moderate number of steps and hard landscapes where finding local optima requires an infeasible amount of time. Hard examples exist even among landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis; on these semi-smooth fitness landscapes, strong selection weak mutation dynamics cannot find the unique peak in polynomial time. More generally, on hard rugged fitness landscapes that include reciprocal sign epistasis, no evolutionary dynamics - even ones that do not follow adaptive paths - can find a local fitness optimum quickly. Moreover, on hard landscapes, the fitness advantage of nearby mutants cannot drop off exponentially fast but has to follow a power-law that long term evolution experiments have associated with unbounded growth in fitness. Thus, the constraint of computational complexity enables open-ended evolution on finite landscapes. Knowing this constraint allows us to use the tools of theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization to characterize the fitness landscapes that we expect to see in nature. I present candidates for hard landscapes at scales from single genes, to microbes, to complex organisms with costly learning (Baldwin effect) or maintained cooperation (Hankshaw effect). Just how ubiquitous hard landscapes (and the corresponding ultimate constraint on evolution) are in nature becomes an open empirical question.",

At the level of common variant genetic architecture, we discovered a significant negative genetic correlation between ADHD and intracranial volume (ICV). Meta-analysis of individual variants found significant loci associated with both ADHD risk and ICV; additional loci were identified for ADHD and amygdala, caudate nucleus, and putamen volumes. Gene-set analysis in the ADHD-ICV meta-analytic data showed significant association with variation in neurite outgrowth-related genes.

During this stage, the mitochondrion lacks a functional electron transport chain (ETC). Successful transition to the fly, requires activation of the ETC and ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation. This life cycle leads to a major problem: in the bloodstream, the mitochondrial genes are not under selection and are subject to genetic drift that endangers their integrity. Exacerbating this, T. brucei undergoes repeated population bottlenecks as they evade the host immune system that would create additional forces of genetic drift. These parasites possess several unique genetic features, including RNA editing of mitochondrial transcripts. RNA editing creates open reading frames by the guided insertion and deletion of U-residues within the mRNA. A major question in the field has been why this metabolically expensive system of RNA editing would evolve and persist. Here, we show that many of the edited mRNAs can alter the choice of start codon and the open reading frame by alternative editing of the 5 end. Analyses of mutational bias indicate that six of the mitochondrial genes may be dual-coding and that RNA editing allows access to both reading frames. We hypothesize that dual-coding genes can protect genetic information by essentially hiding a non-selected gene within one that remains under selection. Thus, the complex RNA editing system found in the mitochondria of trypanosomes provides a unique molecular strategy to combat genetic drift in non-selective conditions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn African trypanosomes, many of the mitochondrial mRNAs require extensive RNA editing before they can be translated. During this process, each edited transcript can undergo hundreds of cleavage/ligation events as U-residues are inserted or deleted to generate a translatable open reading frame. A major paradox has been why this incredibly metabolically expensive process would evolve and persist. In this work, we show that many of the mitochondrial genes in trypanosomes are dual-coding, utilizing different reading frames to potentially produce two very different proteins. Access to both reading frames is made possible by alternative editing of the 5 end of the transcript. We hypothesize that dual-coding genes may work to protect the mitochondrial genes from mutations during growth in the mammalian host, when many of the mitochondrial genes are not being used. Thus, the complex RNA editing system may be maintained because it provides a unique molecular strategy to combat genetic drift.",

    "abstract": "Five classical designations of sickle haplotypes are based on the presence/absence of restriction sites and named after ethnic groups or geographic regions from which patients originated. Each haplotype is thought to represent an independent occurrence of the sickle mutation. We investigated the origins of the sickle mutation using whole genome sequence data. We identified 156 carriers from the 1000 Genomes Project, the African Genome Variation Project, and Qatar. We defined a new haplotypic classification using 27 polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with rs334. Network analysis revealed a common haplotype that differed from the ancestral haplotype only by the derived sickle mutation at rs334 and correlated collectively with the Central African Republic/Bantu, Cameroon, and Arabian/Indian designations. Other haplotypes were derived from this haplotype and fell into two clusters, one comprised of haplotypes correlated with the Senegal designation and the other comprised of haplotypes correlated with both the Benin and Senegal designations. The near-exclusive presence of the original sickle haplotype in the Central African Republic, Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa is consistent with this haplotype predating the Bantu Expansion. Modeling of balancing selection indicated that the heterozygote advantage was 15.2%, an equilibrium frequency of 12.0% was reached after 87 generations, and the selective environment predated the mutation. The posterior distribution of the ancestral recombination graph yielded an age of the sickle mutation of 259 generations, corresponding to 7,300 years and the Holocene Wet Phase. These results clarify the origin of the sickle allele and improve and simplify the classification of sickle haplotypes.",

    "abstract": "High-coverage whole-genome sequencing data of a single ethnicity can provide a useful catalogue of population-specific genetic variations. Herein, we report a comprehensive analysis of the Korean population, and present the Korean National Standard Reference Variome (KoVariome). As a part of the Korean Personal Genome Project (KPGP), we constructed the KoVariome database using 5.5 terabases of whole genome sequence data from 50 healthy Korean individuals with an average coverage depth of 31x. In total, KoVariome includes 12.7M single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 1.7M short insertions and deletions (indels), 4K structural variations (SVs), and 3.6K copy number variations (CNVs). Among them, 2.4M (19%) SNVs and 0.4M (24%) indels were identified as novel. We also discovered selective enrichment of 3.8M SNVs and 0.5M indels in Korean individuals, which were used to filter out 1,271 coding-SNVs not originally removed from the 1,000 Genomes Project data when prioritizing disease-causing variants. CNV analyses revealed gene losses related to bone mineral densities and duplicated genes involved in brain development and fat reduction. Finally, KoVariome health records were used to identify novel disease-causing variants in the Korean population, demonstrating the value of high-quality ethnic variation databases for the accurate interpretation of individual genomes and the precise characterization of genetic variations.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome is coiled, compacted and compartmentalized into complex non-random three-dimensional chromatin loops in the nucleus1-3. At the core of chromatin loop formation is CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), also described as a \\\"weaver of the genome\\\"45. Anchored by CTCF, chromatin loops are proposed to form through a loop extrusion process6, organising themselves into gene neighbourhoods2 that harbour insulated enhancer-promoter domains, restricting enhancer activities to genes within loops, and insulating genes from promiscuous interactions outside of loops2,7-9. Studies targeting CTCF binding site deletions at gene neighbourhood boundaries result in localised gene expression dysregulation8,10-12, and global CTCF depletion recently showed CTCF to be crucial for higher hierarchical chromatin organisation of topologically associating domains (TADs)13. However, the role for CTCF in maintaining sub-TAD CTCF gene neighbourhoods and how gene transcription is affected by CTCF loss remains unclear. In particular, how CTCF gene neighbourhoods govern genome-wide enhancer-promoter interactions require clarification. Here, we took an in vivo approach to assess the global dissolution of CTCF anchored structures in mouse cardiomyocyte-specific Ctcf-knockout (Ctcf-KO), and uncovered large-scale ectopic de novo Enhancer-Promoter (E-P) interactions. In vivo cardiomyocyte-specific Ctcf-KO leads to a heart failure phenotype14, but our analysis integrates genome-wide transcription dysregulation with aberrant E-P interactions in context of CTCF-loop structures, identifying how genes engage their E-P interactions, requiring CTCF looping for their maintenance. Our study points to a mammalian genome that possesses a strong propensity towards spontaneous E-P interactions in vivo, resulting in a diseased transcriptional state, manifest as organ failure. This work solidifies the role of CTCF as the central player for specifying global E-P connections.",

    "abstract": "Infection of host cells by Toxoplasma gondii is an active process, which is regulated by secretion of microneme (MICs) and rhoptry proteins (ROPs and RONs) from specialized organelles in the apical pole of the parasite. MIC1, MIC4 and MIC6 assemble into an adhesin complex, secreted on the parasite surface and function to promote infection competency. MIC1 and MIC4 are known to bind terminal sialic acid residues and galactose residues, respectively and to induce IL-12 production from splenocytes. Here we show that rMIC1- and rMIC4-stimulated dendritic cells and macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines, and they do so by engaging TLR2 and TLR4. This process depends on sugar recognition, since point mutations in the carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD) of rMIC1 and rMIC4 inhibit innate immune cells activation. HEK cells transfected with TLR2 glycomutants were selectively unresponsive to MICs. Following in vitro infection, parasites lacking MIC1 or MIC4, as well as expressing MIC proteins with point mutations in their CRD, failed to induce wild-type (WT) levels of IL-12 secretion by innate immune cells. However, only MIC1 was shown to impact systemic levels of IL-12 and IFN-{gamma} in vivo. Together, our data show that MIC1 and MIC4 interact physically with TLR2 and TLR4 N-glycans to trigger IL-12 responses, and MIC1 is playing a significant role in vivo by altering T. gondii infection competency and murine pathogenesis.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYToxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, belonging to the Apicomplexa phylum. This phylum comprises important parasites able to infect a broad diversity of animals, including humans. A particularity of T. gondii is its ability to invade virtually any nucleated cell of all warm-blooded animals through an active process, which depends on the secretion of adhesin proteins. These proteins are discharged by specialized organelles localized in the parasite apical region, and termed micronemes and rhoptries. We show in this study that two microneme proteins from T. gondii utilize their adhesion activity to stimulate innate immunity. These microneme proteins, denoted MIC1 and MIC4, recognize specific sugars on receptors expressed on the surface of mammalian immune cells. This binding activates these innate immune cells to secrete cytokines, which promotes efficient host defense mechanisms against the parasite and regulate their pathogenesis. This activity promotes a chronic infection by controlling parasite replication during acute infection.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe corpus callosum is integral to the central nervous system, and continually develops with age by virtue of increasing axon diameter and ongoing myelination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques offer a means to disentangle these two aspects of white matter development. We investigate the profile of microstructural metrics across the corpus callosum, and assess the impact of age, sex and pubertal development on these processes.\\n\\nMethodsThis study made use of two independent paediatric populations. Multi-shell diffusion MRI data were analysed to produce a suite of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), neurite orientation density and dispersion imaging (NODDI), and apparent fibre density (AFD) metrics. A multivariate profile analysis was performed for each diffusion metric across 10 subdivisions of the corpus callosum.\\n\\nResultsAll diffusion metrics significantly varied across the length of the corpus callosum. AFD exhibited a strong relationship with age across the corpus callosum (partial{eta} 2 = .65), particularly in the posterior body of the corpus callosum (partial{eta} 2 = .72). In addition, females had significantly higher AFD compared with males, most markedly in the anterior splenium (partial{eta} 2 = .14) and posterior genu (partial{eta} 2 = .13). Age-matched pubertal group differences were localised to the splenium.\\n\\nConclusionWe present evidence of a strong relationship between apparent fibre density and age, sex, and puberty during development. These results are consistent with ex vivo studies of fibre morphology, providing insights into the dynamics of axonal development in childhood and adolescence using diffusion MRI.\\n\\nTarget journalsBrain Structure & Function; HBM; NeuroImage; Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience",

    "abstract": "The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs ones analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code, in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing ones analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and thus create reproducible and shareable science. We give the researcher a better oversight of their pipeline, both while developing and communicating their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine. Porcupine is free, open source, andreleased under the GNU General Public License v3.0.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe neuroimaging community is fervently debating that its reproducibility and transparency should be improved, but it is a challenging problem as to how to accomplish this. We here propose a tool, Porcupine, to aid in this process by more easily creating shareable workflows for analysing neuroimaging data. The conceptual understanding of a pipeline is improved by means of the graphical interface, and it automatically produces the code to perform the analysis and to create a sharing environment. This retains full flexibility to modify the script afterwards but in principle produces readily executable code for an end-to-end analysis. Porcupine currently links to all Nipype functionality, but is designed to be extendable to other workflow packages in neuroimaging and beyond. Porcupine is free and is released under the GNU General Public License.",

Here we show that this does not hold true when saccades are prepared towards a recently extinguished target. We obtained detailed maps of orientation sensitivity when participants prepared a saccade toward a target that either remained on the screen or disappeared before the eyes moved. We found that attention was mainly focused at the immediate surround of the visible target and increasingly spread to more peripheral locations as a function of the delay between the targets disappearance and the saccade. Interestingly, this spread was accompanied by an overall increase in sensitivity, speaking against a dilution of limited resources over a larger spatial area. We hypothesize that these results reflect the behavioral consequences of the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual receptive fields in the presence and in the absence a structured visual cue.",

    "abstract": "Several pieces of evidence indicate that elastase-2 (ELA2; chymotrypsin-like ELA2) is an alternative pathway to the generation of angiotensin II (ANG II). Elastase-2 knockout mice (ELA2KO) exhibit alterations in the arterial blood pressure and heart rate. However, there is no data on the behavioral consequences of ELA2 deletion. In this study we addressed this question, submitting ELA2KO and wild-type (WT) mice to several models sensitive to anxiety- and depression-like, memory, and repetitive behaviors. Our data indicates a higher incidence of barbering behavior in ELA2KO compared to WT, as well as an anxiogenic phenotype, evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM). While a decrease in locomotor activity was observed in ELA2KO in EPM, this feature was not the main source of variation in the other parameters analyzed. The marble burying test (MBT) indicated increase in repetitive behavior, observed by a higher number of buried marbles. The actimeter test indicated a decrease in total activity and confirmed the increase in repetitive behavior. The spatial memory was tested by repeated exposure to the actimeter in a 24h interval. Both ELA2KO and WT exhibited decreased activity compared to the first exposure, without any distinction between the genotypes. However, when submitted to the cued fear conditioning, ELA2KO displayed lower levels of freezing behavior in the extinction session when compared to WT, but no difference was observed during the conditioning phase. Increased levels of BDNF were found in the prefrontal cortex but not in the hippocampus of ELA2KO mice compared to WT. Finally, in silico analysis indicates that ELA2 is putatively able to cleave BDNF, and incubation of the purified enzyme with BDNF led to the degradation of the later. Our data suggested an anxiogenic- and antidepressant-like phenotype of ELA2KO, possibly associated with increased levels of BDNF in the prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe propensity for off-target activity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) has been considerably decreased by rationally engineered variants with increased fidelity (eSpCas9; SpCas9-HF1). However, a subset of targets still generate considerable off-target effects. To deal specifically with these targets, we generated new \\\"Highly enhanced Fidelity\\\" nuclease variants (HeFSpCas9s) containing mutations from both eSpCas9 and SpCas9-HF1 and examined these improved nuclease variants side-by-side, to decipher the factors that affect their specificities and to determine the optimal nuclease for applications sensitive to off-target effects.\\n\\nResultsThese three increased-fidelity nucleases can routinely be used only with perfectly matching 20 nucleotide-long spacers; a matching 5' G extension being more detrimental to their activities than a mismatching one. HeFSpCas9s exhibit substantially improved specificity specifically for those targets for which eSpCas9 and SpCas9-HF1 have higher off-target propensity. There is also a ranking among the targets by their cleavability and off-target effects manifested by the increased fidelity nucleases. Furthermore, we show that the mutations in these variants may diminish the cleavage, but not the DNA-binding, of SpCas9s.\\n\\nConclusionsNo single nuclease variant shows generally superior fidelity; instead, for highest specificity cleavage, each target needs to be matched with an appropriate high fidelity nuclease. We provide here a framework for generating new nuclease variants for targets that currently have no matching optimal nuclease, and offer a simple mean for identifying the optimal nuclease for targets in the absence of accurate target-ranking prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a pathology that manifests due to micro-structural defects in the aortic wall. Blood enters the damaged wall through an intimal tear, thereby creating a so-called false lumen and exposing the blood to thrombogenic intramural constituents such as collagen. The natural history of this acute vascular injury thus depends, in part, on thrombus formation, maturation, and possible healing within the false lumen. A key question is: Why do some false lumens thrombose completely while other thrombose partially or little at all? An ability to predict the location and extent of thrombus in subjects with dissection could contribute significantly to clinical decision-making, including interventional design. We develop, for the first time, a data-driven particle-continuum model for thrombus formation in a murine model of aortic dissection. In the proposed model, we simulate a final-value problem in lieu of the original initial-value problem with significantly fewer particles that may grow in size upon activation, representing the local concentration of blood-borne species. Numerical results confirm that geometry and local hemodynamics play significant roles in the acute progression of thrombus. Despite geometrical differences between murine and human dissections, mouse models can provide considerable insight and have gained in popularity owing to their reproducibility. Our results for three classes of geometrically different false lumens show that thrombus forms and extends to a greater extent in regions with lower bulk shear rates. Dense thrombi are less likely to form in high-shear zones and in the presence of strong vortices.

    "abstract": "Annexins, a family of highly conserved calcium-and phospholipid-binding proteins, play important roles in a wide range of physiological functions. Among the twelve known annexins in human, Annexin A2 (AnxA2) is one of the most extensively studied and has been implicated in various human diseases. AnxA2 can exist as a monomer or a heterotetrameric complex with S100A10 (P11) and plays a critical role in many cellular processes including exocytosis/endocytosis and membrane organization. At the endothelial cell surface, (AnxA2*P11)2 tetramer, acting as a coreceptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), accelerates t-PA dependent activation of the fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, the enzyme responsible for thrombus dissolution and degradation of fibrin. This study shows that exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP isoform 1 (EPAC1) interacts with AnxA2 and regulates its biological functions by modulating its membrane translocation in endothelial cells. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, it is demonstrated that EPAC1, acting through the PLC{varepsilon}-PKC pathway, inhibits AnxA2 surface translocation and plasminogen activation. These results suggest that EPAC1 plays a role in the regulation of fibrinolysis in endothelial cells and may represent a novel therapeutic target for disorders of fibrinolysis.",

We asked whether very obese children with ASD had different behavioral, physical and genetic characteristics compared to children with ASD who were not obese. We found that very obese children with ASD had significantly poorer scores on standardized behavioral tests. Very obese boys with ASD had lower full scale IQ and increased impairments with respect to stereotypies, communication and social skills. Very obese girls with ASD had increased impairments with respect to irritability and oppositional defiant behavior. We identified genetic lesions in a subset of the children with ASD and obesity and attempted to identify enriched biological pathways. Our study demonstrates the value of identifying co-morbidities in children with ASD as we move forward towards understanding the biological processes that contribute to this complex disorder and prepare to design customized treatments that target the diverse genetic lesions present in individuals with ASD.",

    "abstract": "Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.",

Host response to viral infection typically includes virus-induced rewiring of metabolic network to supply essential building blocks for viral assembly, as opposed to activation of anti-viral host defense. Nevertheless, there is a major bottleneck to accurately discern between viral hijacking strategies and host defense responses when averaging bulk population response. Here we use Emiliania huxleyi, a bloom-forming alga and its specific virus (EhV), as one of the most ecologically important host-virus model system in the ocean. Using automatic microfluidic setup to capture individual algal cells, we quantified host and virus gene expression on a single-cell resolution during the course of infection. We revealed high heterogeneity in viral gene expression among individual cells. Simultaneous measurements of expression profiles of host and virus genes at a single-cell level allowed mapping of infected cells into newly defined infection states and uncover a yet unrecognized early phase in host response that occurs prior to viral expression. Intriguingly, resistant cells emerged during viral infection, showed unique expression profiles of metabolic genes which can provide the basis for discerning between viral resistant and sensitive cells within heterogeneous populations in the marine environment. We propose that resolving host-virus arms race at a single-cell level will provide important mechanistic insights into viral life cycles and will uncover host defense strategies.",

    "abstract": "The DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase catalyzes genome-wide DNA demethylation and is required for endosperm genomic imprinting and embryo viability. Targets of DME-mediated DNA demethylation reside in small, euchromatic, AT-rich transposons and at the boundaries of large transposons, but how DME interacts with these diverse chromatin states is unknown. The STRUCTURE SPECIFIC RECOGNITION PROTEIN 1 (SSRP1), subunit of the chromatin remodeler FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions (FACT), was previously shown to be involved in the DME-dependent regulation of genomic imprinting in Arabidopsis endosperm. Therefore, to investigate the interaction between DME and chromatin, we focused on the activity of the two FACT subunits, SSRP1 and SUPPRESSOR of TY16 (SPT16), during reproduction in Arabidopsis. We find that FACT co-localizes with nuclear DME in vivo, and that DME has two classes of target sites, the first being euchromatic and accessible to DME, but the second, representing over half of DME targets, requiring the action of FACT for DME-mediated DNA demethylation genome-wide. Our results show that the FACT-dependent DME targets are GC-rich heterochromatin domains with high nucleosome occupancy enriched with H3K9me2 and H3K27me1. Further, we demonstrate that heterochromatin-associated linker histone H1 specifically mediates the requirement for FACT at a subset of DME-target loci. Overall, our results demonstrate that FACT is required for DME targeting by facilitating its access to heterochromatin.",

    "abstract": "Recently, organ-scale intercellular Ca2+ transients (ICTs) were reported in the Drosophila wing disc. However, the functional in vivo significance of ICTs remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate the in vivo relevance of intercellular Ca2+ signaling and its impact on wing development. We report that Ca2+ signaling in vivo decreases as wing discs mature. Ca2+ signaling ex vivo responds to fly extract in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests ICTs occur in vivo due to chemical stimulus that varies in concentration during development. RNAi mediated inhibition of genes required for ICTs results in defects in the size, shape, and vein patterning of adult wings. It also leads to reduction or elimination of in vivo Ca2+ transients. Further, perturbations to the extracellular matrix along the basal side of the wing disc stimulates intercellular Ca2+ waves. This is the first identified chemically defined, non-wounding stimulus of ICTs. Together, these results point toward specific in vivo functions of intercellular Ca2+ signaling to mediate mechanical stress dissipation and ensure robust patterning during development.",

    "abstract": "With the increase in the availability of genomic data, sequences from different loci are usually concatenated in a supermatrix for phylogenetic inference. However, as an alternative to the supermatrix approach, several implementations of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) have been increasingly used in phylogenomic analyses due to their advantages in accommodating gene tree topological heterogeneity by taking account population-level processes. Moreover, the development of faster algorithms under the MSC is enabling the analysis of thousands of loci/taxa. Here, we explored the MSC approach for a phylogenomic dataset of Insecta. Even with the challenges posed by insects, due to large effective population sizes coupled with short deep internal branches, our MSC analysis could recover several orders and evolutionary relationships in agreement with current insect systematics. However, some phylogenetic relationships were not recovered by MSC methods. Most noticeable, a remiped crustacean was positioned within the Insecta. Additionally, the interordinal relationships within Polyneoptera and Neuropteroidea contradicted recent works, by suggesting the non-monophyly of Neuroptera. We notice, however, that these phylogenetic arrangements were also poorly supported by previous analyses and that they were sensitive to gene sampling.",

The latency, polarity and magnitude of current and spike rate modulation were not predicted by the canonical cortical microcircuit. Pronounced synaptic currents in layer 2/3, which are modulated by loss magnitude, will contribute to the error-related negativity (ERN) and feedback-related negativity (FRN).

The purity of zerumbone was determined through high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Different concentrations of zerumbone were tested against the standard strain S. mutans (ATCC 35668) by using microdilution method. The speed of cidal activity was determined through a time kill-curve assay. The biological cytotoxicity activity of zerumbone was assessed using Vero Cell line through MTT assay.\\n\\nResultsThe zerumbone showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of [&ge;] 250g/ mL and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of [&ge;] 500g/mL against S. mutans.

    "abstract": "We develop and analyze a system of differential equations to investigate the effects of G2 checkpoint dynamics on the low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity. In experimental studies, it has been found that certain cell lines are more sensitive to low-dose radiation than would be expected from the classical Linear Quadratic model (LQ model). In fact, it is frequently observed that cells incur more damage at a low dose (say 0.3 Gy) than at higher dose (say 1 Gy). This effect has been termed hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS). The HRS is followed by a period of relative radioresistance (per unit dose) of cell kill over the dose range of ~ 0.5 - 1 Gy. This latter phenomenon is termed increased radioresistance (IRR). These effects depend on the type of cells and on their phase in the cell cycle. Here we focus on the HRS phenomenon by fitting a model for the cell cycle that includes G2-checkpoint dynamics and radiation treatment to surviving fraction data for different cell lines including glioma cells, prostate cancer cells, as well as to cell populations that are enriched in certain phases of the cell cycle. The HRS effect is measured in the literature through [Formula], the ratio of slope s, of the surviving fraction curve at zero dose to slope  of the corresponding LQ model. We derive an explicit formula for this ratio and we show that it corresponds very closely to experimental observations. Finally, we can identify the dependence of this ratio on the surviving fraction at 2 Gy. It was speculated in the literature that such a relation exists. Our theoretical analysis will help to more systematically identify the HRS in cell lines and opens doors to analyze its use in cancer treatment.\\n\\nPACS and mathematical subject classification numbers as needed.",

    "abstract": "Large bodied organisms have more cells that can potentially turn cancerous than smallbodied organisms with fewer cells, imposing an increased risk of developing cancer. This expectation predicts a positive correlation between body size and cancer risk, however, there is no correlation between body size and cancer risk across species ( Petos Paradox). Here we show that elephants and their extinct relatives (Proboscideans) may have resolved Petos Paradox in part through re-functionalizing a leukemia inhibitory factor pseudogene (LIF6) with pro-apoptotic functions. The LIF6 gene is transcriptionally up-regulated by TP53 in response to DNA damage, and translocates to the mitochondria where it induces apoptosis. Phylogenetic analyses of living and extinct Proboscidean LIF6 genes indicates its TP53 response element evolved coincident with the evolution of large body sizes in the Proboscidean stem-lineage. These results suggest that re-functionalizing of a pro-apoptotic LIF pseudogene may have been permissive (though not sufficient) for the evolution of large body sizes in Proboscideans.",

    "abstract": "How does the brain combine information predictive of the value of a visually guided task (incentive value) with information predictive of where task relevant stimuli may occur (spatial certainty)? Human behavioural evidence indicates that these two predictions may be combined additively to bias visual selection (additive hypothesis), whereas neuroeconomic studies posit that they may be multiplicatively combined (expected value hypothesis). We sought to adjudicate between these two alternatives. Participants viewed two coloured placeholders that specified the potential value of correctly identifying an imminent letter target if it appeared in that placeholder. Then, prior to the targets presentation, an endogenous spatial cue was presented indicating the targets more likely location. Spatial cues were parametrically manipulated with regards to the information gained (in bits). Across two experiments, performance was better for targets appearing in high versus low value placeholders and better when targets appeared in validly cued locations. Interestingly, as shown with a Bayesian model selection approach, these effects did not interact, clearly supporting the additive hypothesis. Even when conditions were adjusted to increase the optimality of a multiplicative operation, support for it remained. These findings refute recent theories that expected value computations are the singular mechanism driving the deployment of endogenous spatial attention. Instead, incentive value and spatial certainty seem to act independently to influence visual selection.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex is implicated in learning the rules of an environment through trial and error. But it is unclear how such learning is related to the prefrontal cor-texs role in short-term memory. Here we asked if the encoding of short-term memory in prefrontal cortex was used by rats learning decision rules in a Y-maze task. We found that a similar pattern of neural ensemble activity was selectively recalled after reinforcement for a correct decision. This reinforcement-selective recall only reliably occurred immediately before the abrupt behavioural transitions indicating successful learning of the current rule, and faded quickly thereafter. We could simultaneously decode multiple, retrospective task events from the ensemble activity, suggesting the recalled ensemble activity had multiplexed encoding of prior events. Our results suggest that successful trial-and-error learning is dependent on reinforcement tagging the relevant features of the environment to maintain in prefrontal cortex short-term memory.",

    "abstract": "Prism adaptation has a long history as an experimental paradigm used to investigate the functional and neural processes that underlie sensorimotor control. In the neuropsychology literature, functional explanations of prism adaptation are typically framed within a traditional cognitive psychology  box-and-arrow framework that distinguishes putative component functions thought to give rise to behaviour (i.e.  strategic control versus  spatial realignment). However, this kind of theoretical framework lacks precision and explanatory power. Here, we advocate for a computational framework that offers several advantages: 1) an algorithmic explanatory account of the computations and operations that drive behaviour; 2) expressed in quantitative mathematical terms; 3) embedded within a principled theoretical framework (Bayesian decision theory, state-space modelling); 4) that offers a means to generate and test quantitative behavioural predictions. This computational framework offers a route toward mechanistic explanations of prism adaptation behaviour. Thus it constitutes a conceptual advance compared to the traditional theoretical framework. In this paper, we illustrate how Bayesian decision theory and state-space models offer principled explanations for a range of behavioural phenomena in the field of prism adaptation (e.g. visual capture, magnitude of visual versus proprioceptive realignment, spontaneous recovery and dynamics of adaptation memory). We argue that this explanatory framework offers to advance understanding of the functional and neural mechanisms that implement prism adaptation behaviour, by enabling quantitative tests of hypotheses that go beyond mere descriptive mapping claims that  brain area X is (somehow) involved in psychological process Y.",

    "abstract": "Sensory stimuli evoke spiking activities patterned across neurons and time that are hypothesized to encode information about their identity. Since the same stimulus can be encountered in a multitude of ways, how stable or flexible are these stimulus-evoked responses? Here, we examined this issue in the locust olfactory system. In the antennal lobe, we found that both spatial and temporal features of odor-evoked responses varied in a stimulus-history dependent manner. The response variations were not random, but allowed the antennal lobe circuit to enhance the uniqueness of the current stimulus. Nevertheless, information about the odorant identity became confounded due to this contrast-enhancement computation. Notably, a linear logical classifier (OR-of-ANDs) that can decode information distributed in flexible subsets of neurons generated predictions that matched results from our behavioral experiments. In sum, our results reveal a simple computational logic for achieving the stability vs. flexibility tradeoff in sensory coding.",
