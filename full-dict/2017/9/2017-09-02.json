    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence of a \\\"set-point\\\" for body weight in the brain, that is regulated by the hypothalamus. This system modifies feeding behavior and metabolic rate, to keep body fat within predetermined parameters. It is also known that animals subjected to chronic centrifugation show a reduction in body fat. Experiments with mutant mice found that this loss of fat appears to be mediated by a vestibulo-hypothalamic pathway. Vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), also known as galvanic vestibular stimulation, involves non-invasively stimulating the vestibular system by applying a small electrical current between two electrodes placed over the mastoid processes. We suggest that any means of repeatedly stimulating the otolith organs in humans would cause a reduction in total body fat, and that VeNS would be a useful technique to use in this regard. Below we provide pilot data to support this idea.",

We recently developed a new high-throughput platform for mapping chemical-genetic (CG) interactions in yeast that can be scaled to screen large compound collections, and we applied this system to generate CG interaction profiles for more than 13,000 compounds. When integrated with the existing global yeast genetic interaction network, CG interaction profiles can enable mode-of-action prediction for previously uncharacterized compounds as well as discover unexpected secondary effects for known drugs. To facilitate future analysis of these valuable data, we developed a public database and web interface named MOSAIC. The website provides a convenient interface for querying compounds, bioprocesses (GO terms), and genes for CG information including direct CG interactions, bioprocesses, and gene-level target predictions. MOSAIC also provides access to chemical structure information of screened molecules, chemical-genomic profiles, and the ability to search for compounds sharing structural and functional similarity. This resource will be of interest to chemical biologists for discovering new small molecule probes with specific modes-of-action as well as computational biologists interested in analyzing CG interaction networks.\\n\\nAvailabilityMOSAIC is available at http://mosaic.cs.umn.edu.\\n\\nContactchadm@umn.edu, charlie.boone@utoronto.ca, yoshidam@riken.jp, or hisyo@riken.jp",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated many low-penetrance loci in schizophrenia. However, its pathological mechanisms are poorly understood, which in turn hampers the development of novel pharmacological treatments. Pathway and gene set analyses carry the potential to generate hypotheses about disease mechanisms and have provided biological context to genome-wide data of schizophrenia. We aimed to examine which biological processes are likely candidates to underlie schizophrenia by integrating novel and powerful pathway analysis tools using data from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia GWAS (N = 79 845) and the most recent 2018 schizophrenia GWAS (N = 105 318). By applying a primary unbiased analysis (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation; MAGMA) to weigh the role of biological processes from the MSigDB database, we identified enrichment of common variants in synaptic plasticity and neuron differentiation gene sets. We supported these findings using MAGMA, Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA) and Interval Enrichment Analysis (INRICH) on detailed synaptic signaling pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and found enrichment in mainly the dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses. Moreover, shared genes involved in these neurotransmitter systems had a large contribution to the observed enrichment, protein products of top genes in these pathways showed more direct and indirect interactions than expected by chance, and expression profiles of these genes were largely similar among brain tissues. In conclusion, we provide strong and consistent genetics and protein-interaction informed evidence for the role of postsynaptic signaling processes in schizophrenia, opening avenues for future translational and psychopharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "The loading of small RNA (sRNA) into Argonaute (AGO) complexes is a crucial step in all regulatory pathways identified so far in plants that depend on such non-coding sequences. Important transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms can be activated depending on the specific AGO protein to which sRNA bind. It is known that sRNA-AGO associations are at least partly encoded in the sRNA primary structure, but the sequence features that drive this association have not been fully explored. Here we train support vector machines (SVM) on sRNA sequencing data obtained from AGO-immunoprecipitation experiments to identify features that determine sRNA affinity to specific AGOs. Our SVM reveal that AGO affinity is strongly determined by complex k-mers in the 5 and 3 ends of sRNA, in addition to well-known features such as sRNA length and the base composition of the first nucleotide. Moreover, we find that these k-mers tend to overlap known transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, thus highlighting a close interplay between TF and sRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation. We embedded the learned SVM in a computational pipeline that can be used for de novo functional classification of sRNA sequences.

    "abstract": "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) plays key roles during embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. Cells in a partial EMT or hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype tend to exhibit collective cell migration, forming clusters of circulating tumour cells - the primary drivers of metastasis. Activation of cell-cell signalling pathways such as Notch fosters a partial or complete EMT, yet the mechanisms enabling cluster formation remain poorly understood. Using an integrated computational-experimental approach, we examine the role of Numb - an inhibitor of Notch intercellular signalling - in mediating EMT and clusters formation of hybrid E/M cells. Knockdown of Numb in stable hybrid E/M cells H1975 results in a full EMT, thereby showing that Numb acts as a brake for a full EMT. Consistent with this observation, we show via a mathematical model that Numb inhibits a full EMT by stabilizing a hybrid E/M phenotype. Thus, Numb can behave as a  phenotypic stability factor by modulating Notch-driven EMT. By generalizing the mathematical model to a multi-cell level, Numb is predicted to alter the balance of hybrid E/M versus mesenchymal cells in clusters, potentially resulting in a higher tumour-initiation ability. Finally, Numb correlates with a poor survival in multiple independent lung and ovarian cancer datasets, hence confirming its relationship with increased cancer aggressiveness.\\n\\nMajor Findings: we adopt an integrative computational-experimental approach to identify that Numb, an inhibitor of Notch signalling, can stabilize a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype. We show that knockdown of Numb in H1975 cells that display a stable hybrid E/M state is sufficient to destabilize a hybrid E/M state and push them to a full EMT phenotype. Next, we develop a mechanism-based mathematical model that recapitulates this ability of Numb in maintaining a hybrid E/M state, and predicts that Numb can alter the relative frequency of hybrid E/M and mesenchymal cells at a tissue level or in clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) - the primary drivers of metastasis. Finally, we show that across cancer types, Numb correlates with worse patient survival, thus reinforcing the emerging notion that a hybrid E/M, but not necessarily a completely mesenchymal, phenotype associates with elevated tumour progression.",

    "abstract": "How HIV-1 genomic RNA (gRNA) is packaged into assembling virus remains unclear. Here, we use biochemical and in situ approaches to identify the complex in which the capsid protein Gag first associates with gRNA, termed the packaging initiation complex. First, we show that in the absence of assembling Gag, non-nuclear non-translating gRNA is nearly absent from the soluble fraction of provirus-expressing cells, and is found instead primarily in complexes >30S. When we express a Gag mutant known to be arrested at packaging initiation, we find only one complex containing Gag and gRNA; thus, this complex corresponds to the packaging initiation complex. This [~]80S complex also contains two cellular facilitators of assembly, ABCE1 and the RNA granule protein DDX6, and therefore corresponds to a co-opted host RNA granule and a previously described capsid assembly intermediate. Additionally, we find this granule-derived packaging initiation complex in HIV-1-infected H9 T cells, and demonstrate that wild-type Gag forms both the packaging initiation complex and a larger granule-derived complex corresponding to a late packaging/assembly intermediate. We also demonstrate that packaging initiation complexes are far more numerous than P bodies in situ. Finally, we show that Gag enters the [~]80S granule to form the packaging initiation complex via a two-step mechanism. In a step that is independent of a gRNA-binding domain, Gag enters a broad class of RNA granules, most of which lack gRNA. In a second step that is dependent on the gRNA-binding nucleocapsid domain of Gag or a heterologous gRNA-binding domain, Gag enters a gRNA-containing subset of these granules. Thus, we conclude that packaging in cells does not result from random encounters between Gag and gRNA; instead our data support a fundamentally different model in which Gag is directed to gRNA within a unique host RNA granule to initiate this critical event in HIV-1 replication.\\n\\nNontechnical SummaryTo form infectious virus, the HIV-1 capsid protein Gag must associate with and package the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) during the virus assembly process. HIV-1 Gag first associates with gRNA in the cytoplasm, forming a complex termed the packaging initiation complex; this complex subsequently targets to the plasma membrane where Gag completes the assembly and packaging process before releasing the virus from the cell. Although the packaging initiation complex is critical for infectious virus formation, its identity and composition, and the mechanism by which it is formed, remain unknown. Here we identify the packaging initiation complex, and demonstrate that it corresponds to a host RNA granule that is co-opted by the virus. RNA granules are diverse complexes utilized by host cells for all aspects of RNA storage and metabolism besides translation. Our study also defines the mechanism by which HIV-1 Gag enters this host RNA granule to form the packaging initiation complex, and reveal that it involves two steps that depend on different regions of Gag. Our finding that Gag co-opts a poorly studied host complex to first associate with gRNA during packaging provides a new paradigm for understanding this critical event in the viral life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Biologists establish the existence of experimental effects by applying treatments or interventions to biological entities or units, such as people, animals, slice preparations, or cells. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity-intervention pair contributes to the sample size (N) and forms the basis of statistical inference. However, sometimes the appropriate entity-intervention pair may not be obvious, and the wrong choice can make an experiment worthless. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents but effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities have provided clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17% to 29%) replicated the correct entity-intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Approximately half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38% to 53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26% to 39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, leading to more false positive results and inflating the apparent evidence supporting a scientific claim. It is hard for science to advance when so many experiments are poorly designed and analysed. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide guidelines for designing and analysing in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments.",

    "abstract": "The visual system is characterized by a strict topographic organization from the retina towards multiple layers of synaptic integration. Recent studies in Drosophila have shown that in the transition from the optic lobes to the central brain, due to convergence of columnar neurons onto optic glomeruli, distinct synaptic units employed in the computation of different visual features, the retinotopic representation is lost in these circuits. However, functional imaging revealed a spatial representation of visual cues in the Drosophila central complex, raising the question about the underlying circuitry, which bypasses optic glomerulus convergence.\\n\\nWhile characterizing afferent arborizations within Drosophila visual glomeruli, we discovered a spatial segregation of topographic and non-topographic projections from distinct molecular classes of medulla projection neurons, medullo-tubercular (MeTu) neurons, into a specific central brain glomerulus, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTu). Single cell analysis revealed that topographic information is organized by ensembles of MeTu neurons (type 1), forming parallel channels within the AOTu, while a separate class of MeTu neurons (type 2) displays convergent projection, associated with a loss of spatial resolution. MeTu afferents in the AOTu synapse onto a matching topographic field of output projection neurons, these tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons relay visual information towards dendritic fields of central complex ring neurons in the bulb neuropil. Within the bulb, neuronal proximity of the topographic AOTu map as well as channel identity is maintained despite the absence of a stereotyped map organization, providing the structural basis for spatial representation of visual information in the central complex (CX). TuBu neurons project onto dendritic fields of efferent ring neurons, where distinct sectors of the bulb correspond to a distinct ring domain in the ellipsoid body. We found a stereotypic circuitry for each analyzed TuBu class, thus the individual channels of peripheral topography are maintained in the central complex structure. Together with previous data showing rough topography within the lobula AOTu domain, our results on the organization of medulla projection neurons define the AOTu neuropil as the main relay station for spatial information from the optic lobes into the central brain.",
