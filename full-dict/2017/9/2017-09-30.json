    "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae infection of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) is a major cause of disease-induced wilting in soil-grown strawberries across the world. To understand what components of the pathogen are affecting disease expression, the presence of the known effector VdAve1 was screened in a sample of Verticillium dahliae isolates. Isolates from strawberry were found to contain VdAve1 and were divided into two major clades, based upon their vegetative compatibility groups (VCG); no UK strawberry isolates contained VdAve1. VC clade was strongly related to their virulence levels. VdAve1-containing isolates pathogenic on strawberry were found in both clades, in contrast to some recently published findings.\\n\\nOn strawberry, VdAve1-containing isolates had significantly higher virulence during early infection, which diminished in significance as the infection progressed. Transformation of a virulent non-VdAve1 containing isolate, with VdAve1 was found neither to increase nor decrease virulence when inoculated on a susceptible strawberry cultivar. There are therefore virulence factors that are epistatic to VdAve1 and potentially multiple independent routes to high virulence on strawberry in V. dahliae lineages.\\n\\nGenome sequencing a subset of isolates across the two VCGs revealed that isolates were differentiated at the whole genome level and contained multiple changes in putative effector content, indicating that different clonal VCGs may have evolved different strategies for infecting strawberry, leading to different virulence levels in pathogenicity tests. It is therefore important to consider both clonal lineage and effector complement as the adaptive potential of each lineage will differ, even if they contain the same race determining effector.",

    "abstract": "Individual response to stress is correlated with neuroticism and is an important predictor of both neuroticism and the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD). Identification of the genetics underpinning individual differences in response to negative events (stress-sensitivity) may improve our understanding of the molecular pathways involved, and its association with stress-related illnesses. We sought to generate a proxy for stress-sensitivity through modelling the interaction between SNP allele and MDD status on neuroticism score in order to identify genetic variants that contribute to the higher neuroticism seen in individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of depression compared to unaffected individuals. Meta-analysis of genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) in UK Biobank (N = 23,092) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (N = 7,155) identified no genome-wide significance SNP interactions. However, gene-based tests identified a genome-wide significant gene, ZNF366, a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptor function implicated in alcohol dependence (p = 1.48x10-7; Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold p < 2.79x10-6). Using summary statistics from the stress-sensitivity term of the GWIS, SNP heritability for stress-sensitivity was estimated at 5.0%. In models fitting polygenic risk scores of both MDD and neuroticism derived from independent GWAS, we show that polygenic risk scores derived from the UK Biobank stress-sensitivity GWIS significantly improved the prediction of MDD in Generation Scotland. This study may improve interpretation of larger genome-wide association studies of MDD and other stress-related illnesses, and the understanding of the etiological mechanisms underpinning stress-sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation of proteins at multiple sites creates different phosphorylation patterns that are essential for their biological activity. For example, such patterns contribute to the redirection of signalling to alternative pathways. Multi-phosphorylated peptides are excellent tools to systematically study the impact of unique phosphorylation patterns on signalling, but their synthesis is extremely difficult. Here we present an efficient and general method for the synthesis of multi-phosphorylated peptides, using a combination of different tailor-made coupling conditions. The method was demonstrated for the synthesis of a library of Rhodopsin C terminal peptides with distinct phosphorylation patterns containing up to seven phosphorylated Ser (pSer) and Thr (pThr) residues in close proximity to one another. Our method can be used to synthesize peptides incorporating multiple phosphorylated amino acids at high efficiency. It does not require any special expertise and can be performed in any standard peptide laboratory. This approach opens the way for quantitative mechanistic studies of phosphorylation patterns and their biological roles.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDDried blood spots (DBSs) have potential use in remote health applications for individual and population diagnosis, and can enable epidemiological surveillance for known and unknown diseases. The preparation and transportation of DBSs from remote settings often exposes these cards to extreme environmental stress that may impact the quality of the diagnostic data. Given these risks, it is essential to investigate the individual stabilities of biomarkers in DBSs. This paper details the stability of routinely-analyzed amino acids (AAs) on DBSs under environmental conditions that simulate a global health workflow.\\n\\nMETHODSThe extractions of 21 AAs from three sets of DBSs prepared on cellulose and cotton filter paper were optimized for quantitation by dansylation-UPLC/MRM-MS. The effects of sunlight exposure, temperature, humidity, and storage time were studied.\\n\\nRESULTSThe AAs were stable in DBSs after 4-hour sunlight exposure, and after storage at -20 and 4 {degrees}C for 30 days. At 25 and 40 {degrees}C, only 7 AAs showed significant concentration decreases over time, while 2 showed concentration increases. The changes were accelerated by high humidity. Histidine was the least stable AA under the conditions tested.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThis study provides quantitative data on the short-term stabilities of 21 AAs in DBSs on cellulose and cotton-based filter paper, under environmental conditions that simulate a global-health workflow. These results highlight the importance of assessing the stability of clinically-relevant biomarkers in DBSs. Based on the measured stabilities, we recommend that higher-temperature and high-humidity storage of DBS samples be avoided for AA analysis in remote health applications.",

    "abstract": "Canine malignant melanoma, a significant cause of mortality in domestic dogs, is a powerful comparative model for human melanoma, but little is known about its genetic etiology. We mapped the genomic landscape of canine melanoma through multi-platform analysis of 37 tumors (31 mucosal, 3 acral, 2 cutaneous, and 1 uveal) and 17 matching constitutional samples including long- and short-insert whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism array, and targeted Sanger sequencing analyses. We identified novel predominantly truncating mutations in the putative tumor suppressor gene PTPRJ in 19% of cases. No BRAF mutations were detected, but activating RAS mutations (24% of cases) occurred in conserved hotspots in all cutaneous and acral and 13% of mucosal subtypes. MDM2 amplifications (24%) and TP53 mutations (19%) were mutually exclusive. Additional low-frequency recurrent alterations were observed amidst low point mutation rates, an absence of ultraviolet light mutational signatures, and an abundance of copy number and structural alterations. Mutations that modulate cell proliferation and cell cycle control were common and highlight therapeutic axes such as MEK and MDM2 inhibition. This mutational landscape resembles that seen in BRAF wild-type and sun-shielded human melanoma subtypes. Overall, these data inform biological comparisons between canine and human melanoma while suggesting actionable targets in both species.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMelanoma, an aggressive cancer arising from transformed melanocytes, commonly occurs in pet dogs. Unlike human melanoma, which most often occurs in sun-exposed cutaneous skin, canine melanoma typically arises in sun-shielded oral mucosa. Clinical features of canine melanoma resemble those of human melanoma, particularly the less common sun-shielded human subtypes. However, whereas the genomic basis of diverse human melanoma subtypes is well understood, canine melanoma genomics remain poorly defined. Similarly, although diverse new treatments for human melanoma based on a biologic disease understanding have recently shown dramatic improvements in outcomes for these patients, treatments for canine melanoma are limited and outcomes remain universally poor. Detailing the genomic basis of canine melanoma thus provides untapped potential for improving the lives of pet dogs while also helping to establish canine melanoma as a comparative model system for informing human melanoma biology and treatment. In order to better define the genomic landscape of canine melanoma, we performed multi-platform characterization of 37 tumors. Our integrated analysis confirms that these tumors commonly contain mutations in canine orthologs of human cancer genes such as RAS, MDM2, and TP53 as well mutational patterns that share important similarities with human melanoma subtypes. We have also found a new putative cancer gene, PTPRJ, frequently mutated in canine melanoma. These data will guide additional biologic and therapeutic studies in canine melanoma while framing the utility of comparative studies of canine and human cancers more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic (or human-caused) wildfire is an increasingly important driver of ecological change on Pacific islands including southeastern Polynesia, but fire ecology studies are almost completely absent for this region. Where observations do exist, they mostly represent descriptions of fire effects on plant communities before the introduction of invasive species in the modern era. Understanding the effects of wildfire in southeastern Polynesian island vegetation communities can elucidate which species may become problematic invasives with continued wildfire activity. We investigate the effects of wildfire on vegetation in three low-elevation sites (45-379 m) on the island of Moorea in the Society Islands, French Polynesia, which are already heavily impacted by past human land use and invasive exotic plants, but retain some native flora. In six study areas (3 burned and 3 unburned comparisons), we placed 30 transects across sites and collected species and abundance information at 390 points. We analyzed each local community of plants in three categories: natives, those introduced by Polynesians before European contact (1767 C.E.), and those introduced since European contact. Burned areas had the same or lower mean species richness than paired comparison sites. Although wildfire did not affect the proportions of native and introduced species, it may increase the abundance of introduced species on some sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicates that (not recently modified) comparison plant communities are more distinct from one another than are those on burned sites. We discuss conservation concerns for particular native plants absent from burned sites, as well as invasive species (including Lantana camara and Paraserianthes falcataria) that may be promoted by fire in the Pacific.",

    "abstract": "In many diploid species the sex chromosomes play a special role in mediating reproductive isolation. In haplodiploids, where females are diploid and males haploid, the whole genome behaves similarly to the X/Z chromosomes of diploids. Therefore, haplodiploid systems can serve as a model for the role of sex chromosomes in speciation and hybridization. A previously described population of Finnish Formica wood ants displays genome-wide signs of ploidally and sexually antagonistic selection resulting from hybridization. Here, hybrid females have increased survivorship but hybrid males are inviable. To understand how the unusual hybrid population may be maintained, we developed a mathematical model with hybrid incompatibility, female heterozygote advantage, recombination, and assortative mating. The rugged fitness landscape resulting from the co-occurrence of heterozygote advantage and hybrid incompatibility results in a sexual conflict in haplodiploids, which is caused by the ploidy difference. Thus, whereas heterozygote advantage always promotes long-term polymorphism in diploids, we find various outcomes in haplodiploids in which the population stabilizes either in favor of males, females, or via maximizing the number of introgressed individuals. We discuss these outcomes with respect to the potential long-term fate of the Finnish wood ant population, and provide approximations for the extension of the model to multiple incompatibilities. Moreover, we highlight the general implications of our results for speciation and hybridization in haplodiploids versus diploids, and how the described fitness relationships could contribute to the outstanding role of sex chromosomes as hotspots of sexual antagonism and genes involved in speciation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain are of immense clinical and research utility. At the atomic and subatomic levels, the sources of MR signals are well understood. However, at the macromolecular scale, we lack a comprehensive understanding of what determines MR signal contrast. To address this gap, we used genome-wide measurements to correlate gene expression with MR signal intensity across the cortex in the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We focused on the ratio of T1-weighted and T2-weighted intensities (T1-w/T2-w) which is considered to be a useful proxy for myelin content. Positive correlations between myelin-associated genes and the ratio supported its use as a myelin marker. However, stronger correlations were observed for neurofilaments, and genes linked to the production of formaldehyde (which cross-links protein to create larger molecules). There was also an association with protein mass, with genes coding for heavier proteins expressed in regions with high T1-w/T2-w values. Oligodendrocyte gene markers were strongly correlated but this was not driven by myelin-associated genes, suggesting this signal is from non-myelinating satellite oligodendrocytes. We find the strongest support for the previous finding of high aerobic glycolysis in regions with low T1-w/T2-w ratio. Specifically, many mitochondrial genes were negatively correlated with T1-w/T2-w ratio. Genes up-regulated by pH in the brain were also highly correlated with the ratio, suggesting the pH gradient in mitochondria may explain the aerobic glycolysis association. Expression of protease subunit genes was also inversely associated with the ratio, in agreement with the protein mass correlation. While we corroborate associations with myelin and synaptic plasticity, differences in the T1-w/T2-w ratio appear to be more attributable to molecule size, satellite oligodendrocyte proportion, mitochondrial number, alkalinity, and axon caliber. Using disease-associated gene lists, we observed an enrichment of negative T1-w/T2-w ratio correlations with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated genes. Expanding our analysis to the whole brain results in strong positive T1-w/T2-w associations for immune system, inflammatory disease, and microglial genes. In contrast, neuron markers and synaptic plasticity genes are negatively enriched. Lastly, our results vary little when our analysis is performed on T1-w or inverted T2-w intensities alone, possibly because the noise reduction properties of the ratio are not needed for postmortem brain scans. These results provide a molecular characterization of MR contrast that will aid interpretation of future MR studies of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Multi-photon laser scanning microscopy provides a powerful tool for monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural circuit activity. It is, however, intrinsically a point scanning technique. Standard raster scanning enables imaging at subcellular resolution; however, acquisition rates are limited by the size of the field of view to be scanned. Recently developed scanning strategies such as Travelling Salesman Scanning (TSS) have been developed to maximize cellular sampling rate by scanning only regions of interest in the field of view corresponding to locations of interest such as somata. However, such strategies are not optimized for the mechanical properties of galvanometric scanners. We describe here the Adaptive Spiral Scanning (SSA) algorithm, which fits a set of near-circular trajectories to the cellular distribution to avoid inertial drifts of galvanometer position. We compare its performance to raster scanning and TSS in terms of cellular sampling frequency and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Using surrogate neuron spatial position data, we show that SSA acquisition rates are an order of magnitude higher than those for raster scanning and generally exceed those achieved by TSS for neural densities comparable with those found in the cortex. We show that this result also holds true for in vitro hippocampal mouse brain slices bath loaded with the synthetic calcium dye Cal-520 AM. The ability of TSS to \\\"park\\\" the laser on each neuron along the scanning trajectory, however, enables higher SNR than SSA when all targets are precisely scanned. Raster scanning has the highest SNR but at a substantial cost in number of cells scanned. To understand the impact of sampling rate and SNR on functional calcium imaging, we used the Cramer-Rao Bound on evoked calcium traces recorded simultaneously with electrophysiology traces to calculate the lower bound estimate of the spike timing occurrence. The results show that TSS and SSA achieve comparable accuracy in spike time estimates compared to raster scanning despite their lower SNR. SSA is an easily implementable way for standard multi-photon laser scanning systems to gain temporal precision in the detection of action potentials while scanning hundreds of active cells.",

    "abstract": "1Neural mass models are accepted as efficient modelling techniques to model empirical observations such as disturbed oscillations or neuronal synchronization. Neural mass models are based on the mean-field assumption, i.e. they capture the mean-activity of a neuronal population. However, it is unclear if neural mass models still describe the mean activity of a neuronal population when the underlying neural network topology is not homogenous. Here, we test whether the mean activity of a neuronal population can be described by neural mass models when there is neuronal loss and when the connections in the network become sparse. To this end, we derive two neural mass models from a conductance based leaky integrate-and-firing (LIF) model. We then compared the power spectral densities of the mean activity of a network of inhibitory and excitatory LIF neurons with that of neural mass models by computing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. Firstly, we found that when the number of neurons in a fully connected LIF-network is larger than 300, the neural mass model is a good description of the mean activity. Secondly, if the connection density in the LIF-network does not exceed a crtical value, this leads to desynchronization of neurons within the LIF-network and to failure of neural mass description. Therefore we conclude that neural mass models can be used for analysing empirical observations if the neuronal network of interest is large enough and when neurons in this system synchronize.",

    "abstract": "Bioelectronic Medicines that modulate the activity patterns on peripheral nerves have promise as a new way of treating diverse medical conditions from epilepsy to rheumatism. Progress in the field builds upon time consuming and expensive experiments in living organisms to evaluate spontaneous activity patterns, stimulation efficiency, and organ responses. To reduce experimentation load and allow for a faster, more detailed analysis of both recording from and stimulation of peripheral nerves, adaptable computational models incorporating insights won in experiments will be of great help. We present a peripheral nerve simulator that combines biophysical axon models and numerically solved and idealized extracellular space models in one environment. Two different scales of abstraction were merged. On the one hand we modeled the extracellular space in a finite element solver as a three dimensional resistive continuum governed by the electro-quasistatic approximation of the Maxwell equations. Potential distributions were precomputed for different media (homogeneous, nerve in saline, nerve in cuff). Axons, on the other hand, were modeled at a higher level of abstraction as one dimensional chains of compartments; each consisting of lumped linear elements and, for some, channels with non-linear dynamics. Unmyelinated fibres were based on the Hodgkin-Huxley model; for myelinated fibers, we instead adapted the model proposed by McIntyre et al. in 2002 to smaller diameters. To obtain realistic axon shapes, an iterative algorithm positioned fibers along the nerve with variable tortuosity, with tortuosity values fit to imaged trajectories. We validated our model with data from the stimulated rat vagus nerve. Simulation results predicted that tortuosity leads to differentiation in recorded signal shapes, with unmyelinated axons being the most affected. Tortuosity was further shown to increase the stimulation threshold. The model we developed can easily be adapted to different nerves, and may be of use for Bioelectronic Medicine research in the future.",

    "abstract": "Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection impacts fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. We infected a pregnant rhesus macaque with a Puerto Rican ZIKV isolate in the first trimester. The pregnancy was complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and fetal demise 49 days post infection (gestational day 95). Significant pathology at the maternal-fetal interface included acute chorioamnionitis, placental infarcts, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the myometrial radial arteries. ZIKV RNA was disseminated throughout the fetus tissues and maternal immune system at necropsy, as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR for viral RNA. Replicating ZIKV was identified in fetal tissues, maternal lymph node, and maternal spleen by fluorescent in situ hybridization for viral replication intermediates. Fetal ocular pathology included a choroidal coloboma, suspected anterior segment dysgenesis, and a dysplastic retina. This is the first report of ocular pathology and prolonged viral replication in both maternal and fetal tissues following congenital ZIKV infection in rhesus macaques. PPROM followed by fetal demise and severe pathology of the visual system have not been described in macaque congenital infection previously; further nonhuman primate studies are needed to determine if an increased risk for PPROM is associated with congenital Zika virus infection.\\n\\nAuthor summaryA ZIKV infection during pregnancy is associated with malformations in fetal development including, but not limited to, ocular and brain anomalies, such as microcephaly, and stillbirth. The development of an accurate pregnancy model to study the effects of ZIKV will provide insight into vertical transmission, ZIKV tissue distribution, and fetal injury and malformations. Non-human primates closely resemble human in terms of the reproductive system, immunity, placentation and pregnancy. Our study demonstrates that the rhesus macaque is a compelling model in which to study ZIKV during pregnancy due to similar outcomes between the human and rhesus macaque. These similarities include prolonged viremia, vertical transmission, adverse pregnancy outcomes and fetal pathology, including defects in the visual system.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting leads to different expression levels of maternally and paternally derived alleles. Over the last years, major progress has been made in identifying novel imprinted candidate genes in plants, owing to affordable next-generation sequencing technologies. However, reports on sequencing the transcriptome of hybrid F1 seed tissues strongly disagree about how many and which genes are imprinted. This raises questions about the relative impact of biological, environmental, technical, and analytic differences or biases. Here, we adopt a statistical approach, frequently used in RNA-seq data analysis, which properly models count overdispersion and considers replicate information of reciprocal crosses. We show that our statistical pipeline outperforms other methods in identifying imprinted genes in simulated and real data. Accordingly, reanalysis of genome-wide imprinting studies in Arabidopsis and maize shows that, at least for the Arabidopsis dataset, an increased agreement across datasets can be observed. For maize, however, consistent reanalysis did not yield in a larger overlap between the datasets. This suggests that the discrepancy across publications might be partially due to different analysis pipelines but that technical, biological, and environmental factors underlie much of the discrepancy between datasets. Finally, we show that the set of genes that can be characterized regarding allelic bias by all studies with minimal confidence is small (~8,000/27,416 genes for Arabidopsis and ~12,000/39,469 for maize). In conclusion, we propose to use biologically replicated reciprocal crosses, high sequence coverage, and a generalized linear model approach to identify differentially expressed alleles in developing seeds.",

However, patients most frequently present with large chromosomal deletions affecting several additional genes. We used human pluripotent stem cell technology and genome editing to further dissect molecular and cellular mechanisms. We found that loss of JIP2 (MAPK8IP2) may contribute to a distinct neurodevelopmental phenotype in neural progenitors (NPCs) affecting neuronal maturation. This is most likely due to simultaneous misregulation of JNK proteins, leading to impaired generation of mature neurons. Furthermore, semaphorin signaling is compromised in patient NPCs and neurons. Pharmacological stimulation of neuropilin receptor 1 (NRP1) rescued impaired semaphorin pathway activity and JNK expression in patient neurons. Our results suggest a novel disease-specific mechanism involving the JIP/JNK complex and identify NRP1 as potential therapeutic target.",

Caenorhabditis nematodes predominant rely on pheromone production for mate finding and mate choice. Here we describe a new microfluidic paradigm for studying mate choice in nematodes. Specifically, the Pheromone Arena allows for a constant flow of small molecule signals to be passed in real time from signaling worms to those making a choice without any physical contact. We validated this microfluidic paradigm by corroborating previous studies in showing that virgin C. remanei and C. elegans males have a strong preference for virgin females over mated ones. Moreover, our results suggest that the strength of attraction is an additive effect of male receptivity and female signal production. We go on to explicitly examine female choice and find that females are more attracted to virgin males. However, a females mate choice is strongly dependent on her mating status.",

The exosomes small size facilitates rapid migration through the extracellular matrix and into and out of circulation. Here we report that the mobility of the exosomes is much lower than would be expected from the size of their membrane vesicles. The difference is broadly distributed and caused by surface proteins, which significantly impede exosome migration. The observed wide range in the mobility implies that a subpopulation of hydrodynamically small exosomes is more likely to participate in signaling. The extracellular environment amplifies the size-dependent hindrance to the exosomes migration. The significant contribution of surface proteins to the transport resistance make the exosome mobility a dynamic property that changes with the extracellular environment which affects the membrane protein conformation, glycosylation, specific, and non-specific surface adsorption.",

We show that inhibition of external Globus Pallidus (GPe) and excitation of the Subthalamic nucleus (STN) using the delta-band stimulation leads to the same delta-beta interactions in the network model as the experimental results observed in healthy basal ganglia. In addition, we show that pathological beta oscillations in the network model decorrelates the delta-beta link in the network model.

To elucidate BrlA pathway involvement in SM regulation, we examined the transcriptional and metabolic profiles of {Delta}brlA, {Delta}abaA, {Delta}wetA and wild-type strains of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We find that BrlA, in addition to regulating production of developmental SMs, regulates vegetative SMs and the SrbA-regulated hypoxia stress response in a concordant fashion to LaeA. We further show that the transcriptional and metabolic equivalence of {Delta}brlA and {Delta}laeA is mediated by a LaeA requirement preventing heterochromatic marks in the brlA promoter.

    "abstract": "Reactivation of representations corresponding to recent experience is thought to be a critical mechanism supporting long-term memory stabilization. Targeted memory reactivation, or the re-exposure of recently learned cues, seeks to induce reactivation and has been shown to benefit later memory when it takes place during sleep. However, despite recent evidence for endogenous reactivation during post-encoding awake periods, less work has addressed whether awake targeted memory reactivation modulates memory. Here, we found that brief (50ms) visual stimulus re-exposure during a repetitive foil task enhanced the stability of cued versus uncued associations in memory. The extent of external or task-oriented attention prior to re-exposure was inversely related to cueing benefits, suggesting that an internally-orientated state may be most permissible to reactivation. Critically, cueing-related memory benefits were greatest in participants without explicit recognition of cued items and remained reliable when only considering associations not recognized as cued, suggesting that explicit cue-triggered retrieval processes did not drive cueing benefits. Cueing benefits were strongest for items and participants with the poorest initial learning. These findings expand our knowledge of the conditions under which targeted memory reactivation can benefit memory, and in doing so, support the notion that reactivation during awake time periods improves memory stabilization.",

Although hippocampal atrophy is often used as an in vivo measure of AD, data-driven neuroimaging has revealed complex patterns of regional brain vulnerability that may not perfectly map to anatomical boundaries. In addition to aiding diagnosis, decoding genetic influences on neuroimaging measures of the disease can enlighten molecular mechanisms of the underlying pathology in living patients and guide the therapeutic design.\\n\\nHere, we aimed to extract a data-driven MRI feature of brain atrophy in AD by decomposing structural neuroimages using independent component analysis (ICA), a method for performing unbiased computational search in high dimensional data spaces. Our study of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative dataset (n=1,100 subjects) revealed a disease-vulnerable feature with a network-like topology, comprising amygdala, hippocampus, fornix and the inter-connecting white-matter tracts of the limbic system. Whole-genome sequencing identified a nonsynonymous variant (rs34173062) in SHARPIN, a gene coding for a synaptic protein, as a significant modifier of this new MRI feature (p=2.1x10-10). The risk variant was brought to replication in the UK Biobank dataset (n=8,428 subjects), where it was associated with reduced cortical thickness in areas co-localizing with those of the discovery sample (left entorhinal cortex p=0.002, right entorhinal cortex p=8.6x10-4; same direction), as well as with the history of AD in both parents (p=2.3x10-6; same direction).\\n\\nIn conclusion, our study shows that ICA can transform voxel-wise volumetric measures of the brain into a data-driven feature of neurodegeneration in AD. Structure of the limbic system, as the most vulnerable focus of brain atrophy in AD, is affected by genetic variability of SHARPIN. The elevated risk of dementia in carriers of the minor allele supports engagement of SHARPIN in the disease pathways, and its role in neurotransmitter receptor scaffolding and integrin signaling may inform on new molecular mechanisms of AD pathophysiology.\\n\\nAbbreviationsAlzheimers disease (AD), genome-wide association study (GWAS), independent component analysis (ICA), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), medial temporal circuit (MTC), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), tensor-based morphometry (TBM)",

    "abstract": "Mnemonic decision-making has long been hypothesized to rely on hippocampal dynamics that bias memory processing toward the formation of new memories or the retrieval of old ones. Successful memory encoding would be best optimized by pattern separation, whereby two highly similar experiences can be represented by underlying neural populations in an orthogonal manner. By contrast, successful memory retrieval is thought to be supported by a recovery of the same neural pattern laid down during encoding. Here we examined how hippocampal pattern completion and separation emerge over time during memory decisions. We measured electrocorticography activity in the human hippocampus and posterior occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) while participants performed continuous recognition of items that were new, repeated (old), or highly similar to a prior item (similar).During retrieval decisions of old items, both regions exhibited significant reinstatement of multivariate high frequency activity (HFA) associated with encoding. Further, the extent of reinstatement of encoding patterns during retrieval was correlated both with the strength (HFA power) of hippocampal encoding and with the strength of hippocampal retrieval. Evidence for encoding pattern reinstatement was also seen in OTC on trials requiring fine-grained discrimination of similar items. By contrast, hippocampal activity showed evidence for pattern separation during these trials. Together, these results underscore the critical role of the hippocampus in supporting both reinstatement of overlapping information and separation of similar events.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne of the biggest computational challenges the memory systems faces is to disambiguate highly similar experiences while at the same time preserving and reinstating prior memories. Remarkably, hippocampal processes have been implicated in both of these functions. However, how this is accomplished is unknown. Leveraging the spatiotemporal resolution of electrocorticography, we found evidence for memory reinstatement in both the hippocampus and occipitotemporal cortex. Reinstatement was differentiated in time across these two regions with earlier reinstatement evident in occipitotemporal cortex. Interestingly, when a current experience was very similar, but not identical to a prior one, occipitotemporal cortical activity still showed reinstatement of the prior memory but hippocampal activity differentiated or disambiguated these two similar experiences.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer is a complex, multiscale dynamical system, with interactions between tumor cells and non-cancerous host systems. Therapies act on this combined cancer-host system, sometimes with unexpected results. Systematic investigation of mechanistic computational models can augment traditional laboratory and clinical studies, helping identify the factors driving a treatments success or failure. However, given the uncertainties regarding the underlying biology, these multiscale computational models can take many potential forms, in addition to encompassing high-dimensional parameter spaces. Therefore, the exploration of these models is computationally challenging. We propose that integrating two existing technologies--one to aid the construction of multiscale agent-based models, the other developed to enhance model exploration and optimization--can provide a computational means for high-throughput hypothesis testing, and eventually, optimization.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we introduce a high throughput computing (HTC) framework that integrates a mechanistic 3-D multicellular simulator (PhysiCell) with an extreme-scale model exploration platform (EMEWS) to investigate high-dimensional parameter spaces. We show early results in applying PhysiCell-EMEWS to 3-D cancer immunotherapy and show insights on therapeutic failure. We describe a generalized PhysiCell-EMEWS workflow for high-throughput cancer hypothesis testing, where hundreds or thousands of mechanistic simulations are compared against data-driven error metrics to perform hypothesis optimization.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile key notational and computational challenges remain, mechanistic agent-based models and high-throughput model exploration environments can be combined to systematically and rapidly explore key problems in cancer. These high-throughput computational experiments can improve our understanding of the underlying biology, drive future experiments, and ultimately inform clinical practice.",
