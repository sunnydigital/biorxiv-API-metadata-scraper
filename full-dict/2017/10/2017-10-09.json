    "abstract": "Temporally precise movement patterns underlie many motor skills and innate actions, yet the flexibility with which the timing of such stereotyped behaviors can be modified is poorly understood. To probe this, we induced adaptive changes to the temporal structure of birdsong. We find that the duration of specific song segments can be modified without affecting the timing in other parts of the song. We derive formal prescriptions for how neural networks can implement such flexible motor timing. We find that randomly connected recurrent networks, a common approximation for how neocortex is wired, do not generally conform to these, though certain implementations can approximate them. We show that feedforward networks, by virtue of their one-to-one mapping between network activity and time, are better suited. Our study provides general prescriptions for pattern generator networks that implement flexible motor timing, an important aspect of many motor skills, including birdsong and human speech.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe adoption of new bioinformatics webservers provides biological researchers with new analytical opportunities but also raises workflow challenges. These challenges include sharing collections of genes with collaborators, translating gene identifiers to the most appropriate nomenclature for each server, tracking these collections across multiple analysis tools and webservers, and maintaining effective records of the genes used in each analysis.\\n\\nDescriptionIn this paper, we present the Tribe webserver (available at https://tribe.greenelab.com), which addresses these challenges in order to make multi-server workflows seamless and reproducible. This allows users to create analysis pipelines that use their own sets of genes in combinations of specialized data mining webservers and tools while seamlessly maintaining gene set version control. Tribes web interface facilitates collaborative editing: users can share with collaborators, who can then view, download, and edit these collections. Tribes fully-featured API allows users to interact with Tribe programmatically if desired. Tribe implements the OAuth 2.0 standard as well as gene identifier mapping, which facilitates its integration into existing servers. Access to Tribes resources is facilitated by an easy-to-install Python application called tribe-client. We provide Tribe and tribe-client under a permissive open-source license to encourage others to download the source code and set up a local instance or to extend its capabilities.\\n\\nConclusionsThe Tribe webserver addresses challenges that have made reproducible multi-webserver workflows difficult to implement until now. It is open source, has a user-friendly web interface, and provides a means for researchers to perform reproducible gene set based analyses seamlessly across webservers and command line tools.",

    "abstract": "Social rituals, like male-male aggression in Drosophila, are often stereotyped and the component behavioral patterns modular. The likelihood of transition from one behavioral pattern to another is malleable by experience and confers flexibility to the behavioral repertoire. Experience-dependent modification of innate aggressive behavior in flies alters fighting strategies during fights and establishes dominant-subordinate relationships. Dominance hierarchies resulting from agonistic encounters are consolidated to longer lasting social status-dependent behavioral modifications resulting in a robust loser effect.\\n\\nWe show that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dynamics regulated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, Rut and the cAMP phosphodiesterase, Dnc but not the Amn gene product, in specific neuronal groups of the mushroom body and central complex, mediate behavioral plasticity necessary to establish dominant- subordinate relationships. rut and dnc mutant flies are unable to alter fighting strategies and establish dominance relationships during agonistic interactions. This real-time flexibility during a fight is independent of changes in aggression levels. Longer-term consolidation of social status in the form of a loser effect, however, requires additional Amn-dependent inputs to cAMP signaling and involves a circuit-level association between the /{beta} and {gamma} neurons of the mushroom body.\\n\\nOur findings implicate cAMP signaling in mediating plasticity of behavioral patterns in aggressive behavior and in the generation of a temporally stable memory trace that manifests as a loser effect.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTPhasic recruitment of different cAMP signaling modalities in specific neuronal groups lead to the formation of temporally distinct components of learning and memory in fly aggression.",

    "abstract": "Accurate annotations of genes and their transcripts is a foundation of genomics, but no annotation technique presently combines throughput and accuracy. As a result, reference gene collections remain incomplete: many gene models are fragmentary, while thousands more remain uncatalogued-particularly for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To accelerate lncRNA annotation, the GENCODE consortium has developed RNA Capture Long Seq (CLS), combining targeted RNA capture with third-generation long-read sequencing. We present an experimental re-annotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA population in matched human and mouse tissues, resulting in novel transcript models for 3574 / 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubles the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enable us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter- and gene-structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus CLS removes a longstanding bottleneck of transcriptome annotation, generating manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "How are perceptual decisions made? The answer to this seemingly simple question necessitates that we specify the nature of perceptual representations on which decisions are based. Recent work has taken for granted that the representation at the decision stage consists of a full probability distribution over all possible stimuli. However, to date, no empirical evidence has supported this assumption. Here I present five possible perceptual representation schemes that allow the extraction of different levels of sensory uncertainty. I review the empirical evidence from both continuous and discrete judgments and show that, at present, only the most primitive scheme based on a single point estimate can be rejected. In other words, at least four different representational schemes are consistent with the available data and therefore full probability distributions cannot be assumed. There is an urgent need for empirical research to adjudicate between these theoretical possibilities.",

    "abstract": "The influenza A virus genome consists of eight segments of single-stranded RNA. These segments are replicated and transcribed by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is made up of the influenza virus proteins PB1, PB2 and PA. To copy the viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments and the complementary RNA (cRNA) segments, the replicative intermediate of viral replication, the RdRp must use two promoters and two different de novo initiation mechanisms. On the vRNA promoter, the RdRp initiates on the 3 terminus, while on the cRNA promoter the RdRp initiates internally and subsequently realigns the nascent vRNA product to ensure that the template is copied in full. In particular the latter process, which is also used by other RNA viruses, is not understood. Here we provide mechanistic insight into prime-realignment during influenza virus replication and show that it is controlled by the priming loop and a helix-loop-helix motif of the PB1 subunit of the RdRp. Overall, these observations advance our understanding of how the influenza A virus initiates viral replication and amplifies the genome correctly.\\n\\nImportanceInfluenza A viruses cause severe disease in humans and are considered a major threat to our economy and health. The viruses replicate and transcribe their genome using an enzyme called the RNA polymerases. To ensure that the genome is amplified faithfully and abundant viral mRNAs are made for viral protein synthesis, the RNA polymerase must work correctly. In this report, we provide insight into the mechanism that the RNA polymerase employs to ensure that the viral genome is copied correctly.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNumerous centrality measures have been introduced to identify \\\"central\\\" nodes in large networks. The availability of a wide range of measures for ranking influential nodes leaves the user to decide which measure may best suit the analysis of a given network. The choice of a suitable measure is furthermore complicated by the impact of the network topology on ranking influential nodes by centrality measures. To approach this problem systematically, we examined the centrality profile of nodes of yeast protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) in order to detect which centrality measure is succeeding in predicting influential proteins. We studied how different topological network features are reflected in a large set of commonly used centrality measures.\\n\\nResultsWe used yeast PPINs to compare 27 common of centrality measures. The measures characterize and assort influential nodes of the networks. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering and found that the most informative measures depend on the networks topology. Interestingly, some measures had a high level of contribution in comparison to others in all PPINs, namely Latora closeness, Decay, Lin, Freeman closeness, Diffusion, Residual closeness and Average distance centralities.\\n\\nConclusionsThe choice of a suitable set of centrality measures is crucial for inferring important functional properties of a network. We concluded that undertaking data reduction using unsupervised machine learning methods helps to choose appropriate variables (centrality measures). Hence, we proposed identifying the contribution proportions of the centrality measures with PCA as a prerequisite step of network analysis before inferring functional consequences, e.g., essentiality of a node.",

The COG/NCI TARGET AML initiative assessed cases by whole-genome, targeted DNA, mRNA, miRNA sequencing and CpG methylation profiling. Validated DNA variants revealed diverse, infrequent mutations with fewer than 40 genes mutated in >2% of cases. In contrast, somatic structural variants, including novel gene fusions and focal MBNL1, ZEB2, and ELF1 deletions, were disproportionately prevalent in young as compared to adult patients. Conversely, DNMT3A and TP53 mutations, common in adults, are conspicuously absent from virtually all pediatric cases. Novel GATA2, FLT3, and CBL mutations, recurrent MYC-ITD, NRAS, KRAS, and WT1 mutations are frequent in pediatric AML. Deletions, mutations, and promoter DNA hypermethylation convergently impact Wnt signaling, Polycomb repression, innate immune cell interactions, and a cluster of zinc finger genes associated with KMT2A rearrangements. These results highlight the need for, and facilitate the development of age-tailored targeted therapies for the treatment of pediatric AML.",

Specifically, females rarely have the option of mating with all males in a population--they can only choose among the males they encounter. Further, quantifying phenotypic differences between the males that females encounter and those that sire females offspring lends insight into how social and reproductive interactions shape male phenotypes. We used an explicitly spatiotemporal Markov chain model to estimate the number of potential mates of Anolis sagrei lizards from their movement behavior, and used genetic paternity assignments to quantify sexual selection on males. Females frequently encountered and mated with multiple males, offering ample opportunity for female mate choice. Sexual selection favored males that were bigger and moved over larger areas, though the effect of body size cannot be disentangled from last-male precedence. Our approach corroborates some patterns of sexual selection previously hypothesized in anoles based on describing them as territorial, whereas other results, including female multiple mating itself, are at odds with territorial polygyny, offering insight into discrepancies in other taxa between behavioral and genetic descriptions of mating systems.",

Serum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (nagalase), a marker of inflammation and cancer cell proliferation, was significantly decreased at the end of a three-month observation. These results are consistent with immune modulating properties of certain probiotics based on the fermentation of milk and colostrum. Urinary excretion of non-metal toxicants that accumulate in adipose tissue such as Perchlorate, N-acetyl(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine (NAHP), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), N-acetyl phenyl cysteine (NAP), Phenylglycoxylic acid (PGO), Monoethylphthalate (MEP) and 2-Hydroxyisobutyric Acid (2HIB) was significantly increased. These results are consistent with the weight loss (5 Kg) associated with intermittent fasting and with the known features of probiotics as detoxification tools. Consistent with certain toxicants acting as endocrine disruptors, we observed an increased elimination of toxicants and a 33% decrease of serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), suggesting a trend toward normalization of thyroid function. These results support the hypothesis that a combination of intermittent fasting with the consumption of specific probiotic yogurts may lead to immune modulation, detoxification and other improvements.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

The IBM explicitly accounts for crowding effects by modifying the rate of movement, direction of movement, and the rate of proliferation by accounting for pair-wise interactions. Taking a Bayesian approach we estimate the free parameters in the IBM using rejection sampling on three separate, independent experimental data sets. Since the posterior distributions for each experiment are similar, we perform simulations with parameters sampled from a new posterior distribution generated by combining the three data sets. To explore the predictive power of the calibrated IBM, we forecast the evolution of a fourth experimental data set. Overall, we show how to calibrate a lattice-free IBM to experimental data, and our work highlights the importance of interactions between individuals. Despite great care taken to distribute cells as uniformly as possible experimentally, we find evidence of significant spatial clustering over short distances, suggesting that standard mean-field models could be inappropriate.",

Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to FAIR guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework (https://osf.io/zm97b/) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability.

Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses.

    "abstract": "The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with marked alterations in circulating immune cell populations, but no studies have characterized alterations in these cell types across the full spectrum of lung function impairment in current and former smokers. In 6,299 subjects from the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, we related Coulter blood counts and proportions to cross-sectional FEV1 adjusting for current smoking status. We also related cell count measures to three-year change in FEV1 in ECLIPSE subjects. In a subset of subjects with blood gene expression data, we used cell type deconvolution methods to infer the proportions of immune cell subpopulations, and we related these to COPD clinical status. We observed that FEV1 levels are positively correlated with lymphocytes and negatively correlated with myeloid populations such as neutrophils and monocytes. In multivariate models, absolute cell counts and proportions were associated with cross-sectional FEV1, and lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophil counts were predictive of three-year change in lung function. Using cell type deconvolution to study immune cell subpopulations, we observed that subjects with COPD had a lower proportion of CD4+ resting memory cells and naive B cells compared to non-COPD smokers. Alterations in circulating immune cells in COPD support a mixed pattern of lymphocyte suppression and an enhanced myeloid cell immune response. Cell counts and proportions contribute independent information to models predicting lung function suggesting a critical role for immune response in long-term COPD outcomes. Cell type deconvolution is a promising method for immunophenotyping in large cohorts.",

Results of recent large-scale studies suggest that many of these hormone-linked behavioral changes are less robust than was previously thought. One hypothesis that has not yet been subject to a large-scale test is the proposal that womens preference for associating with male kin is down-regulated during the ovulatory (high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle. Consequently, we used a longitudinal design to investigate the relationship between changes in womens steroid hormone levels and their perceptions of faces experimentally manipulated to possess kinship cues. Analyses suggested that women viewed mens faces displaying kinship cues more positively (i.e., more attractive and trustworthy) when estradiol-to-progesterone ratio was high. Since estradiol-to-progesterone ratio is positively associated with conception risk during the menstrual cycle, these results directly contradict the hypothesis that womens preference for associating with male kin is down-regulated during the ovulatory (high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle.

    "abstract": "The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the influenza A virus replicates and transcribes the viral genome segments in the nucleus of the host cell. To transcribe these viral genome segments, the RdRp  snatches capped RNA oligonucleotides from nascent host cell mRNAs and aligns these primers to the ultimate or penultimate nucleotide of the segments for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. It has been proposed that this initiation process is not processive and that the RdRp uses a prime-realign mechanism during transcription. Here we provide in vitro evidence for the existence of this transcriptional prime-realign mechanism, but show that it only functions efficiently for primers that are short or can not stably base pair with the template. In addition, we demonstrate that transcriptional elongation is dependent on the priming loop of the PB1 subunit of the RdRp. We propose that the prime-realign mechanism may be used to rescue abortive transcription initiation events or cope with sequence variation among primers. Overall, these observations advance our mechanistic understanding of how the influenza A virus initiates transcription correctly and efficiently.\\n\\nImportanceThe influenza A virus causes severe disease in humans and is considered a major global health threat. The virus replicates and transcribes its genome using an enzyme called the RNA polymerase. To ensure that the genome is amplified faithfully and abundant viral mRNAs are made for viral protein synthesis, the viral RNA polymerase must transcribe the viral genome efficiently. In this report, we characterise a structure inside the polymerase that contributes to the efficiency of viral mRNA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Calcium ion concentration modulates the function of pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Previous studies have shown that despite its ability to affect the function of these dehydrogenases, [Ca2+] does not substantially alter mitochondrial ATP synthesis in vitro under physiological sub-strate conditions. We hypothesize that, rather than contributing to respiratory control, [Ca2+] governs fuel selection. Specifically, cardiac mitochondria are able to use different primary carbon substrates to synthesize ATP aerobically. To determine if and how [Ca2+] affects the relative use of carbohydrates versus fatty acids we measured oxygen consumption and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate concentrations in suspensions of cardiac mitochondria with different combinations of pyruvate and palmitoyl-L-carnitine in the media at various [Ca2+] and ADP infusion rates. Results reveal that when both fatty acid and carbohydrate substrates are available, fuel selection is sensitive to both calcium and ATP synthesis rate. When no Ca2+ is added under low ATP-demand conditions, {beta}-oxidation provides roughly half of acetyl-CoA for the citrate synthase reaction with the rest coming from the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. Under low demand conditions with increasing [Ca2+], the fuel utilization ratio shifts to increased fractional consumption of pyruvate, with 83{+/-}10% of acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate at the highest [Ca2+] evaluated. With high ATP demand, the majority of acetyl-CoA is derived from pyruvate, regardless of the Ca2+ level. Our results suggest that changes in work rate alone are enough to effect a switch to carbohydrate use while in vivo the rate at which this switch happens may depend on mitochondrial calcium.\\n\\nKey PointsO_LIDespite its effects on activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, Ca2+ does not substantially alter mitochondrial ATP synthesis in vitro under physiological substrate conditions.

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics is a versatile tool for exploring heterogeneous cell populations. As with all genomics experiments, batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The success of batch effect correction is often evaluated by visual inspection of dimension-reduced representations such as principal component analysis. This is inherently imprecise due to the high number of genes and non-normal distribution of gene expression. Here, we present a k-nearest neighbour batch effect test (kBET, https://github.com/theislab/kBET) to quantitatively measure batch effects. kBET is easier to interpret, more sensitive and more robust than visual evaluation and other measures of batch effects. We use kBET to assess commonly used batch regression and normalisation approaches, and quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. Our results illustrate that batch correction based on log-transformation or scran pooling followed by ComBat reduced the batch effect while preserving structure across data sets. Finally we show that kBET can pinpoint successful data integration methods across multiple data sets, in this case from different publications all charting mouse embryonic development. This has important implications for future data integration efforts, which will be central to projects such as the Human Cell Atlas where data for the same tissue may be generated in multiple locations around the world.\\n\\n[Before final publication, we will upload the R package to Bioconductor]",

Importantly, patients with only allocentric neglect did not demonstrate any egocentric spatial bias in the locations of the allocentric errors. Left-sided egocentric neglect was more prevalent and more severe than right-sided egocentric neglect, though right-sided neglect was still highly prevalent in the acute stroke sample (35%). Leftsided allocentric neglect was more severe but not more prevalent than right-sided allocentric neglect.

While nucleation has been the major focus of study for new microtubule generation, severing has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to create new polymers, a mechanism recently shown to drive the reorientation of cortical arrays of higher plants in response to blue light perception. As severing produces new plus ends behind the stabilizing GTP-cap, an important and unanswered question is how these are stabilized in vivo to promote net microtubule generation. Here we identify the conserved protein CLASP as a potent stabilizer of new plus ends created by katanin severing and find that CLASP is required for rapid cortical array reorientation. In clasp mutants both rescue of shrinking plus ends and the regrowth of plus ends immediately after severing are reduced, computational modeling reveals that it is the specific stabilization of severed ends that explains CLASPs function in promoting microtubule amplification by severing and cortical array reorientation.",

This is accompanied by an increase in Rab5-positive endosomes in contact with mitochondria. Interestingly, activation of Rab5 on mitochondria depend on the Rab5-GEF ALS2/Alsin, which is encoded by a gene mutated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Alsin-/- human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived spinal motor neurons cannot relocate Rab5 to mitochondria and display increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. These findings define a novel pathway whereby Alsin catalyzes assembly of the Rab5 endocytic machinery on mitochondria.

    "abstract": "Genomic datasets are often associated with sensitive phenotypes. Therefore, the leak of membership information is a major privacy risk. Genomic beacons aim to provide a secure, easy to implement, and standardized interface for data sharing by only allowing yes/no queries on the presence of specific alleles in the dataset. Previously deemed secure against re-identification attacks, beacons were shown to be vulnerable despite their stringent policy. Recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to determine whether the victim is in the dataset, by repeatedly querying the beacon for his/her single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this work, we propose a novel re-identification attack and show that the privacy risk is more serious than previously thought. Using the proposed attack, even if the victim systematically hides informative SNPs (i.e., SNPs with very low minor allele frequency -MAF-), it is possible to infer the alleles at positions of interest as well as the beacon query results with very high confidence. Our method is based on the fact that alleles at different loci are not necessarily independent. We use the linkage disequilibrium and a high-order Markov chain-based algorithm for the inference. We show that in a simulated beacon with 65 individuals from the CEU population, we can infer membership of individuals with 95% confidence with only 5 queries, even when SNPs with MAF less than 0.05 are hidden. This means, we need less than 0.5% of the number of queries that existing works require, to determine beacon membership under the same conditions. We further show that countermeasures such as hiding certain parts of the genome or setting a query budget for the user would fail to protect the privacy of the participants under our adversary model.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression evolution through gene regulatory network (GRN) changes has gained appreciation as a driver of morphological evolution. However, understanding how GRNs evolve is hampered by finding relevant cis-regulatory element (CRE) mutations, and interpreting the protein-DNA interactions they alter. We investigated evolutionary changes in the duplicated Bric-a-brac (Bab) transcription factors and a key Bab target gene in a GRN underlying the novel dimorphic pigmentation of D. melanogaster and its relatives. It has remained uncertain how Bab was integrated within the pigmentation GRN. Here we show that Bab gained a role in sculpting sex-specific pigmentation through the evolution of binding sites in a CRE of the pigment-promoting yellow gene and without any noteworthy changes to Bab protein coding sequences. This work demonstrates how a new trait can evolve by incorporating existing transcription factors into a GRN through CRE evolution, an evolutionary path likely to predominate newly evolved functions of transcription factors.",

Eucalyptus melliodora is a foundation species of a critically endangered community in Australia that is a target for restoration. We examined patterns of genomic and phenotypic variation to make empirical based recommendations for seed sourcing. We examined isolation by distance and isolation by environment, determining gene flow up to 500 km and associations with environmental variables. Climate chamber studies revealed extensive phenotypic variation both within and among sampling sites, but no site-specific differentiation in phenotypic plasticity. Overall our results suggest that seed can be sourced broadly across the landscape, providing ample diversity for adaptation to environmental change. Application of our landscape genomic model to E. melliodora restoration projects can identify genomic variation suitable for predicted future climates, thereby increasing the long term probability of successful restoration.",

Almost nothing is known about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. Here, we reveal that RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain. Using CLIP-seq and SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, we uncover TRIM25s endogenous RNA targets and protein binding partners. Finally, we show that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is important for its ubiquitin ligase function. These results reveal new insights into the molecular roles and characteristics of RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases and demonstrate that RNA could be an essential factor for their biological functions.",

Given its critical role, dynamical changes in SAM activity should play a central role in the adaptation of plant architecture to the environment2. Using quantitative microscopy, grafting experiments and genetic perturbations, we connect the plant environment to the SAM, by describing the molecular mechanism by which cytokinins signal the level of nutrient availability to the SAM. We show that a systemic signal of cytokinin precursors3 mediates the adaptation of SAM size and organogenesis rate to the availability of mineral nutrients by modulating the expression of WUSCHEL, a key regulator of stem cell homeostasis4. In time-lapse experiments, we further show that this mechanism allows meristems to adapt to rapid changes in nitrate concentration, and thereby modulate their rate of organ production to the availability of mineral nutrients within a few days. Our work sheds new light on the role of the stem cell regulatory network, by showing that it does not only maintain meristem homeostasis but also allows plants to adapt to rapid changes in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Activation of telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) is a crucial factor for indefinite proliferation of cancer cells. The most common TMM is based on the action of telomerase, but in some cancers telomeres are elongated via homologous recombination based alternative mechanism (ALT). Despite their importance, little is known about TMM regulation and factors responsible for TMM phenotype choice in different cells. Currently, many studies address the involvement of few genes in TMMs, but a consensus unified picture of the full process is missing.\\n\\nWe have developed a computational biology framework combining knowledge- and data-driven approaches to aid in understanding of TMMs. It is based on a greedy algorithm with three core modules: (1) knowledge-based construction/modification of molecular pathways for telomerase-dependent and alternative TMMs, (2) coupled with gene expression data-based validation with an in-house pathway signal flow (PSF) algorithm, and (3) iteration of these two coupled steps until converging at pathway topologies that best reflect state of the art knowledge and are in maximum accordance with the data. We have used gene expression data derived from cell lines and tumor tissues and have performed extensive literature search and multiple cycles of greedy iterations until reaching TMM assessment accuracy of 100% and 77%, respectively.\\n\\nAvailability of TMM pathways that best reflect recent knowledge and data will facilitate better understanding of TMM processes. As novel experimental findings in TMM biology emerge, and new datasets are generated, our approach may be used to further expand/improve the pathways, possibly allowing for making distinctions not only between telomerase-dependent and ALT TMMs, but also among their different subtypes. Moreover, this method may be used for assessment of TMM phenotypes from gene expression data, which is crucial for studies where experimental detection of TMM states is missing. Furthermore, it can also be used to assess TMM activities in proliferating healthy cells.",

RALIS generated an output, with score >5 triggering an alert. Patient episodes were classified based on culture, radiograph, and antibiotic data into categories: LOS, expanded LOS, NEC, and controls. Paired t-tests, linear regression and cross-validation analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between RALIS alert and LOS/NEC.\\n\\nResultsAmong 155 infants with 161 episodes, there were 41 expanded LOS (+ blood, CSF, urine, respiratory culture), 31 LOS (+ blood, CSF, urine), 9 NEC, and 93 controls. RALIS alert was 43.1+/-79 hours before culture in LOS (p=0.012). There was a significant association between RALIS alert and LOS/NEC ({beta}=0.72, p<0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity for LOS/NEC were 84% and 80%, (PPV=63%; NPV=93%). The regression model demonstrated an AUC of 89.9%.\\n\\nConclusionsFor infants <32 weeks, RALIS detects systemic inflammatory responses in LOS and NEC in the first month of life. The algorithm identifies infection earlier than clinical suspicion, even for NEC with negative cultures. RALIS has high NPV to rule-out LOS and NEC, and may, after prospective validation, aid in antibiotic treatment decisions.",

    "abstract": "The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are primordial enzymes essential for interpretation and transfer of genetic information. Understanding the origin of the peculiarities observed with aaRS can explain what constituted the earliest life forms and how the genetic code was established. The increasing amount of experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of aaRS opens up new avenues for high-throughput analyses of molecular mechanisms. In this study, we present an exhaustive structural analysis of ATP binding motifs. We unveil an oppositional implementation of enzyme substrate binding in each aaRS Class. While Class I binds via interactions mediated by backbone hydrogen bonds, Class II uses a pair of arginine residues to establish salt bridges to its ATP ligand. We show how nature realized the binding of the same ligand species with completely different mechanisms. In addition, we demonstrate that sequence or even structure analysis for conserved residues may miss important functional aspects which can only be revealed by ligand interaction studies. Additionally, the placement of those key residues in the structure supports a popular hypothesis, which states that prototypic aaRS were once coded on complementary strands of the same gene.",

We developed a new method, MIRA, to perform the first comprehensive study of significantly mutated regions (SMRs) affecting binding sites for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in cancer. Extracting signals related to RNA-related selection processes and using RNA sequencing data from the same samples we identified alterations in RNA expression and splicing linked to mutations on RBP binding sites. We found SRSF10 and MBNL1 motifs in introns, HNRPLL motifs at 5 UTRs, as well as 5 and 3 splice-site motifs, among others, with specific mutational patterns that disrupt the motif and impact RNA processing. MIRA facilitates the integrative analysis of multiple genome sites that operate collectively through common RBPs and can aid in the interpretation of non-coding variants in cancer.

Here, we show that the distance-decay relationship, an important measure of beta-diversity, follows a universal form which we call the piecewise quadratic model. To derive the piecewise quadratic model, we develop a new conceptual framework which is based on geometric probability and several key insights about the roles of study design (e.g., plot dimensions and spatial distributions). We fit the piecewise quadratic model to six empirical distance-decay relationships, spanning a range of taxa and spatial scales, including surveys of tropical vegetation, mammals, and amphibians. We find that the model predicts the functional form of the relationships extremely well, with coefficients of determination in excess of 0.95. Moreover, the model predicts a phase transition at distance scales where sample plots are overlapping, which we confirm empirically. Our framework and model provide a fundamental, quantitative link between distance-decay relationships and the shapes of ranges of taxa.",

Acclimatisation results in gradual increase in resistance to bioacoustics in comparison to distress feeding, which makes sudden surge in instances of feeding by depredatory birds. Acclimatisation and distress feeding are independent functions of feeding behaviour. Distress feeding in itself is a function of physiological conditions of bird, extent of cropped area, distance traveled to obtain food, population dynamics, other natural habitats and cropping pattern in an area and is greatly influenced by them. There are no studies conducted to understand the distress feeding of birds in agricultural landscape.

These authors proposed an extension of a Gaussian Process (GP) nonparametric inferential method for the intensity function of non-homogeneous Poisson processes. They found that not only the statistical properties of the estimators were improved with their method, but also, that key aspects of the demographic histories were recovered. The authors work represents the first Bayesian nonparametric solution to this inferential problem because they specify a convenient prior belief without a particular functional form on the population trajectory. Their approach works so well and provides such a profound understanding of the biological process, that the question arises as to how truly \\\"biology-free\\\" their approach really is. Using well-known concepts of stochastic population dynamics, here I demonstrate that in fact, Palacios and Minins GP model can be cast as a parametric population growth model with density dependence and environmental stochasticity. Making this link between population genetics and stochastic population dynamics modeling provides novel insights into eliciting biologically meaningful priors for the trajectory of the effective population size. The results presented here also bring novel understanding of GP as models for the evolution of a trait. Thus, the ecological principles foundation of Palacios and Minin [1]s prior adds to the conceptual and scientific value of these authorsinferential approach.

    "abstract": "We used the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) to investigate the relationships between cognitive behavior, coordinated neural network function and information processing within the hippocampus place cell system. We report in rats that PCP (5mg/kg i.p.) impairs a well-learned hippocampus-dependent place avoidance behavior in rats that requires cognitive control, even when PCP is injected directly into dorsal hippocampus. PCP increases 60-100 Hz medium gamma oscillations in hippocampus CA1 and these increases correlate with the cognitive impairment caused by systemic PCP administration. PCP discoordinates theta-modulated medium and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 local field potentials (LFP) such that medium gamma oscillations become more theta-organized than slow gamma oscillations. CA1 place cell firing fields are preserved under PCP but the drug discoordinates the sub-second temporal organization of discharge amongst place cells. This discoordination causes place cell ensemble representations of a familiar space to cease resembling pre-PCP representations, despite preserved place fields. These findings point to the cognitive impairments caused by PCP arising from neural discoordination. PCP disrupts the timing of discharge with respect to the sub-second timescales of theta and gamma oscillations in the LFP. Because these oscillations arise from local inhibitory synaptic activity, these findings point to excitation-inhibition discoordination as the root of PCP-induced cognitive impairment.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHippocampal neural discharge is temporally coordinated on timescales of theta and gamma oscillations in the local field potential, and the discharge of a subset of pyramidal neurons called \\\"place cells\\\" is spatially organized such that discharge is restricted to locations called a cells \\\"place field.\\\" Because this temporal coordination and spatial discharge organization is thought to represent spatial knowledge, we used the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) to disrupt cognitive behavior and assess the importance of neural coordination and place fields for spatial cognition. PCP impaired the judicious use of spatial information and discoordinated hippocampal discharge, without disrupting firing fields. These findings dissociate place fields from spatial cognitive behavior and suggest that hippocampus discharge coordination is crucial to spatial cognition.",

    "abstract": "It has recently been shown that large-scale propagation of blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity is constrained by anatomical connections and reflects transitions between behavioral states. It remains to be seen, however, if the propagation of BOLD activity can also relate to the brain anatomical structure at a more local scale. Here, we hypothesized that BOLD propagation reflects structured neuronal activity across early visual field maps. To explore this hypothesis, we characterize the propagation of BOLD activity across V1, V2 and V3 using a modeling approach that aims to disentangle the contributions of local activity and directed interactions in shaping BOLD propagation. It does so by estimating the effective connectivity (EC) and the excitability of a noise-diffusion network to reproduce the spatiotemporal covariance structure of the data. We apply our approach to 7T fMRI recordings acquired during resting state (RS) and visual field mapping (VFM). Our results reveal different EC interactions and changes in cortical excitability in RS and VFM, and point to a reconfiguration of feedforward and feedback interactions across the visual system. We conclude that the propagation of BOLD activity has functional relevance, as it reveals directed interactions and changes in cortical excitability in a task-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDuring online speech processing, our brain tracks the acoustic fluctuations in speech at different time-scales. Previous research has focussed on generic time-scales (for example, delta or theta bands) that are assumed to map onto linguistic features such as prosody or syllables. However, given the high inter-subject variability in speaking patterns, such a generic association between the time-scales of brain activity and speech properties can be ambiguous. Here, we analyse speech tracking in source-localised magnetoencephalographic data by directly focusing on time-scales extracted from statistical regularities in the speech material. This revealed widespread tracking at the time-scales of phrases (0.6 - 1.3 Hz), words (1.8 - 3 Hz), syllables (2.8 - 4.8 Hz), and phonemes (8 - 12.4 Hz). Importantly, when examining the relevance for single-trial comprehension, we found stronger tracking for correctly comprehended trials in the left premotor cortex at the phrasal scale, and in left middle temporal cortex at the word scale. Control analyses using generic bands confirmed that these effects were specific to the stimulus-tailored speech regularities. Furthermore, we found that the phase at the phrasal time-scale coupled to beta-power in motor areas. This cross-frequency coupling likely mediates the comprehension effect in the motor system, and implies top-down temporal prediction in speech perception. Together, our results reveal specific functional and perceptually relevant roles of distinct entrainment processes along the auditory-motor pathway. These processes act concurrently at time-scales within the traditional delta band and highlight the role of neural tracking mechanisms that reflect the temporal characteristics of speech.",

While recording animal behavior has become easier than ever with the development of compact and inexpensive devices, detailed behavioral data analysis requires sufficient previous knowledge and/or high content data such as video images of animal postures, which makes it difficult for most of the animal behavioral data to be efficiently analyzed to understand brain function. Here, we report a versatile method using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning approach to efficiently estimate behavioral states and to extract important behavioral features only from low-content animal trajectory data. As proof of principle experiments, we analyzed trajectory data of worms, fruit flies, rats, and bats in the laboratories, and penguins and flying seabirds in the wild, which were recorded with various methods and span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales--from mm to 1000 km in space and from sub-seconds to days in time. We estimated several states during behavior and comprehensively extracted characteristic features from a behavioral state and/or a specific experimental condition. Physiological and genetic experiments in worms revealed that the extracted behavioral features reflected specific neural or gene activities. Thus, our method provides a versatile and unbiased way to extract behavioral features from simple trajectory data to understand brain function.",

    "abstract": "Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a therapy for epilepsy and depression. However, its efficacy varies and its mechanism remains unclear. Prior studies have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activations with VNS in human brains, but have reported inconsistent findings. The source of inconsistency is likely attributable to the complex temporal characteristics of VNS-evoked fMRI responses that cannot be fully explained by simplified response models in the conventional model-based analysis for activation mapping. To address this issue, we acquired 7-Tesla blood oxygenation level dependent fMRI data from anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats receiving electrical stimulation at the left cervical vagus nerve. Using spatially independent component analysis, we identified 20 functional brain networks and detected the network-wise activations with VNS in a data-driven manner. Our results showed that VNS activated 15 out of 20 brain networks, and the activated regions covered >76% of the brain volume. The time course of the evoked response was complex and distinct across regions and networks. In addition, VNS altered the strengths and patterns of correlations among brain networks relative to those in the resting state. The most notable changes in network-network interactions were related to the limbic system. Together, such profound and widespread effects of VNS may underlie its unique potential for a wide range of therapeutics to relieve central or peripheral conditions.",

Some preclinical evidence suggests that sex and sex hormone-dependent prenatal brain organization may interact with the opioid system to influence alcohol drinking behavior. We genotyped 200 alcohol-dependent patients and 240 healthy individuals for the A118G variant and measured serum {beta}-endorphin level at recruitment and during acute withdrawal. We then evaluated the association between these factors and alcohol dependence risk and outcome in the context of both sex and second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D) - a biomarker of prenatal sex hormone load. For the first time, the AA genotype was found to be associated with elevated alcohol-related hospital readmission risk, more readmissions, and fewer days until first readmission in male but not female patients. Upon accounting for 2D:4D, the G-allele predicted alcohol dependence and more readmissions (1 vs [&ge;]2) in males, suggesting prenatal sex hormones interact with OPRM1 to influence addiction pathology. Withdrawal {beta}-endorphin level also correlated negatively with withdrawal severity in females but not in males, indicating {beta}-endorphin might protect against withdrawal-induced stress in a sex-specific manner. Organizational effects of sex hormones may prime individuals for alcohol dependence by inducing permanent changes to the endogenous opioid system.",

Such crossmodal reorganization is likely associated with changes in large-scale functional connectivity, the spectral characteristics of which can be assessed by analysis of neural oscillations. To test visual cortical integration into working memory networks, we recorded magnetoencephalographic data from congenitally blind and sighted individuals during resting state as well as during a voice-based working memory task prior to and following working memory training with voices, or tactile stimuli or a training-control condition. Auditory training strengthened beta-band (17.5-22.5 Hz) connectivity (imaginary coherency) in the blind and theta-band (2.5-5 Hz) connectivity in the sighted during the task, suggesting different neural coupling mechanisms. In the sighted, theta-band connectivity increased between brain areas involved in auditory working memory (inferior frontal, superior temporal, insular cortex). In the blind, beta-band networks largely emerged during the training, and connectivity increased between brain areas involved in auditory working memory and the visual cortex. The prominent involvement of the right fusiform face area in this beta-band network suggests a task-specific integration of visual cortex. Our findings highlight large-scale interactions as a key mechanism of functional reorganization following congenital blindness, and provide new insights into the spectral characteristics of the mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The Emsian deposits of the Battery Point Formation (GaspeCanada) host the most diverse Early Devonian flora in North America. While most of this diversity has been described from plant compressions, the permineralized component of the flora is incompletely explored. Based on >15 axes studied in serial sections, we describe a new anatomically preserved rhyniopsid from the Battery Point Formation, Eddianna gaspiana gen. & sp. nov.. Eddianna axes are up to 2 mm in diameter and have a well-developed terete xylem strand with potential centrarch maturation (comprising 80% of the cross sectional surface area) that features Sennicaulis-type tracheid wall thickenings. A thin layer interpreted as phloem is preserved around the central xylem and an irregular sclerenchymatous cortex forms longitudinal anastomosing ridges on the outside of the axes. The anatomy of Eddianna axes suggests that they represent lower portions, specialized in efficient water transfer, of a larger plant whose distal regions have yet to be discovered. Eddianna, the first permineralized rhyniopsid described from the Battery Point Formation, is one of only four anatomically preserved plants reported from this unit. These fossils reiterate the potential for additional discoveries of anatomically preserved plants in the Battery Point Formation.",

    "abstract": "Several Penjar accessions of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), widely grown in the Mediterranean region, exhibit prolonged shelf life, and harbor alcobaca mutation with valine-106-aspartic acid substitution in the NAC-NOR protein. To uncover the metabolic basis underlying the prolonged shelf life, we compared four Penjar accessions to Ailsa Craig (AC). Three accessions bore alcobaca mutation, whereas fourth was a novel NAC-NOR allele with only six amino acids in the encoded protein. The cuticle composition among Penjars varied widely during the progression of fruit ripening. All Penjars exhibited delayed ripening, prolonged on-vine and off-vine shelf life, low ethylene emission and carotenoid levels albeit with accession-specific differences. Metabolic profiling revealed shifts in Krebs cycle intermediates, amino acids, and {beta}-aminobutyric acid levels indicating the attenuation of respiration in Penjars during post-harvest storage. The prolonged shelf life of Penjar fruits was associated with a concerted downregulation of a number of cell-wall modifying genes and cell-wall-related metabolites. The accumulation of higher ABA and sucrose levels at the onset of senescence in Penjar fruits likely contribute to reduced water loss. Our analyses reveal that in addition to specialized cuticle composition, the attenuation of various metabolic processes by NAC-NOR mutation likely prolongs the shelf life of Penjar fruits.\\n\\nHighlightThe prolonged shelf life of tomato Penjar accessions bearing mutations in NAC-NOR transcription factor appears to be regulated by a combined effect of attenuation of respiration, altered cuticle composition, enhanced ABA and sucrose levels in fruits and downregulation of cell wall modification",

    "abstract": "One paradigm of random monoallelic gene expression is that of T-cell receptor (TCR){beta} allelic exclusion in T lymphocytes. However, the dynamics that sustain asymmetric choice in TCR{beta} dual allele usage and the production of TCR{beta} monoallelic expressing T-cells remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a computational model to explore a scheme of TCR{beta} allelic exclusion based on the stochastic initiation of DNA rearrangement [V(D)J recombination] at homologous alleles in T-cell progenitors, and thus account for the genotypic profiles typically associated with allelic exclusion in differentiated T-cells. Disturbances in these dynamics at the level of an individual allele have limited consequences on these pro1les, robust feature of the system that is underscored by our simulations. Our study predicts a biological system in which locus-specific, prime epigenetic allelic activation effects set the stage to both optimize the production of TCR{beta} allelically excluded T-cells and curtail the emergence of their allelically included counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Humans commonly operate within 3D environments such as multi-floor buildings and yet there is a surprising dearth of studies that have examined how these spaces are represented in the brain. Here we had participants learn the locations of paintings within a virtual multi-level gallery building and then used behavioural tests and fMRI repetition suppression analyses to investigate how this 3D multi-compartment space was represented, and whether there was a bias in encoding vertical and horizontal information. We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioural priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalised representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioural and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multi-compartment environment. These findings provide much-needed information about how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation in buildings with numerous levels and rooms.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of neural circuits from volume electron microscopy data requires the tracing of complete cells including all their neurites. Automated approaches have been developed to perform the tracing, but without costly human proofreading their error rates are too high to obtain reliable circuit diagrams. We present a method for automated segmentation that, like the majority of previous efforts, employs convolutional neural networks, but contains in addition a recurrent pathway that allows the iterative optimization and extension of the reconstructed shape of individual neural processes. We used this technique, which we call flood-filling networks, to trace neurons in a data set obtained by serial block-face electron microscopy from a male zebra finch brain. Our method achieved a mean error-free neurite path length of 1.1 mm, an order of magnitude better than previously published approaches applied to the same dataset. Only 4 mergers were observed in a neurite test set of 97 mm path length.",

    "abstract": "Memory reactivation during sleep is critical for consolidation, but also extremely difficult to measure as it is subtle, distributed and temporally unpredictable. This article reports a novel method for detecting such reactivation in standard sleep recordings. During learning, participants produced a complex sequence of finger presses, with each finger cued by a distinct audio-visual stimulus. Auditory cues were then re-played during subsequent sleep to trigger neural reactivation through a method known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Next, we used electroencephalography data from the learning session to train a machine learning classifier, and then applied this classifier to sleep data to determine how successfully each tone had elicited memory reactivation. Above chance classification was significantly higher in slow wave sleep than in stage 2, suggesting differential efficacy of TMR in these two sleep stages. Interestingly, classification success reduced across numerous repetitions of the tone cue, suggesting either a gradually reducing responsiveness to such cues or a plasticity-related change in the neural signature as a result of cueing. We believe this method will be invaluable for future investigations of memory consolidation.",
