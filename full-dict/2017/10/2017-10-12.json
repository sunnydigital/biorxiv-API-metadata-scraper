    "abstract": "The rapidly growing field of molecular diet analysis is becoming increasingly popular among ecologists, especially when investigating methodologically challenging groups such as invertebrate generalist predators. Prey DNA detection success is known to be affected by multiple factors, however the type of dietary sample has rarely been considered. Here, we address this knowledge gap by comparing prey DNA detection success from three types of dietary samples. In a controlled feeding experiment, using the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius as a model predator, we collected regurgitates, feces and whole consumers (including their gut contents) at different time points post-feeding. All dietary samples were analyzed using multiplex PCR targeting three different length DNA fragments (128 bp, 332 bp and 612 bp). Our results show that both the type of dietary sample and the size of the DNA fragment contribute to a significant part of the variation found in the detectability of prey DNA. Specifically, we observed that in both regurgitates and whole consumers prey DNA was detectable significantly longer for all fragment sizes than for feces. Based on these observations, we conclude that prey DNA detected from regurgitates and whole consumers DNA extracts are comparable, whereas prey DNA detected from feces, though still sufficiently reliable for ecological studies, will not be directly comparable to the former. Therefore, regurgitates and feces constitute an interesting, non-lethal source for dietary information that could be applied to field studies in situations when invertebrate predators should not be killed.",

    "abstract": "Predicting a phenotype and understanding which variables improve that prediction are two very challenging and overlapping problems in analysis of high-dimensional data such as those arising from genomic and brain imaging studies. It is often believed that the number of truly important predictors is small relative to the total number of variables, making computational approaches to variable selection and dimension reduction extremely important. To reduce dimensionality, commonly-used two-step methods first cluster the data in some way, and build models using cluster summaries to predict the phenotype.\\n\\nIt is known that important exposure variables can alter correlation patterns between clusters of high-dimensional variables, i.e., alter network properties of the variables. However, it is not well understood whether such altered clustering is informative in prediction. Here, assuming there is a binary exposure with such network-altering effects, we explore whether use of exposure-dependent clustering relationships in dimension reduction can improve predictive modelling in a two-step framework. Hence, we propose a modelling framework called ECLUST to test this hypothesis, and evaluate its performance through extensive simulations.\\n\\nWith ECLUST, we found improved prediction and variable selection performance compared to methods that do not consider the environment in the clustering step, or to methods that use the original data as features. We further illustrate this modelling framework through the analysis of three data sets from very different fields, each with high dimensional data, a binary exposure, and a phenotype of interest. Our method is available in the eclust CRAN package.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (<http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100022>). Understanding Ebola Virus (EBOV) virulence evolution is not only timely but also raises specific questions because it causes one of the most virulent human infections and it is capable of transmission after the death of its host. Using a compartmental epidemiological model that captures three transmission routes (by regular contact, via dead bodies and by sexual contact), we infer the evolutionary dynamics of case fatality ratio (CFR) on the scale of an outbreak and on the long term. Our major finding is that the viruss specific life cycle imposes selection for high levels of virulence and that this pattern is robust to parameter variations in biological ranges. In addition to shedding a new light on the ultimate causes of EBOVs high virulence, these results generate testable predictions and contribute to informing public health policies. In particular, burial management stands out as the most appropriate intervention since it decreases the R0 of the epidemics, while imposing selection for less virulent strains.\\n\\nImpact SummaryThe severe haemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola Virus (EBOV) usually kills more than one infected individual out of two in the absence of treatment, which makes this pathogen one of the most virulent known to humans. The recent outbreak in West Africa (2013-2016) revealed that the virus is able to spread and persist for months across countries. It is often thought that virulence could be due to the fact that the virus is adapted to its reservoir host. Given that microbes evolve rapidly, it is important to determine whether EBOV virulence is likely to decrease as the virus adapts to its human host. To address this problem, we developed a novel mathematical model tailored to EBOVs life cycle, notably by capturing its three main transmission routes (by regular contact, sexual contact and via dead bodies). We investigated the evolutionary trends of EBOVs virulence on different time scales (outbreak initiation, short term and long term). Our results reveal that the virulence of EBOV might not be due to the maladaptation of the virus, but could rather originate from its unique life cycle. These results are robust to the parameter values chosen. From a public health perspective, burial management stands out as the main leverage to fight the virulence of EBOV, both on the short and long terms.",

    "abstract": "To optimize processing, the human visual system utilizes regularities present in naturalistic visual input. One of these regularities is the relative position of objects in a scene (e.g., a sofa in front of a television), with behavioral research showing that regularly positioned objects are easier to perceive and to remember. Here we use fMRI to test how positional regularities are encoded in the visual system. Participants viewed pairs of objects that formed minimalistic two-object scenes (e.g., a \\\"living room\\\" consisting of a sofa and television) presented in their regularly experienced spatial arrangement or in an irregular arrangement (with interchanged positions). Additionally, single objects were presented centrally and in isolation. Multi-voxel activity patterns evoked by the object pairs were modeled as the average of the response patterns evoked by the two single objects forming the pair. In two experiments, this approximation in object-selective cortex was significantly less accurate for the regularly than the irregularly positioned pairs, indicating integration of individual object representations. More detailed analysis revealed a transition from independent to integrative coding along the posterior-anterior axis of the visual cortex, with the independent component (but not the integrative component) being almost perfectly predicted by object selectivity across the visual hierarchy. These results reveal a transitional stage between individual object and multi-object coding in visual cortex, providing a possible neural correlate of efficient processing of regularly positioned objects in natural scenes.",

    "abstract": "Potato virus Y is the most economically important potato viral pathogen. We aimed at unraveling the roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in the complex immune signaling network controlling the establishment of tolerant response of potato cv. Desiree to the virus. We constructed a sRNA regulatory network connecting sRNAs and their targets to link sRNA level responses to physiological processes. We discovered an interesting novel sRNAs-gibberellin regulatory circuit being activated as early as 3 days post inoculation before viral multiplication can be detected. Increased levels of miR167 and phasiRNA931 were reflected in decreased levels of transcripts involved in gibberellin biosynthesis. Moreover, decreased concentration of gibberellin confirmed this regulation. The functional relation between lower activity of gibberellin signaling and reduced disease severity was previously confirmed in Arabidopsis-virus interaction using knockout mutants. We further showed that this regulation is salicylic acid-dependent as the response of sRNA network was attenuated in salicylic acid-depleted transgenic counterpart NahG-Desiree expressing severe disease symptoms. Besides downregulation of gibberellin signaling, regulation of several other parts of sRNA network in tolerant Desiree revealed similarities to responses observed in mutualistic symbiotic interactions. The intertwining of different regulatory networks revealed shows how developmental signaling, disease symptom development and stress signaling can be balanced.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding how complex traits evolve through adaptive changes in gene regulation remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Over the last ~50 million years, Earth has experienced climate cooling and ancestrally tropical plants have adapted to expanding temperate environments. The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass flora of the temperate regions, but the role of cold-response gene regulation in the transitioning from tropical to temperate climate remains unexplored.\\n\\nResultsTo establish if molecular responses to cold are conserved throughout the phylogeny, we assembled the transcriptomes of five Pooideae species spanning early to later diverging lineages, and compared short- and long-term cold responsive genes using 8633 high confidence ortholog groups with resolved gene tree topologies. We found that a majority of cold responsive genes were specific to one or two lineages, an observation that we deem incompatible with a cold adapted Pooideae ancestor. However, all five species shared short-term cold response in a small set of general stress genes as well as the ability to down-regulate the photosynthetic machinery during cold temperatures.\\n\\nConclusionsOur observations indicate that the different Pooideae lineages have assembled cold response programs in parallel by taking advantage of a common potential for cold adaptation.",

Here we evaluate the role of anthropogenic drivers in marine ecosystems as drivers of change in local species richness with a meta-analysis of a novel dataset of temporal change in species richness. We paired biodiversity data from 144 sites with large-scale drivers derived from geospatial databases: human cumulative impact scores, sea surface temperature change, nutrient loading, and invasion potential. Three specific drivers (nutrient inputs, rate of linear temperature change, and non-native species invasion potential) explained patterns in local marine species richness change. We show that these drivers have opposing effects on biodiversity trends. In some cases, variability in drivers can create contrasting directions of change yielding observations of no net change when localities are pooled in an attempt to find a global average. Further, long-term studies reveal different effects of drivers that are not observed in short-term studies. These findings begin to explain high variability observed in species diversity trends at local scales. Formally attributing local species diversity change to human drivers is essential to understanding global patterns of local species diversity change and their consequences.",

    "abstract": "Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics have been shown to enhance biofilm formation in multiple bacterial species. While antibiotic exposure has been associated with modulated expression in many biofilm-related genes, the mechanisms of drug-induced biofilm formation remain a focus of ongoing research efforts and may vary significantly across species. In this work, we investigate antibiotic-induced biofilm formation in E. faecalis, a leading cause of nosocomial infections. We show that biofilm formation is enhanced by subinhibitory concentrations of cell wall synthesis inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of protein, DNA, folic acid, or RNA synthesis. Furthermore, enhanced biofilm is associated with increased cell lysis, an increase in extracellular DNA (eDNA), and an increase in the density of living cells in the biofilm. In addition, we observe similar enhancement of biofilm formation when cells are treated with non-antibiotic surfactants that induce cell lysis. These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced biofilm formation is governed by a trade-off between drug toxicity and the beneficial effects of cell lysis. To understand this trade-off, we developed a simple mathematical model that predicts changes to antibiotic-induced biofilm formation due to external perturbations, and we verify these predictions experimentally. Specifically, we demonstrate that perturbations that reduce eDNA (DNase treatment) or decrease the number of living cells in the planktonic phase (a second antibiotic) decrease biofilm induction, while chemical inhibitors of cell lysis increase relative biofilm induction and shift the peak to higher antibiotic concentrations. Overall, our results offer experimental evidence linking cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell lysis, increased eDNA, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis while also providing a predictive, quantitative model that sheds light on the interplay between cell lysis and antibiotic efficacy in developing biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Ecological mechanisms influence relationships among microbial communities, which in turn impact biogeochemistry. In particular, microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (e.g., selection) and stochastic (e.g., dispersal) processes, and the relative influence of these two process types is hypothesized to alter the influence of microbial communities over biogeochemical function, which we define generically to represent any biogeochemical reaction of interest. We used an ecological simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis. We assembled receiving communities under different levels of dispersal from a source community that was assembled purely by deterministic selection. The dispersal scenarios ranged from no dispersal (i.e., selection-only) to dispersal rates high enough to overwhelm selection (i.e., homogenizing dispersal). We used an aggregate measure of community fitness to infer its biogeochemical function relative to other communities. We also used ecological null models to further link the relative influence of deterministic assembly to function. We found that increasing rates of dispersal decrease biogeochemical function by increasing the proportion of maladapted taxa in a local community. Niche breadth was also a key determinant of biogeochemical function, suggesting a tradeoff between the function of generalist and specialist species. Together, our results highlight the influence of spatial processes on biogeochemical function and indicate the need to account for such effects in models that aim to predict biogeochemical function under future environmental scenarios.",

Our study implicates vasomotion of smooth muscle actin-covered vessels, rather than pericyte-covered capillaries, as the main mechanism for modulating tissue oxygenation. We also resolve seemingly paradoxical observations in the literature around reduced blood velocity in response to arteriolar constrictions and deduce the cause to be propagation of constrictions to upstream penetrating arterioles. We provide support for pericytes acting as signalling conduits for upstream smooth muscle activation, and erythrocyte deformation as a complementary regulatory mechanism.

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting leads to different expression levels of maternally and paternally derived alleles. Over the last years, major progress has been made in identifying novel imprinted candidate genes in plants, owing to affordable next-generation sequencing technologies. However, reports on sequencing the transcriptome of hybrid F1 seed tissues strongly disagree about how many and which genes are imprinted. This raises questions about the relative impact of biological, environmental, technical, and analytic differences or biases. Here, we adopt a statistical approach, frequently used in RNA-seq data analysis, which properly models count overdispersion and considers replicate information of reciprocal crosses. We show that our statistical pipeline outperforms other methods in identifying imprinted genes in simulated and real data. Accordingly, reanalysis of genome-wide imprinting studies in Arabidopsis and maize shows that, at least for the Arabidopsis dataset, an increased agreement across datasets can be observed. For maize, however, consistent reanalysis did not yield in a larger overlap between the datasets. This suggests that the discrepancy across publications might be partially due to different analysis pipelines but that technical, biological, and environmental factors underlie much of the discrepancy between datasets. Finally, we show that the set of genes that can be characterized regarding allelic bias by all studies with minimal confidence is small (~8,000/27,416 genes for Arabidopsis and ~12,000/39,469 for maize). In conclusion, we propose to use biologically replicated reciprocal crosses, high sequence coverage, and a generalized linear model approach to identify differentially expressed alleles in developing seeds.",

    "abstract": "In biological membranes many factors such as cytoskeleton, lipid composition, crowding and molecular interactions deviate lateral diffusion from the expected random walks. These factors have different effects on diffusion but act simultaneously so the observed diffusion is a complex mixture of diffusive behaviors (directed, >Brownian, anomalous or confined). Therefore commonly used approaches to quantify diffusion based on averaging of the displacements, such as the mean square displacement, are not adapted to the analysis of this heterogeneity. We introduce a new parameter, the packing coefficient Pc, which gives an estimate of the degree of free movement that a molecule displays in a period of time independently of its global diffusivity. Applying this approach to two different situations (diffusion of a lipid probe and trapping of receptors at synapses), we show that Pc detected and localized temporary changes of diffusive behavior both in time and in space. More importantly, it allowed the detection of periods with very high confinement (~immobility), their frequency and duration, and thus it can be used to calculate the effective kon and koff of scaffolding interactions such those that immobilize receptors at synapses.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavior is the final and integrated output of the brain activity. Thus, recording and analyzing behavior is critical to understand the underlying brain function. While recording animal behavior has become easier than ever with the development of compact and inexpensive devices, detailed behavioral data analysis requires sufficient previous knowledge and/or high content data such as video images of animal postures, which makes it difficult for most of the animal behavioral data to be efficiently analyzed to understand brain function. Here, we report a versatile method using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning approach to efficiently estimate behavioral states and to extract important behavioral features only from low-content animal trajectory data. As proof of principle experiments, we analyzed trajectory data of worms, fruit flies, rats, and bats in the laboratories, and penguins and flying seabirds in the wild, which were recorded with various methods and span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales--from mm to 1000 km in space and from sub-seconds to days in time. We estimated several states during behavior and comprehensively extracted characteristic features from a behavioral state and/or a specific experimental condition. Physiological and genetic experiments in worms revealed that the extracted behavioral features reflected specific neural or gene activities. Thus, our method provides a versatile and unbiased way to extract behavioral features from simple trajectory data to understand brain function.",

    "abstract": "In the hippocampus, episodic memories are thought to be encoded by the formation of ensembles of synaptically coupled CA3 pyramidal cells driven by sparse but powerful mossy fiber inputs from dentate gyrus granule cells. Since CA3 network capacity is finite, a mechanism for enhancing memory encoding during important events would ensure greater efficiency, but the salient signal that might determine this memory selectivity filter is unknown. Using experimental and computational methods we show that the cholinergic system can operate as a memory selectivity filter by combining 3 separate mechanisms: disinhibition of feed-forward mossy fiber inhibition enables synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses; Increasing cellular excitability lowers the threshold for ensemble formation; Reduction of overall CA3-CA3 recurrent synapse strength allows for an increase in overlap between ensembles. Thus, we show that acetylcholine release enables the selective encoding of salient high-density episodic memories in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Two experiments examined adult age differences in the use of memory to comprehend changes in everyday activities. Participants viewed movies depicting an actor performing activities on two fictive days in her life. Some activities were repeated across days, other activities were repeated with a changed feature (e.g., waking up to an alarm clock or a phone alarm), and a final set of activities was performed on Day 2 only. After a one-week delay, participants completed a cued recall test for the activities of Day 2. Unsurprisingly, exact repetition boosted final recall. More surprising, features that changed from Day 1 to Day 2 were remembered approximately as well as features that were only presented on Day 2--showing an absence of proactive interference and in some cases proactive facilitation. Proactive facilitation was strongly related to participants ability to detect and recollect the changes. Younger adults detected and recollected more changes than older adults, which in part explained older adults differential deficit in memory for changed activity features. We propose that this pattern may reflect observers use of episodic memory to make predictions during the experience of a new activity, and that when predictions fail, this triggers processing that benefits subsequent episodic memory. Disruption of this chain of processing could play a role in age-related episodic memory deficits.",

To examine their respective roles, we generated a set of HCT116-based cell lines expressing Ki-67 and/or condensin subunits that were fused with an auxin-inducible degron for their conditional degradation. Both the localization and the dynamic behavior of Ki-67 on mitotic chromosomes were not largely affected upon depletion of condensin subunits, and vice versa. When both Ki-67 and SMC2 (a core subunit of condensins) were depleted, ball-like chromosome clusters with no sign of discernible thread-like structures were observed. This severe defective phenotype was distinct from that observed in cells depleted of either Ki-67 or SMC2 alone. Our results show that Ki-67 and condensins, which localize to the external surface and the central axis of mitotic chromosomes, respectively, have independent yet cooperative functions in supporting the structural integrity of mitotic chromosomes.\\n\\nList of Abbreviations used",

We present two structures of the human pancreatic KATP channel, containing the ABC transporter SUR1 and the inward-rectifier K+ channel Kir6.2, in the presence of Mg2+ and nucleotides. These structures, referred to as quatrefoil and propeller forms, were determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.9 [A] and 5.6 [A], respectively. In both forms ATP occupies the inhibitory site in Kir6.2. The nucleotide-binding domains of SUR1 are dimerized with Mg2+-ATP in the degenerate site and Mg2+-ADP in the consensus site. A lasso extension forms an interface between SUR1 and Kir6.2 adjacent to the ATP site in the propeller form, and is disrupted in the quatrefoil form. These structures support the role of SUR1 as an ADP sensor and highlight the lasso extension as a key regulatory element in ADPs ability to override ATP inhibition.",

Recent studies have challenged assumptions about both the cellular composition1 and functional significance of the cardiac non-myocyte cell pool, with unexpected roles identified for resident fibroblasts2 and immune cell populations3,4. In this study, we characterized single-cell transcriptional profiles of the murine non-myocyte cardiac cellular landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Detailed molecular analyses revealed the diversity of the cardiac cellulome and facilitated the development of novel techniques to isolate understudied cardiac cell populations such as mural cells and glia. Our analyses also revealed networks of intercellular communication as well as extensive sexual dimorphism in gene expression in the heart, most notably demonstrated by the upregulation of immune-sensing and pro-inflammatory genes in male cardiac macrophages. This study offers new insights into the structure and function of the mammalian cardiac cellulome and provides an important resource that will stimulate new studies in cardiac cell biology.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and chemo-genetic interactions have played key roles in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which certain chemicals perturb cellular functions. Many studies have employed gene knockout collections or gene disruption/depletion strategies to identify routes for evolving resistance to chemical agents. By contrast, searching for point-mutational genetic suppressors that can identify separation- or gain-of-function mutations, has been limited even in simpler, genetically amenable organisms such as yeast, and has not until recently been possible in mammalian cell culture systems. Here, by demonstrating its utility in identifying suppressors of cellular sensitivity to the drugs camptothecin or olaparib, we describe an approach allowing systematic, large-scale detection of spontaneous or chemically-induced suppressor mutations in yeast and in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells in a short timeframe, and with potential applications in essentially any other haploid system. In addition to its utility for molecular biology research, this protocol can be used to identify drug targets and to predict mechanisms leading to drug resistance. Mapping suppressor mutations on the primary sequence or three-dimensional structures of protein suppressor hits provides insights into functionally relevant protein domains, advancing our molecular understanding of protein functions, and potentially helping to improve drug design and applicability.",

    "abstract": "LIN28 is a bipartite RNA-binding protein that post-transcriptionally inhibits let-7 microRNAs to regulate development and influence disease states. However, the mechanisms of let-7 suppression remains poorly understood, because LIN28 recognition depends on coordinated targeting by both the zinc knuckle domain (ZKD)--which binds a GGAG-like element in the precursor--and the cold shock domain (CSD), whose binding sites have not been systematically characterized. By leveraging single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of LIN28 binding sites in vivo, we determined that the CSD recognizes a (U)GAU motif. This motif partitions the let-7 family into Class I precursors with both CSD and ZKD binding sites and Class II precursors with ZKD but no CSD binding sites. LIN28 in vivo recognition--and subsequent 3' uridylation and degradation--of Class I precursors is more efficient, leading to their stronger suppression in LIN28-activated cells and cancers. Thus, CSD binding sites amplify the effects of the LIN28 activation with potential implication in development and cancer.",

APPswe/PS1dE9 mice demonstrated despair- and anxiety-like behaviors, and reduced sociability, accompanied by high levels of soluble beta-amyloid, glial activation, neuroinflammation and brain derived neurotrophic factor signaling disturbance in the hippocampus. Notably, APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exposure to CMS further aggravated anxiety-like behaviors rather than hopelessness and sociability deficits, accompanied with more severe neuroinflammation, and low serum corticosterone increased to the normal level.

    "abstract": "The deviation from the uniform usage of synonymous codons is termed codon usage bias. A lot has been explained from the translational viewpoint for the observed phenomenon. To understand codon usage bias from the transcriptional perspective, we present here a holistic picture of this phenomenon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using both wild type and computationally mutated mRNAs. Although in wild type, both codon usage bias and mRNA stability positively regulate the gene (mRNA) expression level and are positively correlated with each other, any deviation from natural situation breaks such equilibrium. Computational examination of mRNA sequences with different sets of synonymous codon composition reveals that in mutated condition, the mRNA expression becomes reduced. Furthermore, constraining codon usage pattern to wild type and carrying out randomization of codons resulted in less stable mRNA. Further, we realized a Boolean Expression explaining the gene expression under various conditions of bias and mRNA stability. These studies suggest that selection of codons is favored for regulation of gene expression through potential formation of messenger RNA structures which contribute to folding stability. The naturally occurring codon composition is responsible for optimization of gene expression, and under such composition, the mRNA structure having highest stability is selected by nature.",

    "abstract": "The transport of proteins across or into membranes is a vital biological process, achieved in every cell by the conserved Sec machinery. In bacteria, SecYEG combines with the SecA motor protein for secretion of pre-proteins across the plasma membrane, powered by ATP hydrolysis and the trans-membrane proton-motive-force (PMF). The activities of SecYEG and SecA are modulated by membrane lipids, particularly by cardiolipin, a specialised phospholipid known to associate with a range of energy-transducing machines. Here, we identify two specific cardiolipin binding sites on the Thermotoga maritima SecA-SecYEG complex, through application of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We validate the computational data and demonstrate the conserved nature of the binding sites using in vitro mutagenesis, native mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis of Escherichia coli SecYEG. The results show that the two sites account for the preponderance of functional cardiolipin binding to SecYEG, and mediate its roles in ATPase and protein transport activity. In addition, we demonstrate an important role for cardiolipin in the conferral of PMF-stimulation of protein transport. The apparent transient nature of the CL interaction might facilitate proton exchange with the Sec machinery and thereby stimulate protein transport, by an as yet unknown mechanism. This study demonstrates the power of coupling the high predictive ability of coarse-grained simulation with experimental analyses, towards investigation of both the nature and functional implications of protein-lipid interactions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany proteins are located in lipid membranes surrounding cells and cellular organelles. The membrane can impart important structural and functional effects on the protein, making understanding of this interaction critical. Here, we apply computational simulation to the identification of conserved lipid binding sites on an important highly conserved bacterial membrane protein, the Sec translocase (SecA-SecYEG), which uses ATP and the proton motive force (PMF) to secrete proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane. We experimentally validate and reveal the conserved nature of these binding sites, and use functional analyses to investigate the biological significance of this interaction. We demonstrate that these interactions are specific, transient, and critical for both ATP- and PMF- driven protein secretion.",

    "abstract": "The transport of proteins across membranes is a fundamental and essential process, achieved in every cell by the  Sec translocon. In prokaryotes, SecYEG associates with the motor protein SecA to carry out ATP-driven pre-protein secretion - a vital step in the biogenesis of most periplasmic, outer membrane and secreted proteins. Structural data of the SecA-SecYEG complex has provided considerable insight into underlying mechanism of this process. Previously, we have proposed a Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation, whereby the free energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis favours the progression of pre-protein across the membrane from the cytosol toward the outside [Allen, Corey et al. eLife 2016]. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of a SecA-SecYEG complex engaged with preprotein to further address the mechanism underlying this process. The data describe pre-protein secondary structure formation within the channel, which exhibits a nucleotide-dependent asymmetry between the cytoplasmic and exterior cavities. The results suggest ATP-dependent pre-protein transport is partly driven by pre-protein secondary structure formation. The model previously described, and refined here, could easily be adapted for the transport of proteins across various other membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial inner membranes.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) are involved in pathogen defense and inflammatory reactions. Upon stimulation, they release substances stored in their granules via regulated exocytosis. In other cell types, Munc13 proteins play essential roles in regulated exocytosis. We found that MCs express Munc13-2 and -4, and we studied their roles using global and conditional knockout (KO) mice. In a model of systemic anaphylaxis, we found no difference between WT and Munc13-2 KO mice, but global and MC-specific Munc13-4 KO mice developed less hypothermia. This protection correlated with lower plasma histamine levels and histological evidence of defective MC degranulation, and not with changes in MC development, distribution, numbers or morphology. In vitro assays revealed that the defective MC response in the absence of Munc13-4 was limited to regulated exocytosis, leaving other MC secretory effector responses intact. Single cell capacitance measurements in MCs from mouse mutants with different expression levels of Munc13-4 in their MCs showed that as levels of Munc13-4 decrease, the rate of exocytosis declines first, and the total amount of exocytosis follows. A requirement for Munc13-2 in MC exocytosis was revealed only in the absence of Munc13-4. Electrophysiology and electron microscopy studies showed that the number of multigranular compound events (granule-to-granule homotypic fusion) was severely reduced in the absence of Munc13-4. We conclude that while Munc13-2 plays a minor role, Munc13-4 is essential for regulated exocytosis in MCs, and that this MC effector response is required for a full IgE-mediated anaphylactic response.",

    "abstract": "The Placozoa [1] is a monotypic phylum of non-bilaterian marine animals. Its only species, Trichoplax adhaerens, was described in 1883 [2], Despite the worldwide distribution of placozoans [3-6], morphological differences are lacking among isolates from different geographic areas and, consequently, no other species in this phylum has been described and accepted for more than 130 years. However, recent single-gene studies on the genetic diversity of this \\\"species\\\" have revealed deeply divergent lineages of, as yet, undefined taxonomic ranks [3,5,6], Since single genes are not considered sufficient to define species [7], a whole nuclear genome comparison appears the most appropriate approach to determine relationships between placozoan lineages. Such a \\\"taxogenomics\\\" approach can help discover and diagnose potential additional species and, therefore, develop a much-needed, more robust, taxonomic framework for this phylum. To achieve this we sequenced the genome of a placozoan lineage isolated from Hong Kong (lineage H13), which is distantly related to T. adhaerens [6]. The 87 megabase genome assembly contains 12,010 genes. Comparison to the T. adhaerens genome [8] identified an average protein distance of 24.4% in more than 2,700 screened one-to-one orthologs, similar to levels observed between the chordate classes mammals and birds. Genome rearrangements are commonplace and >25% of genes are not collinear (i.e. they are not in the same order in the two genomes). Finally, a multi-gene distance comparison with other non-bilaterian phyla indicate genus level differences to T. adhaerens. These data highlight the large genomic diversity within the Placozoa and justifies the designation of lineage HI3 as a new species, Xxxxxxxxx yyyyyyyyyyyyy1 gen. et spaec. nov., now the second described placozoan species and the first in a new genus. Phylogenomic analyses furthermore supports a robust placement of the Placozoa as sister to a cnidarian-bilaterian clade.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria interact with their environment through the secretion of a specific set of proteins (known as secretome) through various secretion systems. Molecular modifications of these secretion systems may lead to the emergence of new bacterial-environment interactions, although this remains unexplored. In this study we investigate the possible link between molecular and functional changes in secretion proteins and the ecological diversity of bacteria. We studied functional modifications in secretion proteins by identifying events of functional evolutionary divergence--that is, changes at the molecular level that have driven changes of proteins function. We present data supporting that these functional diversifications occurred in essential secretion proteins in bacteria. In particular, functional divergence of the two most important secretion proteins SecA and SecY in pathogenic bacteria suggests that molecular changes at these proteins are responsible for their adaptations to the host. Functional divergence has mainly occurred at protein domains involved in ATP hydrolysis in SecA and membrane pore formation in SecY. This divergence is stronger in pathogenic bacteria for protein copies resulting from the duplication of SecA/SecY, known as SecA2/SecY2. In concert with these results, we find that the secretome of bacteria with the strongest functional divergence is enriched for proteins specialized in the interaction with specific environments. We unravel evolutionary signatures that link mutations at secretion proteins to the ecological diversification of bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies of in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater with acetate injections have focused on the role of Geobacter species in U(VI) reduction because of a lack of other abundant known U(VI)-reducing microorganisms. Monitoring the levels of methyl CoM reductase subunit A (mcrA) transcripts during an acetate-injection field experiment demonstrated that acetoclastic methanogens from the genus Methanosarcina were enriched after 40 days of acetate amendment. The increased abundance of Methanosarcina corresponded with an accumulation of methane in the groundwater. An enrichment culture dominated by a Methanosarcina species with the same Methanosarcina mcrA sequence that predominated in the field experiment could effectively convert acetate to methane. In order to determine whether Methanosarcina species could be participating in U(VI) reduction in the subsurface, cell suspensions of M. barkeri were incubated in the presence of U(VI) with acetate provided as the electron donor. U(VI) was reduced by metabolically active M. barkeri cells, however, no U(VI) reduction was observed in inactive controls. These results demonstrate that Methanosarcina species could play an important role in the long-term bioremediation of uranium-contaminated aquifers after depletion of Fe(III) oxides limits the growth of Geobacter species. The results also suggest that Methanosarcina have the potential to influence uranium geochemistry in a diversity of anaerobic sedimentary environments.",

These results provide evidence for navigational planning and contextual accounts of human MTL function at the single-neuron level. More generally, our findings identify phase-coded neuronal firing as a component of the human neural code.",

    "abstract": "Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalography (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework.\\n\\nWe show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44 %). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75-95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55-125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification.\\n\\nThus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAveraging brain activity across trials is a powerful way to increase signal-to-noise ratio in MEG data. This approach, however, potentially obscures meaningful brain dynamics that unfold on the single-trial level. Single-trial analyses have been successfully applied to time domain or low frequency oscillatory activity; its application to MEG high frequency activity is hindered by the low amplitude of these signals. In the present study, we show that stimulus modality (visual versus auditory presentation of words) can successfully be decoded from single-trial MEG high frequency activity by combining source reconstruction with a random forest classification algorithm. This approach reveals patterns of activity above 75 Hz in both visual and auditory cortex, highlighting the importance of high frequency activity for the processing of domain-specific stimuli. Thereby, our results extend prior findings by revealing high-frequency activity in auditory cortex related to auditory word stimuli in MEG data. The adopted across-subjects framework furthermore suggests a high inter-individual consistency in the high frequency activity patterns.",

    "abstract": "Sleep promotes memory consolidation through unique neuromodulatory activity. However, little is known about the impact of attention during pre-sleep memory encoding on later memory performance. The current study aimed to address the question of whether attentional state prior to encoding, as indexed by alpha oscillatory activity, modulates the consolidation of images across periods of sleep and wake. 22 participants aged 18 - 41 years (mean age = 27.3) viewed 120 emotionally valenced images (positive, negative, neutral) before a 2hr afternoon sleep opportunity and an equivalent period of wake. Following the sleep and wake conditions, participants were required to distinguish between 120 previously seen (target) images and 120 new (distractor) images. Relative alpha power - adjusted according to participants individual alpha frequency - was computed to index attentional state prior to the learning phase. Generalised linear mixed-effects modelling revealed memory performance was modulated by attention, such that greater pre-encoding alpha power preferentially promoted memory consolidation during wake compared to sleep. There was no difference in memory performance between positive, negative and neutral stimuli. Modulations in alpha oscillatory activity may help to coordinate the flow of information between task-relevant cortical regions and a thalamo-cortical loop that preferentially subserves the formation of memory during times of wake relative to sleep.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free synthetic biochemistry provides a green solution to replace traditional petroleum or agricultural based methods for production of fine chemicals. 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one, also known as raspberry ketone, is the major fragrance component of raspberry fruit and is utilised as a natural additive in the food and sports industry. Current industrial processing standards involve chemical extraction with a yield of 1-4 mg per kilo of fruit. As such its market price can fluctuate up to $20,000 per kg. Metabolic engineering approaches to synthesise this molecule by microbial fermentation have only resulted in low yields of up to 5 mg L-1. In contrast, cell-free synthetic biochemistry offers an intriguing compromise to the engineering constraints provided by the living cell. Using purified enzymes or a two-step semisynthetic route, an optimised pathway was formed for raspberry ketone synthesis leading up to 100% yield conversion. The semi-synthetic route is potentially scalable and cost-efficient for industrial synthesis of raspberry ketone.",

    "abstract": "Natural biochemical systems are ubiquitously organized both in space and time. Engineering the spatial organization of biochemistry has emerged as a key theme of synthetic biology, with numerous technologies promising improved biosynthetic pathway performance. One strategy, however, may produce disparate results for different biosynthetic pathways. We propose a spatially resolved kinetic model to explore this fundamental design choice in systems and synthetic biology. We predict that two example biosynthetic pathways have distinct optimal organization strategies that vary based on pathway-dependent and cell-extrinsic factors. Moreover, we outline this design space in general as a function of kinetic and biophysical properties, as well as culture conditions. Our results suggest that organizing biosynthesis has the potential to substantially improve performance, but that choosing the appropriate strategy is key. The flexible mathematical framework we propose can be adapted to diverse biosynthetic pathways, and lays a foundation to rationally choose organization strategies for biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing biological data using pathways helps identify trends in data tied to the function of a network. A large number of pathway-based analysis tools have been developed toward this goal. These pathways are often manually curated and thus associations are subject to the biases of the curator. A potentially attractive alternative is to define pathways based on the inherent functionality and connectivity of the network itself. Within metabolism, functionality is defined by the production and consumption of metabolites, and connectivity by metabolites participating in reactions through common enzymes. In this work, we present an algorithm, termed MetPath, that calculates pathways for production and consumption of metabolites. We show how these pathways have attractive properties, such as the ability to integrate multiple data types and weight contribution of genes within the pathway by their functional contribution to metabolite production/consumption. Pathways calculated in this manner are condition-specific and thus are custom tailored to the system of interest, in contrast to curated pathways. We find that these pathways predict gene expression correlation better compared to manually-curated pathways. Additionally, we find that these pathways can be used to understand gene expression changes between growth conditions and between cell types. This work serves to better understand the functional pathway structure underlying cell metabolism and helps to enable systems analyses of high-throughput data.",

Here we present the affinity landscapes of 78 human RBPs using an unbiased assay that determines the sequence, structure, and context preferences of an RBP in vitro from deep sequencing of bound RNAs. Analyses of these data revealed several interesting patterns, including unexpectedly low diversity of RNA motifs, implying frequent convergent evolution of binding specificity toward a relatively small set of RNA motifs, many with low compositional complexity. Offsetting this trend, we observed extensive preferences for contextual features outside of core RNA motifs, including spaced \\\"bipartite\\\" motifs, biased flanking nucleotide context, and bias away from or towards RNA structure. These contextual features are likely to enable targeting of distinct subsets of transcripts by different RBPs that recognize the same core motif. Our results enable construction of \\\"RNA maps\\\" of RBP activity without requiring crosslinking-based assays, and provide unprecedented depth of information on the interaction of RBPs with RNA.",

Extraction of biologically relevant information from a set of high-resolution structures is important because it can provide mechanistic details behind the functional properties of protein families, enabling rational comparison between families. Most of the current structure comparisons are pairwise-based, which hampers the global analysis of increasing contents in the Protein Data Bank. Additionally, pairing of protein structures introduces uncertainty with respect to reproducibility because it frequently accompanies other settings for superimposition. This study introduces intramolecular distance scoring, for the analysis of human proteins, for each of which at least several high-resolution are available. We show that the results are comprehensively used to overview advances at the atomic level exploration of each protein and protein family. This method, and the interpretation based on model calculations, provide new criteria for understanding specific and non-specific structure variation in a protein, enabling global comparison of the dynamics among a vast variety of proteins from different species.",

    "abstract": "We propose a mathematical and computational model that captures the stimulus-generated Ca2+ transients in the C. elegans ASH sensory neuron. The model is built based on biophysical events and molecular cascades known to unfold as part of neurons Ca2+ homeostasis mechanism, as well as on Ca2+ signaling events. The state of ion channels is described by their probability of being activated or inactivated, and the remaining molecular states are based on biochemically defined kinetic equations with phenomenological adjustments. We estimate the parameters of the model using experimental data of hyperosmotic stimulus-evoked Ca2+ transients detected with a FRET sensor in young and aged worms, unstressed and exposed to oxidative stress. We use a hybrid optimization method composed of a multi-objective genetic algorithm and nonlinear least-squares to estimate the model parameters. We first obtain the model parameters for young unstressed worms. Next, we use these values of the parameters as a starting point to identify the model parameters for stressed and aged worms. We show that the model, in combination with experimental data, corroborates literature results. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can be used to predict ASH response to complex combinations of stimulation pulses. The proposed model includes for the first time the ASH Ca2+ dynamics observed during both \\\"on\\\" and \\\"off\\\" responses. This mathematical and computational effort is the first to propose a dynamic model of the Ca2+ transients mechanism in C. elegans neurons, based on biochemical pathways of the cells Ca2+ homeostasis machinery.\\n\\nSignificance StatementC. elegans is widely used as a model system for monitoring neuronal Ca2+ transients. The ASH neuron is the subject of several such studies, primarily due to its key importance as a polymodal nociceptor. However, despite its pivotal role in C. elegans biology, and the special characteristics of its stimulus-evoked Ca2+ transients (e.g., the \\\"off\\\" response), no mathematical or computational model has been developed to include special features of ASH Ca2+ dynamics, i.e. the \\\"off\\\" response. The model includes for the first time the ASH Ca2+ dynamics observed during both \\\"on\\\" and \\\"off\\\" responses, and is the first to propose a dynamical model of the C. elegans Ca2+ transients mechanism based on biochemical pathways of the cells Ca2+ homeostasis machinery.\\n\\nAbbreviations",
