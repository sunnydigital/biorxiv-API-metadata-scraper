    "abstract": "Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204 (N=32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and {Omega}nyx).\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe describe Latent change score modelling as a flexible statistical tool\\nC_LIO_LIKey developmental questions can be readily formalized using LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWe provide accessible open source code and software examples to fit LCS models\\nC_LIO_LIWhite matter structural change is negatively correlated with processing speed gains\\nC_LIO_LIFrontal lobe thinning in adolescence is more variable in males than females\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genome annotation is critical to understand the function of disease variants, especially for clinical applications. To meet this need there are segmentations available from public consortia reflecting varying unsupervised approaches to functional annotation based on epigenetics data, but there remains a need for transparent, reproducible, and easily interpreted genomic maps of the functional biology of chromatin. We introduce a new methodological framework for defining a combinatorial epigenomic model of chromatin state on a web database, StateHub. In addition, we created an annotation tool for bioconductor, StatePaintR, which accesses these models and uses them to rapidly (on the order of seconds) produce chromatin state segmentations in standard genome browser formats. Annotations are fully documented with change history and versioning, authorship information, and original source files. StatePaintR calculates ranks for each state from next-gen sequencing peak statistics, facilitating variant prioritization, enrichment testing, and other types of quantitative analysis. StateHub hosts annotation tracks for major public consortia as a resource, and allows users to submit their own alternative models.",

    "abstract": "The relatively new field of connectomics provides us with a unique window into nervous system function. In the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, this promise is even greater due to the relatively small number of cells (302) in its nervous system. While the adult C. elegans connectome has been characterized, the emergence of these networks in development has yet to be established. In this paper, we approach this problem using secondary data describing the birth times of terminally-differentiated cells as they appear in the embryo and a connectomics model for nervous system cells in the adult hermaphrodite. By combining these two sources of data, we can better understand patterns that emerge in an incipient connectome. This includes identifying at what point in embryogenesis the cells of a connectome first comes into being, potentially observing some of the earliest neuron-neuron interactions, and making comparisons between the formally-defined connectome and developmental cell lineages. An analysis is also conducted to root terminally-differentiated cells in their developmental cell lineage precursors. This reveals subnetworks with different properties at 300 minutes of embryogenesis. Additional investigations reveal the spatial position of neuronal cells born during pre-hatch development, both within and outside the connectome model, in the context of all developmental cells in the embryo. Overall, these analyses reveal important information about the birth order of specific cells in the connectome, key building blocks of global connectivity, and how these structures correspond to key events in early development.",

    "abstract": "Acquisition of foreign DNA by natural transformation is an important mechanism of adaptation and evolution in diverse microbial species. Here, we characterize the mechanism of ComM, a broadly conserved AAA+ protein previously implicated in homologous recombination of transforming DNA (tDNA) in naturally competent Gram-negative bacterial species. In vivo, we found that ComM was required for efficient comigration of linked genetic markers in Vibrio cholerae and Acinetobacter baylyi, which is consistent with a role in branch migration. Also, ComM was particularly important for integration of tDNA with increased sequence heterology, suggesting that its activity promotes the acquisition of novel DNA sequences. In vitro, we showed that purified ComM binds ssDNA, oligomerizes into a hexameric ring, and has bidirectional helicase and branch migration activity. Based on these data, we propose a model for tDNA integration during natural transformation. This study provides mechanistic insight into the enigmatic steps involved in tDNA integration and uncovers the function of a protein required for this conserved mechanism of horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "While meta-analysis has demonstrated increased statistical power and more robust estimations in studies, the application of this commonly accepted methodology to cytometry data has been challenging. Different cytometry studies often involve diverse sets of markers. Moreover, the detected values of the same marker are inconsistent between studies due to different experimental designs and cytometer configurations. As a result, the cell subsets identified by existing auto-gating methods cannot be directly compared across studies. We developed MetaCyto for automated meta-analysis of both flow and mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. By combining clustering methods with a silhouette scanning method, MetaCyto is able to identify commonly labeled cell subsets across studies, thus enabling meta-analysis. Applying MetaCyto across a set of 10 heterogeneous cytometry studies totaling 2926 samples enabled us to identify multiple cell populations exhibiting differences in abundance between White and Asian adults.

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100039). The efficiency of plant resistance to fungal pathogen populations is expected to decrease over time, due to its evolution with an increase in the frequency of virulent or highly aggressive strains. This dynamics may differ depending on the scale investigated (annual or pluriannual), particularly for annual crop pathogens with both sexual and asexual reproduction cycles. We assessed this time-scale effect, by comparing aggressiveness changes in a local Zymoseptoria tritici population over an eight-month cropping season and a six-year period of wheat monoculture. We collected two pairs of subpopulations to represent the annual and pluriannual scales: from leaf lesions at the beginning and end of a single annual epidemic, and from crop debris at the beginning and end of a six-year period. We assessed two aggressiveness traits - latent period and lesion size - on sympatric and allopatric host varieties. A trend toward decreased latent period concomitant with a significant loss of variability was established during the course of the annual epidemic, but not over the six-year period. Furthermore, a significant cultivar effect (sympatric vs. allopatric) on the average aggressiveness of the isolates revealed host adaptation, arguing that the observed patterns could result from selection. We thus provide an experimental body of evidence of an epidemiological trade-off between the intra- and inter-annual scales in the evolution of aggressiveness in a local plant pathogen population. More aggressive isolates were collected from upper leaves, on which disease severity is usually lower than on the lower part of the plants left in the field as crop debris after harvest. We suggest that these isolates play little role in sexual reproduction, due to an Allee effect (difficulty finding mates at low pathogen densities), particularly as the upper parts of the plant are removed from the field, explaining the lack of transmission of increases in aggressiveness between epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between sensory pathways such as the visual and auditory systems are known to occur in the brain, but where they first occur is uncertain. Here we show a novel multimodal interaction evident at the eardrum. Ear canal microphone measurements in humans (n=19 ears in 16 subjects) and monkeys (n=5 ears in 3 subjects) performing a saccadic eye movement task to visual targets indicated that the eardrum moves in conjunction with the eye movement. The eardrum motion was oscillatory and began as early as 10 ms before saccade onset in humans or with saccade onset in monkeys. These eardrum movements, which we dub Eye Movement Related Eardrum Oscillations (EMREOs), occurred in the absence of a sound stimulus. The EMREOs amplitude and phase depended on the direction and horizontal amplitude of the saccade. They lasted throughout the saccade and well into subsequent periods of steady fixation. We discuss the possibility that the mechanisms underlying EMREOs create eye movement-related binaural cues that may aid the brain in evaluating the relationship between visual and auditory stimulus locations as the eyes move.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe peripheral hearing system contains several motor mechanisms that allow the brain to modify the auditory transduction process. Movements or tensioning of either the middle-ear muscles or the outer hair cells modify eardrum motion, producing sounds that can be detected by a microphone placed in the ear canal (e.g. as otoacoustic emissions). Here, we report a novel form of eardrum motion produced by the brain via these systems -- oscillations synchronized with and covarying with the direction and amplitude of saccades. These observations suggest that a vision-related process modulates the first stage of hearing. In particular, these eye-movement related eardrum oscillations may help the brain connect sights and sounds despite changes in the spatial relationship between the eyes and the ears.",

    "abstract": "ciRS-7 is an intensely studied, highly expressed and conserved circRNA. Essentially nothing is known about its biogenesis, including the location of its promoter. A prevailing assumption has been that ciRS-7 is an exceptional circRNA because it is transcribed from a locus lacking any mature linear RNA transcripts of the same sense. Our interest in the biogenesis of ciRS-7 led us to develop an algorithm to define its promoter. This approach predicted that the human ciRS-7 promoter coincides with that of the long non-coding RNA, LINC00632. We validated this prediction using multiple orthogonal experimental assays. We also used computational approaches and experimental validation to establish that ciRS-7 exonic sequence is embedded in linear transcripts that are flanked by cryptic exons in both human and mouse. Together, this experimental and computational evidence generate a new view of regulation in this locus: (a) ciRS-7 is like other circRNAs, as it is spliced into linear transcripts; (b) expression of ciRS-7 is primarily determined by the chromatin state of LINC00632 promoters; (c) transcription and splicing factors sufficient for ciRS-7 biogenesis are expressed in cells that lack detectable ciRS-7 expression. These findings have significant implications for the study of the regulation and function of ciRS-7, and the analytic framework we developed to jointly analyze RNA-seq and ChlP-seq data reveal the potential for genome-wide discovery of important biological regulation missed in current reference annotations.\\n\\nAuthor SummarycircRNAs were recently discovered to be a significant product of  host gene expression programs but little is known about their transcriptional regulation. Here, we have studied the expression of a well-known circRNA named ciRS-7. ciRS-7 has an unusual function for a circRNA; it is believed to be a miRNA sponge. Previously, ciRS-7 was thought to be transcribed from a locus lacking any mature linear isoforms, unlike all other circular RNAs known to be expressed in human cells. However, we have found this to be false; using a combination of bioinformatic and experimental genetic approaches, in both human and mouse, we discovered that linear transcripts containing the ciRS-7 exonic sequence, linking it to upstream genes. This suggests the potential for additional functional roles of this important locus and provides critical information to begin study on the biogenesis of ciRS-7.",

Here we use tDCS to test the role of the motor cortex and cerebellum in sensorimotor learning in speech. During productions of  head,  bed, and  dead, the first formant of the vowel sound was altered in real-time towards the first formant of the vowel sound in  had,  bad, and  dad. Compensatory changes in first and second formant production were used as a measure of motor adaptation. TDCS to either the motor cortex or the cerebellum improved sensorimotor learning in speech compared to sham stimulation. However, in the case of cerebellar tDCS, production changes were restricted to the source of the acoustical error (i.e. the first formant). Motor cortex tDCS drove production changes that offset errors in the first formant, but, unlike cerebellar tDCS, adaptive changes in the second formant also occurred. The results suggest that motor cortex and cerebellar tDCS have both shared and dissociable effects on motor adaptation. The study provides initial causal evidence in speech production that the motor cortex and the cerebellum support different aspects of sensorimotor learning. We propose that motor cortex tDCS drives sensorimotor learning towards previously learned patterns of movement, while cerebellar tDCS focuses sensorimotor learning on error correction.",

Here, we test this postulated dissociation between intact bottom-up and impaired top-down processing and evaluate its brain mechanisms using high-density recordings of event-related potentials. Sixteen patients with schizophrenia and sixteen controls were exposed to peripheral digits with various degrees of visibility, under conditions of either focused attention or distraction by another task. In the distraction condition, the brain activity evoked by masked digits was drastically reduced in both groups, but early bottom-up visual activation could still be detected and did not differ between patients and controls. By contrast, under focused top-down attention, a major impairment was observed: in patients, contrary to controls, the late non-linear ignition associated with the P3 component was reduced. Interestingly, the patients showed an essentially normal attentional amplification of the PI and N2 components. These results suggest that some but not all top-down attentional amplification processes are impaired in schizophrenia, while bottom-up processing seems to be preserved.",

Here, in our study of healthy human participants, we characterize two constraints on this learning process: the size of adaptive corrections is only related to error size when errors are smaller than 6{degrees}, and learning functions converge to a similar level of asymptotic learning over a wide range of error sizes. These findings are problematic for current models of sensorimotor adaptation, and point to a new theoretical perspective in which learning is constrained by the size of the error correction, rather than sensitivity to error.",

Recent work has shown that the remodeling acto-myosin network modifies local membrane organization, but the molecular details are only partly understood due to difficulties with experimentally accessing the relevant time and length scales. Here, we use interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy to investigate a minimal acto-myosin network linked to a supported lipid bilayer membrane. Using the magnitude of the interferometric contrast, which is proportional to molecular mass, and fast acquisition rates, we detect, and image individual membrane attached actin filaments diffusing within the acto-myosin network and follow individual myosin II filament dynamics. We quantify myosin II filament dwell times and processivity as a function of ATP concentration, providing evidence for the predicted ensemble behavior of myosin head domains. Our results show how decreasing ATP concentrations lead to both increasing dwell times of individual myosin II filaments and a global change from a remodeling to a contractile state of the acto-myosin network.\n\nStatement of SignificanceHere, we show that interferometric scattering microscopy in combination with single particle tracking enables label-free, high contrast imaging of filament dynamics on surfaces, while distinguishing different species based on their mass.

    "abstract": "Molecular motors play key roles in organizing the interior of cells. An efficient motor in cargo transport would travel with a high speed and a minimal error in transport time (or distance) while consuming minimal amount of energy. The travel distance and its variance of motor are, however, physically constrained by energy consumption, the principle of which has recently been formulated into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Here, we reinterpret the uncertainty measure ([Q]) defined in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation such that a motor efficient in cargo transport is characterized with a small [Q]. Analyses on the motility data from several types of molecular motors show that [Q] is a nonmonotic function of ATP concentration and load (f). For kinesin-1, [Q] is locally minimized at [ATP] {approx} 200 M and f {approx} 4 pN. Remarkably, for the mutant with a longer neck-linker this local minimum vanishes, and the energetic cost to achieve the same precision as the wild-type increases significantly, which underscores the importance of molecular structure in transport properties. For the biological motors studied here, their value of [Q] is semi-optimized under the cellular condition ([ATP] {approx} 1 mM, f = 0 - 1 pN). We find that among the motors, kinesin-1 at single molecule level is the most efficient in cargo transport.",

    "abstract": "Although macrophages are armed with potent anti-bacterial functions, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) replicates inside these innate immune cells. Determinants of macrophage-intrinsic bacterial control, and the Mtb strategies to overcome them are poorly understood. To further study these processes, we used a systematic affinity tag purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach to identify 187 Mtb-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving 34 secreted Mtb proteins. This interaction map revealed two new factors involved in Mtb pathogenesis - the secreted Mtb protein, LpqN, and its binding partner, the human ubiquitin ligase CBL. We discovered that an lpqN Mtb mutant is attenuated in macrophages, but growth is restored when CBL is removed. Conversely, Cbl-/- macrophages are resistant to viral infection, indicating that CBL regulates cell-intrinsic polarization between anti-bacterial and anti-viral immunity. Collectively, these findings illustrate the utility of this Mtb-human PPI map as a resource for developing a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between Mtb and its host.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuit-based guidance for optimizing patient screening, target selection and parameter tuning for deep brain stimulation (DBS) remains limited. To this end, we propose a functional brain connectome-based modeling approach that simulates network-spreading effects of stimulating different brain regions and quantifies rectification of abnormal network topology in silico. We validate these analyses by predicting nuclei in basal-ganglia circuits as top-ranked targets for 43 local patients with Parkinsons disease and 90 patients from public database. However, individual connectome-based predictions demonstrate that globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus (STN) constituted as the best choice for 21.1% and 19.5% of patients, respectively. Notably, the priority rank of STN significantly correlated with motor symptom severity in the local cohort. By introducing whole-brain network diffusion dynamics, these findings unfold a new dimension of brain connectomics and underscore the importance of neural network modeling for personalized DBS therapy, which warrants experimental investigation to validate its clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "The commercially available 10X Genomics protocol to generate droplet-based single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is enjoying growing popularity among researchers. Fundamental to the analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method offers most accuracy. Answering this question is complicated by the fact that 10X Genomics data lack cell labels that would allow a direct performance evaluation. Thus in this review, we focused on comparing clustering solutions of a dozen methods for three datasets on human peripheral mononuclear cells generated with the 10X Genomics technology. While clustering solutions appeared robust, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other. They also failed to replicate cell type assignment generated with supervised labeling approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all clustering methods tested clustered cells to a large degree according to the amount of genes coding for ribosomal protein genes in each cell.",

    "abstract": "How choices are made within noisy environments is a central question in the neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However, real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics of the environment, experimenters could control the rats accumulation timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing has revolutionized cell engineering and promises to open new doors in gene and cell therapies. Despite improvements in the CRISPR-editing molecular toolbox in cell lines and primary cells, identifying and purifying properly edited clones remains slow, laborious and low-yield. Here, we establish a new method that uses cell manipulation on a chip with Opto-Electronic Positioning (OEP) technology to enable clonal isolation and selection of edited cells. We focused on editing CXCR4 in primary human T cells, a gene that encodes a co-receptor for HIV entry. T cells hold significant potential for cell-based therapy, but the gene-editing efficiency and expansion potential of these cells is limited. We describe here a method to obviate these limitations. Briefly, after electroporation of cells with CXCR4-targeting Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), single T cells were isolated on a chip, where they proliferated over time into well-resolved colonies. Phenotypic consequences of genome editing could be rapidly assessed on-chip with cell-surface staining for CXCR4. Furthermore, independent of phenotype, individual colonies could be identified based on their specific genotype at the 5-10 cell stage. Each colony was split and sequentially exported for immediate on-target sequencing and validation, and further off-chip clonal expansion of the validated clones. We were able to assess single-clone editing efficiencies, including the rate of monoallelic and biallelic indels or precise nucleotide replacements. This new method will enable identification and selection of perfectly edited clones within 10 days from Cas9-RNP introduction in cells based on the phenotype and/or genotype.",

    "abstract": "Cells are able to sense and react to their physical environment by translating a mechanical cue into an intracellular biochemical signal that triggers biological and mechanical responses. This process, called mechanotransduction, controls essential cellular functions such as proliferation and migration. The cellular response to an external mechanical stimulation has been investigated with various static and dynamic systems, so far limited to global deformations or to local stimulation through discrete substrates. To apply local and dynamic mechanical constraints at the single cell scale through a continuous surface, we have developed and modelled magneto-active substrates made of magnetic micro-pillars embedded in an elastomer. Constrained and unconstrained substrates are analysed to map surface stress resulting from the magnetic actuation of the micro-pillars and the adherent cells. These substrates have a rigidity in the range of cell matrices, and the magnetic micro-pillars generate local forces in the range of cellular forces, both in traction and compression. As an application, we followed the protrusive activity of cells subjected to dynamic stimulations. Our magneto-active substrates thus represent a new tool to study mechanotransduction in single cells, and complement existing techniques by exerting a local and dynamic stimulation, traction and compression, through a continuous soft substrate.",

Two mechanisms control their lifetimes: the ILF (IntraLumenal Fragment) and vReD (Vacuole REcycling and Degradation) pathways. But it is not clear if they function independently. Using S. cerevisiae as a model, here we show that the ILF pathway mediates constitutive turnover of the lysine transporter Ypq1 and zinc transporter Cot1--known vReD client proteins--in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, the vReD pathway mediates constitutive degradation of the amino acid transporter Vba4. Activation of TOR with cycloheximide enhances their degradation by these pathways. However, misfolding by heat stress shunts all three into the ILF pathway. Thus, both pathways control individual transporter lifetimes, although only the ILF pathway mediates protein quality control.

    "abstract": "Cardiac myocytes (CMs) obtained by differentiating embryonic stem cells (ES-CMs) have an immature phenotype and promoting the maturation of such PSC-derived cardiomyocytes remains a major limitation in the development of stem cell models of human cardiovascular disease. We cultured murine ES-CMs in a collagen gel (3D) at a low density, or on collagen-coated polystyrene (2D) and found that 3D culture results in dramatic improvement of the maturation rate and end-state gene expression of ES-CMs. There are two main differences between CMs cultured in 3D versus 2D; in 3D the mechanical stiffness of the environment is lower, enabling auxotonic instead of isometric contraction; and, in 3D the amount of cell-cell interaction is higher. To isolate the contributions, we first cultured ES-CMs on gels (2D substrates) that are softer than tissue culture plastic, enabling auxotonic contraction, while controlling for dimensionality and cell interaction. This indeed promoted a mature gene expression profile, while also enabling the maintenance of sarcomeres. Next, we determined that increased cell-cell interaction inhibits the mature gene expression of ES-CMs. Thus, auxotonic contraction is the likely mechanism for improved gene expression in sub-confluent 3D culture. However, 2D auxotonic contraction may offer a suitable compromise between obtaining enhanced gene expression and morphology. After 6 weeks of culture on gels, via Di-8-ANEPPs and WGA staining we also detected CMs forming a t-tubule network. Collectively these results demonstrate that 3D and 2D cultures that enable auxotonic contraction enhance aspects of the maturation of ES-CMs.",

Understanding the onset of such behavior in early prebiotic world is essential for solving the problem of origins of life. To elucidate this transition, we study a theoretical model of information-storing heteropolymers capable of template-assisted ligation and subjected to cyclic non-equilibrium driving forces. We discover that this simple physical system undergoes a spontaneous reduction of the information entropy due to the competition of chains for constituent monomers. This natural-selection-like process ultimately results in the survival of a limited subset of polymer sequences. Importantly, the number of surviving sequences remains exponentially large, thus opening up the possibility of further increase in complexity due to Darwinian evolution. We also propose potential experimental implementations of our model using either biopolymers or artificial nano-structures.",

In addition, we measured the distance that 5 axons had grown down the nerve and the longest distance a single axon reached. Results showed a considerable amount of differential axonal growth across all 9 BXD strains. There was a significant difference (P=0.014 Mann-Whitney U test) in the regenerative capacity in the number of axons reaching 0.5 mm from a low of 1487.6 {+/-} 264.9 axons in BXD102 to a high of 4175.8 {+/-} 648.6 axons in BXD29. There were also significant differences (P=0.014 Mann-Whitney U test) in the distance axons traveled, looking at a minimum of 5 axons with the shortest distance was 787.2 {+/-} 46.5{micro}m in BXD102 to a maximum distance of 2025.5 {+/-} 223.3{micro}m in BXD29. These results reveal that genetic background can modulate axonal regeneration and that the BXD strains are a particularly well-suited model system.",

Here we report the effect of ethylene on secondary cell wall formation and the molecular connection between ethylene signaling and wood formation.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied exogenous ethylene or its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to wild type and ethylene insensitive hybrid aspen trees (Populus tremula x tremuloides) and studied secondary cell wall anatomy, chemistry and ultrastructure. We furthermore analyzed the transcriptome (RNA Seq) after ACC application to wild type and ethylene insensitive trees.\\n\\nKey resultsWe demonstrate that ACC and ethylene induce gelatinous-layers (G-layers) and alter the fiber cell wall cellulose microfibril angle. G-layers are tertiary wall layers rich in cellulose, typically found in tension wood of aspen trees.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveNovel therapeutic applications for neural implants require miniaturized devices. Pilot clinical studies suggest that rapid failure of the miniaturized neural implants in the body presents a major challenge for this type of technology. Miniaturization imposes stricter requirements for reliability of materials and designs. Evaluation of neural implant performance over clinically relevant timescales presents time-and cost-prohibitive challenges for animal models.\\n\\nApproachIn vitro reactive accelerated aging (RAA) was developed to expedite durability testing of these devices. RAA simulates an aggressive physiological environment associated with an immune response and implicated in device failure. It uses hydrogen peroxide, which mimics reactive oxygen species (ROS), and high temperature to accelerate chemical reactions that lead to device degradation. RAA accurately simulates the degradation pattern of neural implants observed in vivo, but requires daily maintenance and is prone to variability in performance.\\n\\nMain resultsThis work introduces automated reactive accelerated aging (aRAA) that is compatible with multiplexing. The core of aRAA is electrochemical detection for feedback control of hydrogen peroxide concentration, implemented with simple off-the shelf components.\\n\\nSignificanceaRAA allows multiple parallel experiments for a high-throughput optimization of reactive aging conditions to more quickly and more rigorously simulate the in vivo environment. aRAA is a cost-effective tool for rapid in vitro evaluation of durability of neural implants, ultimately expediting the development of a new generation of miniaturized devices with long functional lifespans.",

To accomplish this, an original volume is temporally split into odd and even slices, and then voxel intensities are spatially and temporally interpolated in the process of image registration.

However, ambiguous metabolite identifications are a common challenge and biochemical interpretation is often limited by incomplete and inaccurate genome-based predictions of enzyme activities (i.e. gene annotations). Metabolite, Annotation, and Gene Integration (MAGI) generates a metabolite-gene association score using a biochemical reaction network. This is calculated by a method that emphasizes consensus between metabolites and genes via biochemical reactions. To demonstrate the potential of this method, we applied MAGI to integrate sequence data and metabolomics data collected from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), an extensively characterized bacterium that produces diverse secondary metabolites. Our findings suggest that coupling metabolomics and genomics data by scoring consensus between the two increases the quality of both metabolite identifications and gene annotations in this organism. MAGI also made biochemical predictions for poorly annotated genes that were consistent with the extensive literature on this important organism. This limited analysis suggests that using metabolomics data has the potential to improve annotations in sequenced organisms and also provides testable hypotheses for specific biochemical functions.

Assuming a linear model linking the markers to the outcome, this article proposes an estimator of the heritability of the trait, defined here as the fraction of the variance of the trait explained by the genomic markers in the study. The estimator, called GWAS heritability (GWASH) estimator, is easy to compute, highly interpretable, and is consistent as the number of markers and the sample size increase. More importantly, it can be computed from summary statistics typically reported in GWAS, not requiring access to the original data. The estimator takes full account of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) or correlation between the SNPs in the study through moments of the LD matrix, estimable from auxiliary datasets. Unlike other proposed estimators in the literature, the precision of the estimate is obtainable analytically, allowing for power and sample size calculations for heritability estimates.",

    "abstract": "Translation initiation is the rate limiting step of protein synthesis that is downregulated during Integrated Stress Response (ISR). In our previous work (Andreev, OConnor et al 2015), we demonstrated that most human mRNAs resistant to this inhibition possess translated uORFs and in some cases a single uORF is sufficient for the resistance. Here we developed a computational model of Initiation Complexes Interference with Elongating Ribosomes (ICIER) to gain insight into the mechanism. We explored the relationship between the flux of scanning ribosomes upstream and downstream of a single uORF depending on uORF features. Paradoxically our analysis predicts that reducing ribosome flux upstream of certain uORFs increases initiation downstream. The model reveals derepression of downstream translation as general mechanism of uORF-mediated stress resistance. It predicts that stress resistance can be achieved with long or slowly translated uORFs that do not favor high levels of translation re-initiation and start with non-leaky initiators.",

Accurately predicting mortality risk from chemotherapy is important, but few patient data-driven tools exist. We sought to create and validate a machine learning model predicting mortality for patients starting new chemotherapy.\\n\\nMethodsWe obtained electronic health records for patients treated at a large cancer center (26,946 patients; 51,774 new regimens) over 2004-14, linked to Social Security data for date of death. The model was derived using 2004-11 data, and performance measured on non-overlapping 2012-14 data.\\n\\nFindings30-day mortality from chemotherapy start was 2.1%. Common cancers included breast (21.1%), colorectal (19.3%), and lung (18.0%). Model predictions were accurate for all patients (AUC 0.94). Predictions for patients starting palliative chemotherapy (46.6% of regimens), for whom prognosis is particularly important, remained highly accurate (AUC 0.92). To illustrate model discrimination, we ranked patients initiating palliative chemotherapy by model-predicted mortality risk, and calculated observed mortality by risk decile. 30-day mortality in the highest-risk decile was 22.6%; in the lowest-risk decile, no patients died. Predictions remained accurate across all primary cancers, stages, and chemotherapies--even for clinical trial regimens that first appeared in years after the model was trained (AUC 0.94). The model also performed well for prediction of 180-day mortality (AUC 0.87; mortality 74.8% in the highest risk decile vs. 0.2% in the lowest). Predictions were more accurate than data from randomized trials of individual chemotherapies, or SEER estimates.\\n\\nInterpretationA machine learning algorithm accurately predicted short-term mortality in patients starting chemotherapy using EHR data.

In contrast to previous studies based on mRNA expression or protein abundance, we found that a set of TFs binding to only around ten distinct motifs display strong DNA-binding activity in any given cell or tissue type. Mass spectrometric identification of TFs revealed that within these highly active TFs, there were both housekeeping TFs, which were universally found in all cell types, and specific TFs, which were highly enriched in known factors that determine the fate of the analyzed tissue or cell type.

In zebrafish, DNA methylation (DNAme) patterns are programmed in transcriptionally-quiescent cleavage embryos; remarkably, paternally-inherited patterns are maintained, whereas maternal patterns are reprogrammed to match the paternal. Here we provide the mechanism, by demonstrating that  Placeholder nucleosomes, containing histone H2A variant H2A.Z(FV) and H3K4me1, occupy virtually all regions lacking DNAme in both sperm and cleavage embryos, and resides at promoters encoding housekeeping and early embryonic transcription factors. Upon genome-wide transcriptional onset, genes with Placeholder become either active (H3K4me3) or silent (H3K4me3/K27me3). Importantly, functional perturbation causing Placeholder loss confers DNAme accumulation, whereas acquisition/expansion of Placeholder confers DNA hypomethylation and improper gene activation. Thus, during transcriptionally-quiescent gametic and embryonic stages, an H2A.Z(FV)/H3K4me1-containing Placeholder nucleosome deters DNAme, poising parental genes for either gene-specific activation or facultative repression.\\n\\nHighlights: four, 85 characters eachO_LIPlaceholder nucleosomes bear H3K4me and the histone variant H2A.Z(FV)\\nC_LIO_LIPlaceholders occupy all DNA hypomethylated loci in zebrafish sperm and early embryos\\nC_LIO_LIAt ZGA, Placeholders resolve into either active or poised (bivalent) nucleosomes\\nC_LIO_LIPlaceholder localization excludes DNAme, and regulates embryonic transcription\\nC_LI",

Particularly extreme is the hybrid dysgenesis syndrome caused by P-element DNA transposons, in which dysgenic female ovaries often contain few or no germline cells. Those offspring that are produced from dysgenic germlines exhibit high rates of de novo mutation and recombination, implicating transposition-associated DNA damage as the cause of germline loss. However, how this loss occurs, in terms of the particular cellular response that is triggered (cell cycle arrest, senescence, or cell death) remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that two components of the DNA damage response, Checkpoint kinase 2 and its downstream target p53, are determine the frequency of ovarian atrophy that is associated with P-element hybrid dysgenesis. We further show that p53 is strongly induced in the germline stem cells (GSCs) of dysgenic females, and is required for their maintenance. Our observations support the critical role for p53 in conferring tolerance of transposable element activity in stem cells.",

    "abstract": "Biological interpretation of GWAS data frequently involves analyzing unsigned genomic annotations comprising SNPs involved in a biological process and assessing enrichment for disease signal. However, it is often possible to generate signed annotations quantifying whether each SNP allele promotes or hinders a biological process, e.g., binding of a transcription factor (TF). Directional effects of such annotations on disease risk enable stronger statements about causal mechanisms of disease than enrichments of corresponding unsigned annotations. Here we introduce a new method, signed LD profile regression, for detecting such directional effects using GWAS summary statistics, and we apply the method using 382 signed annotations reflecting predicted TF binding. We show via theory and simulations that our method is well-powered and is well-calibrated even when TF binding sites co-localize with other enriched regulatory elements, which can confound unsigned enrichment methods. We further validate our method by showing that it recovers known transcriptional regulators when applied to molecular QTL in blood. We then apply our method to eQTL in 48 GTEx tissues, identifying 651 distinct TF-tissue expression associations at per-tissue FDR < 5%, including 30 associations with robust evidence of tissue specificity. Finally, we apply our method to 46 diseases and complex traits (average N = 289,617) and identify 77 annotation-trait associations at per-trait FDR < 5% representing 12 independent TF-trait associations, and we conduct gene-set enrichment analyses to characterize the underlying transcriptional programs. Our results implicate new causal disease genes (including causal genes at known GWAS loci), and in some cases suggest a detailed mechanism for a causal genes effect on disease. Our method provides a new way to leverage functional data to draw inferences about disease etiology.",

    "abstract": "Emerging pathogens are a major threat to public health, however understanding how pathogens adapt to new niches remains a challenge. New methods are urgently required to provide functional insights into pathogens from the massive genomic data sets now being generated from routine pathogen surveillance for epidemiological purposes. Here, we measure the burden of atypical mutations in protein coding genes across independently evolved Salmonella enterica lineages, and use these as input to train a random forest classifier to identify strains associated with extraintestinal disease. Members of the species fall along a continuum, from pathovars which cause gastrointestinal infection and low mortality, associated with a broad host-range, to those that cause invasive infection and high mortality, associated with a narrowed host range. Our random forest classifier learned to perfectly discriminate long-established gastrointestinal and invasive serovars of Salmonella. Additionally, it was able to discriminate recently emerged Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium lineages associated with invasive disease in immunocompromised populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and within-host adaptation to invasive infection. We dissect the architecture of the model to identify the genes that were most informative of phenotype, revealing a common theme of degradation of metabolic pathways in extraintestinal lineages. This approach accurately identifies patterns of gene degradation and diversifying selection specific to invasive serovars that have been captured by more labour-intensive investigations, but can be readily scaled to larger analyses.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous patterns of genomic differentiation are commonly documented between closely related populations and there is considerable interest in identifying factors that contribute to their formation. These factors could include genomic features (e.g., areas of low recombination) that promote processes like linked selection (positive or purifying selection that affects linked neutral sites) at specific genomic regions. Examinations of repeatable patterns of differentiation across population pairs can provide insight into the role of these factors. Birds are well suited for this work, as genome structure is conserved across this group. Accordingly, we re-estimated relative (FST) and absolute (dXY) differentiation between eight sister pairs of birds that span a broad taxonomic range using a common pipeline. Across pairs, there were modest but significant correlations in window-based estimates of differentiation (up to 3% of variation explained for FST and 26% for dXY), supporting a role for processes at conserved genomic features in generating heterogeneous patterns of differentiation. This suggestion was reinforced by linear models identifying several genomic features (e.g., gene densities) as significant predictors of FST and dXY repeatability. FST repeatability was higher among pairs that were further along the speciation continuum (i.e., more reproductively isolated), suggesting that early stages of speciation may be dominated by positive selection that is different between pairs and replaced by processes acting according to shared genomic features as speciation proceeds.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe clinical sequencing of cancer genomes to personalize therapy is becoming routine across the world. However, concerns over patient re-identification from these data lead to questions about how tightly access should be controlled. It is not thought to be possible to re-identify patients from somatic variant data. However, somatic variant detection pipelines can mistakenly identify germline variants as somatic ones, a process called \\\"germline leakage\\\". The rate of germline leakage across different somatic variant detection pipelines is not well-understood, and it is uncertain whether or not somatic variant calls should be considered re-identifiable. To fill this gap, we quantified germline leakage across 259 sets of whole-genome somatic single nucleotide variant (SNVs) predictions made by 21 teams as part of the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge.\\n\\nResultsThe median somatic SNV prediction set contained 4,325 somatic SNVs and leaked one germline polymorphism. The level of germline leakage was inversely correlated with somatic SNV prediction accuracy and positively correlated with the amount of infiltrating normal cells. The specific germline variants leaked differed by tumour and algorithm. To aid in quantitation and correction of leakage, we created a tool, called GermlineFilter, for use in public-facing somatic SNV databases.\\n\\nConclusionsThe potential for patient re-identification from leaked germline variants in somatic SNV predictions has led to divergent open data access policies, based on different assessments of the risks. Indeed, a single, well-publicized re-identification event could reshape public perceptions of the values of genomic data sharing. We find that modern somatic SNV prediction pipelines have low germline-leakage rates, which can be further reduced, especially for cloud-sharing, using pre-filtering software.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion has recently emerged as an active player in a myriad of cellular processes. Additionally, it was recently shown that more than 200 diseases are known to be linked to variants in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes interacting with mitochondria. This has reinvigorated interest in its biology and population genetics. Mitochondrial heteroplasmy, or genotypic variation of mitochondria within an individual, is now understood to be common in humans and important in human health. However, it is still not possible to make quantitative predictions about the inheritance of heteroplasmy and its proliferation within the body, partly due to the lack of an appropriate model. Here, we present a population-genetic framework for modeling mitochondrial heteroplasmy as a process that occurs on an ontogenetic phylogeny, with genetic drift and mutation changing heteroplasmy frequencies during the various developmental processes represented in the phylogeny. Using this framework, we develop a Bayesian inference method for inferring rates of mitochondrial genetic drift and mutation at different stages of human life. Applying the method to previously published heteroplasmy frequency data, we demonstrate a severe effective germline bottleneck comprised of the cumulative genetic drift occurring between the divergence of germline and somatic cells in the mother and the separation of germ layers in the offspring. Additionally, we find that the two somatic tissues we analyze here undergo tissue-specific bottlenecks during embryogenesis, less severe than the effective germline bottleneck, and that these somatic tissues experience little additional genetic drift during adulthood. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of the ontogenetic phylogeny framework and its possible applications to other ontogenetic processes in addition to mitochondrial heteroplasmy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman neutrophils are central players in innate immunity, a major component of inflammatory responses, and a leading model for cell motility and chemotaxis. However, primary neutrophils are remarkably short-lived, limiting their experimental usefulness in the laboratory. Thus, human myeloid cell lines have been established and characterized for their ability to undergo neutrophil-like differentiation in vitro. The HL-60 cell line and its PLB-985 sub-line are commonly used as a model for human neutrophil behavior, but how closely gene expression in differentiated cells resembles that of primary neutrophils has remained unclear.\\n\\nResultsIn the present study, we compared the effectiveness of differentiation protocols and used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare the transcriptomes of HL-60 and PLB-985 cells with published data for human and mouse primary neutrophils. Among commonly used differentiation protocols for neutrophil like cell lines, addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) gave the best combination of cell viability and expression of markers for differentiation. However, combining DMSO with the serum-free-supplement Nutridoma resulted in an increased chemotactic response and cell surface expression of the neutrophil markers FPR1 and CD11b without a cost in viability. RNA-seq analysis of HL-60 and PLB-985 cells before and after differentiation showed that differentiation broadly increases the similarity in gene expression between the cell lines and primary neutrophils. Furthermore, the gene expression pattern of the differentiated cell lines correlated slightly better with that of human neutrophils than the mouse neutrophil pattern did. Finally, we created a publicly available gene expression database that is searchable by gene name and by protein domain content, where users can compare gene expression in HL-60, PLB-985 and primary human and mouse neutrophils.\\n\\nConclusionsOur study verifies that a DMSO-based differentiation protocol for HL-60 and PLB-985 cell lines gives superior differentiation and cell viability relative to other common protocols, and indicates that addition of Nutridoma may be preferable for studies of chemotaxis. Our neutrophil gene expression database will be a valuable tool to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between the cell lines and primary neutrophils, to compare expression levels for genes of interest, and to improve the design of tools for genetic perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity often enhances the tolerance of microbial communities against antimicrobial treatment. However the sociobiology underlying this antimicrobial tolerance remains largely unexplored. Here we analyze how inter-species interactions can increase antimicrobial tolerance. We apply our approach to 17 industrially-relevant multispecies biofilm models, based on species isolated from 58 contaminating biofilms in three breweries. Sulfathiazole is used as antimicrobial agent because it shows the highest activity out of 22 biofilm inhibitors tested. Our analysis reveals that competitive interactions dominate among species within brewery biofilms. We show that antimicrobial treatment can reduce the level of competition and therefore cause a subset of species to bloom. The result is a lower percentage inhibition of these species and increased tolerance. In addition, we show that the presence of competing species can also directly enhance the inherent tolerance of microbes to antimicrobial treatment, either because species protect each other or because they induce specific tolerance phenotypes as a response to competitors (i.e. competition sensing). Overall, our study emphasizes that the dominance of competitive interactions is central to the enhanced antimicrobial tolerance of the multispecies biofilms and that the activity of antimicrobials against multispecies biofilms cannot be predicted based on their effect against mono-cultures.",

These functions intersect in the basal ganglia (BG), which has at least two targets of plasticity: a dopaminergic modulation of striatal pathways and cortical modulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Dual learning mechanisms suggests that feedback signals have a multifaceted impact on BG-dependent decisions. Using a hybrid of accumulation-to-bound decision models and reinforcement learning, we modeled the performance of humans in a stop-signal task where participants (N=75) learned the prior distribution of the timing of a stop signal through trial-and-error feedback. Changes in the drift-rate of the action execution process were driven by errors in action timing, whereas adaptation in the boundary height served to increase caution following failed stops. These findings highlight two interactive learning mechanisms for adapting the control of goal-directed actions based on dissociable dimensions of feedback error.",

    "abstract": "Adequate protein intake is crucial for animals. Despite the recent progress in understanding protein hunger and satiety in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, how fruit flies assess prospective dietary protein sources and ensure protein consumption remains elusive. We show here that three specific amino acids, L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-alanine (L-Ala), and L-aspartate (L-Asp), rapidly promote food consumption in fruit flies when present in food. The effect of dietary amino acids to promote food consumption is independent of mating experience and internal nutritional status. Genetic analysis identifies six brain neurons expressing diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) as a sensor of dietary amino acids. DH44+ neurons can be directly activated by these three amino acids, and are both necessary and sufficient for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. By conducting single cell RNAseq analysis, we also identify an amino acid transporter, CG13248, which is highly expressed in DH44+ neurons and is required for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. Therefore, these data suggest that dietary amino acids may enter DH44+ neurons via CG13248 and modulate their activity and hence food consumption. Taken together, these data identify an internal amino acid sensor in the fly brain that evaluate food sources post-ingestively and facilitates adequate protein intake.",

We found clearly distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. The molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia shifted after postnatal day 5, and was then maintained through postnatal and adult stages. A similar shift was observed for granule cells at P20. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages.

    "abstract": "Understanding how neuronal signals propagate in local network is an important step in understanding information processing. As a result, spike trains recorded with Multi-electrode Arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study behaviors of neural connections. Studying the dynamics of neuronal networks requires the identification of both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The detection of excitatory relationships can robustly be inferred by characterizing the statistical relationships of neural spike trains. However, the identification of inhibitory relationships is more difficult: distinguishing endogenous low firing rates from active inhibition is not obvious. In this paper, we propose an in silico interventional procedure that makes predictions about the effect of stimulating or inhibiting single neurons on other neurons, and thereby gives the ability to accurately identify inhibitory causal relationships. To experimentally test these predictions, we have developed a Neural Circuit Probe (NCP) that delivers drugs transiently and reversibly on individually identified neurons to assess their contributions to the neural circuit behavior. With the help of NCP, three inhibitory connections identified by our in silico modeling were validated through real interventional experiments. Together, these methods provide a basis for mapping complete neural circuits.",

Zebrafish has recently gained wide attention as a behavioral model to study the neurobehavioral effects of acute and chronic alcohol use, including withdrawal. The literature, however, is very contradictory on findings regarding withdrawal effects, with some studies reporting increased anxiety, while others report no effect. A meta-analytic approach was taken to find the sources of this heterogeneity, and ethanol concentration during exposure and exposure duration were found to be the main sources of variation. A conceptual replication was also made using continuous exposure for 16 days in waterborne ethanol (0.5%) and assessing anxiety-like behavior in the light/dark test after 60 min withdrawal. Withdrawal was shown to reduce preference for darkness, consistent with decreased anxiety, but to increase risk assessment, consistent with increased anxiety. Animals were also subjected to the withdrawal protocol and injected with pilocarpine in a sub-convulsive dose to assess susceptibility to epileptic seizure-like behavior. The protocol was sufficient to increase susceptibility to epileptic seizure-like behavior in animals exposed to ethanol. Finally, withdrawal also decreased catalase activity in the brain, but not in the head kidney, suggesting mechanisms associated with the behavioral effects of ethanol withdrawal.",

In the present work, photosynthetic and biochemical traits were investigated in four rice genotypes under two NaCl (0 and 150 mM) concentration to assess the stomatal, mesophyll and biochemical contributions to reduced photosynthetic rate (A) in salt stressed leaves. Our results indicated that salinity led to a decrease in A, leaf osmotic potential, electron transport rate and CO2 concentrations in the chloroplasts (Cc) of rice leaves. Decreased A in salt-stressed leaves was mainly attributable to low Cc, which was determined by stomatal and mesophyll conductance. The increased stomatal limitation was mainly related to the low leaf osmotic potential caused by soil salinity. However, the increased mesophyll limitation in salt stressed leaves was related to both osmotic stress and ion stress. These findings highlight the importance of considering mesophyll conductance when developing salinity-tolerant rice cultivars.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Plant phenotyping has continued to pose a challenge to computer vision for many years. There is a particular demand to accurately quantify images of crops, and the natural variability and structure of these plants presents unique difficulties. Recently, machine learning approaches have shown impressive results in many areas of computer vision, but these rely on large datasets that are at present not available for crops. We present a new dataset, called ACID, that provides hundreds of accurately annotated images of wheat spikes and spikelets, along with image level class annotation. We then present a deep learning approach capable of accurately localising wheat spikes and spikelets, despite the varied nature of this dataset. As well as locating features, our network offers near perfect counting accuracy for spikes (95.91%) and spikelets (99.66%). We also extend the network to perform simultaneous classification of images, demonstrating the power of multi-task deep architectures for plant phenotyping. We hope that our dataset will be useful to researchers in continued improvement of plant and crop phenotyping. With this in mind, alongside the dataset we will make all code and trained models available online.",

Several synthetic genetic circuits for control of multicellular patterning have been reported to date. However, hierarchical induction of gene expression domains has received little attention from synthetic biologists, despite its importance in biological self-organization. We report the first synthetic genetic system implementing population-based AND logic for programmed autonomous induction of bacterial gene expression domains. We develop a ratiometric assay for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase activity and use it to systematically characterize different intact and split enzyme variants. We then utilize the best-performing variant to build a three-color patterning system responsive to two different homoserine lactones. We validate the AND gate-like behavior of this system both in cell suspension and in surface culture. Finally, we use the synthetic circuit in a membrane-based spatial assay to demonstrate programmed hierarchical patterning of gene expression across bacterial populations.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

A particular challenge is the acquisition of opposing states by two copies of the same gene, as it is the case in mammals for Xist at the onset of random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). The regulatory principles that lead to stable mono-allelic expression of Xist remain unknown. Here, we uncovered the minimal Xist regulatory network, by combining mathematical modeling and experimental validation of central model predictions. We identified a symmetric toggle switch as the basis for random mono-allelic Xist up-regulation, which reproduces data from several mutant, aneuploid and polyploid murine cell lines with various Xist expression patterns. Moreover, this toggle switch explains the diversity of strategies employed by different species at the onset of XCI. In addition to providing a unifying conceptual framework to explore X-chromosome inactivation across mammals, our study sets the stage for identifying the molecular mechanisms required to initiate random XCI.",

    "abstract": "Sexual dimorphism has been reported in the prevalence, onset and progression of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesize that immunological signaling in the developing brain, notably the complement cascade underlying microglial synaptic pruning, could be one mechanism for this dimorphism. Here we show that genes differentially expressed between male and female normal cortical development are enriched for pathways associated with the activation of the innate immune system, complement cascade and phagocytic processes. Specifically, the male brain is enriched for the expression of genes associated with phagocytic function of microglia through complement-dependent synaptic pruning especially at the developmental stages before birth. Our results suggest the existence of a common regulatory module involved in both prenatal immune activation in males and postnatal immune activation in females. The activation of immune pruning pathways at different stages of normal male and female development could provide valuable insights about critical periods of plasticity and refinement in the human cortex that could explain the different vulnerabilities of males and females to neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Neurons use sequences of action potentials (spikes) to convey information across neuronal networks. In neurophysiology experiments, information about external stimuli or behavioral tasks has been frequently characterized in term of neuronal firing rate. The firing rate is conventionally estimated by averaging spiking responses across multiple similar experiments (or trials). However, there exist a number of applications in neuroscience research that require firing rate to be estimated on a single trial basis. Estimating firing rate from a single trial is a challenging problem and current state-of-the-art methods do not perform well. To address this issue, we develop a new method for estimating firing rate based on kernel smoothing technique that considers the bandwidth as a random variable with prior distribution that is adaptively updated under a Bayesian framework. By carefully selecting the prior distribution together with Gaussian kernel function, an analytical expression can be achieved for the kernel bandwidth. We refer to the proposed method as Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother (BAKS). We evaluate the performance of BAKS using synthetic spike train data generated by biologically plausible models: inhomogeneous Gamma (IG) and inhomogeneous inverse Gaussian (IIG). We also apply BAKS to real spike train data from non-human primate (NHP) motor and visual cortex. We benchmark the proposed method against the established and previously reported methods. These include: optimized kernel smoother (OKS), variable kernel smoother (VKS), local polynomial fit (Locfit), and Bayesian adaptive regression splines (BARS). Results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to competing methods. This suggests that the proposed method could be useful for understanding the encoding mechanism of neurons in cognitive-related tasks. The proposed method could also potentially improve the performance of brain-machine interface (BMI) decoder that relies on estimated firing rate as the input.",

    "abstract": "HighlightWe show that the recently suggested third pathway for SA biosynthesis from mandelonitrile in peach is also functional under both abiotic and biotic stress conditions.\\n\\nAbstractSalicylic acid (SA) plays a central role in plant responses to environmental stresses via the SA-mediated regulation of many metabolic and molecular processes. In a recent study, we suggested a third pathway for SA biosynthesis from mandelonitrile (MD) in peach plants. This pathway is alternative to the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathway and links SA biosynthesis and cyanogenesis. In the present work, we show that this new SA biosynthetic pathway is also functional under abiotic (salt) and biotic (Plum pox virus infection) stress conditions, although the contribution of this pathway to the SA pool does not seem to be important under such conditions. Treating peach plants with MD not only affected the SA content, but it also had a pleiotropic effect on abscisic acid and jasmonic acid levels, two well-known stress related hormones, as well as on the H2O2-related antioxidant activities. Furthermore, MD improved plant performance under the stressful conditions, probably via the activation of different signaling pathways. We have thus proven that SA is not limited to biotic stress responses, but that it also plays a role in the response to abiotic stress in peach, although the physiological functions of this new SA biosynthetic pathway from MD remain to be elucidated.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the gene Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) C677T (or rs1801133) is the most established genetic factor that increases plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and consequently results in hyperhomocysteinemia. Yet given the limited penetrance of this genetic variant, it is necessary to individually predict the risk of hyperhomocysteinemia for a rs1801133 carrier.\\n\\nObjectiveWe hypothesized that variability of this genetic risk is largely due to the presence of factors (covariates) that serve as effect modifiers and/or confounders, such as folic acid (FA) intake, and aimed to assess this risk in the complex context of these covariates.\\n\\nDesignWe systematically extracted from published studies the data of tHcy, rs1801133, and any previously reported rs1801133 covariates. The resulting meta-dataset was first used to analyze the covariates modifying effect by meta regression and other statistical means. Subsequently, we stratified tHcy data by the rs1801133 genotypes and analyzed under each genotype the variability of the risk resulted from the covariates confounding.\\n\\nResultsThe dataset contains data of 36 rs1801133 covariates that were collected from 114,448 subjects and 249 qualified studies, among which 6 covariates (sex, age, race, FA intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption) are the most frequently informed and therefore included for statistical analysis. The effect of rs1801133 on tHcy exhibits significant variability that can be attributed to effect modification and, to a larger degree, confounding by these covariates. Via statistical modeling, we predicted the covariate-dependent risk of tHcy elevation and hyperhomocysteinemia in a systematic manner.\\n\\nConclusionswe demonstrated an evidence-based approach that globally assesses the covariate-dependent effect of rs1801133 on tHcy. The results should assist clinicians in interpreting the rs1801133 data from genetic testing for their patients. Such information is also important for the public that increasingly receives genetic data from commercial services without interpretation of its clinical relevance.",

One mode of cellular signaling is via bioelectrical properties determined by the activity of ion channels. Several studies have shown a role for bioelectric signaling in planarian regeneration, but these have focused on D. japonica and S. mediterranea. It is not known how the alterations of ion channel activity would affect regeneration in other species of planaria. Here, we tested the effect of ivermectin (IVM), a chloride channel opener drug commonly used to combat heart worms, on regeneration in a new species of planaria: D. dorotocephala. Exposure to IVM during regeneration resulted in patterning abnormalities, such as bifurcated tails with partial heads, as well as delayed regeneration. By testing the effect of drugs that target resting potential on regenerative repair in novel model species, additional insight is gained on the comparative roles of ionic signaling across taxa.",
