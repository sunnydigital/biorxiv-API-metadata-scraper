    "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen and a causative agent of culture-negative endocarditis. While C. burnetii initially infects alveolar macrophages, it has also been found in lipid droplet (LD)-containing foamy macrophages in the cardiac valves of endocarditis patients. In addition, transcriptional studies of C. burnetii-infected macrophages reported differential regulation of the LD coat protein-encoding gene perilipin 2 (plin-2). To further investigate the relationship between LDs and C. burnetii, we compared LD numbers using fluorescence microscopy in mock-infected and C. burnetii-infected alveolar macrophages. On average, C. burnetii-infected macrophages contained twice as many LDs as mock-infected macrophages. LD numbers increased as early as 24 hours post-infection, an effect reversed by blocking C. burnetii protein synthesis. The observed LD accumulation was dependent on the C. burnetii Type 4B Secretion System (T4BSS), a major virulence factor that manipulates host cellular processes by secreting bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. To determine the importance of LDs during C. burnetii infection, we manipulated LD homeostasis and assessed C. burnetii intracellular growth. Surprisingly, blocking LD formation with the pharmacological inhibitors triacsin C or T863, or knocking out acyl-CoA transferase-1 (acat-1) in alveolar macrophages, increased C. burnetii growth at least 2-fold. Conversely, preventing LD lipolysis by inhibiting adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) with atglistatin almost completely blocked bacterial growth, suggesting LD breakdown is essential for C. burnetii. Together these data suggest that maintenance of LD homeostasis, possibly via the C. burnetii T4BSS, is critical for bacterial growth.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEHost neutral lipid storage organelles known as lipid droplets (LDs) serve as a source of energy, nutrients, and signaling lipids. LDs are associated with infection of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Coxiella burnetii, a significant cause of culture-negative endocarditis. While C. burnetii was found in LD-rich foamy macrophages in endocarditis patients, little is known about the host LD-C. burnetii relationship. We demonstrated C. burnetii Type 4B Secretion System (T4BSS)-dependent LD accumulation in macrophages, suggesting a T4BSS-mediated regulation of host LD homeostasis. Further, manipulating LD homeostasis significantly affected bacterial growth, indicating LDs play an important role during C. burnetii infection. As C. burnetii endocarditis has a 19% mortality rate even in treated patients, exploring the LD-C. burnetii association might identify novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe accurate description of ancestry is essential to interpret and integrate human genomics data, and to ensure that advances in the field of genomics benefit individuals from all ancestral backgrounds. However, there are no established guidelines for the consistent, unambiguous and standardized description of ancestry. To fill this gap, we provide a framework, designed for the representation of ancestry in GWAS data, but with wider application to studies and resources involving human subjects.\\n\\nResultHere we describe our framework and its application to the representation of ancestry data in a widely-used publically available genomics resource, the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. We present the first analyses of GWAS data using our ancestry categories, demonstrating the validity of the framework to facilitate the tracking of ancestry in big data sets. We exhibit the broader relevance and integration potential of our method by its usage to describe the well-established HapMap and 1000 Genomes reference populations. Finally, to encourage adoption, we outline recommendations for authors to implement when describing samples.\\n\\nConclusionsWhile the known bias towards inclusion of European ancestry individuals in GWA studies persists, African and Hispanic or Latin American ancestry populations contribute a disproportionately high number of associations, suggesting that analyses including these groups may be more effective at identifying new associations. We believe the widespread adoption of our framework will increase standardization of ancestry data, thus enabling improved analysis, interpretation and integration of human genomics data and furthering our understanding of disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant advance in our understanding of the molecular basis of light entrainment of the circadian clock in Drosophila, the underlying genetic architecture is still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to identify loci associated with variation in circadian photosensitivity, which are important for the evolution of this trait. We have used complementary approaches that combined quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, complementation testing and transcriptome profiling to dissect this variation.\\n\\nWe identified a major QTL on chromosome 2, which was subsequently fine-mapped using deficiency complementation mapping into two smaller regions spanning 139 genes, some of which are known to be involved in functions which have been previously implicated in light entrainment. Two genes implicated with the clock and located within that interval, timeless and cycle, failed to complement the QTL, indicating that alleles of these genes contribute to the variation in light response. Specifically, we find that the timeless s/ls polymorphism that has been previously shown to constitute a latitudinal cline in Europe, is also segregating in our recombinant inbred lines, and is contributing to the phenotypic variation in light sensitivity.\\n\\nWe have also profiled gene expression in two recombinant inbred strains that differ significantly in their photosensitivity, and identified a total of 368 transcripts that showed differential expression (FDR < 0.1). Out of 131 transcripts that showed a significant RIL by treatment interaction (i.e. putative expression QTL), four are located within QTL2",

    "abstract": "The influenza A virus genome consists of eight segments of single-stranded RNA. These segments are replicated and transcribed by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is made up of the influenza virus proteins PB1, PB2 and PA. To copy the viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments and the complementary RNA (cRNA) segments, the replicative intermediate of viral replication, the RdRp must use two promoters and two different de novo initiation mechanisms. On the vRNA promoter, the RdRp initiates on the 3 terminus, while on the cRNA promoter the RdRp initiates internally and subsequently realigns the nascent vRNA product to ensure that the template is copied in full. In particular the latter process, which is also used by other RNA viruses, is not understood. Here we provide mechanistic insight into prime-realignment during influenza virus replication and show that it is controlled by the priming loop and a helix-loop-helix motif of the PB1 subunit of the RdRp. Overall, these observations advance our understanding of how the influenza A virus initiates viral replication and amplifies the genome correctly.\\n\\nImportanceInfluenza A viruses cause severe disease in humans and are considered a major threat to our economy and health. The viruses replicate and transcribe their genome using an enzyme called the RNA polymerases. To ensure that the genome is amplified faithfully and abundant viral mRNAs are made for viral protein synthesis, the RNA polymerase must work correctly. In this report, we provide insight into the mechanism that the RNA polymerase employs to ensure that the viral genome is copied correctly.",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100034). Despite being able to conclusively demonstrate local adaptation, we are still often unable to objectively determine the climatic drivers of local adaptation. Given the rapid rate of global change, understanding the climatic drivers of local adaptation is vital. Not only will this tell us which climate axes matter most to population fitness, but such knowledge is critical to inform management strategies such as translocation and targeted gene flow. While simple assessments of geographic trait variation are useful, geographic variation (and its associations with environment) may represent plastic, rather than evolved, differences. Additionally, the vast number of trait-environment combinations makes it difficult to determine which aspects of the environment populations adapt to. Here we argue that by incorporating a measure of landscape connectivity as a proxy for gene flow, we can differentiate between trait-environment relationships underpinned by genetic differences versus those that reflect phenotypic plasticity. By doing so, we can rapidly shorten the list of trait-environment combinations that may be of adaptive significance. We demonstrate how this reasoning can be applied using data on geographic trait variation in a lizard species from Australia's Wet Tropics rainforest. Our analysis reveals an overwhelming signal of local adaptation for the traits and environmental variables we investigated. Our analysis also allows us to rank environmental variables by the degree to which they appear to be driving local adaptation. Although encouraging, methodological issues remain: we point to these issue in the hope that the community can rapidly hone the methods we sketch here. The promise is a rapid and general approach to identifying the environmental drivers of local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Differential expression experiments or other analyses often end in a list of genes. Pathway enrichment analysis is one method to discern important biological signals and patterns from noisy expression data. However, pathway enrichment analysis may perform suboptimally in situations where there are multiple implicated pathways - such as in the case of genes that define subtypes of complex diseases. Our simulation study shows that in this setting, standard overrepresentation analysis identifies many false positive pathways along with the true positives. These false positives hamper investigators attempts to glean biological insights from enrichment analysis. We develop and evaluate an approach that combines community detection over functional networks with pathway enrichment to reduce false positives. Our simulation study demonstrates that a large reduction in false positives can be obtained with a small decrease in power. Though we hypothesized that multiple communities might underlie previously described subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and applied this approach, our results do not support this hypothesis. In summary, applying community detection before enrichment analysis may ease interpretation for complex gene sets that represent multiple distinct pathways.",

Here we present Mixed effects modeling of Associations of Single Cells (MASC), a novel reverse single cell association strategy for testing whether case-control status influences the membership of single cells in any of multiple cellular subsets while accounting for technical confounds and biological variation. Applying MASC to mass cytometry analyses of CD4+ T cells from blood of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and controls revealed a significantly expanded population of CD4+ T cells, identified as CD27- HLA-DR+ effector memory cells, in RA patients (OR = 1.7; p = 1.1 x 10-3). The frequency of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells was similarly elevated in blood samples from a second RA patient cohort, and CD27- HLA-DR+ cell frequency decreased in RA patients who respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Compared to peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples from RA patients contained [~]5-fold higher frequencies of CD27- HLA-DR+ cells, which comprised [~]10% of synovial CD4+ T cells. We find that CD27- HLA-DR+ cells are abundant producers of IFN-{gamma} and also express perforin and granzyme A at elevated levels. Thus MASC identified the expansion of a unique Th1 skewed effector T cell population with cytotoxic capacity in RA.

    "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has profiled over 10,000 tumors across 33 different cancer-types for many genomic features, including gene expression levels. Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumors response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach.

    "abstract": "Kinesin-based cargo transport in cells frequently involves the coordinated activity of multiple motors, including kinesins from different families that move at different speeds. However, compared to the progress at the single-molecule level, mechanisms by which multiple kinesins coordinate their activity during cargo transport are poorly understood. To understand these multi-motor coordination mechanisms, defined pairs of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motors were assembled on DNA scaffolds and their motility examined in vitro. Although less processive than kinesin-1 at the single-molecule level, addition of kinesin-2 motors more effectively amplified cargo run lengths. By applying the law of total expectation to cargo binding durations in ADP, the kinesin-2 microtubule reattachment rate was shown to be 4-fold faster than that of kinesin-1. This difference in microtubule binding rates was also observed in solution by stopped-flow. High-resolution tracking of gold-nanoparticle-labeled cargo with 1 ms and 2 nm precision revealed that kinesin-2 motors detach and rebind to the microtubule much more frequently than do kinesin-1. Finally, cargo transported by kinesin-2 motors more effectively navigated roadblocks on the microtubule track. These results highlight the importance of motor reattachment kinetics during multi-motor transport and suggest a coordinated transport model in which kinesin-1 motors step effectively against loads while kinesin-2 motors rapidly unbind and rebind to the microtubule. This dynamic tethering by kinesin-2 maintains the cargo near the microtubule and enables effective navigation along crowded microtubules.",

    "abstract": "The balance of fresh and saline water is essential to estuarine ecosystem function. Along the fresh-brackish-saline water gradient within the C-43 canal/Caloosahatchee River estuary (CRE) the quantity, timing and distribution of water and associated water quality significantly influences ecosystem function. Long-term trends of water quality and quantity were assessed from Lake Okeechobee to the CRE between May 1978 to April 2016. Significant changes to monthly flow volumes were detected between the lake and the estuary which correspond to changes in upstream management. and climatic events. Across the 37-year period total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean (FWM) concentration significantly increased at the lake, meanwhile total nitrogen (TN) FMW concentrations significantly declined at both the lake and estuary headwaters. Between May 1999 and April 2016, TN, TP and total organic carbon (TOC), ortho-P and ammonium conditions were assessed within the estuary at several monitoring locations. Generally nutrient concentrations decreased from upstream to downstream with shifts in TN:TP from values >20 in the freshwater portion, ~20 in the estuarine portion and <20 in the marine portion indicating a spatial shift in nutrient limitations along the continuum. Aquatic productivity analysis suggests that the estuary is net heterotrophic with productivity being negatively influenced by TP, TN and TOC likely due to a combination of effects including shading by high color dissolved organic matter. We conclude that rainfall patterns, land use and the resulting discharges of run-off drives the ecology of the C-43/CRE aquatic continuum and associated biogeochemistry rather than water management associated with Lake Okeechobee.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of research utilizing microphysiological systems (MPSs), the need for tools that enable the physiological mimicking of the relevant cellular environment is vital. The limited ability to reproduce crucial features of the microenvironment, such as surrounding fluid flow and dynamic changes in biochemical stimuli, severely limits the types of experiments that can be carried out. Current equipment to achieve this, such as syringe and peristaltic pumps, is expensive, large, difficult to program and has limited potential for scalability. Here, we present a new pumping platform that is open-source, low-cost, modular, scalable, fully-programmable and easy to assemble that can be incorporated into cell culture systems to better recapitulate physiological environments. By controlling two commercially available piezoelectric pumps using a Raspberry Pi Zero microcontroller, the system is capable of producing arbitrary dynamic flow profiles with reliable flow rates ranging from 1 to 3,000 {micro}L/min as specified by an easily programmable Python-based script. We validated the accuracy of the flow rates, the use of time-varying profiles, and the practicality of the system by creating repeatable dynamic concentration profiles using a 3D-printed static micromixer.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) is a helicase that facilitates assembly of the translation preinitiation complex by unwinding structured mRNA 5 untranslated regions. Pateamine A (PatA) and silvestrol are natural products that disrupt eIF4A function and arrest translation, thereby triggering the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates of stalled preinitiation complexes known as stress granules (SGs). Here we examined the effects of eIF4A inhibition by PatA and silvestrol on influenza A virus (IAV) protein synthesis and replication in cell culture. Treatment of infected cells with either PatA or silvestrol at early times post-infection results in SG formation, arrest of viral protein synthesis and failure to replicate the viral genome. PatA, which irreversibly binds to eIF4A, sustained long-term blockade of IAV replication following drug withdrawal, and inhibited IAV replication at concentrations that had minimal cytotoxicity. By contrast, the antiviral effects of silvestrol were fully reversible; drug withdrawal caused rapid SG dissolution and resumption of viral protein synthesis. IAV inhibition by silvestrol was invariably associated with cytotoxicity. PatA blocked replication of genetically divergent IAV strains, suggesting common dependence on host eIF4A activity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of targeting core host protein synthesis machinery to prevent viral replication.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEInfluenza A virus (IAV) relies on cellular protein synthesis to decode viral messenger RNAs. Pateamine A and silvestrol are natural products that inactivate an essential protein synthesis protein known as eIF4A. Here we show that IAV is sensitive to these eIF4A inhibitor drugs. Treatment of infected cells with pateamine A or silvestrol prevented synthesis of viral proteins, viral genome replication and release of infectious virions. The irreversible eIF4A inhibitor pateamine A sustained long-term blockade of viral replication, whereas viral protein synthesis quickly resumed after silvestrol was removed from infected cells. Prolonged incubation of either infected or uninfected cells with these drugs induced the programmed cell death cascade called apoptosis. Our findings suggest that core components of the host protein synthesis machinery are viable targets for antiviral drug discovery. The most promising drug candidates should selectively block protein synthesis in infected cells without perturbing bystander uninfected cells.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain are of immense clinical and research utility. At the atomic and subatomic levels, the sources of MR signals are well understood. However, at the macromolecular scale, we lack a comprehensive understanding of what determines MR signal contrast. To address this gap, we used genome-wide measurements to correlate gene expression with MR signal intensity across the cortex in the Allen Human Brain Atlas. We focused on the ratio of T1-weighted and T2-weighted intensities (T1-w/T2-w) which is considered to be a useful proxy for myelin content. Positive correlations between myelin-associated genes and the ratio supported its use as a myelin marker. However, stronger correlations were observed for neurofilaments, and genes linked to the production of formaldehyde (which cross-links protein to create larger molecules). There was also an association with protein mass, with genes coding for heavier proteins expressed in regions with high T1-w/T2-w values. Oligodendrocyte gene markers were strongly correlated but this was not driven by myelin-associated genes, suggesting this signal is from non-myelinating satellite oligodendrocytes. We find the strongest support for the previous finding of high aerobic glycolysis in regions with low T1-w/T2-w ratio. Specifically, many mitochondrial genes were negatively correlated with T1-w/T2-w ratio. Genes up-regulated by pH in the brain were also highly correlated with the ratio, suggesting the pH gradient in mitochondria may explain the aerobic glycolysis association. Expression of protease subunit genes was also inversely associated with the ratio, in agreement with the protein mass correlation. While we corroborate associations with myelin and synaptic plasticity, differences in the T1-w/T2-w ratio appear to be more attributable to molecule size, satellite oligodendrocyte proportion, mitochondrial number, alkalinity, and axon caliber. Using disease-associated gene lists, we observed an enrichment of negative T1-w/T2-w ratio correlations with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated genes. Expanding our analysis to the whole brain results in strong positive T1-w/T2-w associations for immune system, inflammatory disease, and microglial genes. In contrast, neuron markers and synaptic plasticity genes are negatively enriched. Lastly, our results vary little when our analysis is performed on T1-w or inverted T2-w intensities alone, possibly because the noise reduction properties of the ratio are not needed for postmortem brain scans. These results provide a molecular characterization of MR contrast that will aid interpretation of future MR studies of the brain.",

The extensive computational cost of such integration challenges planning methods that integrate online, at decision time. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether \\\"offline\\\" integration during replay supports planning, and if so which memories should be replayed. Inspired by machine learning, we propose that (a) offline replay of trajectories facilitates integrating representations that guide decisions, and (b) unsigned prediction errors (uncertainty) trigger such integrative replay. We designed a 2-step revaluation task for fMRI, whereby participants needed to integrate changes in rewards with past knowledge to optimally replan decisions. As predicted, we found that (a) multi-voxel pattern evidence for off-task replay predicts subsequent replanning; (b) neural sensitivity to uncertainty predicts subsequent replay and replanning; (c) off-task hippocampus and anterior cingulate activity increase when revaluation is required. These findings elucidate how the brain leverages offline mechanisms in planning and goal-directed behavior under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Despite major strides in the treatment of cancer, the development of drug resistance remains a major hurdle. One strategy which has been proposed to address this is the sequential application of drug therapies where resistance to one drug induces sensitivity to another drug, a concept called collateral sensitivity. The optimal timing of drug switching in these situations, however, remains unknown.\\n\\nTo study this, we developed a dynamical model of sequential therapy on heterogeneous tumors comprised of resistant and sensitive cells. A pair of drugs (DrugA, DrugB) are utilized and are periodically switched during therapy. Assuming resistant cells to one drug are collaterally sensitive to the opposing drug, we classified cancer cells into two groups, AR and BR, each of which is a subpopulation of cells resistant to the indicated drug and concurrently sensitive to the other, and we subsequently explored the resulting population dynamics.\\n\\nSpecifically, based on a system of ordinary differential equations for AR and BR, we determined that the optimal treatment strategy consists of two stages: an initial stage in which a chosen effective drug is utilized until a specific time point, T, and a second stage in which drugs are switched repeatedly, during which each drug is used for a relative duration (i.e. f{Delta}t-long for DrugA and (1 - f) {Delta}t-long for DrugB with 0 [&le;] f [&le;] 1 and {Delta}t [&ge;] 0). We prove that the optimal duration of the initial stage, in which the first drug is administered, T, is shorter than the period in which it remains effective in decreasing the total population, contrary to current clinical intuition.\\n\\nWe further analyzed the relationship between population makeup, [Formula], and the effect of each drug. We determine a critical ratio, which we term [Formula], at which the two drugs are equally effective. As the first stage of the optimal strategy is applied, [Formula] changes monotonically to [Formula] and then, during the second stage, remains at [Formula] thereafter.\\n\\nBeyond our analytic results, we explored an individual based stochastic model and presented the distribution of extinction times for the classes of solutions found. Taken together, our results suggest opportunities to improve therapy scheduling in clinical oncology.",

Using a genome-wide dual RNA sequencing of flow-sorted infected and uninfected hepatoma cells we identify the human mucosal immunity gene, Mucin13 (MUC13), as strongly upregulated during Plasmodium exoerythrocytic hepatic-stage infection. We confirm that MUC13 expression is upregulated in hepatoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes. In immunofluorescence assays, host MUC13 protein expression distinguishes infected cells from adjacent uninfected cells and shows similar colocalization with parasite biomarkers such as UIS4 and HSP70. We further show that localization patterns are species independent, distinguishing both P. berghei and P. vivax infected cells, and that MUC13 can be used to identify compounds that inhibit parasite replication in hepatocytes across all Human-infecting Plasmodium species.

    "abstract": "Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models predict that structures are either re - used as a whole or created from scratch, prohibiting the ability to generalize constituent parts of learned structures. This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non - parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions that may have different popularity across contexts. We compare this agent to an agent that jointly clusters both across a range of task domains. We show that relative performance of the two agents depends on the statistics of the task domain, including the mutual information between transition and reward functions in the environment, and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and develop a meta learning agent that can dynamically arbitrate between strategies across task domains. We argue that this provides a first step in allowing for compositional structures in reinforcement learners, which should be provide a better model of human learning and additional flexibility for artificial agents.\\n\\nAuthor summaryA musician may learn to generalize behaviors across instruments for different purposes, for example, reusing hand motions used when playing classical on the flute to play jazz on the saxophone. Conversely, she may learn to play a single song across many instruments that require completely distinct physical motions, but nonetheless transfer knowledge between them. This degree of compositionality is often absent from computational frameworks of learning, forcing agents either to generalize entire learned policies or to learn new policies from scratch. Here, we propose a solution to this problem that allows an agent to generalize components of a policy independently and compare it to an agent that generalizes components as a whole. We show that the degree to which one form of generalization is favored over the other is dependent on the features of task domain, with independent generalization of task components favored in environments with weak relationships between components or high degrees of noise and joint generalization of task components favored when there is a clear, discoverable relationship between task components. Furthermore, we show that the overall meta structure of the environment can be learned and leveraged by an agent that dynamically arbitrates between these forms of structure learning.",

MDD participants were carefully screened for physical comorbidity, and were compared to healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, body mass indices, and cigarette smoking status. Using group-wise comparisons and the innovative statistical approach of partial least squares, we demonstrated that elevated CRP was associated with treatment-resistance, childhood adversity, and specific depressive and anxious symptoms.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceCRP is significantly increased \\\"on average\\\" in MDD patients, However, CRP was most abnormally increased in the subgroup of patients with treatment-resistant depression. High BMI, high scores on vegetative symptoms of depression, low scores on calmness, and a history of childhood adversity, were all predictive of increased CRP. In future, stratification of MDD patients using pro-inflammatory biomarkers, like CRP, may be valuable for sample enrichment and targeted treatment interventions.\\n\\nAbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSC-reactive protein (CRP) is a candidate biomarker for major depressive disorder (MDD), but it is unclear how peripheral CRP levels relate to the heterogeneous clinical phenotypes of the disorder.\\n\\nMethodsWe recruited 102 treatment-resistant, depressed MDD patients, 48 treatment-responsive, non-depressed MDD patients, 48 depressed but un-medicated patients, and 54 healthy volunteers. High sensitivity CRP in peripheral venous blood, body mass index (BMI), and questionnaire assessments of depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma, were measured. Group differences in CRP were estimated, before and after correction for BMI. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis explored the relationships between CRP and specific clinical phenotypes.\\n\\nOutcomesCompared to healthy volunteers, BMI-corrected CRP was significantly elevated in treatment-resistant patients (P = 0.007; Cohens d = 0.47); but not significantly so in the treatment-responsive (d = 0.29) and untreated (d = 0.18) groups. PLS yielded an optimal two factor solution that accounted for 34.7% of variation in clinical measures, and for 36.0% of variation in CRP. The clinical phenotypes most strongly associated with CRP and heavily weighted on the first PLS component were: vegetative depressive symptoms, BMI, state anxiety, and feeling unloved as a child or wishing for a different childhood.\\n\\nInterpretationPeripheral CRP was elevated in MDD, especially in treatment-resistant cases. Other phenotypes associated with elevated CRP included childhood adversity, and specific depressive and anxious symptoms. We suggest that MDD patients stratified for pro-inflammatory biomarkers, like CRP, have a distinctive clinical profile that might be responsive to second-line treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs.\\n\\nFundingWellcome Trust strategy award to the Neuroimmunology of Mood Disorders and Alzheimers Disease (NIMA) Consortium.",

    "abstract": "Missense mutations in MORC2 cause neuropathies including spinal muscular atrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We recently identified MORC2 as an effector of epigenetic silencing by the HUSH complex. Here we report the biochemical and cellular activities of MORC2 variants, alongside crystal structures of wild-type and neuropathic forms of a human MORC2 fragment comprising the GHKL-type ATPase module and CW-type zinc finger. This fragment dimerizes upon binding ATP and contains a hinged, functionally critical coiled coil insertion absent in other GHKL ATPases. We find that dimerization and DNA binding of the MORC2 ATPase module transduce HUSH-dependent silencing. Disease mutations change the dynamics of dimerization by distinct structural mechanisms: destabilizing the ATPase-CW module, trapping the ATP lid or perturbing the dimer interface. These defects lead to modulation of HUSH function, thus providing a molecular basis for understanding MORC2-associated neuropathies.",

    "abstract": "Pillar-based microfluidic sorting devices are preferred for isolation of rare cells due to their simple designs and passive operation. Dead-end pillar filters can efficiently capture large rare cells, such as, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs), etc., but they get clogged easily. Cross flow filters are preferred for smaller rare particles (e.g. separating bacteria from blood), but they need additional buffer inlets and a large device footprint for efficient operation. We have designed a new microparticle separation device i.e. Radial Pillar Device (RAPID) that combines the advantages of dead-end and cross flow filters. RAPID can simultaneously isolate both large and small rare particles from a mixed population, while functioning for several hours without clogging. We have achieved simultaneous separation of 10{micro}m and 2{micro}m polystyrene particles from a mixture of 2 {micro}m, 7 {micro}m and 10 {micro}m beads. RAPID achieved average separation purity and recovery in excess of 90%. The throughput of our device ( 3ml/min) is 10 and 100 times higher compared to cross flow and dead-end filters respectively, thereby justifying the name RAPID.",

Recently, proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a new approach to study the spatial and interaction characteristics of proteins in living cells. However, the two enzymes commonly used for PL come with tradeoffs - BioID is slow, requiring tagging times of 18-24 hours, while APEX peroxidase uses substrates that have limited cell permeability and high toxicity. To address these problems, we used yeast display-based directed evolution to engineer two mutants of biotin ligase, TurboID and miniTurbo, with much greater catalytic efficiency than BioID, and the ability to carry out PL in cells in much shorter time windows (as little as 10 minutes) with non-toxic and easily deliverable biotin. In addition to shortening PL time by 100-fold and increasing PL yield in cell culture, TurboID enabled biotin-based PL in new settings, including yeast, Drosophila, and C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "In biological membranes many factors such as cytoskeleton, lipid composition, crowding and molecular interactions deviate lateral diffusion from the expected random walks. These factors have different effects on diffusion but act simultaneously so the observed diffusion is a complex mixture of diffusive behaviors (directed, >Brownian, anomalous or confined). Therefore commonly used approaches to quantify diffusion based on averaging of the displacements, such as the mean square displacement, are not adapted to the analysis of this heterogeneity. We introduce a new parameter, the packing coefficient Pc, which gives an estimate of the degree of free movement that a molecule displays in a period of time independently of its global diffusivity. Applying this approach to two different situations (diffusion of a lipid probe and trapping of receptors at synapses), we show that Pc detected and localized temporary changes of diffusive behavior both in time and in space. More importantly, it allowed the detection of periods with very high confinement (~immobility), their frequency and duration, and thus it can be used to calculate the effective kon and koff of scaffolding interactions such those that immobilize receptors at synapses.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the human genome is made of transposable elements, giving rise to interspaced repeats, including Long Interspersed Element-1s (LINE-1s or L1s). L1s are active human DNA parasites involved in genomic diversity and evolution, but can also contribute to genomic instability and diseases. L1s require host factors to complete their life cycles, whereas the host has evolved numerous mechanisms to restrict L1-induced mutagenesis. Restriction mechanisms in somatic cells include methylation of the L1 promoter, anti-viral factors and RNA-mediated processes such as small RNAs. microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress multiple target genes often found in the same cellular pathways. We have recently established that the interferon-inducible miR-128 function as a novel restriction factor inhibiting L1 mobilization in somatic cells. We have further demonstrated that miR-128 function through a dual mechanism; by directly targeting L1 RNA for degradation and indirectly by inhibiting a cellular co-factor which L1 is dependent on to transpose to new genomic locations (TNPO1). Here we add another piece to the puzzle of the enigmatic L1 life cycle. We show that miR-128 also inhibits another key cellular factor, hnRNPA1, by significantly reducing mRNA and protein levels through direct interaction with the coding sequence (CDS) of hnRNPA1 mRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that repression of hnRNPA1 using shRNA significantly decreases de novo L1 retrotransposition and that induced hnRNPA1 expression enhances L1 mobilization. Finally, we determine that hnRNPA1 is a functional target of miR-128 and that induced hnRNPA1 expression in miR-128-overexpressing cells can partly rescue the miR-128-induced repression of L1s ability to transpose to different genomic locations. Thus, we have identified an additional mechanism by which miR-128 represses L1 retrotransposition and mediate genomic stability.",

    "abstract": "Sulfur-cycling microorganisms impact organic matter decomposition in wetlands and consequently greenhouse gas emissions from these globally relevant environments. However,their identities and physiological properties are largely unknown. By applying a functional metagenomics approach to an acidic peatland, we recovered draft genomes of seven novel Acidobacteria species with the potential for dissimilatory sulfite (dsrAB, dsrC, dsrD, dsrN, dsrT, dsrMKJOP) or sulfate respiration (sat, aprBA, qmoABC plus dsr genes). Surprisingly, the genomes also encoded dsrL, a unique gene of the sulfur oxidation pathway. Metatranscriptome analysis demonstrated expression of acidobacterial sulfur-metabolism genes in native peat soil and their upregulation in diverse anoxic microcosms. This indicated an active sulfate respiration pathway, which, however, could also operate in reverse for sulfur oxidation as recently shown for other microorganisms. Acidobacteria that only harbored genes for sulfite reduction additionally encoded enzymes that liberate sulfite from organosulfonates, which suggested organic sulfur compounds as complementary energy sources. Further metabolic potentials included polysaccharide hydrolysis and sugar utilization, aerobic respiration, several fermentative capabilities, and hydrogen oxidation. Our findings extend both, the known physiological and genetic properties of Acidobacteria and the known taxonomic diversity of microorganisms with a DsrAB-based sulfur metabolism, and highlight new fundamental niches for facultative anaerobic Acidobacteria in wetlands based on exploitation of inorganic and organic sulfur molecules for energy conservation.",

    "abstract": "In this article a novel mechanism of retrograde signaling by chloroplasts during stress is described. This mechanism involves the DNA/RNA binding protein WHIRLY1 as a regulator of microRNA levels. By virtue of its dual localization in chloroplasts and the nucleus of the same cell, WHIRLY1 was proposed as an excellent candidate coordinator of chloroplast function and nuclear gene expression (Grabowski et al., 2008; Foyer et al., 2014). In this study the putative involvement of WHIRLY1 in stress dependent retrograde signaling was investigated by comparison of barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. Golden Promise) wild-type and transgenic plants with an RNAi-mediated knockdown of WHIRLY1. In contrast to the wild type, the transgenic plants were unable to cope with continuous high light conditions. They were impaired in production of several microRNAs mediating post-transcriptional responses during stress (Kruszka et al., 2012, Sunkar et al., 2012). The results support a central role of WHIRLY1 in retrograde signaling and underpin a so far underestimated role of microRNAs in this process.",

Yet general rules for how the kinase domain allows the more than 500 members of the human kinome to receive specific regulatory inputs and convey information to appropriate substrates - all while using the common signaling currency of phosphorylation - remain enigmatic. Here, using co-evolution analysis and quantitative live-cell assays, we reveal a deep hierarchical organization of the kinase domain that facilitates the orthogonal evolution of regulatory inputs and substrate outputs while maintaining catalytic function. Three quasi-independent functional units in the kinase domain (known as protein sectors) encode for catalysis, substrate specificity and regulation, and these distinct subdomains are differentially exploited by somatic cancer mutations and harnessed by allosteric inhibitors. We propose that this functional architecture endows the kinase domain with inherent regulatory plasticity.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, transcription factors (TFs) are thought to act in a combinatorial way, by competing and collaborating to regulate common target genes. However, several questions remain regarding the conservation of these combina-tions among different gene classes, regulatory regions and cell types. We propose a new approach named TFcoop to infer the TF combinations involved in the binding of a tar-get TF in a particular cell type. TFcoop aims to predict the binding sites of the target TF upon the binding affinity of all identified cooperating TFs. The set of cooperating TFs and model parameters are learned from ChIP-seq data of the target TF. We used TFcoop to investigate the TF combina-tions involved in the binding of 106 TFs on 41 cell types and in four regulatory regions: promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs, and enhancers. We first assess that TFcoop is accurate and outperforms simple PWM methods for pre-dicting TF binding sites. Next, analysis of the learned models sheds light on important properties of TF combinations in different promoter classes and in enhancers. First, we show that combinations governing TF binding on enhancers are more cell-type specific than that governing binding in pro-moters. Second, for a given TF and cell type, we observe that TF combinations are different between promoters and en-hancers, but similar for promoters of mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs. Analysis of the TFs cooperating with the dif-ferent targets show over-representation of pioneer TFs and a clear preference for TFs with binding motif composition similar to that of the target. Lastly, our models accurately dis-tinguish promoters associated with specific biological processes.",

    "abstract": "We study a Brownian dynamics simulation model of a biopolymeric shell deformed by axial forces exerted at opposing poles. The model exhibits two distinct linear force-extension regimes, with the response to small tensions governed by linear elasticity and the response to large tensions governed by an effective spring constant that scales with radius as R-0.25. When extended beyond the initial linear elastic regime, the shell undergoes a hysteretic, temperature-dependent buckling transition. We experimentally observe this buckling transition by stretching and imaging the lamina of isolated cell nuclei. Furthermore, the interior contents of the shell can alter mechanical response and buckling, which we show by simulating a model for the nucleus that quantitatively agrees with our micromanipulation experiments stretching individual nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) can induce IRF7 activation and Type I/III interferon signaling through dsRNA-mediated viral mimicry in cancer cells. By performing a large pan-cancer analysis using TCGA data, we determined that IRF7 activation is associated with higher CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and higher cytolytic activity across multiple cancer types. Accordingly, we demonstrate that DNMTi treatment results in increased CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration, enhanced cytolytic activity and CD8+ T cell dependent tumor growth inhibition. Finally, we show that DNMTi triggers a process marked by the induction of viral mimicry directly on CD8+ T cells, leading to activation of dsRNA sensing pathway, and up-regulation of T cell activation markers, effector cytokines, and Granzyme B. Taken together, our findings suggest that dsRNA sensing pathway activation in the immune compartment, through pharmacological DNA demethylation, is a viable strategy for boosting anti-tumor immune response.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, or GAS) causes 600 million cases of pharyngitis each year. Despite this considerable disease burden, the molecular mechanisms used by GAS to infect, cause clinical pharyngitis, and persist in the human oropharynx are poorly understood. Saliva is ubiquitous in the human oropharynx and is the first material GAS encounters in the upper respiratory tract. Thus, a fuller understanding of how GAS survives and proliferates in saliva may provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms at work in the human oropharynx. We generated a highly saturated transposon insertion mutant library in serotype M1 strain MGAS2221, a strain genetically representative of a pandemic clone that arose in the 1980s and spread globally. The transposon mutant library was exposed to human saliva to screen for GAS genes required for wild-type fitness in this clinically relevant fluid. Using transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), we identified 92 genes required for GAS fitness in saliva. The more prevalent categories represented are genes involved in carbohydrate transport/metabolism, amino acid transport/metabolism, and inorganic ion transport/metabolism. Using six isogenic mutant strains, we confirmed that each of the mutants are significantly impaired for growth or persistence in human saliva ex vivo. Mutants with an inactivated spy0644 (sptA) or spy0646 (sptC) gene have especially severe persistence defects. This study is the first use of TraDIS to study bacterial fitness in human saliva. The new information we obtained is valuable for future translational maneuvers designed to prevent or treat human GAS infections.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) causes more than 600 million cases of pharyngitis annually worldwide, 15 million of which occur in the United States. The human oropharynx is the primary anatomic site for GAS colonization and infection, and saliva is the first material encountered. Using a genome-wide transposon mutant screen, we identified 92 GAS genes required for wild-type fitness in human saliva. Many of the identified genes are involved in carbohydrate transport/metabolism, amino acid transport/metabolism, and inorganic ion transport/metabolism. The new information is potentially valuable for developing novel GAS therapeutics and vaccine research.",

Aerobic fitness has been shown to ameliorate decline in some cognitive domains, but the potential benefits for language have not been examined. In a cross-sectional sample, we investigated the relationship between aerobic fitness and tip-of-the-tongue states. These are among the most frequent cognitive failures in healthy older adults and occur when a speaker knows a word but is unable to produce it. We found that healthy older adults indeed experience more tip-of-the-tongue states than young adults. Importantly, higher aerobic fitness levels decrease the probability of experiencing tip-of-the-tongue states in healthy older adults. Fitness-related differences in word finding abilities are observed over and above effects of age. This is the first demonstration of a link between aerobic fitness and language functioning in healthy older adults.",

    "abstract": "Photoreceptor degeneration is a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Separation of neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium is a prominent feature preceding photoreceptor degeneration in a variety of retinal diseases. Although ophthalmic surgeries have been well developed to restore retinal structures, post-op patients usually experience progressive photoreceptor degeneration and irreversible vision loss that is incurable at present. Previous studies point to a critical role of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway in photoreceptor degeneration, but the upstream triggers remain largely unexplored. In this study, we show that after experimental RD induction, photoreceptors activate dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission pathway and subsequent apoptotic cascades. Mechanistically, endogenous ROS is necessary for Drp1 activation in vivo and exogenous ROS insult is sufficient to activate Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in cultured photoreceptors. Accordingly, inhibition of Drp1 activity effectively preserves mitochondrial integrity and rescues photoreceptors. Collectively, our data delineates a ROS-Drp1-mitochondria axis that promotes photoreceptor degeneration in retinal diseased models.",

However, the methodological advancements in this field have been mostly and sometimes exclusively used only in indoor laboratory settings. In parallel, there has been an unprecedented and rapid improvement in our ability to track animals and their behaviour in the wild. However, while the spatial analysis of tracking data is widespread, its temporal aspect is largely unexplored. Here, we review the tools that are available or have potential to record rhythms in the wild animals with emphasis on currently overlooked approaches and monitoring systems. We then demonstrate, in three question-driven case studies, how the integration of traditional and newer approaches can help answer novel chronobiological questions in free-living animals. Finally, we highlight unresolved issues in field chronobiology that may benefit from technological development in the future. As most of the studies in the field are descriptive, the future challenge lies in applying the diverse technologies to experimental set-ups in the wild.",

Host diet is a key factor that shapes bacterial communities, but the impact of dietary transitions across insect development is poorly understood. We analyzed bacterial communities of 12 butterfly species across different development stages, using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Butterfly larvae typically consume leaves of a single host plant, whereas adults are more generalist nectar feeders. Thus, we expected bacterial communities to vary substantially across butterfly development. Surprisingly, very few species showed significant developmental transitions in bacterial communities, suggesting weak impacts of dietary transitions across butterfly development. On the other hand, bacterial communities were strongly influenced by butterfly species identity and dietary variation across species. Larvae of most butterfly species largely mirrored bacterial community composition of their diets, suggesting passive acquisition rather than active selection. Overall, our results suggest that although butterflies harbor distinct microbiomes across taxonomic groups and dietary guilds, the dramatic dietary shifts that occur during development do not impose strong selection to maintain distinct bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between mutational (i.e. genetic) robustness, cryptic genetic variation and epistasis is currently under much debate, as is the question whether mutational robustness evolved under direct selection or as a by-product of environmental robustness. Here we report that mutational robustness was restored in a mutant line of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana after the spontaneous mutation, comet, appeared in a genetically polymorphic wild type population. The comet mutation modified two phenotypic traits known to be under sexual selection in this butterfly: the dorsal forewing eyespot, which is normally round, but became  comet-shaped, and the androconia, the structures producing the male sex pheromone, which were reduced in size. The comet mutant line remained phenotypically stable for [~]7 seven years, but when outcrossed to the genetically polymorphic wild type population, the outcrossed comet line surprisingly recovered the wild type phenotype within 8 generations. This suggests that mutational robustness against the comet mutation was recovered in the comet outcrossed line by epistatic interactions with the genetic polymorphism originating from wild types. The extent of wild type phenotype recovery in the comet outcrossed line was trait- and developmental temperature-dependent, such that mutational robustness was partially recovered at high, but not at low developmental temperatures. We hypothesized that sexual selection through mate choice, which is sex-reversed between developmental temperatures in this butterfly, could produce mutational robustness at a high (but not at a low) temperature. Females are the choosy sex and exert stabilizing or directional selection on male secondary sexual wing traits but only at higher temperatures. Male mating success experiments under semi-natural conditions then revealed that males with the typical comet mutant phenotype suffered from lower mating success compared to wild type males, while mating success of comet males resembling wild types was partially restored. Altogether, we document the roles of cryptic genetic variation and epistasis in restoration of mutational robustness against a spontaneous mutation with known fitness effects, and we provide experimental evidence, for the first time to our knowledge, that sexual selection can produce mutational robustness.",

We exploit a suite of genomic resources to show that introgressive hybridization occurred between close relatives of Arabidopsis, impacting our understanding of species relationships in the group. The composition of introgressed and retained genes indicates that selection against incompatible cytonuclear and nuclear-nuclear interactions likely acted during introgression, while neutral processes also contributed to genome composition through the retention of ancient haplotype blocks. We also developed a divergence-based test to distinguish donor from recipient lineages without the requirement of additional taxon-sampling. Finally, to our great surprise, we find that cytonuclear discordance appears to have arisen via extensive nuclear, rather than cytoplasmic, introgression, meaning that most of the genome was displaced during introgression, while only a small proportion of native alleles were retained.",

    "abstract": "Here we have proposed the functional space hypothesis, positing that mutational target size scales with genome size, impacting the number, source, and genomic location of beneficial mutations that contribute to adaptation. Though motivated by preliminary evidence, mostly from Arabidopsis and maize, more data are needed before any rigorous assessment of the hypothesis can be made. If correct, the functional space hypothesis suggests that we should expect plants with large genomes to exhibit more functional mutations outside of genes, more regulatory variation, and likely less signal of strong selective sweeps reducing diversity. These differences have implications for how we study the evolution and development of plant genomes, from where we should look for signals of adaptation to what patterns we expect adaptation to leave in genetic diversity or gene expression data. While flowering plant genomes vary across more than three orders of magnitude in size, most studies of both functional and evolutionary genomics have focused on species at the extreme small edge of this scale. Our hypothesis predicts that methods and results from these small genomes may not replicate well as we begin to explore large plant genomes. Finally, while we have focused here on evidence from plant genomes, we see no a priori reason why similar arguments might not hold in other taxa as well.",

    "abstract": "The high lignocellulolytic activity displayed by the soft-rot fungus P. purpurogenum has made it a target for the study of novel lignocellulolytic enzymes. We have obtained a reference genome of 36.2Mb of non-redundant sequence (11,057 protein-coding genes). The 49 largest scaffolds cover 90% of the assembly, and CEGMA analysis reveals that our assembly covers most if not all all protein-coding genes. RNASeq was performed and 93.1% of the reads aligned within the assembled genome. These data, plus the independent sequencing of a set of genes of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, validate the quality of the genome sequence. P. purpurogenum shows a higher number of proteins with CAZy motifs, transcription factors and transporters as compared to other sequenced Penicillia. These results demonstrate the great potential for lignocellulolytic activity of this fungus and the possible use of its enzymes in related industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Viruses coevolve with their hosts to overcome host resistance and gain the upper hand in the evolutionary arms race. Drosophila innubila nudivirus (DiNV) is a double stranded DNA virus, closely related to Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Kallithea virus. DiNV is the first DNA virus found to naturally infect Drosophila and therefore has the potential to be developed as a model for DNA virus immune defense and host/virus coevolution within its well-studied host system. Here we sequence and annotate the genome of DiNV and identify signatures of adaptation, revealing clues for genes involved in host-parasite coevolution. The genome is 155555bp long and contains 107 coding open reading frames (ORFs) and a wealth of AT-rich simple sequence repeats. While synteny is highly conserved between DiNV and Kallithea virus, it drops off rapidly as sequences become more divergent, consistent with rampant rearrangements across nudiviruses. Overall, we show that evolution of DiNV is likely due to adaptation of few genes coupled with high gene turnover.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe sequence the genome of DiNV.\\nC_LIO_LIFew genes are rapidly evolving between nudiviruses.\\nC_LIO_LIWe find high gene turnover between DiNV and its closest relatives.\\nC_LIO_LIHelicase and ODV-E56 show consistent signatures of adaptation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "All higher eukaryotes live in a relationship with diverse microorganisms which colonize their bodily surfaces; plants are no exception. However, we still lack a satisfactory understanding of how these loosely associated microbiomes with immense diversity and functional potential interact with their hosts or how these interactions shape processes within populations and ecosystems. There is considerable similarity between microbial communities colonizing plant surfaces such as roots, and those of the animal gut. This often overlooked parallel allows us to look at microbial as well as host ecophysiology from a fresh perspective. The traps of carnivorous plants are sophisticated digestive organs and interface environments between the supply and the demand for nutrients. We selected the miniature ecosystem in the traps of aquatic carnivorous Utricularia plants as our model system. By assessing the trap-associated microbial community structure, diversity, function, as well as the nutrient recycling potential of bacterivory, we gained insight into the nutrient acquisition strategies of the Utricularia hosts. We conclude that trap ecophysiological function is in many aspects highly analogous to that of the herbivore gut and centers around complex microbial consortia, which act synergistically to covert complex organic matter, often of algal origin, into a source of nutrients for the plants.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectivesTreatments that inhibit the expression or functioning of bacterial virulence factors hold great promise to be both effective and exert weaker selection for resistance than conventional antibiotics. However, the evolutionary robustness argument, based on the idea that anti-virulence treatments disarm rather than kill pathogens, is controversial. Here we probe the evolutionary robustness of two repurposed drugs, gallium and flucytosine, targeting the iron-scavenging pyoverdine of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\\n\\nMethodologyWe subjected replicated cultures of bacteria to two concentrations of each drug for 20 consecutive days in human serum as an ex-vivo infection model. We screened evolved populations and clones for resistance phenotypes, including the restoration of growth and pyoverdine production, and the evolution of iron uptake by-passing mechanisms. We whole-genome sequenced evolved clones to identify the genetic basis of resistance.\\n\\nResultsWe found that mutants resistant against anti-virulence treatments readily arose, but their selective spreading varied between treatments. Flucytosine resistance quickly spread in all populations due to disruptive mutations in upp, a gene encoding an enzyme required for flucytosine activation. Conversely, resistance against gallium arose only sporadically, and was based on mutations in transcriptional regulators, upregulating pyocyanin production, a redox-active molecule promoting siderophore-independent iron acquisition. The spread of gallium resistance could be hampered because pyocyanin-mediated iron delivery benefits resistant and susceptible cells alike.\\n\\nConclusions and implicationsOur work highlights that anti-virulence treatments are not evolutionarily robust per se. Instead, evolutionary robustness is a relative measure, with specific treatments occupying different positions on a continuous scale.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the influenza A virus replicates and transcribes the viral genome segments in the nucleus of the host cell. To transcribe these viral genome segments, the RdRp  snatches capped RNA oligonucleotides from nascent host cell mRNAs and aligns these primers to the ultimate or penultimate nucleotide of the segments for the initiation of viral mRNA synthesis. It has been proposed that this initiation process is not processive and that the RdRp uses a prime-realign mechanism during transcription. Here we provide in vitro evidence for the existence of this transcriptional prime-realign mechanism, but show that it only functions efficiently for primers that are short or can not stably base pair with the template. In addition, we demonstrate that transcriptional elongation is dependent on the priming loop of the PB1 subunit of the RdRp. We propose that the prime-realign mechanism may be used to rescue abortive transcription initiation events or cope with sequence variation among primers. Overall, these observations advance our mechanistic understanding of how the influenza A virus initiates transcription correctly and efficiently.\\n\\nImportanceThe influenza A virus causes severe disease in humans and is considered a major global health threat. The virus replicates and transcribes its genome using an enzyme called the RNA polymerase. To ensure that the genome is amplified faithfully and abundant viral mRNAs are made for viral protein synthesis, the viral RNA polymerase must transcribe the viral genome efficiently. In this report, we characterise a structure inside the polymerase that contributes to the efficiency of viral mRNA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Several publications have reported structural changes in the brain of synesthetes compared to controls, either local differences or differences in connectivity. In the present study, we pursued this quest for structural brain differences that might support the subjective experience of synaesthesia. In particular, for the first time in this field, we investigated brain folding in comparing 45 sulcal shapes in each hemisphere of control and grapheme-color synesthete populations. To overcome flaws relative to data interpretation based only on p-values, common in the synesthesia literature, we report confidence intervals of effect sizes. Moreover, our statistical maps are displayed without introducing the classical, but misleading, p-value level threshold. We adopt such a methodological procedure to facilitate appropriate data interpretation and promote the New Statistics approach. Based on structural or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data, we did not find any strong cerebral anomaly, in sulci, tissue volume, tissue density or fiber organization that could support synesthetic color experience. Finally, by sharing our complete datasets, we strongly support the multi-center construction of a sufficient large dataset repository for detecting, if any, subtle brain differences that may help understanding how a subjective experience, such as synesthesia, is mentally constructed.",

Further development of speech motor control models may be aided by a comparison of model attributes. The review builds an understanding of existing models from first principles, before moving into a discussion of several models, showing how each is constructed out of the same basic domain-general ideas and components - e.g., generalized feedforward, feedback, and model predictive components. This approach allows for direct comparisons to be made in terms of where the models differ, and their points of agreement. Substantial differences among models can be observed in their use of feedforward control, process of estimating system state, and method of incorporating feedback signals into control. However, many commonalities exist among the models in terms of their reliance on higher-level motor planning, use of feedback signals, lack of time-variant adaptation, and focus on kinematic aspects of control and biomechanics. Ongoing research bridging hybrid feedforward/feedback pathways with forward dynamic control, as well as feedback/internal model-based state estimation is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Biological heterogeneities are ubiquitous and play critical roles in the emergence of physiology at multiple scales. Although neurons in layer II (LII) of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) express heterogeneities in their channel properties, the impact of such heterogeneities on the robustness of cellular-scale physiology has not been assessed. Here, we performed a 55-parameter stochastic search spanning 9 voltage- or calcium-activated channels to assess the impact of channel heterogeneities on the concomitant emergence of 10 electrophysiological characteristics of LII stellate cells (SCs). We generated 50,000 models and found a heterogeneous subpopulation of 155 valid models to robustly match all electrophysiological signatures. We employed this heterogeneous population to demonstrate the emergence of cellular-scale degeneracy in LII SCs, whereby disparate parametric combinations expressing weak pairwise correlations resulted in similar models. We then assessed the impact of virtually knocking out each channel from all valid models and demonstrate that the mapping between channels and measurements was many-to-many, a critical requirement for the expression of degeneracy. Finally, we quantitatively predict that the spike-triggered average of LII SCs should be endowed with theta-frequency spectral selectivity and coincidence detection capabilities in the fast gamma-band. We postulate this fast gamma-band coincidence detection as an instance of cellular-scale efficient coding, whereby SC response characteristics match the dominant oscillatory signals in LII MEC. The heterogeneous population of valid SC models built here unveils the robust emergence of cellular-scale physiology despite significant channel heterogeneities, and forms an efficacious substrate for evaluating the impact of biological heterogeneities on entorhinal network function.\\n\\nKEY POINTSO_LIStellate cells (SC) in layer II (LII) of the medial entorhinal cortex express cellular-scale degeneracy in the concomitant manifestation of several of their unique physiological signatures.\\nC_LIO_LISeveral disparate parametric combinations expressing weak pairwise correlations resulted in models with very similar physiological characteristics, including robust theta-frequency membrane potential oscillations spanning several levels of subthreshold depolarization.\\nC_LIO_LIElectrophysiological measurements of LII SCs exhibited differential and variable dependencies on underlying channels, and the mapping between channels and measurements was many-to-many.\\nC_LIO_LIQuantitative predictions point to theta-frequency spectral selectivity and fast gamma-range coincidence detection capabilities in class II/III spike-triggered average of LII SCs, with the postulate for this to be an instance of cellular-scale efficient coding.\\nC_LIO_LIA heterogeneous cell population that accounts for both channel and intrinsic heterogeneities in LII SCs, which could be employed by network models of entorhinal function to probe the impact of several biological heterogeneities on spatial navigation circuits.\\nC_LI",

Consequently, their application in neuroscience is rapidly increasing. While classification approaches have proved useful in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, there are concerns regarding extraction, reproducibility and visualization of brain regions that contribute most significantly to the classification. We addressed these issues using an fMRI classification scheme based on neural networks and compared a set of methods for extraction of category-related voxel importances in three simulated and two empirical datasets. The simulation data revealed that the proposed scheme successfully detects spatially distributed and overlapping activation patterns upon successful classification. Application of the proposed classification scheme to two previously published empirical fMRI datasets revealed robust importance maps that extensively overlap with univariate maps but also provide complementary information. We conclude that importance maps are superior to univariate approaches for both detection of overlapping patterns and patterns with weak univariate information.",

    "abstract": "The thalamostriatal system is a major network in the mammalian brain, originating principally from the intralaminar nuclei of thalamus. Functions of the thalamostriatal system remain unclear, but a subset of these projections provides a pathway through which the cerebellum communicates with the basal ganglia. Both the cerebellum and basal ganglia play crucial roles in motor control. Although songbirds have yielded key insights into the neural basis of vocal learning, it is unknown whether a thalamostriatal system exists in the songbird brain. Thalamic nucleus DLM is an important part of the song system, the network of nuclei required for learning and producing song. DLM receives output from song system basal ganglia nucleus Area X and sits within dorsal thalamus, the proposed avian homolog of the mammalian intralaminar nuclei that also receives projections from the cerebellar nuclei. Using a viral vector that specifically labels presynaptic axon segments, we show in Bengalese finches that dorsal thalamus projects to Area X, the basal ganglia nucleus of the song system, and to surrounding medial striatum. To identify the sources of thalamic input to Area X, we map DLM and cerebellar-recipient dorsal thalamus (DTCbN). Surprisingly, we find both DLM and immediately-adjacent subregions of DTCbN project to Area X. In contrast, a medial-ventral subregion of DTCbN projects to medial striatum outside Area X. Our results suggest the basal ganglia in the song system, like the mammalian basal ganglia, integrate feedback from the thalamic region to which they project as well as thalamic regions that receive cerebellar output.",

Here we investigated memory competition during sleep by presenting auditory cues that had been linked to two distinct picture-location pairs during wake. We manipulated competition during learning by requiring subjects to rehearse item pairs associated with the same sound either competitively (choosing to rehearse one over the other, leading to greater competition) or separately; we hypothesized that greater competition during learning would lead to greater competition when memories were cued during sleep. With separate-pair learning, we found that cueing benefited spatial retention. With competitive-pair learning, no benefit of cueing was observed on retention, but cueing impaired retention of well-learned pairs (where we expected strong competition). During sleep, post-cue beta power (16-30 Hz) indexed competition-based weakening and forgetting, whereas sigma power (11-16 Hz) indexed memory strengthening. These findings show that memory consolidation during sleep fundamentally engages competition and selective memory weakening.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Introduction Materials and methods Results Discussion References Statins are a commonly-used class of cholesterol-lowering drugs which effectively reduce the production of plasma cholesterol by the liver, and thus are associated with reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases (Horwich et al., 2004). However, cholesterol is also produced de novo in the brain, raising questions of whether oral statins that cross from the periphery into the brain impact brain cholesterol, neural tissue, and cognition (Eckert et al., 2001, Fong, 2014, Banach et al., 2017). The vast majority of research on statins and cognition convincingly demonstrate that many statins are neuroprotective and ameliorate cognitive decline in patients with neurodegenerative dise ...",

    "abstract": "A plethora of evidence and theoretical work indicates that the basal ganglia (BG) might be the locus where conflicts between prospective motor programs, or actions, are being resolved. Similarly to the majority of brain regions, oscillations in this subcortical group are ubiquitous, largely driven by the cortex and associated with a number of motor symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the literature so far contains no systematic attempt to address the impact of cortical oscillations on the ability of the BG to select. In this study, we employed a state of the art spiking neural model of the BG circuitry and investigated the effectiveness of the BG as an action selection device. We found that cortical frequency, phase, dopamine and the examined time scale, all have a very important impact on the models ability to select. Our simulations resulted n a canonical profile of selectivity, termed selectivity portraits, which suggests that the cortex is the structure that determines whether selection will be performed in the BG and what strategy will be utilized. Some frequency ranges promote the exploitation of highly salient actions, others promote the exploration of alternative options, while the remaining frequencies simply halt the selection process. Based on this behaviour, we propose that the BG circuitry can be viewed as the \\\"gearbox\\\" of action selection. Coalitions of rhythmic cortical areas are able to switch between a repertoire of available BG modes which, in turn, change the course of information flow within the Cortico BG thalamo cortical loop. Dopamine, akin to \\\"control pedals\\\", either stops or initiates a decision, while cortical frequencies, as a \\\"gear lever\\\", determine whether a decision can be triggered and what type of decision this will be. Finally, we identified a selection cycle with a period of around 200ms, which was used to assess the biological plausibility of the popular cognitive architectures.",

    "abstract": "During development, morphogens provide extracellular cues allowing cells to select a specific fate by inducing complex transcriptional programs. The mating pathway in budding yeast offers simplified settings to understand this process. Pheromone secreted by the mating partner triggers the activity of a MAPK pathway, which results in the expression of hundreds of genes. Using a dynamic expression reporter, we quantified the kinetics of gene expression in single cells upon exogenous pheromone stimulation and in the physiological context of mating. In both conditions, we observed striking differences in the timing of induction of mating-responsive promoters. Biochemical analyses and generation of synthetic promoter variants demonstrated how the interplay between transcription factor binding and nucleosomes contribute to determine the kinetics of transcription in a simplified cell-fate decision system.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryQuantitative and dynamic single cell measurements in the yeast mating pathway uncover a complex temporal orchestration of gene expression events.",

    "abstract": "Feathers act as vibrotactile sensors that can detect mechanical stimuli during avian flight and tactile navigation, suggesting that they may also detect stimuli during social displays. In this study, we present the first measurements of the biomechanical properties of the feather crests found on the heads of birds, with an emphasis on those from the Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus). We show that in peafowl these crest feathers are coupled to filoplumes, small feathers known to function as mechanosensors. We also determined that airborne stimuli with the frequencies used during peafowl courtship and social displays couple efficiently via resonance to the vibrational response of their feather crests. Specifically, vibrational measurements showed that although different types of feathers have a wide range of fundamental resonant frequencies, peafowl crests are driven near-optimally by the shaking frequencies used by peacocks performing train-rattling displays. Peafowl crests were also driven to vibrate near resonance in a playback experiment that mimicked the effect of these mechanical sounds in the acoustic very near-field, reproducing the way peafowl displays are experienced at distances [&le;] 1.5m in vivo. When peacock wing-shaking courtship behaviour was simulated in the laboratory, the resulting airflow excited measurable vibrations of crest feathers. These results demonstrate that peafowl crests have mechanical properties that allow them to respond to airborne stimuli at the frequencies typical of this species social displays. This suggests a new hypothesis that mechanosensory stimuli could complement acoustic and visual perception and/or proprioception of social displays in peafowl and other bird species. We suggest behavioral studies to explore these ideas and their functional implications.",

    "abstract": "Computational modeling is a remarkable and common tool to quantitatively describe a biological process. However, most model parameters, such as kinetics parameters, initial conditions and scale factors, are usually unknown because they cannot be directly measured.\\n\\nTherefore, key issues in Systems Biology are model calibration and identifiability analysis, i.e. estimate parameters from experimental data and assess how well those parameters are determined by the dimension and quality of the data.\\n\\nCurrently in the Systems Biology and Computational Biology communities, the existing methodologies for parameter estimation are divided in two classes: frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. The first ones are based on the optimization of a cost function while the second ones estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters through different sampling techniques.\\n\\nIn this work, we present an innovative Bayesian method, called Conditional Robust Calibration (CRC), for model calibration and identifiability analysis. The algorithm is an iterative procedure based on parameter space sampling and on the definition of multiple objective functions related to each output variables. The method estimates step by step the probability density function (pdf) of parameters conditioned to the experimental measures and it returns as output a subset in the parameter space that best reproduce the dataset.\\n\\nWe apply CRC to six Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) models with different characteristics and complexity to test its performances compared with profile likelihood (PL) and Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Montecarlo (ABC-SMC) approaches. The datasets selected for calibration are time course measurements of different nature: noisy or noiseless, real or in silico.\\n\\nCompared with PL, our approach finds a more robust solution because parameter identifiability is inferred by conditional pdfs of estimated parameters. Compared with ABC-SMC, we have found a more precise solution with a reduced computational cost.",

It is still unclear what information should be considered for optimal disease stratification, and most prior work focuses on tumor genomics. Here, we focus on the tumor micro-environment. Using a large-scale co-culture assay optimized to measure drug-induced cell death, we identify tumor-stroma interactions that modulate drug sensitivity. Our data show that the chemo-insensitivity typically associated with aggressive subtypes of breast cancer is not cell intrinsic, but rather a product of tumor-fibroblast interactions. Additionally, we find that fibroblast cells influence tumor drug response in two distinct and divergent manners, which were predicable based on the anatomical origin from which the fibroblasts were harvested. These divergent phenotypes result from modulation of \\\"mitochondrial priming\\\" of tumor cells, caused by secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 and IL8, from stromal cells.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium parasites and related pathogens contain an essential non-photosynthetic plastid organelle, the apicoplast, derived from secondary endosymbiosis. Intriguingly, a highly conserved eukaryotic protein, autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8), has an autophagy-independent function in the apicoplast. Little is known about the novel apicoplast function of Atg8 and its importance in blood-stage P. falciparum. Using a P. falciparum strain in which Atg8 expression was conditionally regulated, we showed that PfAtg8 is essential for parasite replication. Significantly, growth inhibition caused by the loss of PfAtg8 was reversed by addition of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which was previously shown to rescue apicoplast defects in P. falciparum. Parasites deficient in PfAtg8, but growth rescued by IPP, had lost their apicoplast. We designed a suite of functional assays, including a new fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method for detection of the low-copy apicoplast genome, to interrogate specific steps in apicoplast biogenesis and detect apicoplast defects which preceded the block in parasite replication. Though protein import and membrane expansion of the apicoplast were unaffected, the apicoplast was not inherited by daughter parasites. Our findings demonstrate that, though multiple autophagy-dependent and independent functions have been proposed for PfAtg8, only its role in apicoplast biogenesis is essential. We propose that PfAtg8 is required for fission or segregation of the apicoplast during parasite replication.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is a typical allopolyploid with three homoeologous subgenomes (A, B, and D). The ancestors of the subgenomes A and D had been identified, but not for the subgenome B. The goatgrass Aegilops speltoides (genome SS) has been controversially considered a candidate for the ancestor of the wheat B genome. However, the relationship of the Ae. speltoides S genome with the wheat B genome remains largely obscure, which has puzzled the wheat research community for nearly a century. In the present study, the genome-wide homology analysis identified perceptible homology between wheat chromosome 1B and Ae. speltoides chromosome 1S, but not between other chromosomes in the B and S genomes. An Ae. speltoides-originated segment spanning a genomic region of approximately 10.46 Mb was identified on the long arm of wheat chromosome 1B (1BL). The Ae. speltoides-originated segment on 1BL was found to co-evolve with the rest of the B genome in wheat species. Thereby, we conclude that Ae. speltoides had been involved in the origin of the wheat B genome, but should not be considered an exclusive ancestor of this genome. The wheat B genome might have a polyphyletic origin with multiple ancestors involved, including Ae. speltoides. These novel findings provide significant insights into the origin and evolution of the wheat B genome, and will facilitate polyploid genome studies in wheat and other plants as well.",

Genetic analyses of such data typically present challenges, because of the choice of underlying hypotheses on genetic architecture of the studied disorders and phenotypes, large numbers of phenotypes, the appropriate multiple testing corrections, limited numbers of subjects, imputations required on missing phenotypes and genotypes, and the cross-disciplinary nature of the phenotype measures. Advances in genotype and phenotype imputation, and in genome-wide association (GWAS) methods, are useful in dealing with these challenges. As compared with the more traditional single-trait analyses, deep phenotyping with simultaneous genome-wide analyses serves as a discovery tool for previously unsuspected relationships of phenotypic traits with each other, and with specific molecular involvements.",

    "abstract": "Computational models posit that visual attention is guided by activity within spatial maps that index the image-computable salience and the behavioral relevance of objects in the scene. However, the simultaneous influence of these factors on putative neural  attentional priority maps in human cortex is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that visual salience and behavioral relevance independently impact the activation profile across retinotopically-organized cortical regions by quantifying attentional priority maps measured in human brains using functional MRI while participants attended one of two differentially-salient stimuli. We find that the topography of activation in priority maps, as reflected in the modulation of region-level patterns of population activity, independently indexed the physical salience and behavioral relevance of each scene element. Moreover, salience strongly impacted activation patterns in early visual areas, whereas later visual areas were dominated by relevance. This suggests that prioritizing spatial locations relies on distributed neural codes containing graded representations of salience and relevance across the visual hierarchy.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOften, it is necessary to orient towards bright, unique, or sudden events in the environment - that is, salient stimuli. However, we can focus processing resources on less salient visual information if it is relevant to the task at hand. We tested a theory which supposes that we represent different scene elements according to both their salience and their relevance in a series of  priority maps by measuring fMRI activation patterns across the human brain and reconstructing spatial maps of the visual scene under different task conditions. We found that different regions indexed either the salience or the relevance of scene items, but not their interaction, suggesting an evolving representation of salience and relevance across different visual areas.",

However, humans seamlessly integrate signals from the faces and voices of others for optimal social interaction. How are emotional expressions, when delivered by different sensory modalities (faces and voices), integrated in the brain? In this study, we characterized the brains response to faces, voices, and combined face-voice information (congruent, incongruent), which varied in expression (neutral, fearful). Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) responded more to bimodal stimuli than to face or voice alone but only when the stimuli contained emotional expression. Face-and voice-selective regions of interest extracted from independent functional localizers, similarly revealed multisensory integration in the face-selective rpSTS only; further, this was the only face-selective region that also responded significantly to voices. Dynamic Causal Modeling revealed that the rpSTS receives unidirectional information from the face-selective fusiform face area (FFA), and voice-selective temporal voice area (TVA), with emotional expression affecting the connection strength. Our study promotes a hierarchical model of face and voice integration, with convergence in the rpSTS, and that such integration depends on the (emotional) salience of the stimuli.",
