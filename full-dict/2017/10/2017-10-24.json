    "abstract": "Dissecting the physiological circuitry underlying diverse human complex traits associated with heritable common mutations is an ongoing effort. The primary challenge involves identifying the relevant cell types and the causal variants among the vast majority of the associated mutations in the noncoding regions. To address this challenge, we developed an efficient probabilistic framework. First, we propose a sparse group-guided learning algorithm to infer cell-type-specific enrichments. Second, we propose a fine-mapping Bayesian model that incorporates as Bayesian priors the sparse enrichments to infer risk variants. Using the proposed framework to analyze 32 complex human traits revealed meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments indicative of the relevant disease pathologies. The prioritized variants exhibit prominent tissue-specific epigenomic signatures and significant enrichments for eQTL and conserved elements. Together, we demonstrate the general benefits of the proposed integrative framework in elucidating meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic elements from large-scale correlated annotations and the implicated functional variants for future experimental interrogation.",

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the surface-based methods for assessment of cortical volume and area from magnetic resonance images shows that volume mostly mirrors variability in surface area, while having little sensitivity to cortical thickness, and this remains the case even when volume is assessed using an improved analytic method. Using data from young adults born with very low birth weight and coetaneous controls, it is demonstrated that the permutation-based non-parametric combination (NPC) of thickness and area is more sensitive than volume for studying joint effects on these two quantities, giving equal weight to variation in both. NPC can replace current analyses of cortical volume altogether, allowing a better characterisation of processes that can concomitantly influence brain anatomy, even when their effects are in opposite directions. The method is remarkably general and can be extended to other indices of brain structure and function.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in sensory neuroscience involves understanding how neural circuits shape computations across cascaded cell layers. Here we develop a computational framework to reconstruct the response properties of experimentally unobserved neurons in the interior of a multilayered neural circuit. We combine non-smooth regularization with proximal consensus algorithms to overcome difficulties in fitting such models that arise from the high dimensionality of their parameter space. Our methods are statistically and computationally efficient, enabling us to rapidly learn hierarchical non-linear models as well as efficiently compute widely used descriptive statistics such as the spike triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) for high dimensional stimuli. For example, with our regularization framework, we can learn the STA and STC using 5 and 10 minutes of data, respectively, at a level of accuracy that otherwise requires 40 minutes of data without regularization. We apply our framework to retinal ganglion cell processing, learning cascaded linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) models of retinal circuitry, consisting of thousands of parameters, using 40 minutes of responses to white noise. Our models demonstrate a 53% improvement in predicting ganglion cell spikes over classical linear-nonlinear (LN) models. Internal nonlinear subunits of the model match properties of retinal bipolar cells in both receptive field structure and number. Subunits had consistently high thresholds, leading to sparse activity patterns in which only one subunit drives ganglion cell spiking at any time. From the model's parameters, we predict that the removal of visual redundancies through stimulus decorrelation across space, a central tenet of efficient coding theory, originates primarily from bipolar cell synapses. Furthermore, the composite nonlinear computation performed by retinal circuitry corresponds to a boolean OR function applied to bipolar cell feature detectors. Our general computational framework may aid in extracting principles of nonlinear hierarchical sensory processing across diverse modalities from limited data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryComputation in neural circuits arises from the cascaded processing of inputs through multiple cell layers. Each of these cell layers performs operations such as filtering and thresholding in order to shape a circuits output. It remains a challenge to describe both the computations and the mechanisms that mediate them given limited data recorded from a neural circuit. A standard approach to describing circuit computation involves building quantitative encoding models that predict the circuit response given its input, but these often fail to map in an interpretable way onto mechanisms within the circuit. In this work, we build two layer linear-nonlinear cascade models (LN-LN) in order to describe how the retinal output is shaped by nonlinear mechanisms in the inner retina. We find that these LN-LN models, fit to ganglion cell recordings alone, identify filters and nonlinearities that are readily mapped onto individual circuit components inside the retina, namely bipolar cells and the bipolar-to-ganglion cell synaptic threshold. This work demonstrates how combining simple prior knowledge of circuit properties with partial experimental recordings of a neural circuits output can yield interpretable models of the entire circuit computation, including parts of the circuit that are hidden or not directly observed in neural recordings.",

    "abstract": "We present a new phylogenetic approach SelAC (Selection on Amino acids and Codons), whose substitution rates are based on a nested model linking protein expression to population genetics. Unlike simpler codon models which assume a single substitution matrix for all sites, our model more realistically represents the evolution of protein coding DNA under the assumption of consistent, stabilizing selection using cost-benefit approach. This cost-benefit approach allows us generate a set of 20 optimal amino acid specific matrix families using just a handful of parameters and naturally links the strength of stabilizing selection to protein synthesis levels, which we can estimate. Using a yeast dataset of 100 orthologs for 6 taxa, we find SelAC fits the data much better than popular models by 104-105 AICc units. Our results indicate there is great potential for more accurate inference of phylogenetic trees and branch lengths from already existing data through the use of nested, mechanistic models. Additional parameters estimated by SelAC indicate that a large amount of non-phylogenetic, but biologically meaningful, information can be inferred from exisiting data. For example, SelAC prediction of gene specific protein synthesis rates correlates well with both empirical (r=0.33-0.48) and other theoretical predictions (r=0.45-0.64) for multiple yeast species. SelAC also provides estimates of the optimal amino acid at each site. Finally, because SelAC is a nested approach based on clearly stated biological assumptions, future modifications, such as including shifts in the optimal amino acid sequence within or across lineages, are possible.",

    "abstract": "Some nematode species are economically important parasites of livestock, while others are important human pathogens causing some of the most important neglected tropical diseases. In both humans and animals, anthelmintic drug administration is the main control strategy, but the emergence of drug-resistant worms has stimulated the development of alternative control approaches. Among these, vaccination is considered to be a sustainable and cost effective strategy. Currently, Barbervax(R) for the ruminant strongylid Haemonchus contortus is the only registered subunit vaccine for a nematode parasite, although a vaccine for the human hookworm Necator americanus is undergoing clinical trials (HOOKVAC consortium). As both these vaccines comprise a limited number of proteins there is potential for selection of nematodes with altered sequence or expression of the vaccine antigens. Here we compared the transcriptome of H. contortus populations from sheep vaccinated with Barbervax(R) with worms from control animals. Barbervax(R) antigens are native integral membrane proteins isolated from the brush border of the intestinal cells of the adult parasite and many of them are proteases. Our findings provide no evidence for changes in expression of genes encoding Barbervax(R) antigens in the surviving parasite populations. However, surviving parasites from vaccinated animals showed increased expression of other proteases and regulators of lysosome trafficking, and displayed up-regulated lipid storage and defecation abilities that may have circumvented the vaccine effect. Implications for other potential vaccines for human and veterinary nematodes are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Totally Asymmetric Exclusion Process (TASEP) is a classical stochastic model for describing the transport of interacting particles, such as ribosomes moving along the mRNA during translation. Although this model has been widely studied in the past, the extent of collision between particles and the average distance between a particle to its nearest neighbor have not been quantified explicitly. We provide here a theoretical analysis of such quantities via the distribution of isolated particles. In the classical form of the model in which each particle occupies only a single site, we obtain an exact analytic solution using the Matrix Ansatz. We then employ a refined mean field approach to extend the analysis to a generalized TASEP with particles of an arbitrary size. Our theoretical study has direct applications in mRNA translation and the interpretation of experimental ribosome profiling data. In particular, our analysis of data from S. cerevisiae suggests a potential bias against the detection of nearby ribosomes with gap distance less than ~ 3 codons, which leads to some ambiguity in estimating the initiation rate and protein production flux for a substantial fraction of genes. Despite such ambiguity, however, we demonstrate theoretically that the interference rate associated with collisions can be robustly estimated, and show that approximately 1% of the translating ribosomes get obstructed.",

    "abstract": "Many components of host-parasite interactions have been shown to affect the way virulence (i.e., parasite-induced harm to the host) evolves. However, coevolution of multiple parasite traits is often neglected. We explore how an immunosuppressive mechanism of parasites affects and co-evolves with virulence through multiple infections. Applying the adaptive dynamics framework to epidemiological models with coinfection, we show that immunosuppression is a double-edged-sword for the evolution of virulence. On one hand, it amplifies the adaptive benefit of virulence by increasing the abundance of coinfections through epidemiological feedbacks. On the other hand, immunosuppression hinders host recovery, prolonging the duration of infection and elevating the cost of killing the host. The balance between the cost and benefit of immunosuppression varies across different background mortality rates of hosts. In addition, we find that immunosuppression evolution is influenced considerably by the precise trade-off shape determining the effect of immunosuppression on host recovery and susceptibility to further infection. These results demonstrate that the evolution of virulence is shaped by immunosuppression while highlighting that the evolution of immune evasion mechanisms deserves further research attention.",

Critically, despite this large heterogeneity, we were able to visualize nanometer-sized epigenetic domains at the single-cell level.

How the binding activities of non-motor MAPs are coordinated and how they contribute to the balance and distribution of microtubule motor transport is unknown. Here, we examine the relationship between MAP7 and tau due to their antagonistic effects on neuronal branch formation and kinesin motility in vivo1-8. We find that MAP7 and tau compete for binding to microtubules, and determine a mechanism by which MAP7 displaces tau from the lattice. In striking contrast to the inhibitory effect of tau, MAP7 promotes kinesin-based transport in vivo and strongly enhances kinesin-1 binding to the microtubule in vitro, providing evidence for direct enhancement of motor motility by a MAP. In contrast, both MAP7 and tau strongly inhibit kinesin-3 and have no effect on cytoplasmic dynein, demonstrating that MAPs exhibit differential control over distinct classes of motors. Overall, these results reveal a general principle for how MAP competition dictates access to the microtubule to determine the correct distribution and balance of molecular motor activity.",

It is indeed a powerful tool for the study of microbial communities which requires equally powerful methods of analysis. Current challenges in the analysis of metagenomic data include the comparative study of samples, the degree of uncertainty in the results, and the removal of contamination. The scarcer the microbes are in an environment, the more essential it is to have solutions to these issues. Examples of sites with few microbes are not only habitats with low levels of nutrients, but also many body tissues and fluids. Recentrifuges novel approach combines statistical, mathematical and computational methods to tackle those challenges with efficiency and robustness: it seamlessly removes diverse contamination, provides a confidence level for every result, and unveils the generalities and specificities in the metagenomic samples.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, much technical progress has been done regarding plant phenotyping including the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. With automated, high-throughput platforms and the development of improved algorithms for the rosette segmentation task, it is now possible to massively extract reliable shape and size parameters for genetic, physiological and environmental studies. The development of low-cost phenotyping platforms and freeware resources make it possible to widely expand phenotypic analysis tools for Arabidopsis. However, objective descriptors of shape parameters that could be used independently of platform and segmentation software used are still lacking and shape descriptions still rely on ad hoc or even sometimes contradictory descriptors, which could make comparisons difficult and perhaps inaccurate. Modern geometric morphometrics is a family of methods in quantitative biology proposed to be the main source of data and analytical tools in the emerging field of phenomics studies. It has been used for taxonomists and paleontologists for decades and is now a mature discipline. By combining geometry, multivariate analysis and powerful statistical techniques, it offers the possibility to reproducibly and accurately account for shape variations amongst groups. Based on the location of homologous landmarks points over photographed or scanned specimens, these tools could identify the existence and degree of shape variation and measure them in standard units. Here, it is proposed a particular scheme of landmarks placement on Arabidopsis rosette images to study shape variation in the case study of viral infection processes. Several freeware-based geometric morphometric tools are applied in order to exemplify the usefulness of this approach to the study of phenotypes in this model plant. These methods are concisely presented and explained. Shape differences between controls and infected plants are quantified throughout the infectious process and visualized with the appealing graphs that are a hallmark of these techniques and render complex mathematical analysis simple outcomes to interpret. Quantitative comparisons between two unrelated ssRNA+ viruses are shown and reproducibility issues are assessed. Combined with the newest automatons and plant segmentation procedures, geometric morphometric tools could boost phenotypic features extraction and processing in an objective, reproducible manner.",

For most drug development applications, it is important to predict not only the mean response to an intervention but also the distribution of responses, due to inter-patient variability. Given the necessary complexity of QSP models, and the sparsity of relevant human data, the parameters of QSP models are often not well determined. One approach to overcome these limitations is to develop alternative virtual patients (VPs) and virtual populations (Vpops), which allow for the exploration of parametric uncertainty and reproduce inter-patient variability in response to perturbation. Here we evaluated approaches to improve the efficiency of generating Vpops. We aimed to generate Vpops without sacrificing diversity of the VPs pathophysiologies and phenotypes. To do this, we built upon a previously published approach (Allen, Rieger et al. 2016) by (a) incorporating alternative optimization algorithms (genetic algorithm and Metropolis-Hastings) or alternatively (b) augmenting the optimized objective function. Each method improved the baseline algorithm by requiring significantly fewer plausible patients (precursors to VPs) to create a reasonable Vpop. #ddct #qsp",

    "abstract": "Reliable detection of somatic variations is of critical importance in cancer research. Lancet is an accurate and sensitive somatic variant caller which detects SNVs and indels by jointly analyzing reads from tumor and matched normal samples using colored DeBruijn graphs. Extensive experimental comparison on synthetic and real whole-genome sequencing datasets demonstrates that Lancet has better accuracy, especially for indel detection, than widely used somatic callers, such as MuTect, MuTect2, LoFreq, Strelka, and Strelka2. Lancet features a reliable variant scoring system which is essential for variant prioritization and detects low frequency mutations without sacrificing the sensitivity to call longer insertions and deletions empowered by the local assembly engine. In addition to genome-wide analysis, Lancet allows inspection of somatic variants in graph space, which augments the traditional read alignment visualization to help confirm a variant of interest. Lancet is available as an open-source program at https://github.com/nygenome/lancet.",

    "abstract": "Animal behavior is the final and integrated output of the brain activity. Thus, recording and analyzing behavior is critical to understand the underlying brain function. While recording animal behavior has become easier than ever with the development of compact and inexpensive devices, detailed behavioral data analysis requires sufficient previous knowledge and/or high content data such as video images of animal postures, which makes it difficult for most of the animal behavioral data to be efficiently analyzed to understand brain function. Here, we report a versatile method using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning approach to efficiently estimate behavioral states and to extract important behavioral features only from low-content animal trajectory data. As proof of principle experiments, we analyzed trajectory data of worms, fruit flies, rats, and bats in the laboratories, and penguins and flying seabirds in the wild, which were recorded with various methods and span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales--from mm to 1000 km in space and from sub-seconds to days in time. We estimated several states during behavior and comprehensively extracted characteristic features from a behavioral state and/or a specific experimental condition. Physiological and genetic experiments in worms revealed that the extracted behavioral features reflected specific neural or gene activities. Thus, our method provides a versatile and unbiased way to extract behavioral features from simple trajectory data to understand brain function.",

    "abstract": "Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites are short tandem repeats of DNA sequences that are 1-6 bp long. In plants, SSRs serve as a source of important class of molecular markers because of their hypervariabile and co-dominant nature, making them useful both for the genetic studies and marker-assisted breeding. The SSRs are widespread throughout the genome of an organism, so that a large number of SSR datasets are available, most of them from either protein-coding regions or untranslated regions. It is only recently, that their occurrence within microRNAs (miRNA) genes has received attention. As is widely known, miRNA themselves are a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with varying length of 19-22 nucleotides (nts), which play an important role in regulating gene expression in plants under different biotic and abiotic stresses. In this communication, we describe the results of a study, where miRNA-SSRs in full length pre-miRNA sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana were mined. The sequences were retrieved by annotations available at EnsemblPlants using BatchPrimer3 server with miRNA-SSR flanking primers found to be well distributed. Our analysis shows that miRNA-SSRs are relatively rare in protein-coding regions but abundant in non-coding region. All the observed 147 di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide SSRs were located in non-coding regions of all the 5 chromosomes of A. thaliana. While we confirm that miRNA-SSRs were commonly spread across the full length pre-miRNAs, we envisage that such studies would allow us to identify newly discovered markers for breeding studies.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) is widely used to identify causal relationships among heritable traits, but it can be confounded by genetic correlations reflecting shared etiology. We propose a model in which a latent causal variable mediates the genetic correlation between two traits. Under the latent causal variable (LCV) model, trait 1 is fully genetically causal for trait 2 if it is perfectly genetically correlated with the latent causal variable, implying that the entire genetic component of trait 1 is causal for trait 2; it is partially genetically causal for trait 2 if it has a high genetic correlation with the latent variable, implying that part of the genetic component of trait 1 is causal for trait 2. To quantify the degree of partial genetic causality, we define the genetic causality proportion (gcp). We fit this model using mixed fourth moments E([Formula]12) and E([Formula]12) of marginal effect sizes for each trait, exploiting the fact that if trait 1 is causal for trait 2 then SNPs affecting trait 1 (large [Formula]) will have correlated effects on trait 2 (large 12), but not vice versa. We performed simulations under a wide range of genetic architectures and determined that LCV, unlike state-of-the-art MR methods, produced well-calibrated false positive rates and reliable gcp estimates in the presence of genetic correlations and asymmetric genetic architectures; we also determined that LCV is well-powered to detect a causal effect. We applied LCV to GWAS summary statistics for 52 traits (average N=331k), identifying partially or fully genetically causal effects (1% FDR) for 59 pairs of traits, including 30 pairs of traits with high gcp estimates (g[c]p > 0.6). Results consistent with the published literature included genetically causal effects on myocardial infarction (MI) for LDL, triglycerides and BMI. Novel findings included a genetically causal effect of LDL on bone mineral density, consistent with clinical trials of statins in osteoporosis. These results demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between genetic correlation and causation using genetic data.",

Here I report a faster immune priming, which can be triggered by an injection of gelatin or collagen, that confers a complete infection resistance to Gram-negative bacteria on silkworms. Gelatin-injected silkworms showed 100% viability in a lethal dose of a Gram-negative bacterial infection within two hours after the gelatin injection. Injection of collagen showed a similar effect. Whereas, an injection of non-gelatin protein (bovine serum albumin) solution did not induce such reaction. These results suggest that the silkworm possesses a fast and gelatin-inducible pathway that confers infection resistance to Gram-negative bacteria, which may act as a front-line defense. This finding highlights the potency of gelatin as a tool for investigating the primed immune responses in insect species.",

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is one of the most common and lethal birth defects. Previous studies using exome sequencing support a significant contribution of coding de novo variants in complex CDH cases with additional anomalies and likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants in isolated CDH cases. To further investigate the genetic architecture of CDH, we performed exome or genome sequencing in 283 proband-parent trios. Combined with data from previous studies, we analyzed a total of 357 trios, including 148 complex and 209 isolated cases. Complex and isolated cases both have a significant burden of deleterious de novo coding variants (1.7~fold, p= 1.2x10-5 for complex, 1.5~fold, p= 9.0x10-5 for isolated). Strikingly, in isolated CDH, almost all of the burden is carried by female cases (2.1~fold, p=0.004 for likely gene disrupting and 1.8~fold, p= 0.0008 for damaging missense variants); whereas in complex CDH, the burden is similar in females and males. Additionally, de novo LGD variants in complex cases are mostly enriched in genes highly expressed in developing diaphragm, but distributed in genes with a broad range of expression levels in isolated cases. Finally, we identified a new candidate risk gene MYRF (4 de novo variants, p-value=2x10-10), a transcription factor intolerant of mutations. Patients with MYRF mutations have additional anomalies including congenital heart disease and genitourinary defects, likely representing a novel syndrome.",

A bimodal relationship has been proposed, where delirium is particularly adverse for those with underlying frailty, but may have a smaller effect (perhaps even protective) if it is an early indicator of acute illness in fitter people. We investigated the impact of delirium on mortality in a cohort simultaneously evaluated for frailty.\\n\\nMethodsWe undertook an exploratory analysis of a cohort of consecutive acute medical admissions aged [&ge;]70. Delirium on admission was ascertained by psychiatrists. A Frailty Index (FI) was derived according to a standard approach. Deaths were notified from linked national mortality statistics. Cox regression was used to estimate associations between delirium, frailty and their interactions on mortality.\\n\\nResultsThe sample consisted of 710 individuals. Both delirium and frailty were independently associated with increased mortality rates (delirium: HR 2.4, 95%CI 1.8-3.3, p<0.01; frailty (per SD): HR 3.5, 95%CI 1.2-9.9, p=0.02). Estimating the effect of delirium in tertiles of FI, mortality was greatest in the lowest tertile: tertile 1 HR 3.4 (95%CI 2.1-5.6); tertile 2 HR 2.7 (95%CI 1.5-4.6); tertile 3 HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-3.0).\\n\\nConclusionWhile delirium and frailty contribute to mortality, the overall impact of delirium on admission appears to be greater at lower levels of frailty. In contrast to the hypothesis that there is a bimodal distribution for mortality, delirium appears to be particularly adverse when precipitated in fitter individuals.",

    "abstract": "Cortical sensory systems often activate in parallel, even when stimulation is experienced through a single sensory modality1-3. Critically, the functional relationship between coactivated cortical systems is unclear: Co-activations may reflect the interactive coupling between information-linked cortical systems or merely parallel but independent sensory processing. Here, we report causal evidence that human somatosensory cortex (S1), which co-activates with auditory cortex during the processing of vibrations and textures4-9, interactively couples to cortical systems that support auditory perception. Acute manipulation of S1 activity using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) impairs auditory frequency perception when subjects simultaneously attend to auditory and tactile frequency, but not when attention is directed to audition alone. Auditory frequency perception is unaffected by TMS over visual cortex thus confirming the privileged coupling between the somatosensory and auditory cortical systems in temporal frequency processing10-13. Our results provide a key demonstration that selective attention can enhance the functional coupling between cortical systems that support different sensory modalities. The gating of crossmodal coupling by selective attention may critically support multisensory interactions and feature-specific perception.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsS.C. and J.M.Y. designed the study and wrote the manuscript.

Sequences of 500-520 bp were analysed and found to be A+T rich. Rate of transitions was higher than transversions.

The genetic distances calculated by K2P model, showed the interspecific distances range more than 8.2%, while the intraspecific distance range had not exceed 0.8%. The 1000 bootstrapped Neighbour-joining tree and Maximum likelihood tree were constructed to establish the phylogenetic relationship between the different muscid species.

    "abstract": "The environment and lifestyle of a species are known to exert selective pressure on the visual system, often demonstrating a tight link between visual morphology and ecology. Many studies have predicted the visual requirements of a species by examining the anatomical features of the eye. However, among the vast number of studies on visual specializations in aquatic animals, only a few have focused on small benthic fishes that occupy a heterogeneous and spatially complex visual environment. This study investigates the general retinal anatomy including the topography of both the photoreceptor and ganglion cell populations and estimates the spatial resolving power of the eye of the Mediterranean triplefin Tripterygion delaisi. Retinal wholemounts were prepared to systematically and quantitatively analyze photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cell densities using design-based stereology. To further examine the retinal structure, we also used magnetic resonance imaging and histological examination of retinal cross sections. Observations of the triplefin's eyes revealed them to be highly mobile, allowing them to view the surroundings without body movements. A rostral aphakic gap and the elliptical shape of the eye extend its visual field rostrally and allow for a rostro-caudal accommodatory axis, enabling this species to focus on prey at close range. Single and twin cones dominate the retina and are consistently arranged in one of two regular patterns, which may enhance motion detection and color vision. The retina features a prominent, dorso-temporal, convexiclivate fovea with an average density of 104,400 double and 30,800 single cones per mm2, and 81,000 retinal ganglion cells per mm2. Based on photoreceptor spacing, spatial resolving power was calculated to be between 6.7 and 9.0 cycles per degree. Location and resolving power of the fovea would benefit the detection and identification of small prey in the lower frontal region of the visual field.",

Even though the biochemistry of CRISPR interference has been largely covered, the biophysics of DNA unwinding and coupling of the helicase and nuclease domains of Cas3 remains elusive. Here we employed single-molecule FRET to probe the helicase activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution. We show that Cas3 remains tightly associated with the target-bound Cascade complex while reeling in the target DNA using a spring-loaded mechanism. This spring-loaded reeling occurs in distinct bursts of three base pairs, that each underlie three successive 1-nt unwinding events. Reeling is highly repetitive, compensating for inefficient nicking activity of the nuclease domain. Our study reveals that the discontinuous helicase properties of Cas3 and its tight interaction with Cascade ensure well controlled degradation of target DNA only.",

    "abstract": "Adherin-junctions are traditionally described by the homophilic-interactions of classical cadherin-proteins at the extracellular region. However, the role of long-chain non-classical cadherins like cadherin-23(Cdh23) is not explored as yet even though it is implicated in tissue-morphogenesis, cancer, and force-sensing in neuronal tissues. Here, we identified a novel antiparallel-binding interface of Cdh23 homodimer in solution by combining biophysical and computational methods, in-vitro cell-binding, and mutational modifications. The dimer consists of two electrostatic-based interfaces extended up to two terminal domains, atypical to classical-cadherins known so far, and forms the strongest interactions in cadherin-family as measured using single-molecule force-spectroscopy. We further identified single point-mutation, E78K, that completely disrupts this binding. Interestingly, the mutation, S77L, found in skin cancers falls within the binding interface of the antiparallel-dimer. Overall, we provide the molecular architecture of Cdh23 at the cell-cell junctions which are likely to have far-reaching applications in the fields of mechanobiology and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Simple, novel techniques developed for separation and simultaneous direct morphometric study of Amber micro fragments (AMF) from tropical beach sand are reported yielding rich information on unidentified fossilized microfungi. Sieves of different mesh sizes were used to separate AMF from tropical beach sand. Fractions below 150 m which proved rich in AMF were used for manual retrieval using stereomicroscope. A handprinted slide microarray having 4 X 12 squares used for microscopic examination of multiple AMF mounts revealed AMF having either rough or smooth surfaces and with or without microinclusions. The microinclusions could be morphologically attributed to fungi. The potential for systematic and comprehensive studies to retrieve and examine AMF at high frequency from tropical beach sand in the world and especially those which are threatened due to sea level rise due to climate change was demonstrated. The potential of retrievable AMF from tropical beach sand in microbiological, metagenomic studies and as biological proxies to reconstruct bygone biospheres has been highlighted.\\n\\nSummaryNovel techniques for retrieval of AMF and visualization using slide microarray are described. Sand samples from various locations from Goa were collected by pool sampling method. Microscopic study helped to reveal that fraction between 150 and below 53 m contained microscopic fragments of Amber ranging from size of within the size range of 70 m or below and with or without bio inclusions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic prediction models were, in principle, developed to include all the available marker information; with this approach, these models have shown in various crops moderate to high predictive accuracies. Previous studies in cassava have demonstrated that, even with relatively small training populations and low-density GBS markers, prediction models are feasible for genomic selection. In the present study, we prioritized SNPs in close proximity to genome regions with biological importance for a given trait. We used a number of strategies to select variants that were then included in single and multiple kernel GBLUP models. Specifically, our sources of information were transcriptomics, GWAS, and immunity-related genes, with the ultimate goal to increase predictive accuracies for Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD) severity.\\n\\nResultsWe used single and multi-kernel GBLUP models with markers imputed to whole genome sequence level to accommodate various sources of biological information; fitting more than one kinship matrix allowed for differential weighting of the individual marker relationships. We applied these GBLUP approaches to CBSD phenotypes (i.e., root infection and leaf severity three and six months after planting) in a Ugandan Breeding Population (n = 955). Three means of exploiting an established RNAseq experiment of CBSD-infected cassava plants were used. Compared to the biology-agnostic GBLUP model, the accuracy of the informed multi-kernel models increased the prediction accuracy only marginally (1.78% to 2.52%).\\n\\nConclusionsOur results show that markers imputed to whole genome sequence level do not provide enhanced prediction accuracies compared to using standard GBS marker data in cassava. The use of transcriptomics data and other sources of biological information resulted in prediction accuracies that were nominally superior to those obtained from traditional prediction models.",

In this study, an OTU belonging to Acetothermia was detected at high abundance in two full-scale anaerobic digesters. The first closed genome from this phylum was obtained by differential coverage binning of metagenomes and scaffolding with nanopore data. Genome annotation and metabolic reconstruction suggested an anaerobic chemoheterotrophic lifestyle in which the bacterium obtain energy and carbon via fermentation of peptides, amino acids, and simple sugars to acetate, formate, and hydrogen. The morphology was unusual and composed of a central rod-shaped cell with bipolar prosthecae as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy, Raman microspectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. We hypothesize that these prosthecae allow for increased nutrient uptake by greatly expanding the cell surface area, providing a competitive advantage under nutrient-limited conditions.",

Furthermore, prolonged cognitive engagement leads to mental fatigue, consisting of subjective feeling of exhaustion and decline in performance. Despite the intuitive characterization of fatigue as an increase in subjective effort perception, the effect of fatigue on effort cost has never been tested experimentally. To this end, sixty participants in 2 separate experiments underwent a forced-choice working memory task following either a fatigue-inducing (i.e. Stroop task) or a control manipulation. We measured subjective fatigue and effort as well as their objective behavioral signatures: performance decline and task avoidance, respectively. We found that fatigue-induced performance decline was correlated with task avoidance, while the feelings of fatigue and effort were unrelated to each other. Our findings highlight the discrepancy between subjective and objective manifestations of fatigue and effort, and provide valuable evidence feeding the ongoing theoretical debate on the nature of these constructs.",

In particular, the sensitivity of cerebral blood flow to activity changes in specific neurotransmitter systems remains unclear. We address this question by probing cerebral blood flow in healthy volunteers using seven established drugs with known dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms of action. We use a novel framework aimed at disentangling the observed effects to contribution from underlying neurotransmitter systems. We find for all evaluated compounds a reliable spatial link of respective cerebral blood flow changes with underlying neurotransmitter receptor densities corresponding to their primary mechanisms of action. The strength of these associations with receptor density is mediated by respective drug affinities. These findings suggest that cerebral blood flow is a sensitive brain-wide in-vivo assay of metabolic demands across a variety of neurotransmitter systems in humans.",

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the sensitivity of visual cortex to two of the most important image segmentation cues: relative motion and relative disparity. Relative motion and disparity cues were isolated using random-dot kinematograms and stereograms, respectively. For motion-defined boundaries, we found a strong retinotopically organized representation of a 2-degree radius motion-defined disk, starting in V1 and extending though V2 and V3. In the surrounding region, we observed phase-inverted activations indicative of suppression, extending out to at least 6 degrees of retinal eccentricity. For relative disparity, figure responses were only robust in V3, while suppression was observed in all early visual areas. When attention was captured at fixation, figure responses persisted while suppression did not, suggesting that suppression is generated by attentional feedback from higher-order visual areas. Outside of the early visual areas, several areas were sensitive to both types of cues, most notably hV4, LO1 and V3B, making them additional candidate areas for motion- and disparity-cue combination. The overall pattern of extra-striate activations is consistent with recent three-stream models of cortical organization.",

This study aimed to evaluate which factors in the reproductive process could be related to the lack of fruit set. In two consecutive years, establishment of a suitable polleniser and the stage of ovule development at anthesis as well as initial and final fruit set have been studied. In addition to this, the impact made by temperature fluctuations on the interaction between male gametophytes and female sporophytes was also analysed. Growth of the pollen tubes in the style and penetration into the nucellus as well as fruit set were more effective in cross-pollination than in open and self-pollination. A relative delay in ovule development was observed, and most ovules had an embryo sac with eight nuclei. Considering the results of the quantitiative parameter study of pollen tube growth in the ovary as well as the results of the stage of ovule development, a conclusion can be made that this cultivar is characterised by an extremely short effective period of pollination.",

    "abstract": "Individual bacterial lineages stably persist for years in the human gut microbiome1-3. However, the potential of these lineages to adapt during colonization of healthy people is not well understood2,4. Here, we assess evolution within individual microbiomes by sequencing the genomes of 602 Bacteroides fragilis isolates cultured from 12 healthy subjects. We find that B. fragilis within-subject populations contain substantial de novo nucleotide and mobile element diversity, which preserve years of within-person evolutionary history. This evolutionary history contains signatures of within-person adaptation to both subject-specific and common selective forces, including parallel mutations in sixteen genes. These sixteen genes are involved in cell-envelope biosynthesis and polysaccharide utilization, as well as yet under-characterized pathways. Notably, one of these genes has been shown to be critical for B. fragilis colonization in mice5, indicating that key genes have not already been optimized for survival in vivo. This lack of optimization, given historical signatures of purifying selection in these genes, suggests that varying selective forces with discordant solutions act upon B. fragilis in vivo. Remarkably, in one subject, two B. fragilis sublineages coexisted at a stable relative frequency over a 1.5-year period despite rapid adaptive dynamics within one of the sublineages. This stable coexistence suggests that competing selective forces can lead to B. fragilis niche-differentiation even within a single person. We conclude that B. fragilis adapts rapidly within the microbiomes of individual healthy people, providing a new route for the discovery of key genes in the microbiome and implications for microbiome stability and manipulation.",

These mutations are classically thought to occur either at low levels in progenitor cells or at the time of fertilization1,3 and are often assigned a low risk of recurrence in siblings4,5. Here, we directly assess the presence of de novo mutations in paternal sperm and discover abundant, germline-restricted mosaicism. From a cohort of ASD cases, employing single molecule genotyping, we found that four out of 14 fathers were germline mosaic for a putatively causative mutation transmitted to the affected child. Three of these were enriched or exclusively present in sperm at high allelic fractions (AF; 7-15%); and one was recurrently transmitted to two additional affected children, representing clinically actionable information. Germline mosaicism was further assessed by deep (>90x) whole genome sequencing of four paternal sperm samples, which detected 12/355 transmitted de novo single nucleotide variants that were mosaic above 2% AF, and more than two dozen additional, non-transmitted mosaic variants in paternal sperm. Our results demonstrate that germline mosaicism is an underestimated phenomenon, which has important implications for clinical practice and in understanding the basis of human disease. Genetic analysis of sperm can assess individualized recurrence risk following the birth of a child with a de novo disease, as well as the risk in any male planning to have children.",

Once thought to be limited to only a few animal species, polarization sensitivity is now known to be widespread across many taxonomic groups, and advances in experimental techniques are, in part, responsible for these discoveries. Nevertheless, its study remains challenging, perhaps because of our own poor sensitivity to the polarization of light, but equally as a result of the slow spread of new practices and methodological innovations within the field. In this review, we introduce the most important steps in designing and calibrating polarized stimuli, within the broader context of areas of current research and the applications of new techniques to key questions. Our aim is to provide a constructive guide to help researchers, particularly those with no background in the physics of polarization, to design robust experiments that are free from confounding factors.",

The Nature has encoded her messages in RNA molecules using only four alphabets A, U, C and G in which the nine member double-ring bases (adenine (A) and Guanine (G)) are purines, while the six member single-ring bases (cytosine (C) and uracil (U)) are pyrimidines. Four bases A, U, C and G of RNA sequences are divided into three kinds of classifications according to their chemical properties. One of the three classifications, the purine-pyrimidine class is important. In understanding the distribution (organization) of purines and pyrimidines over some of the non-coding regions of RNA, all miRNAs from three species of Family Hominidae (namely human, gorilla and chimpanzee) are considered. The distribution of purines and pyrimidines over miRNA shows deviation from randomness. Based on the quantitative metrics (fractal dimension, Hurst exponent, Hamming distance, distance pattern of purine-pyrimidine, purine-pyrimidine frequency distribution and Shannon entropy) five different clusters have been made.

    "abstract": "Human SAMHD1 (hSAMHD1) is a retroviral restriction factor that blocks HIV-1 infection by depleting the cellular nucleotides required for viral reverse transcription. SAMHD1 is allosterically activated by nucleotides that induce assembly of the active tetramer. Although the catalytic core of hSAMHD1 has been studied extensively, previous structures have not captured the regulatory SAM domain. In this study, we determined the first crystal structure of full-length SAMHD1 by capturing mouse SAMHD1 (mSAMHD1) structures in three different nucleotide bound states. Although mSAMHD1 and hSAMHD1 are highly similar in sequence and function, we found that mSAMHD1 possesses a more complex nucleotide-induced activation process, highlighting the regulatory role of the SAM domain. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of SAMHD1 activity, thereby will facilitate the improvement of HIV mouse models and the development of new therapies for certain cancers and autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "The activity of the histone lysine methyltransferase NSD2 is thought to play a driving role in oncogenesis. Both overexpression of NSD2 and point mutations that increase its catalytic activity are associated with a variety of human cancers. While NSD2 is an attractive therapeutic target, no potent, selective and cell-active inhibitors have been reported to date, possibly due to the challenging nature of developing high-throughput assays for NSD2. To establish a platform for the discovery and development of selective NSD2 inhibitors, multiple assays were optimized and implemented. Quantitative high-throughput screening was performed with full-length wild-type NSD2 and a nucleosome substrate against a diverse collection of known bioactives comprising 16,251 compounds. Actives from the primary screen were further interrogated with orthogonal and counter assays, as well as activity assays with the clinically relevant NSD2 mutants E1099K and T1150A. Five confirmed inhibitors were selected for follow-up, which included a radiolabeled validation assay, surface plasmon resonance studies, methyltransferase profiling, and histone methylation in cells. The identification of NSD2 inhibitors that bind the catalytic SET domain and demonstrate activity in cells validates the workflow, providing a template for identifying selective NSD2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "AimSince the Late Cretaceous, the Earth has gone through periods of climate change similar in scale and pace to the warming trend observed today in the Anthropocene. The impact of these ancient climatic events on the evolutionary trajectories of organisms provides clues on the organismal response to climate change, including extinction, migration or persistence. Here, we examine the evolutionary response to climate cooling/warming events of the clusioid families Calophyllaceae, Podostemaceae and Hypericaceae (CPH), and the genus Hypericum as test cases.\\n\\nLocationHolarctic.\\n\\nTime periodLate Cretaceous-Cenozoic\\n\\nMajor taxa studiedangiosperms\\n\\nMethodsWe use paleoclimate simulations, species distribution models and phylogenetic comparative approaches calibrated with fossils.\\n\\nResultsAncestral CPH lineages could have been distributed in the Holarctic 100 Ma, occupying tropical subhumid assemblages, a finding supported by the fossil record. Expansion to closed-canopy tropical rain forests occurred after 60 Ma, in the Cenozoic, in agreement with earlier ideas of a post-Cretaceous origin of current tropical rain forest. Cooling during this period triggered diversification declines on CPH tropical lineages, and was associated with a climatic shift towards temperate affinities in Hypericum. Hypericum subsequently migrated to tropical mountains where it encountered different temperate conditions than in the Holarctic.\\n\\nMain conclusionsWe hypothesize that most clusioid CPH lineages failed to adapt to temperate regimes during periods of Cenozoic climate change, and thus went extinct in the Holarctic. In contrast, boreotropical descendants including Hypericum that underwent niche evolution demonstrated selective advantages as climates became colder. Our results points toward macroevolutionary trajectories involving the altering fates of closely related clades that adapt to periods of global climate change versus those that do not. Moreover, they suggest the hypothesis that potentially many clades, particularly inhabitants of boreotropical floras, were likely extirpated from the Holarctic and persist today (if at all) in more southern tropical locations.",

    "abstract": "Acquisition of mutations is central to evolution but the detrimental effects of most mutations on protein folding and stability limit protein evolvability. Molecular chaperones, which suppress aggregation and facilitate polypeptide folding, are proposed to promote sequence diversification by buffering destabilizing mutations. However, whether and how chaperones directly control protein evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the effect of reducing the activity of the key eukaryotic chaperone Hsp90 on poliovirus evolution. Contrary to predictions of a buffering model, inhibiting Hsp90 increases population sequence diversity and promotes accumulation of mutations reducing protein stability. Explaining this counterintuitive observation, we find that Hsp90 offsets the evolutionary tradeoff between protein stability and aggregation. Lower chaperone levels favor sequence variants of reduced hydrophobicity, thus decreasing protein aggregation propensity but at a cost to protein stability. Notably, reducing Hsp90 activity also promotes clusters of codon-deoptimized synonymous mutations at inter-domain boundaries, likely to promote local ribosomal slowdown to facilitate cotranslational domain folding. Our results reveal how a chaperone can shape the sequence landscape at both the protein and RNA levels to harmonize the competing constraints posed by protein stability, aggregation propensity and translation rate on successful protein biogenesis.",

We compare these data to predictions of fish species numbers derived from the neutral theory of biodiversity combined with well-established ecological scaling laws, and measured oceanic biomass data. We consider several variants of these scaling laws, and we find that more large fish species exist compared to the prediction, which is especially true for elasmobranchs, possibly due to their overwhelmingly predatory niches. We find species numbers decreasing with occurrence depth somewhat quicker than our predictions based on the decrease of the number of individuals with depth indicates. This is especially true for the elasmobranchs. This is unsurprising, since the individuals versus depth data did not specifically determine elasmobranch biomass, and since sharks are known to be limited to depths < 3,000 m.\\n\\nFinally, we discuss how a reduced rate of speciation in larger animals could explain why large species are rare, in spite of the advantages of large body sizes outlined in Copes rule.",

    "abstract": "Heritable variation in gene expression provides a critical bridge between differences in genome sequence and the biology of many traits, including common human diseases. However, the sources of most regulatory genetic variation remain unknown. Here, we used transcriptome profiling in 1,012 yeast segregants to map the genetic basis of variation in gene expression with high statistical power. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that together account for over 70% of the total genetic contribution to variation in mRNA levels, allowing us to examine the sources of regulatory variation comprehensively. We found that variation in the expression of a typical gene has a complex genetic architecture involving multiple eQTL. We also detected hundreds of eQTL pairs with significant non-additive interactions in an unbiased genome-wide scan. Although most genes were influenced by a local eQTL located close to the gene, most expression variation arose from distant, trans-acting eQTL located far from their target genes. Nearly all distant eQTL clustered at 102 \\\"hotspot\\\" locations, some of which influenced the expression of thousands of genes. Hotspot regions were enriched for transcription factor genes and altered expression of their target genes though both direct and indirect mechanisms. Many local eQTL had no detectable effects on the expression of other genes in trans. These results reveal the complexity of genetic influences on transcriptome variation in unprecedented depth and detail.",

Less is known about how weight gain in early childhood is influenced by gut, and particularly oral, microbiomes. Here we analyze the relationships among weight gain and gut and oral microbiomes in 226 two-year-olds who were followed during the first two years of life, as part of a larger study, with weight and length measured at seven time points. We used these data to identify children with rapid weight gain (a strong risk factor for childhood obesity), and to derive growth curves with novel Functional Data Analysis (FDA) techniques. The childrens oral and gut microbiomes were sampled at the end of the two-year period, and surveyed with 16S sequencing. First, we show that growth curves are associated negatively with diversity and positively with Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio of the oral microbiome - a relationship that is also observed in children with rapid (vs. non-rapid) weight gain. We also demonstrate an association between the gut microbiome and child growth, but only when considering the effect of diet on the microbiome. Lastly, we identify several bacterial genera that are associated with child growth patterns. These results suggest that by the age of two, the oral microbiome may have already begun to establish patterns often seen in older obese individuals. They also suggest that the gut microbiome, while strongly influenced by diet, at age two does not harbor obesity signatures many researchers identified in later life stages.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of hospitalization for children under two years of age. RSV vaccines are currently unavailable, and children suffering from multiple reinfections by the same viral strain, fail to develop protective memory responses. Follicular helper T (TFH) cells specialize in providing B cell help to antibody production and affinity maturation, mainly via IL-21 secretion. Although RSV-specific antibodies can be detected upon infection, how they are generated and their relevance against disease protection has not been fully examined. Here, we observed that RSV expands a functionally impaired murine TFH cell population in vitro and vivo, with downregulated IL-21R expression and IL-21 production. IL-21 treatment of RSV-infected mice, however, increased TFH cells frequency, enhanced the germinal center reaction and improved protective humoral immune responses by increasing viral protein F specific antibody avidity and neutralization capacity. In vivo, it protected from RSV infection, decreasing lung inflammation. Passive immunization with purified IgG from IL-21 treated RSV-infected mice protected against RSV infection. Both viable and UV-inactivated RSV induced PD-L1 expression on B cells and DCs, however, only in DCs a direct effect of RSV was detected. Blocking PD-L1 during infection recovered IL-21R expression in TFH and B cells and increased secretion of IL-21 by TFH cells in a DC-dependent manner. Our results unveil a novel pathway by which RSV affects TFH cells activity, reducing levels of IL-21 and its receptor, by increasing PD-L1 expression on APCs. These results highlight the PD-L1/IL-21 axis importance for the generation of protective responses to RSV infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=176 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/203133_figGA1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (36K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@172470eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@197017eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e31ae3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa4c4f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG GRAPHICAL ABSTRACTRSV infection impairing IL-21 secretion by TFH cells via PD-L1induction in dendritic cells and B cells.

To assess brain-wide transcriptional diversity, we sequenced the transcriptomes of the largest collection of genetically and anatomically identified neuronal classes. Using improved expression metrics that distinguish information content from signal-to-noise-ratio, we found that homeobox transcription factors contain the highest information about cell types and have the lowest noise. Genes that contribute the most to neuronal diversity tend to be long and enriched in factors specifically involved in neuronal function. Genome accessibility measurements reveal that long genes have more candidate regulatory elements arrayed in more distinct patterns. These elements frequently overlap interspersed repeats (mobile elements) and the pattern of repeats is predictive of gene expression. New regulatory sites resulting from elongation of neuronal genes by mobile elements may be an evolutionary force enhancing nervous system complexity.",

Subsets of synaptic input can be selected or  gated by precise modulation of finely tuned EI balance, but assessing the granularity of EI balance requires combinatorial analysis of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Using patterned optogenetic stimulation of hippocampal CA3 neurons, we show that hundreds of unique CA3 input combinations recruit excitation and inhibition with a nearly identical ratio, demonstrating precise EI balance at the hippocampus. Crucially, the delay between excitation and inhibition decreases as excitatory input increases from a few synapses to tens of synapses. This creates a dynamic millisecond-range window for postsynaptic excitation, controlling membrane depolarization amplitude and timing via subthreshold divisive normalization. We suggest that this combination of precise EI balance and dynamic EI delays forms a general mechanism for millisecond-range input gating and subthreshold gain control in feedforward networks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDevelopmental cadmium exposure in vivo disrupts mammary gland differentiation, while exposure of breast cell lines to cadmium causes invasion consistent with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The effects of cadmium on normal human breast stem cell development have not been measured.\\n\\nObjectiveThe objective of this study was to quantify the effects of cadmium exposure on normal breast stem cell proliferation and differentiation.\\n\\nMethodsWe tested the effects of two physiologically relevant doses of cadmium: 250M and 2.5M on reduction mammoplasty patient-derived breast cells using the mammosphere assay, organoid formation in 3D hydrogels, and tested for molecular alterations using RNA-seq. We functionally validated our RNA-seq findings with a HIF-1 transcription factor activity reporter line and pharmaceutical inhibition of HIF-1 in mammosphere and organoid formation assays.\\n\\nResults2.5M cadmium reduced primary and secondary mammosphere formation and branching structure organoid formation rates by 33%, 40%, and 83%, respectively. Despite no changes in mammosphere formation, 0.25M cadmium treatment inhibited branching organoid formation in hydrogels by 68%. RNA-seq revealed that cadmium treatment downregulated genes associated with extracellular matrix formation and EMT, while upregulating genes associated with metal response including metallothioneins and zinc transporters. In the RNA-seq data, cadmium treatment also downregulated HIF-1 target genes including LOXL2, ZEB1, and VIM. Cadmium treatment significantly inhibited HIF-1 activity in a luciferase assay, and the HIF-1 inhibitor acriflavine ablated mammosphere and organoid formation.\\n\\nDiscussionThese findings show that cadmium, at doses relevant to human exposure, inhibited human mammary gland development, potentially through disruption of HIF-1 activity. These findings do not support cadmium being a breast cancer initiator via induction of stem cell proliferation, but instead implicate cadmium as an inhibitor of mammary gland morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCell-based regenerative medicine therapies are now frequently tested in clinical trials. In many conditions, cell therapies are administered systemically, but there is little understanding of their fate, and adverse events are often under-reported. Currently, it is only possible to assess safety and fate of cell therapies in preclinical studies, specifically by monitoring animals longitudinally using multimodal imaging approaches. Here, using a suite of in vivo imaging modalities to explore the fate of a range of human and murine cells, we investigate how route of administration, cell type and host immune status affect the fate of administered cells.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied a unique imaging toolkit combining bioluminescence, optoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging modalities to assess the safety of different human and murine cell types by following their biodistribution and persistence in mice following administration into the venous or arterial system. Results: Longitudinal imaging analyses (i) suggested that the intra-arterial route may be more hazardous than intravenous administration for certain cell types; (ii) revealed that the potential of a mouse mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) line to form tumours, depended on administration route and mouse strain; and (iii) indicated that clinically tested human umbilical cord (hUC)-derived MSCs can transiently and unexpectedly proliferate when administered intravenously to mice.\\n\\nConclusionsIn order to perform an adequate safety assessment of potential cell-based therapies, a thorough understanding of cell biodistribution and fate post administration is required. The non-invasive imaging toolbox used here can expose not only the general organ distribution of these therapies, but also a detailed view of their presence within different organs and, importantly, tumourigenic potential. Our observation that the hUC-MSCs but not the human bone marrow (hBM)-derived MSCs persisted for a period in some animals, suggests that therapies with these cells should proceed with caution.",
