    "abstract": "The occurrence of plant-associated oomycetes in natural ecosystems and particularly during long-term ecosystem development is largely unknown, despite the importance of many oomycetes as plant pathogens. Using DNA sequencing from roots, we investigated the frequency and host relationships of plant-associated oomycete communities along a 120 000 year glacial chronosequence, comprising site ages with rapid compositional change (\\\"early succession\\\"; 5, 15, and 70 years old soil); relatively stable higher-diversity sites (\\\"mature\\\", 280, 500, 1000, 5000, 12000 years); and ancient, nutrient-limited soils with declining plant diversity and stature (\\\"retrogression\\\", 60 000, 120 000 years). Plant-associated oomycetes were frequent in all three early successional sites, occurring in 38 - 65% of plant roots, but rare (average 3%) in all older ecosystems. Oomycetes were highly host specific, and more frequent on those plant species that declined most strongly in abundance between ecosystem ages. The results support the particular importance of plant-associated oomycetes in early succession (up to 70 years). High host specificity and correlations of abundance of oomycete inside roots with declining plant species are consistent with oomycete-driven successional change.",

    "abstract": "By following the evolution of populations that are initially genetically homogeneous, much can be learned about core biological principles. For example, it allows for detailed studies of the rate of emergence of de novo mutations and their change in frequency due to drift and selection. Unfortunately, in multicellular organisms with generation times of months or years, it is difficult to set up and carry out such experiments over many generations. An alternative is provided by \\\"natural evolution experiments\\\" that started from colonizations or invasions of new habitats by selfing lineages. With limited or missing gene flow from other lineages, new mutations and their effects can be easily detected. North America has been colonized in historic times by the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and although multiple intercrossing lineages are found today, many of the individuals belong to a single lineage, HPG1. To determine in this lineage the rate of substitutions - the subset of mutations that survived natural selection and drift -, we have sequenced genomes from plants collected between 1863 and 2006. We identified 73 modern and 27 herbarium specimens that belonged to HPG1. Using the estimated substitution rate, we infer that the last common HPG1 ancestor lived in the early 17th century, when it was most likely introduced by chance from Europe. Mutations in coding regions are depleted in frequency compared to those in other portions of the genome, consistent with purifying selection. Nevertheless, a handful of mutations is found at high frequency in present-day populations. We link these to detectable phenotypic variance in traits of known ecological importance, life history and growth, which could reflect their adaptive value. Our work showcases how, by applying genomics methods to a combination of modern and historic samples from colonizing lineages, we can directly study new mutations and their potential evolutionary relevance.",

    "abstract": "Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed \\\"Ouija\\\" that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify \\\"metastable\\\" states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories - that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods.

They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped.

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mek1 is a CHK2/Rad53-family kinase that regulates meiotic recombination and progression upon its activation in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The full catalog of direct Mek1 phosphorylation targets remains unknown. Here, we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 on threonine 11 (H3 T11ph) is induced by meiotic DSBs in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Molecular genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae confirmed that Mek1 is required for H3 T11ph and revealed that phosphorylation is rapidly reversed when Mek1 kinase is no longer active. Reconstituting histone phosphorylation in vitro with recombinant proteins demonstrated that Mek1 directly catalyzes H3 T11 phosphorylation. Mutating H3 T11 to nonphosphorylatable residues conferred no detectable defects in otherwise unperturbed meiosis, although the mutations modestly reduced spore viability in certain strains where Rad51 is used for strand exchange in place of Dmc1. H3 T11ph is therefore mostly dispensable for Mek1 function. However, H3 T11ph provides an excellent marker of ongoing Mek1 kinase activity in vivo. Anti-H3 T11ph chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing demonstrated that H3 T11ph was highly enriched at presumed sites of attachment of chromatin to chromosome axes, gave a more modest signal along chromatin loops, and was present at still lower levels immediately adjacent to DSB hotspots. These localization patterns closely tracked the distribution of Red1 and Hop1, axis proteins required for Mek1 activation. These findings provide insight into the spatial disposition of Mek1 kinase activity and the higher order organization of recombining meiotic chromosomes.\\n\\nbioRxiv version 2 (June 2017)One major experimental change was incorporated into the revised manuscript: We repeated the anti-H3 T11ph ChIP-seq experiment on larger scale, including two meiotic time points from each of two wild type cultures and one time point from a spo11-Y135F mutant culture. To facilitate comparison of different samples, we used meiotic S. pombe cells as a spike-in control for all samples for both anti-H3 and anti-H3 T11ph ChIP-seq. Most conclusions described in the first bioRxiv submission were confirmed, but the improved datasets allowed us to derive more detailed information in particular about H3 T11ph patterns around DSB sites.\\n\\nbioRxiv version 3 (October 2017)The following experimental changes were incorporated, along with more minor changes in response to reviewer comments: O_LIWe added previously unpublished ChIP-seq data for Red1 protein, generated by Masaru Ito and Kunihiro Ohta, who have been added as coauthors.\\nC_LIO_LIWe repeated key experiments with the H3-T11V single point mutant. No conclusions were changed relative to prior experiments with the H3-S10, T11V mutant.\\nC_LIO_LIWe repeated the analysis of spore viability in a dmc1 rad54-T132A background using a more appropriate isogenic control, and recapitulated the original conclusion that the H3-T11V mutation modestly decreases spore viability in this sensitized background.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "New architectures of multilayer artificial neural networks and new methods for training them are rapidly revolutionizing the application of machine learning in diverse fields, including business, social science, physical sciences, and biology. Interpreting deep neural networks, however, currently remains elusive, and a critical challenge lies in understanding which meaningful features a network is actually learning. We present a general method for interpreting deep neural networks and extracting network-learned features from input data. We describe our algorithm in the context of biological sequence analysis. Our approach, based on ideas from statistical physics, samples from the maximum entropy distribution over possible sequences, anchored at an input sequence and subject to constraints implied by the empirical function learned by a network. Using our framework, we demonstrate that local transcription factor binding motifs can be identified from a network trained on ChIP-seq data and that nucleosome positioning signals are indeed learned by a network trained on chemical cleavage nucleosome maps. Imposing a further constraint on the maximum entropy distribution also allows us to probe whether a network is learning global sequence features, such as the high GC content in nucleosome-rich regions. This work thus provides valuable mathematical tools for interpreting and extracting learned features from feed-forward neural networks.",

We validate these estimated effects in an independent dataset of [~]46,000 de novo mutations, and confirm our estimates are more accurate than previously published estimates based on ancestrally older variants without considering genomic features.

The activation of these G-proteins, known as the Rho of Plants (ROPs), by the plant hormone auxin, is known to promote certain protuberances on root hair cells, which are crucial for both anchorage and the uptake of nutrients from the soil. Our mathematical model for the activation of ROPs by the auxin gradient is an extension of the model of Payne and Grierson [PLoS ONE, 12(4), (2009)], and consists of a two-component Schnakenberg-type RD system with spatially heterogeneous coefficients on a 2-D domain. The nonlinear kinetics in this RD system model the nonlinear interactions between the active and inactive forms of ROPs. By using a singular perturbation analysis to study 2-D localized spatial patterns of active ROPs, it is shown that the spatial variations in the nonlinear reaction kinetics, due to the auxin gradient, lead to a slow spatial alignment of the localized regions of active ROPs along the longitudinal midline of the plant cell. Numerical bifurcation analysis, together with time-dependent numerical simulations of the RD system are used to illustrate both 2-D localized patterns in the model, and the spatial alignment of localized structures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTraditional health information systems are generally devised to support clinical data collection at the point of care. However, as the significance of the modern information economy expands in scope and permeates the healthcare domain, there is an increasing urgency for healthcare organisations to offer information systems that address the expectations of clinicians, researchers and the business intelligence community alike. Amongst other emergent requirements, the principal unmet need might be defined as the 3R principle (right data, right place, right time) to address deficiencies in organisational data flow while retaining the strict information governance policies that apply within the UK National Health Service (NHS). Here, we describe our work on creating and deploying a low cost structured and unstructured information retrieval and extraction architecture within Kings College Hospital, the management of governance concerns and the associated use cases and cost saving opportunities that such components present.\\n\\nResultsTo date, our CogStack architecture has processed over 300 million lines of clinical data, making it available for internal service improvement projects at Kings College London.

    "abstract": "A reduction in high-dimensional phenotypic states to a few degrees of freedom is essential to understand biological systems. One possible origin of such a reduction (as recently discussed) is the steady growth of cells that constrains each components replication rate. Here, in contrast, our aim is to investigate consequences of evolutionary robustness, which is shown to cause a stronger dimensional reduction in possible phenotypic changes in response to a variety of environmental conditions. First, we examined global protein expression changes in Escherichia coli after various environmental perturbations. Remarkably, they were proportional across components, across different types of environmental conditions, while the proportion coefficient corresponded to the change in growth rate. Because such global proportionality is not generic to all systems under a condition of steady growth, a new conceptual framework is then needed. We hypothesized that such proportionality is a result of evolution. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a cell model--with a huge number of components, that reproduces itself via a catalytic reaction network--and confirmed that common proportionality in the concentrations of all components is shaped through evolutionary processes to maximize cell growth (and therefore fitness) under a given environmental condition. Furthermore, we found that the changes in concentration across all components in response to environmental and evolutionary changes are constrained to the changes along a one-dimensional major axis within a huge-dimensional state space. On the basis of these observations, we propose a theory in which high-dimensional phenotypic changes after evolution are constrained to the points near a one-dimensional major axis that correlates with the growth rate, to achieve both evolutionary robustness and plasticity. By formulating this proposition in terms of dynamical systems, broad experimental and numerical results on phenotypic changes caused by evolution and adaptation are coherently explained.\\n\\nSummaryCells generally consist of thousands of components whose abundance levels change through adaptation and evolution. Accordingly, each steady cell state can be represented as a point in a high-dimensional space of component concentrations. In the context of equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, even though the state space is high-dimensional, macroscopic description only by a few degrees of freedom is possible for equilibrium systems; however, such characterization by a few degrees of freedom has not yet been achieved for cell systems. Given that they are not in equilibrium, we need some other constraint to be imposed. Here, by restricting our focus to a cellular state with steady growth that is achieved after evolution,we examine how the expression levels of its several components change under different environmental conditions. On the basis of analysis of protein expression levels in recent bacterial experiments as well as the results of simulations using a toy cell model consisting of thousands of components that are reproduced by catalytic reactions, we found that adaptation and evolutionary paths in high-dimensional state space are constrained to changes along a one-dimensional curve, representing a major axis for all the observed changes. Moreover, this one-dimensional structure emerges only after evolution and is not applicable to any system showing steady growth. This curve is determined by the growth rate of a cell, and thus it is possible to describe an evolved system by means of a growth rate function. All the observed results are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in high-dimensional states are nearly confined to the major axis in response to environmental, evolutionary, and stochastic perturbations. This description opens up the possibility to characterize a cell state as a macroscopic growth rate, as is the case for the thermodynamic potential. This approach can provide estimates of which phenotypic changes are theoretically more evolvable, as predicted simply from their observed environmental responses.",

    "abstract": "With advances in transcript profiling, the presence of transcriptional activities in intergenic regions has been well established in multiple model systems. However, whether intergenic expression reflects transcriptional noise or the activity of novel genes remains unclear. We identified intergenic transcribed regions (ITRs) in 15 diverse flowering plant species and found that the amount of intergenic expression correlates with genome size, a pattern that could be expected if intergenic expression is largely non-functional. To further assess the functionality of ITRs, we first built machine learning classifiers using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model that can accurately distinguish functional sequences (phenotype genes) and non-functional ones (pseudogenes and random unexpressed intergenic regions) by integrating 93 biochemical, evolutionary, and sequence-structure features. Next, by applying the models to ITRs, we found that 2,453 (21%) had features significantly similar to phenotype genes and thus were likely parts of functional genes, while an additional 17% resembled benchmark RNA genes. However, [~]60% of ITRs were more similar to nonfunctional sequences and should be considered transcriptional noise unless falsified with experiments. The predictive framework establish here provides not only a comprehensive look at how functional, genic sequences are distinct from likely non-functional ones, but also a new way to differentiate novel genes from genomic regions with noisy transcriptional activities.",

In this report, we unveil the detailed mechanism of how the dynamic interaction of thermodynamic states (critical states) enables the genome system to pass through the critical transition state to achieve genome reprogramming.\\n\\nSelf-organized criticality (SOC) control of overall expression provides a snapshot of self-organization and explains the coexistence of critical states at a certain experimental time point. The time-development of self-organization is dynamically modulated by exchanges in expression flux between critical states through the cell nucleus milieu, where sequential global perturbations involving activation-inhibition of multiple critical states occur from the early state to the late 2-cell state. Two cyclic fluxes act as feedback flow and generate critical-state coherent oscillatory dynamics. Dynamic perturbation of these cyclic flows due to vivid activation of the ensemble of low-variance expression (sub-critical state) genes allows the genome system to overcome a transition state during reprogramming.\\n\\nOur findings imply that a universal mechanism of long-term global RNA oscillation underlies autonomous SOC control, and the critical gene ensemble at a critical point (CP) drives genome reprogramming.

    "abstract": "Most breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis and treatment options beyond radiation and cytotoxic drugs, which have severe side effects, and hormonal treatments, which are or become ineffective for many patients, are urgently needed. This study reanalyzed existing data from three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a novel computational biostatistics approach (muGWAS), which had been validated in studies of 600-2000 subjects in epilepsy and autism. MuGWAS jointly analyzes several neighboring single nucleotide polymorphisms while incorporating knowledge about genetics of heritable diseases into the statistical method and about GWAS into the rules for determining adaptive genome-wide significance.\\n\\nResults from three independent GWAS of 1000-2000 subjects each, which were made available under the National Institute of Healths \\\"Up For A Challenge\\\" (U4C) project, not only confirmed cell-cycle control and receptor/AKT signaling, but, for the first time in breast cancer GWAS, also consistently identified many genes involved in endo-/exocytosis (EEC), most of which had already been observed in functional and expression studies of breast cancer. In particular, the findings include genes that translocate (ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ANO4, ABCA1) and metabolize (AGPAT3, AGPAT4, DGKQ, LPPR1) phospholipids entering the phosphatidylinositol cycle, which controls EEC. These novel findings suggest scavenging phospholipids via alpha-cyclodextrins (CD) as a novel intervention to control local spread of cancer, packaging of exosomes (which prepare distant microenvironment for organ-specific metastases), and endocytosis of {beta}1 integrins (which are required for spread of metastatic phenotype and mesenchymal migration of tumor cells).\\n\\nBeta-cyclodextrins ({beta}CD) have already been shown to be effective in in vitro and animal studies of breast cancer, but exhibits cholesterol-related ototoxicity. The smaller CDs also scavenges phospholipids, but cannot fit cholesterol. An in-vitro study presented here confirms hydroxypropyl (HP)-CD to be twice as effective as HP{beta}CD against migration of human cells of both receptor negative and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.\\n\\nIf the previous successful animal studies with {beta}CDs are replicated with the safer and more effective CDs, clinical trials of adjuvant treatment with CDs are warranted. Ultimately, all breast cancer are expected to benefit from treatment with HPCD, but women with triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) will benefit most, because they have fewer treatment options and their cancer advances more aggressively.",

The impact of normative variability in caregiving on such biobehavioral processes, however, is poorly understood. Here, we provide initial evidence that even subtle variability in normative caregiving shapes threat-related brain function and, potentially, associated psychopathology in adolescence. Specifically, we report that greater familial affective responsiveness is associated with heightened amygdala reactivity to interpersonal threat, particularly in adolescents having experienced relatively low recent stress. These findings extend the literature on the effects of caregiving extremes on brain function to subtle, normative variability, but suggest that presumably protective factors may be associated with increased risk-related amygdala reactivity. We consider these paradoxical associations with regard to studies of basic associative threat learning and further consider their relevance for understanding potential effects of caregiving on psychological development.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding gene regulatory enhancers are essential to transcription in mammalian cells. As a result, a large variety of experimental and computational strategies have been developed to identify cis-regulatory enhancer sequences. In practice, most studies consider enhancers identified by only a single method, and the concordance of enhancers identified by different methods has not been comprehensively evaluated. Here, we assess the similarities of enhancer sets identified by ten representative strategies in four biological contexts and evaluate the robustness of downstream conclusions to the choice of identification strategy. All pairs of enhancer sets we evaluated overlap significantly more than expected by chance; however, we also found significant dissimilarity between enhancer sets in their genomic characteristics, evolutionary conservation, and association with functional loci within each context. We find most regions identified as enhancers are supported by only one method. The disagreement is sufficient to influence interpretation of GWAS SNPs and eQTL, and to lead to disparate conclusions about enhancer biology and disease mechanisms. We also find only limited evidence that regions identified by multiple enhancer identification methods are better candidates than those identified by a single method. Our results highlight the inherent complexity of enhancer biology and argue that current approaches have yet to adequately account for enhancer diversity. As a result, we cannot recommend the use of any single enhancer identification strategy in isolation. To facilitate assessment of enhancer diversity on studies conclusions, we developed creDB, a database of enhancer annotations designed to integrate into bioinformatics workflows. While our findings highlight a major challenge to mapping the genetic architecture of complex disease and interpreting regulatory variants found in patient genomes, a systematic understanding of similarities and differences in enhancer identification methodology will ultimately enable robust inferences about gene regulatory sequences.",

    "abstract": "Viral diseases are a leading cause of worldwide yield losses in crop production. Breeding of resistance genes (R gene) into elite crop cultivars has been the standard and most cost-effective practice. However, R gene-mediated resistance is limited by the available R genes within genetic resources and in many cases, by strain specificity. Therefore, it is important to generate new and broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat, CRISPR-associated) editing system has been employed to confer resistance to human viruses and several plant single-stranded DNA geminiviruses, pointing out the possible application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for virus control. Here we demonstrate that strong viral resistance to cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), a pararetrovirus with a double-stranded DNA genome, can be achieved through Cas9-mediated multiplex targeting of the viral coat protein sequence. We further show that small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are produced and mostly map to the 3' end of guide RNAs (gRNA), although very low levels of siRNAs map to the spacer region as well. However, these siRNAs are not responsible for the inhibited CaMV infection because there is no resistance if Cas9 is not present. We have also observed edited viruses in systematically infected leaves in some transgenic plants, with short deletions or insertions consistent with Cas9-induced DNA breaks at the gRNA target sites in coat protein coding sequence. These edited coat proteins, in most cases, led to earlier translation stop and thus, non-functional coat proteins. We also recovered wild-type CP sequence in these infected transgenic plants, suggesting these edited viral genomes were packaged by wild-type coat proteins. Our data demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used for virus control against plant pararetroviruses with further modifications.",

We investigated the genetic architecture of family relationship satisfaction and friendship satisfaction in the UK Biobank.

We identified two genome-wide significant associations for both the phenotypes: rs1483617 on chromosome 3 and rs2189373 on chromosome 6, a region previously implicated in schizophrenia. eQTL and chromosome conformation capture in neural tissues prioritizes several genes including NLGN1. Gene-based association studies identified several significant genes, with highest expression in brain tissues. Genetic correlation analysis identified significant negative correlations for multiple psychiatric conditions including highly significant negative correlation with cross-psychiatric disorder GWAS, underscoring the central role of social relationship dissatisfaction in psychiatric diagnosis. The two phenotypes were enriched for genes that are loss of function intolerant. Both phenotypes had modest, significant additive SNP heritability of approximately 6%.

This method uses the intra-cellular proximity signal captured by Hi-C as a direct indicator of which sequences originated in the same cell, enabling culture-free de novo deconvolution of mixed genomes without any reliance on a priori information. We show that ProxiMeta deconvolution provides results of markedly high accuracy and sensitivity, yielding 50 near-complete microbial genomes (many of which are novel) from a single fecal sample, out of 252 total genome clusters. ProxiMeta outperforms traditional contig binning at high-quality genome reconstruction. ProxiMeta shows particularly good performance in constructing high-quality genomes for diverse but poorly-characterized members of the human gut. We further use ProxiMeta to reconstruct genome plasmid content and sharing of plasmids among genomes--tasks that traditional binning methods usually fail to accomplish. Our findings suggest that Hi-C-based deconvolution can be useful to a variety of applications in genomics and metagenomics.",

However, the mechanistic basis underlying inter-individual differences remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, we performed a large-scale genome wide analysis of HR-increase and HR-recovery in 58,818 individuals. A total of 25 significant independent SNPs in 23 loci (P<8.3x10-9) were associated with HR-increase or HR-recovery, and 36 candidate causal genes were prioritized that were enriched for pathways related to neuron biology. There was no evidence of a causal relationship with mortality or cardiovascular diseases, however, a nominal association with parental lifespan was observed (5.5x10-4) that requires further study. In conclusion, our findings provide new biological and clinical insight into the mechanistic under-pinning of HR response to exercise, underscoring the role of the autonomous nervous system in HR-recovery.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

    "abstract": "Individual cells of the bacterium Proteus mirabilis can elongate up to 40-fold on surfaces before engaging in a cooperative surface-based motility termed swarming. How cells regulate this dramatic morphological remodeling remains an open question. In this paper, we move forward the understanding of this regulation by demonstrating that P. mirabilis requires the gene rffG for swarmer cell elongation and subsequent swarm motility. The rffG gene encodes a protein homologous to the dTDP-glucose 4,6 dehydratase protein of Escherichia coli, which contributes to Enterobacterial Common Antigen biosynthesis. Here we characterize the rffG gene in P. mirabilis, demonstrating that it is required for the production of large lipopolysaccharide-linked moieties necessary for wild-type cell envelope integrity. We show that absence of the rffG gene induces several stress-responsive pathways including those controlled by the transcriptional regulators RpoS, CaiF, and RcsB. We further show that in rffG-deficient cells, suppression of the Rcs phosphorelay, via loss of RcsB, is sufficient to induce cell elongation and swarm motility. However, loss of RcsB does not rescue cell envelope integrity defects and instead results in abnormally shaped cells, including cells producing more than two poles. We conclude that a RcsB-mediated response acts to suppress emergence of shape defects in cell envelope-compromised cells, suggesting an additional role for RcsB in maintaining cell morphology under stress conditions. We further propose that the composition of the cell envelope acts as a checkpoint before cells initiate swarmer cell elongation and motility.\\n\\nImportance statementP. mirabilis swarm motility has been implicated in pathogenesis. We have found that cells deploy multiple uncharacterized strategies to handle cell envelope stress beyond the Rcs phosphorelay when attempting to engage in swarm motility. While RcsB is known to directly inhibit the master transcriptional regulator for swarming, we have shown an additional role for RcsB in protecting cell morphology. These data support a growing appreciation that the Rcs phosphorelay is a multi-functional regulator of cell morphology in addition to its role in microbial stress responses. These data also strengthen the paradigm that outer membrane composition is a crucial checkpoint for modulating entry into swarm motility. Furthermore, the rffG-dependent moieties provide a novel, attractive target for potential antimicrobials.",

Here, we utilize homology modeling techniques to calculate full-length structures of human Hsp90 in closed and partially-open conformations. Atomistic simulations of these structures demonstrated that bound ATP stabilizes the dimer by  tensing each protomer, while ADP and apo configurations  relax the complex by increasing global flexibility. Dynamic residue network analysis revealed regions of the protein involved in intra-protein communication, and identified several overlapping key communication hubs that correlate with known functional sites. Perturbation response scanning analysis identified several potential residue sites capable of modulating conformational change in favour of interstate conversion. For the ATP-bound open conformation, these sites were found to overlap with known Aha1 and client binding sites, demonstrating how naturally occurring forces associated with co-factor binding could allosterically modulate conformational dynamics.",

To better understand this process we monitored genome-wide temporal and spatial gene expression changes in grafted Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls. Tissues above and below the graft rapidly developed an asymmetry such that many genes were more highly expressed on one side than the other. This asymmetry correlated with sugar responsive genes and we observed an accumulation of starch above the graft that decreased along with asymmetry once the sugar-transporting vascular tissues reconnected. Despite the initial starvation response below the graft, many genes associated with vascular formation were rapidly activated in grafted tissues but not in cut and separated tissues indicating that a recognition mechanism activated that was independent of functional vascular connections. Auxin which is transported cell-to-cell, had a rapidly elevated response that was symmetric, suggesting that auxin was perceived by the root within hours of tissue attachment to activate the vascular regeneration process. A subset of genes were expressed only in grafted tissues, indicating that wound healing proceeded via different mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of adjoining tissues. Such a recognition process could have broader relevance for tissue regeneration, inter-tissue communication and tissue fusion events.",

The thiol-maleimide modality achieves the highest macromer coupling efficiency of the reported Michael-type pairs, but the resulting hydrogel networks are heterogeneous, because polymerization is faster than the individual components can be manually mixed. The reactivity of the thiol dictates the overall reaction speed, which can be slowed in organic solvents and acidic buffers. Since these modifications also reduce the biocompatibility of resulting hydrogels, we investigated a series of biocompatible buffers and crosslinkers to decelerate gelation while maintaining high cell viability. We found that lowering the polymer weight percentage (wt%), buffer concentration, and pH slowed gelation kinetics, but crosslinking with an electronegative peptide was optimal for both kinetics and cell viability. Slowing the speed of polymerization resulted in more uniform hydrogels, both in terms of visual inspection and the diffusion of small molecules through the network. However, reactions that were too slow resulted in non-uniform particle dispersion due to settling, thus there is a trade-off in hydrogel network uniformity versus cell distribution in the hydrogels when using these networks in cell applications.",

A possible consequence would then be the extinction of small populations. Relative to most single-cell organisms, cancer cells, with large and non-recombining genomes, could be particularly susceptible to such \\\"mutational meltdown\\\". Curiously, deleterious mutations in cancer cells are rarely noticed despite the strong signals in cancer genome sequences. Here, by monitoring single-cell clones from HeLa cell lines, we characterize deleterious mutations that retard cell proliferation. The main mutational events are copy number variations (CNVs), which happen at an extraordinarily high rate of 0.29 events per cell division. The average fitness reduction, estimated to be 18% per mutation, is also very high. HeLa cell populations therefore have very substantial genetic load and, at this level, natural population would likely experience mutational meltdown. We suspect that HeLa cell populations may avoid extinction only after the population size becomes large. Because CNVs are common in most cell lines and cancer tissues, the observations hint at cancer cells vulnerability, which could be exploited by therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is a synthetic chemical, identified by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1946 in a screen for repellents to protect soldiers from mosquito-borne diseases1,2. Since its discovery, DEET has become the worlds most widely used arthropod repellent3, and is effective against invertebrates separated by millions of years of evolution, including biting flies4, honeybees5, ticks6, and land leeches4,7. In insects, DEET acts on the olfactory system5,8-14 and requires the olfactory receptor co-receptor orco9,11-13, but its specific mechanism of action remains controversial. Here we show that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is sensitive to DEET, and use this genetically-tractable animal to study its mechanism of action. We found that DEET is not a volatile repellent, but interferes selectively with chemotaxis to a variety of attractant and repellent molecules. DEET increases pause lengths to disrupt chemotaxis to some odours but not others. In a forward genetic screen for DEET-resistant animals, we identified a single G protein-coupled receptor, str-217, which is expressed in a single pair of DEET-responsive chemosensory neurons, ADL. Misexpression of str-217 in another chemosensory neuron conferred strong responses to DEET. Both engineered str-217 mutants and a wild isolate of C. elegans carrying a deletion in str-217 are DEET-resistant. We found that DEET can interfere with behaviour by inducing an increase in average pause length during locomotion, and show that this increase in pausing requires both str-217 and ADL neurons. Finally, we demonstrated that ADL neurons are activated by DEET and that optogenetic activation of ADL increased average pause length. This is consistent with the \\\"confusant\\\" hypothesis, in which DEET is not a simple repellent but modulates multiple olfactory pathways to scramble behavioural responses12,13. Our results suggest a consistent motif for the effectiveness of DEET across widely divergent taxa: an effect on multiple chemosensory neurons to disrupt the pairing between odorant stimulus and behavioural response.",

    "abstract": "Mentally imagining anothers perspective is a high-level social process, reliant on manipulating internal representations of the self in an embodied manner. Recently Wang et al., (1) showed that theta-band (3-7Hz) brain oscillations within the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) and brain regions coding for motor/body schema contribute to the process of perspective-taking. Using a task requiring participants to engage in embodied perspective-taking, we set out to unravel the extended functional brain network and its connections in detail. We found that increasing the angle of disparity between self and other perspective was accompanied by longer reaction times and increases in theta power within rTPJ, right lateral pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Using nonparametric Granger-causality, we showed that during later stages of perspective-taking, the lateral PFC and ACC exert top-down influences over rTPJ, indicative of executive control processes required for managing conflicts between self and other perspectives. Finally, we quantified patterns of whole-brain phase coupling (imaginary coherence) in relation to rTPJ during high-level perspective taking. Results suggest that rTPJ increases its theta-band phase synchrony with brain regions involved in mentalizing and regions coding for motor/body schema; whilst decreasing its synchrony to visual regions. Implications for neurocognitive models are discussed, and it is proposed that rTPJ acts as a  hub to route bottom-up visual information to internal representations of the self during perspective-taking, co-ordinated by theta-band oscillations. The self is then projected onto the others perspective via embodied motor/body schema transformations, regulated by top-down cingulo-frontal activity.\\n\\nSignificance StatementHigh-level social processing, such as the ability to imagine anothers visuospatial experience of the world (perspective taking), is a core part of what makes us human. Building on a substantial body of converging previous evidence, our study reveals how concerted activity across the cortex in low frequencies (theta: 3-7 Hz) implements this crucial human process. We found that oscillatory power and connectivity (imaginary coherence, nonparametric Granger causality) at theta frequency linked functional sub-networks of executive control, mentalizing, and sensorimotor/body schema via a main hub located in the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ). Our findings inform neurocognitive models of social cognition by describing the co-ordinated changes in brain network connectivity, mediated by theta oscillations, during perspective-taking.",

    "abstract": "Important for understanding the regulatory roles of miRNAs is the ability to predict the mRNA targets most responsive to each miRNA. Here, we acquired datasets needed for the quantitative study of microRNA targeting in Drosophila. Analyses of these data expanded the types of sites known to be effective in flies, expanded the mRNA regions with detectable targeting to include 5' UTRs, and identified features of site context that correlate with targeting efficacy. Updated evolutionary analyses evaluated the probability of conserved targeting for each predicted site and indicated that more than a third of the Drosophila genes are preferentially conserved targets of miRNAs. Based on these results, a quantitative model was developed to predict targeting efficacy in insects. This model performed better than existing models and will drive the next version of TargetScanFly (v7.0; targetscan.org), thereby providing a valuable resource for placing miRNAs into gene-regulatory networks of this important experimental organism.",

Herein, such co-occurrences of LOHs and GOHs were confirmed in 102 cases of four cancer types analyzed with three different next-generation sequencing platforms, comparing non-tumor, paratumor, and tumor tissues with white-blood-cell controls; and in 246 pan-cancer cases of whole-genome tumor-control pairs. Unexpectedly, large numbers of SNVs enriched with CG>TG GOHs and copy-number-variations (CNVs) proximal to these GOHs were detected in the non-tumor tissues, which were extensively reversed in paratumors showing prominent TG>CG LOHs with proximal CNVs, and less so in tumors to form forward-reverse mutation cycles.

Nevertheless, the long-term divergence patterns of proteins maintaining the same molecular function and the possible limits of this divergence have not been explored in detail. We investigate these fundamental questions by characterizing the divergence between ancient protein orthologs with conserved molecular function. Our results demonstrate that the decline of sequence and structural similarities between such orthologs significantly slows down after ~1-2 billion years of independent evolution. As a result, their sequence and structural similarities have not substantially decreased for the past billion years. The effective divergence limit (>25% sequence identity) is not primarily due to protein sites universally conserved in all linages. Instead, less than four amino acid types are accepted, on average, per site in orthologs strictly conserving their molecular function. Our analysis also reveals different divergence patterns for protein sites with experimentally determined small and large fitness effects of mutations.",

We then infected HMEC-1 with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and found that adhesion of Lm onto host cells increases monotonically with increasing matrix stiffness, an effect that requires the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We identified cell surface vimentin as a candidate surface receptor mediating stiffness-dependent adhesion of Lm to HMEC-1, and demonstrated that bacterial infection of these host cells is decreased when surface vimentin is perturbed. Our results provide the first evidence that ECM stiffness can mediate the susceptibility of host cells to bacterial infection.",

    "abstract": "Associative learning requires mapping between complex stimuli and behavioural responses. When multiple stimuli are involved, conditional associative learning is a gradual process with learning based on trial and error. It is established that a distributed network of regions track associative learning, however the role of neural oscillations in human learning remains less clear. Here we used scalp EEG to test how neural oscillations change during learning of arbitrary visuo-motor associations. Participants learned to associative 48 different abstract shapes to one of four button responses through trial and error over repetitions of the shapes. To quantify how well the associations were learned for each trial, we used a state-space computational model of learning that provided a probability of each trial being correct given past performance for that stimulus, that we take as a measure of the strength of the association. We used linear modelling to relate single-trial neural oscillations to single-trial measures of association strength. We found frontal midline theta oscillations during the delay period tracked learning, where theta activity was strongest during the early stages of learning and declined as the associations were formed. Further, posterior alpha and low-beta oscillations in the cue period showed strong desynchronised activity early in learning, while stronger alpha activity during the delay period were seen as associations became well learned. Moreover, the magnitude of these effects during early learning, before the associations were learned, related to improvements in memory seen on the next presentation of the stimulus. The current study provides clear evidence that frontal theta and posterior alpha/beta oscillations play a key role during associative memory formation.",

We recorded ensembles of grid cells in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex during active exploratory behaviors and overnight sleep. Per pair and collectively, we found preserved patterns of spike-time correlations across waking, REM, and non-REM sleep, which reflected the spatial tuning offsets between these cells during active exploration. The preservation of cell-cell relationships across states was not explained by theta oscillations or CA1 activity. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity within the grid cell network drives grid cell activity across behavioral states.",

    "abstract": "There are a growing number of neuroimaging methods that model spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity to allow more meaningful characterizations of brain networks. This paper proposes dynamic graphical models (DGMs) for dynamic, directed functional connectivity. DGMs are a multivariate graphical model with time-varying coefficients that describe instantaneous directed relationships between nodes. A further benefit of DGMs is that networks may contain loops and that large networks can be estimated. We use network simulations, human resting-state fMRI (N = 500) to investigate the validity and reliability of the estimated networks. We simulate systematic lags of the hemodynamic response at different brain regions to investigate how these lags potentially bias directionality estimates. In the presence of such lag confounds (0.4-0.8 seconds offset between connected nodes), our method has a sensitivity of 72%-77% to detect the true direction. Stronger lag confounds have reduced sensitivity, but do not increase false positives (i.e., directionality estimates of the opposite direction). In human resting-state fMRI, we find the DMN has consistent influence on the cerebellar, the limbic and the auditory/temporal network, as well a consistent reciprocal relationship between the visual medial and visual lateral network. Finally, we apply the method in a small mouse fMRI sample and discover a highly plausible relationship between areas in the hippocampus feeding into the cingulate cortex. We provide a computationally efficient implementation of DGM as a free software package for R.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the precise neural mechanisms by which tACS affects the human cortex. Current hypothesis suggest that transcranial current stimulation (tCS) can directly enhance ongoing brain oscillations and induce long - lasting effects through the activation of synaptic plasticity mechanisms [1]. Entrainment has been demonstrated in in - vitro studies, but its presence in non-invasive human studies is still under debate [2,3]. Here, we aim to investigate the immediate and short-term effects of tACS bursts on the occipital cortex of participants engaged in a change - of - speed detection task, a task that has previously reported to have a clear physiology - behavior relationship, where trials with faster responses also have increased power in {gamma} - oscillations (50 - 80 Hz) [4]. The dominant brain oscillations related to the visual task are modulated using multichannel tACS at 10 and 70 Hz within occipital cortex. We found that tACS stimulation at 10 Hz (tACS 10) enhanced both  (8 - 13 Hz) and {gamma} oscillations, in hand with an increase in reaction time (RT) in the change - of - speed detection visual task. On the other hand, tACS at 70Hz desynchronized visual cortices, impairing both phase - locked and endogenous {gamma} - power while increasing RT. While both tACS protocols seem to revert the relationship reported in [4], we argue that tACS produces a shift in attentional resources within visual cortex while leaving unaltered the resources required to conduct the task. This theory is supported by the fact that the correlation between fast RT and high {gamma}- power trials is maintained for tACS sessions too. Finally, we measured cortical excitability by analyzing Event - Related - Potentials (ERP) Lempel - Ziv - Welch Complexity (LZW). In control sessions we observe that lower {gamma} - LZW complexity correlates to faster reaction times. Both metrics are altered by tACS stimulation, as tACS 10 decreased amplitude of the P300 peak, while increasing {gamma}- LZW complexity. To this end, our study highlights the nonlinear cross - frequency interaction between exogenous stimulation and endogenous brain dynamics, and proposes the use of complexity metrics, as LZW, to characterize excitability patterns of cortical areas in a behaviorally relevant timescale. These insights will hopefully contribute to the design of adaptive and personalized tACS protocols where cortical excitability can be characterized through complexity metrics.\\n\\nAdditional Title Page FootnotesO_LIWe introduce a bursting tACS protocol to study semi-concurrent tACS effects in the visual system and their impact on behavior as measured by reaction time.\\nC_LIO_LIBurst 10 Hz tACS (tACS10) applied to the visual cortex entrained {gamma}-oscillations and increased RTs in a change-of-speed detection visual task more than 70 Hz tACS (tACS70) or Control conditions.\\nC_LIO_LIBurst tACS10 also decreased amplitude of the P300 peak, while increasing -power and {gamma}-LZW complexity.\\nC_LIO_LIPhysiological and behavioral impact of occipital tACS10 and tACS70 was frequency-specific. tACS70 reduced {gamma}-oscillations after 20min of tACS stimulation.\\nC_LIO_LICognitive task may determine cortical excitation levels as measured by complexity metrics, as lower {gamma}-LZW complexity correlates to faster reaction times.\\nC_LI",

Here, we show how to model glial physiology and neuron-glia interactions in the Brian 2 simulator. Brian 2 offers facilities to explicitly describe any model in mathematical terms with limited and simple simulator-specific syntax, automatically generating high-performance code from the user-provided descriptions. The flexibility of this approach allows us to model not only networks of neurons, but also individual glial cells, electrical coupling of glial cells, and the interaction between glial cells and synapses. We therefore conclude that Brian 2 provides an ideal platform to efficiently simulate glial physiology, and specifically, the influence of astrocytes on neural activity.",

The mechanistic origin of the grid representation is unknown, but continuous attractor network (CAN) models explain multiple fundamental features of grid-cell activity. An untested prediction of CAN grid models is that the grid-cell network should exhibit an activity correlation structure that transcends behavioural or brain states. By recording from MEC cell ensembles during navigation and sleep, we found that spatial phase offsets of grid cells predict arousal-state-independent spike rate correlations. Similarly, state-invariant correlations between conjunctive grid-head-direction and pure head-direction cells were predicted by their head-direction tuning offsets. Spike rates of grid cells were only weakly correlated across modules, and module scale relationships disintegrated during slow-save sleep, suggesting that modules function as independent attractor networks. Collectively, our observations suggest that network states in MEC are expressed universally across brain and behaviour states.",

Recent transcriptional studies of PDAC have provided several competing stratifications of the disease. However, the development of therapeutic strategies will depend on a unique and coherent classification of PDAC. Here, we use an integrative meta-analysis of four different PDAC gene expression studies to derive the consensus PDAC classification. Despite the fact that immunotherapies have yet to have an impact in treatment of PDAC, the gene expression signatures that stratify PDAC across studies are immunologic. We define these as \\\"adaptive\\\", \\\"innate\\\" and \\\"immune-exclusion\\\" immunologic signatures, which are prognostic across independent cohorts. An appreciation of the immune composition of PDAC with prognostic significance is an opportunity to understand distinct immune escape mechanisms in development of the disease and design novel immune-oncology therapeutic strategies to overcome current barriers.",

    "abstract": "How symbiotic lifestyles evolve from free-living ecologies is poorly understood. In Metazoas largest family, Staphylinidae (rove beetles), numerous lineages have evolved obligate behavioral symbioses with ants or termites. Widespread convergence of this lifestyle is thought to stem from a novel, chemically defended body plan that enables free-living species to infiltrate colonies and undergo extreme evolutionary specialization. Here we show how this innovative body plan evolved, via new Hox functions in staphylinids that remodeled the coleopteran groundplan. Using a model staphylinid, Dalotia coriaria, we reveal the Hox basis for changes in thoracic appendage morphology that shortened the beetle elytron and left the abdomen physically unprotected, selecting for an abdominal defense gland that was likely key to unlocking ant and termite societies. We present evidence that the gland evolved through a novel, combinatorial role of the abdominal Hox proteins AbdA and AbdB. These proteins function together to specify distinct gland cell types in neighboring segmental compartments, each cell type synthesizing a different class of compound--irritant, ester and solvent. Only when secreted together do these compounds constitute a bioactive secretion, providing an example of emergent chemical functionality that arises from synergy between individual gland cell types. Hox-controlled specification of glandular diversity implies a modularity in compound biosynthesis that likely catalyzed the evolvability of rove beetle chemistry, including the capacity of symbiotic taxa to produce potent compounds for host deception. This study reveals how Hox-controlled body axis modifications predispose a major animal to convergently evolve into symbionts.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are tested for disease association mostly using simple regression, one variant at a time. Standard approaches to improve power in detecting disease-associated SNPs use multiple regression with Bayesian variable selection in which a sparsity-enforcing prior on effect sizes is used to avoid overtraining and all effect sizes are integrated out for posterior inference. For binary traits, the logistic model has not yielded clear improvements over the linear model. For multi-SNP analysis, the logistic model required costly and technically challenging MCMC sampling to perform the integration.\\n\\nHere, we introduce the quasi-Laplace approximation to solve the integral and avoid MCMC sampling. We expect the logistic model to perform much better than multiple linear regression except when predicted disease risks are spread closely around 0.5, because only close to its inflection point can the logistic function be well approximated by a linear function. Indeed, in extensive benchmarks with simulated phenotypes and real genotypes, our Bayesian multiple LOgistic REgression method (B-LORE) showed considerable improvements (1) when regressing on many variants in multiple loci at heritabilities [&ge;] 0.4 and (2) for unbalanced case-control ratios.\\n\\nB-LORE also enables meta-analysis by approximating the likelihood functions of individual studies by multivariate normal distributions, using their means and covariance matrices as summary statistics.

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is widely attributed as the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. Due to intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the ability to form biofilms, P. aeruginosa infections are challenging to treat. P. aeruginosa employs multiple virulence mechanisms to establish infections, many of which are controlled by the global virulence regulator Vfr. An attractive strategy to combat P. aeruginosa infections is thus the use of anti-virulence compounds. Here, we report the discovery that FDA-approved drug auranofin attenuates virulence in P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that auranofin acts by targeting Vfr, which in turn leads to inhibition of quorum sensing (QS) and Type IV pili (TFP). Consistent with inhibition of QS and TFP expression, we show that auranofin attenuates biofilm maturation, and when used in combination with colistin, displays strong synergy in eradicating P. aeruginosa biofilms. Auranofin may have immediate applications as an anti-virulence drug against P. aeruginosa infections.",

FMRI data were then recorded during a similar task, to obtain the accuracy with which the same sample numerosities could be read out from evoked brain activity patterns, as a measure of the precision of the neuronal representation. Sample numerosities were decodable in both early visual and intra-parietal cortex with approximately equal accuracy on average. In parietal cortex, smaller numerosities were better discriminated than larger numerosities of the same ratio, paralleling smaller behavioral Weber fractions for smaller numerosities. Furthermore, in parietal but not early visual cortex, fMRI decoding performance was correlated with behavioral number discrimination acuity across subjects (subjects with a more precise behavioral Weber fraction measured prior to scanning showed greater discriminability of fMRI activity patterns in intraparietal cortex, and more specifically, the right LIP region).\\n\\nThese results suggest a crucial role for intra-parietal cortex in supporting a numerical representation which is explicitly read out for numerical decisions and behavior.",

Analogous to the TCR, Drapers extracellular domain and PS can be replaced with FRB and FKBP respectively, resulting in a rapamycin-inducible engulfment system. However, in contrast to the TCR, we show that localized signaling at Draper microclusters results in time-dependent depolymerization of actin filaments.

Here we show that excess DNA methylation-based epigenetic silencing promotes eye degeneration in blind cave Astyanax mexicanus. By performing parallel analyses in Astyanax mexicanus cave and surface morphs and in the zebrafish Danio rerio, we have discovered that DNA methylation mediates eye-specific gene repression and globally regulates early eye development. The most significantly hypermethylated and down-regulated genes in the cave morph are also linked to human eye disorders, suggesting the function of these genes is conserved across the vertebrates. Our results show that changes in DNA methylation-based gene repression can serve as an important molecular mechanism generating phenotypic diversity during development and evolution.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, most RNA molecules are exported into the cytoplasm after being transcribed in the nucleus. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to reside and function primarily inside the nucleus, but nuclear localization of protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) has been considered rare in both animals and plants. Here we show that two mRNAs, transcribed from the CDC20 and CCS52B (plant orthologue of CDH1) genes, are specifically sequestered inside the nucleus during the cell cycle. CDC20 and CDH1 both function as coactivators of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) E3 ligase to trigger cyclin B (C YCB) destruction. In the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristem (SAM), we find CDC20 and CCS52B are co-expressed with CYCBs in mitotic cells. CYCB transcripts can be exported and translated, whereas CDC20 and CCS52B mRNAs are strictly confined to the nucleus at prophase and the cognate proteins are not translated until the redistribution of the mRNAs to the cytoplasm after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) at prometaphase. The 5 untranslated region (UTR) is necessary and sufficient for CDC20 mRNA nuclear localization as well as protein translation. Mitotic enrichment of CDC20 and CCS52B transcripts enables the timely and rapid activation of APC/C, while their nuclear sequestration at prophase appears to protect cyclins from precocious degradation.",

    "abstract": "The type-1 secretion system (T1SS) of gram-negative bacteria enables a one-step translocation strategy known to move functionally diverse proteins from the cytoplasm into the extracellular environment without a periplasmic intermediate. LapA of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 is a giant type-1 secreted (T1S) adhesin that facilitates biofilm formation only when displayed at the cell surface. A LapA-targeting periplasmic protease, LapG, connects intracellular cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels with cell surface-associated LapA by cleaving and absolving LapA from the cell surface under conditions unsuitable for biofilm formation. Here, we demonstrate that LapA contains a novel N-terminal element, called the retention module (RM), which prohibits classical one-step T1S of LapA. We provide evidence that the RM of LapA tethers LapA at the cell surface through its outer membrane TolC-like pore, LapE, where LapA is accessible to the periplasmic protease LapG. We also demonstrate that this unusual retention strategy is likely conserved among LapA-like proteins and represents a new subclass of T1SS ABC transporters exclusively involved in transporting LapA-like adhesins.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBacteria have evolved multiple secretion strategies to interact with their environment. For many bacteria, the secretion of cell surface associated adhesins is often key for initiating contact with a preferred substrate to facilitate biofilm formation. Our work demonstrates that P. fluorescens uses a previously unrecognized secretion strategy to retain the giant adhesin LapA at its cell surface. Further, we identify likely LapA-like adhesins in various pathogenic and commensal Proteobacteria and provide phylogenetic evidence these adhesins are secreted by a new subclass of T1SS ABC transporters.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that cooperative RAS-MET signaling drives disease progression in NF1-related MPNSTs, and that MET inhibition results in downstream inhibition of RAS/MAPK in the context of MET amplification. This study revealed that response to MET inhibition appeared to be modulated by P53 gene status. It is currently unclear how P53 function affects kinome signaling and response to kinase inhibition. Here we utilized genetically engineered mouse models with variable levels of Met and Hgf amplification and differential p53 status (NF1fl/KO;lox-stop-loxMETtg/+;Plp-creERTtg/+; NF1+/KO;p53R172H;Plp-creERTtg/+; and NF1+/KO;Plp-creERTtg/+t). These NF1-MPNST models were used to assess a novel MET/MEK (i.e. RAS-MET) inhibition strategy and investigate the adaptive kinome response to MET and MEK inhibition. We demonstrate that combination MET (capmatinib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibition fully suppresses MET, RAS/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT activation in P53 wild type tumors, whereas P53-mutant tumors demonstrated sustained CRAF, BRAF, and AKT activation in the presence of combined MET and MEK inhibition. Interestingly, trametinib therapy alone strongly activates MET signaling in MET and HGF-amplified tumors regardless of P53 status, an effect that was abrogated by the addition of capmatinib. We conclude that P53 alters RAS-MET signaling interactions that drive therapy resistance in NF1-related MPNSTs.",

    "abstract": "The question of the existence of cancer is inadequately answered by invoking somatic mutations or the disruptions of cellular and tissue control mechanisms. As such uniformly random events alone cannot account for the almost inevitable occurrence of an extremely complex process such as cancer. In the different epistemic realm, an ultimate explanation of cancer is that cancer is a reversion of a cell to an ancestral pre-Metazoan state, i.e. a cellular form of atavism. Several studies have suggested that genes involved in cancer have evolved at particular evolutionary time linked to the unicellular-multicellular transition. Here we used a refined phylostratigraphic analysis of evolutionary ages of the known genes/pathways associated with cancer and the genes differentially expressed between normal and cancer tissue as well as between embryonic and mature (differentiated) cells. We found that cancer-specific transcriptomes and cancer-related pathways were enriched for genes that evolved in the pre-Metazoan era and depleted of genes that evolved in the post-Metazoan era. By contrast an opposite relation was found for cell maturation: the age distribution frequency of the genes expressed in differentiated epithelial cells were enriched for post-Metazoan genes and depleted of pre-Metazoan ones. These findings support the atavism theory that cancer cells manifest the reactivation of an ancient ancestral state featuring unicellular modalities. Thus our bioinformatics analyses suggest that not only does oncogenesis recapitulate ontogenesis, and ontogenesis recapitulates phylogenesis, but also oncogenesis recapitulates phylogenesis. This more encompassing perspective may offer a natural organizing framework for genetic alterations in cancers and point to new treatment options that target the genes controlling the atavism transition.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryTracing cancer gene evolutionary ages revealed that cancer reverts to a pre-existing early Metazoan state.",

    "abstract": "Withdrawal of the growth factor interleukin 3 from IL3-dependent myeloid cells causes them to undergo Bax/Bak1-dependent apoptosis, whereas factor-deprived Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells remain viable, but arrest and shrink. It was reported that withdrawal of IL3 from Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells caused decreased expression of the glucose transporter Glut1, leading to reduced glucose uptake, so that arrested cells required Atg5-dependent autophagy for long-term survival. In other cell types, a decrease in Glut1 is mediated by the thioredoxin-interacting protein Txnip, which is induced in IL3-dependent myeloid cells when growth factor is removed. We mutated Atg5 and Txnip by CRISPR/Cas9 and found that Atg5-dependent autophagy was not necessary for the long-term viability of cycling or arrested Bax-/-Bak1-/- cells, and that Txnip was not required for the decrease in Glut1 expression in response to IL3 withdrawal. Surprisingly, Atg5-deficient Bax/Bak1 double mutant cells survived for several weeks in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), without high concentrations of added glucose or glutamine. When serum was withdrawn, the provision of an equivalent amount of glucose present in 10% FBS (~0.5 mM) was sufficient to support cell survival for more than a week, in the presence or absence of IL3. Thus, Bax-/-Bak1-/- myeloid cells deprived of growth factor consume extracellular glucose to maintain long-term viability, without a requirement for Atg5-dependent autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Although it is widely recognised as involving two stages (poor placentation followed by oxidative stress/inflammation), the precise originating causes of pre-eclampsia (PE) remain elusive. We have previously brought together some of the considerable evidence that a (dormant) microbial component is commonly a significant part of its aetiology. However, apart from recognising, consistent with this view, that the many inflammatory markers of PE are also increased in infection, we had little to say about immunity, whether innate or adaptive. In addition, we focussed on the gut, oral and female urinary tract microbiomes as the main sources of the infection. We here marshall further evidence for an infectious component in PE, focussing on the immunological tolerance characteristic of pregnancy, and the well-established fact that increased exposure to the fathers semen assists this immunological tolerance. As well as these benefits, however, semen is not sterile, microbial tolerance mechanisms may exist, and we also review the evidence that semen may be responsible for inoculating the developing conceptus with microbes, not all of which are benign. It is suggested that when they are not, this may be a significant cause of preeclampsia. A variety of epidemiological and other evidence is entirely consistent with this, not least correlations between semen infection, infertility and PE. Our view also leads to a series of other, testable predictions. Overall, we argue for a significant paternal role in the development of PE through microbial infection of the mother via insemination.

    "abstract": "Ergosterol is an essential isoprenoid for cellular integrity and proper membrane fluidity of fungi. Proper level of ergosterol is crucial for resistance to various stressful conditions, such as hypoxia, hypothermia, and hyperosmolarity. The isoprenoid building blocks of ergosterol are synthesized via the mevalonate pathway, which relies on the availability of many central metabolites, such as acetyl-coA and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The metabolic currencies are also the substrates for epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation and methylation. To have a better understanding of how isoprenoid synthesis and these epigenetic mechanisms affect each other, we re-analyzed the results of our screen on Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion collection for isoprenoid production and found a group of chromatin regulators with significant effects on isoprenoid production. More specifically, the canonical histone Htz1 (H2A.z), the SWR1 complex that loads Htz1 onto chromatin, and the histone demethylase Jhd2 inhibited, whereas the Htz1 unloading INO80 complex and histone methylase Set1 enhanced isoprenoid production. Further analysis of genome-wide expression data revealed that Htz1 and Set1 differentially regulate stress-response genes which presumably affect isoprenoid synthesis. Conversely, changes in isoprenoid production alters the transcription of the same set of genes. Further analysis of ergosterol levels in these gene deletions showed that htz1, set1 double deletion leads to accumulation of ergosterol beyond homeostatic levels and renders cells vulnerable to environmental stress. Our re-analysis of multiple published data and follow-up experiments revealed an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism between ergosterol levels and stress response genes that is essential for maintaining optimum concentration of ergosterol under various conditions.",

    "abstract": "In patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) the pharyngeal muscles become relaxed during sleep, which leads to a partial or complete closure of upper airway. Empirical studies suggest that withdrawal of noradrenergic and serotonergic drives importantly contribute to depression of hypoglossal motoneurons during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep and, therefore, may contribute to OSA pathophysiology; however, specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms remain unknown. It was recently suggested that, in order to explain experimental observations, the neuronal network for monoaminergic control of excitability of hypoglossal motoneurons has to include excitatory and inhibitory perihypoglossal interneurons that would mediate noradrenergic and serotonergic drives to the motoneurons. In this study, we applied a biophysical network model to validate the rationality of the proposed circuit and to investigate the dynamics of its neuronal populations during REM sleep-induced withdrawal of noradrenergic and serotonergic drives. The state-dependent activity of the model hypoglossal motoneurons during simulated REM sleep with or without a virtual application of noradrenergic and serotonergic drugs was in qualitative agreement with in vivo data. The study predicts the dynamics of the perihypoglossal interneurons during these conditions and corroborates the hypothesis that the excitatory interneurons may integrate both noradrenergic and serotonergic drives. The latter drive has to be mediated by the inhibitory interneurons. The study suggests that perihypoglossal interneurons may serve as novel potential targets for pharmacological treatment of OSA.",

    "abstract": "Several bacterial cell wall components such as peptidoglycan and muramyl peptide are potent inducers of mammalian slow-wave sleep when exogenously administered to freely behaving animals. It has been proposed that the native gut microflora may serve as a quasi-endogenous pool of somnogenic bacterial cell wall products given their quantity and close proximity to the intestinal portal. This proposal suggests that deliberate manipulation of the host's intestinal flora may elicit changes in host sleep behavior. To test this possibility, we evaluated 24 h of sleep-wake behavior after depleting the gut microbiota with a 14 d broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen containing high doses of ampicillin, metronidazole, neomycin, and vancomycin. High-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene was used to confirm depletion of fecal bacteria and sleep-wake vigilance states were determined using videosomnography techniques based on previously established behavioral criteria shown to highly correlate with standard polysomnography-based methods. Additionally, considering that germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice have been earlier shown to display increased locomotor activity, and since locomotor activity has been used as a reliable proxy of sleep, we suspected that the elevated locomotor activity previously reported in these animals may reflect an unreported reduction in sleep behavior. To examine this potential relationship, we also quantified locomotor activity on a representative subsample of the same 24 h of video recordings using the automated video-tracking software ANY-maze. We found that antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota reduced nocturnal sleep, but not diurnal sleep. Likewise, antibiotic-treated mice showed increased nocturnal locomotor activity, but not diurnal locomotor activity. Taken together, these results support a link between the gut microbiome and nocturnal sleep and locomotor physiology in adult mice. Additionally, our findings indicate that antibiotics may be insomnogenic via their ability to diminish gut-derived bacterial somnogens. Given that antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in human medicine, these findings have important implications for clinical practice with respect to prolonged antibiotic therapy, insomnia, and other idiopathic sleep-wake and circadian-rhythm disorders affecting an estimated 50-70 million people in the United States alone.\\n\\nHighlights- 14 d broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment effectively depletes the gut microbiota.\\n- Gut microbiota depletion reduces nocturnal sleep, but not diurnal sleep.\\n- Gut microbiota depletion increases nocturnal locomotion, but not diurnal locomotion.\\n- Antibiotics may be insomnogenic: implications for idiopathic sleep disorders.",

Genomic analysis of longitudinally collected tumor samples in a case of MPNST disease progression revealed early hemizygous microdeletions in NF1 and TP53, with concomitant amplifications of MET, HGF, and EGFR. To examine the role of MET in MPNST progression, we developed mice with enhanced MET expression and NF1 ablation (NF1fl/KO;lox-stop-loxMETtg/+;Plp-creERTtg/+; referred to as NF1-MET). NF1-MET mice express a robust MPNST phenotype in the absence of additional mutations. A comparison of NF1-MET MPSNTs with MPNSTs derived from NF1KO/+;p53R172H;Plp-creERTtg/+ (NF1-P53) and NF1KO/+;Plp-creERTtg/+ (NF1) mice revealed unique Met, Ras, and PI3K signaling patterns. To investigate the therapeutic potential of MET inhibition among tumorgrafts derived from the respective MPNST models, we tested the highly selective MET inhibitor, capmatinib. NF1-MET MPNSTs were uniformly sensitive to MET inhibition whereas only a small subset of NF1-P53 and NF1 MPNSTs were inhibited. These results confirm that MET activation is sufficient for Schwann cell dedifferentiation into MPNSTs in the context of NF1 deficiency.

Genetic defects in their component molecules, known as \\\"ciliopathies\\\" give rise to devastating symptoms, ranging from defective development, to kidney disease, to progressive blindness. The detailed structures of these organelles and the true functions of proteins encoded by ciliopathy genes are poorly understood because of the small size of cilia and the limitations of conventional microscopic techniques. We describe the combination of cryo-electron tomography, enhanced by sub-tomogram averaging, with super-resolution stochastic reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to define substructures and subdomains within the light-sensing rod sensory cilium of the mammalian retina. Longitudinal and radial domains are demarcated by structural features such as the axoneme and its connections to the ciliary membrane, and are correlated with molecular markers of these compartments, including Ca2+-binding protein centrin-2 in the lumen of the axoneme, acetylated tubulin forming the axoneme, the glycocalyx extending outward from the surface of the plasma membrane, and molecular residents of the space between axoneme and ciliary membrane, including Arl13B, intraflagellar transport proteins, BBS5, and syntaxin-3. Within this framework we document that deficiencies in the ciliopathy proteins BBS2, BBS7 and BBS9 lead to inappropriate accumulation of proteins in rod outer segments while largely preserving their sub-domain localization within the connecting cilium region, but alter the distribution of syntaxin-3 clusters.",

    "abstract": "In macroevolution, the Red Queen (RQ) model posits that biodiversity dynamics depend mainly on species-intrinsic biotic factors such as interactions among species or life-history traits, while the Court Jester (CJ) model states that extrinsic environmental abiotic factors have a stronger role. Until recently, a lack of relevant methodological approaches has prevented the unraveling of contributions from these two types of factors to the evolutionary history of a lineage. Here we take advantage of the rapid development of new macroevolution models that tie diversification rates to changes in paleoenvironmental (extrinsic) and/or biotic (intrinsic) factors. We inferred a robust and fully-sampled species-level phylogeny, as well as divergence times and ancestral geographic ranges, and related these to the radiation of Apollo butterflies (Parnassiinae) using both extant (molecular) and extinct (fossil/morphological) evidence. We tested whether their diversification dynamics are better explained by a RQ or CJ hypothesis, by assessing whether speciation and extinction were mediated by diversity-dependence (niche filling) and clade-dependent host-plant association (RQ) or by large-scale continuous changes in extrinsic factors such as climate or geology (CJ). For the RQ hypothesis, we found significant differences in speciation rates associated with different host-plants but detected no sign of diversity-dependence. For CJ, the role of Himalayan-Tibetan building was substantial for biogeography but not a driver of high speciation, while positive dependence between warm climate and speciation/extinction was supported by continuously varying maximum-likelihood models. We find that rather than a single factor, the joint effect of multiple factors (biogeography, species traits, environmental drivers, and mass extinction) is responsible for current diversity patterns, and that the same factor might act differently across clades, emphasizing the notion of opportunity. This study confirms the importance of the confluence of several factors rather than single explanations in modeling diversification within lineages.",

    "abstract": "Diphyllatea is an ancient and enigmatic lineage of unicellular eukaryotes that possesses morphological features common to other deeply diverging eukaryotes, such as Amoebozoa and Excavata. In reconstruction of the evolutionary processes underlying diversification and morphological innovation among eukaryotes, Diphyllatea plays a key role together with other orphan lineages. Despite being of evolutionary significance, only three species of Diphyllatea have descripted morphology, with molecular data available from fewer. The lack of data means that the actual diversity of this key lineage of eukaryotes remains unresolved. We here present a first attempt to understand the species diversity and higher order structure of the Diphyllatea phylogeny. We have cultured several new strains, described these morphologically, and amplified their rRNA. We have sampled DNA from multiple globally distributed sites, using these as templates in a Diphyllatea-specific PCR. In contrast to recent diversity studies, which use short variable gene regions, we amplify nearly the whole 18S rRNA gene, and sequence using PacBio RS II technology, to provide enough information to resolve historically ancient speciation events. Phylogenetic inference of Diphyllatea rRNA reveals three deeply branching and distinct clades of Diphyllatea, here named Diphy I - III. Diphy I and II include the genera Diphylleia and Collodictyon. Notably, Diphy III is here shown as novel phylogenetic clade with all strains investigated having a congruent morphology to Collodictyon triciliatum (Diphy II). Altogether, Diphyllatea seems to constitute two morphotypes, a biflagellate (i.e. Diphy I) and a quadraflagellate (i.e. Diphy II and III) form, congruent with earlier descriptions of Diphylleia and Collodictyon. Further, our targeted environmental sequencing approach, which includes specific PCR primers, reveals a wider global distribution of Diphyllatea than earlier known. Altogether, the described protocol shows the usefulness of combining long amplicon high-throughput sequencing and lineage-specific PCR approach in surveys of enigmatic eukaryote lineages.",

    "abstract": "Sex can be an important determinant of cancer phenotype, and exploring sex-biased tumor biology holds promise for identifying novel therapeutic targets and new approaches to cancer treatment. In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4-bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. These sex-biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We found that male and female GBM cells exhibited opposing responses to pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Brd4. Brd4 knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition decreased male GBM cell clonogenicity and in vivo tumorigenesis, while increasing both in female GBM cells. These results were validated in male and female patient-derived GBM cell lines. Furthermore, analysis of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal of human GBM samples segregated by sex revealed that male GBM cells are significantly more sensitive to BET inhibitors than are female cells. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells. This has important implications for the clinical evaluation and use of BET inhibitors.\n\nSignificanceConsistent sex differences in incidence and outcome have been reported in numerous cancers including brain tumors. GBM, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, occurs with higher incidence and shorter survival in males compared to females. Brd4 is essential for regulating transcriptome-wide gene expression and specifying cell identity, including that of GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. The observed sex differences in BETi treatment strongly indicate that sex differences in disease biology translate into sex differences in therapeutic responses. This has critical implications for clinical use of BET inhibitors further affirming the importance of inclusion of sex as a biological variable.",
