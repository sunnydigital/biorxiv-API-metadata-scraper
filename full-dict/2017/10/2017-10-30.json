    "abstract": "Cognitive processing requires the ability to flexibly integrate and process information across large brain networks. More information is needed on how brain networks dynamically reorganize to allow such broad communication across many different brain regions in order to integrate the necessary information. Here, we use intracranial EEG to record neural activity from 12 epileptic patients while they perform three cognitive tasks in order to study how the functional connectivity changes to facilitate communication across the underlying network spanning many different brain regions. At the topological level, this facilitation is characterized by measures of integration and segregation. Across all patients, we found significant increases in integration and decreases in segregation during cognitive processing, especially in the gamma band (50-90 Hz). Accordingly, we also found significantly higher level of global synchronization and functional connectivity during the execution of the cognitive task, again particularly in the gamma band. More importantly, we demonstrate here for the first time that the modulations at the level of functional connectivity facilitating communication across the network were not caused by changes in the level of the underlying oscillations but caused by a rearrangement of the mutual synchronisation between the different nodes as proposed by the \\\"Communication Through Coherence\\\" Theory.",

    "abstract": "Category learning is a critical neurobiological function that allows organisms to simplify a complex world. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) is often active in neurobiological studies of category learning; however, the specific role this region serves in category learning remains uncertain. Previous category learning studies have hypothesized that the rlPFC is involved in switching between rules, whereas others have emphasized rule abstraction and evaluation. We aimed to clarify the role of rlPFC in category learning and dissociate switching and evaluation accounts using two common types of category learning tasks: matching and classification. The matching task involved matching a reference stimulus to one of four target stimuli. In the classification task, participants were shown a single stimulus and learned to classify it into one of two categories. Matching and classification are similar but place different demands on switching and evaluation. In matching, a rule can be known with certainty after a single correct answer. In classification, participants may need to evaluate evidence for a rule even after an initial correct response. This critical difference allows isolation of evaluative functions from switching functions. If the rlPFC is primarily involved in switching between representations, it should cease to be active once participants settle on a given rule in both tasks. If the rlPFC is involved in rule evaluation, its activation should persist in the classification task, but not matching. The results revealed that rlPFC activation persisted into correct trials in classification, but not matching, suggesting that it continues to be involved in the evaluations of evidence for a rule even after participants have arrived at the correct rule.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDifferences between rule-based matching and classification tasks were highlighted.\\nC_LIO_LIRostrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in evaluation of evidence for a rule in rule-based category learning tasks.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Humans tend to form social relationships with others who resemble them. Whether this sorting of like with like arises from historical patterns of migration, meso-level social structures in modern society, or individual-level selection of similar peers remains unsettled. Recent research has evaluated the possibility that unobserved genotypes may play an important role in the creation of homophilous relationships. We extend this work by using data from 9,500 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine genetic similarities among pairs of friends. While there is some evidence that friends have correlated genotypes, both at the whole-genome level as well as at trait-associated loci (via polygenic scores), further analysis suggests that meso-level forces, such as school assignment, are a principal source of genetic similarity between friends. We also observe apparent social-genetic effects in which polygenic scores of an individuals friends and schoolmates predict the individuals own educational attainment. In contrast, an individuals height is unassociated with the height genetics of peers.\\n\\nSignificanceOur study reported significant findings of a \\\"social genome\\\" that can be quantified and studied to understand human health and behavior. In a national sample of more than 9,000 American adolescents, we found evidence of social forces that act to make friends and schoolmates more genetically similar to one another as compared to random pairs of unrelated individuals. This subtle genetic similarity was observed across the entire genome and at sets of genomic locations linked with specific traits--educational attainment and body-mass index--a phenomenon we term \\\"social-genetic correlation.\\\" We also find evidence of a \\\"social-genetic effect\\\" such that the genetics of a persons friends and schoolmates influenced their own education, even after accounting for the persons own genetics.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measure to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table, which decomposes the total and global variance into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each variance component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variance and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the transition from fatty liver or steatosis to more advanced inflammatory and fibrotic stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (steatohepatitis), is key to define strategies that alter or even reverse the progression of this pathology. The Liver X Receptor alpha (LXR) controls hepatic lipid homeostasis and inflammation. Here we show that mice carrying a mutation that abolishes phosphorylation at Ser196 (S196A) in LXR exhibit reduced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis when challenged with a high fat-high cholesterol diet, despite displaying enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation. This protective effect is associated with reduced cholesterol accumulation, a key promoter of lipid-mediated hepatic damage. Reduced steatohepatitis in S196A mice involves the reprogramming of the liver transcriptome by promoting diet-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress, extracellular matrix remodelling, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Unexpectedly, changes in LXR phosphorylation uncover novel diet-specific target genes, whose regulation does not simply mirror ligand-induced LXR activation. These unique LXR phosphorylation-sensitive, diet-responsive target genes are revealed by promoting LXR occupancy and cofactor recruitment in the context of a cholesterol-rich diet. Therefore, LXR phosphorylation at Ser196 critically acts as a novel nutritional sensor that promotes a unique diet-induced transcriptome thereby modulating metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic responses important in the transition to steatohepatitis.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific reverse engineering of transcriptional networks has uncovered master regulators (MRs) of cellular networks in various cancers, yet the application of this method to neuropsychiatric disorders is largely unexplored. Here, using RNA-Seq data on postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and control subjects, we deconvolved the transcriptional network to identify MRs that mediate expression of a large body of target genes. Together with an independent RNA-Seq data on cultured cells derived from olfactory neuroepithelium, we identified TCF4, a leading SCZ risk locus implicated by genome-wide association studies, as one of the top candidate MRs that may be potentially dysregulated in SCZ. We validated the dysregulated TCF4-related transcriptional network through examining the transcription factor binding footprints inferred from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal ATAC-Seq data, as well as direct binding sites obtained from ChIP-seq data in SH-SY5Y cells. The predicted TCF4 transcriptional targets were enriched for genes showing transcriptomic changes upon knockdown of TCF4 in hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC) and glutamatergic neurons (Glut_N), based on observations from three separate cell lines. The altered TCF4 gene network perturbations in NPC, as compared to that in Glut_N, was more similar to the expression differences in the TCF4 gene network observed in the DLPFC of individuals with SCZ. Moreover, TCF4-associated gene expression changes in NPC were more enriched than Glut_N for pathways involved in neuronal activity, genome-wide significant SCZ risk genes, and SCZ-associated de novo mutations. Our results suggest that TCF4 may potentially serve as a MR of a gene network that confers susceptibility to SCZ at early stage of neurodevelopment, highlighting the importance of network dysregulation involving core genes and many hundreds of peripheral genes in conferring susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases.",

The confluence of these factors can lead to severe inflammatory disease in premature infants; however, investigating complex environment-host interactions is diZcult due to limited access to immature human tissue. Here, we demonstrate that the epithelium of human pluripotent stem cell-derived human intestinal organoids is globally similar to the immature human epithelium and we utilize HIOs to investigate complex host-microbe interactions in this naive epithelium. Our findings demonstrate that the immature epithelium is intrinsically capable of establishing a stable host-microbe symbiosis. Microbial colonization leads to complex contact and hypoxia driven responses resulting in increased antimicrobial peptide production, maturation of the mucus layer, and improved barrier function. These studies lay the groundwork for an improved mechanistic understanding of how colonization influences development of the immature human intestine.",

We designed a quantitative experimental framework to compare the in vivo tumorigenic potential of NetSig candidates, known oncogenes and random genes in mice showing that NetSig candidates induce tumors at rates comparable to known oncogenes and 10-fold higher than random genes. By reanalyzing nine tumor-inducing NetSig candidates in 242 patients with oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas, we find that two (AKT2 and TFDP2) are significantly amplified.

    "abstract": "Background & AimsCystic fibrosis (CF) patients and CF mouse models have increased risk for gastrointestinal tumors. CF mice exhibit augmented intestinal proliferation of unknown etiology and an altered intestinal environment. We examined the role of Cftr in Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, stem cell proliferation and its functional expression in the active intestinal stem cell (ISC) population. Dysregulation of intracellular pH (pHi) in CF ISCs was investigated for facilitation of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling.\\n\\nMethodsCrypt epithelia from wild-type (WT) and CF mice were compared ex vivo and in intestinal organoids (enteroids) for proliferation and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling by standard assays. Cftr in ISCs was assessed by immunoblot of sorted Sox9EGFP intestinal epithelia and pHi regulation by confocal microfluorimetry of Lgr5+-EGFP ISCs. Plasma membrane association of the Wnt transducer Disheveled 2 (Dvl2) was assessed by fluorescence imaging of live enteroids from WT and CF mice crossed with Dvl2-EGFP/RosamT/mG mice.\\n\\nResultsRelative to WT, CF intestinal crypts showed a ~30% increase in epithelial and Lgr5+ ISC proliferation and increased Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Cftr was expressed in Sox9EGFPLo ISCs and loss of Cftr induced an alkaline pHi in Lgr5+-EGFP ISCs. CF crypt-base columnar cells (CBCs) demonstrated a generalized increase in plasma membrane Dvl2-EGFP association as compared to WT. Dvl2-EGFP membrane association was charge- and pH-dependent and increased in WT CBCs by Cftr inhibition.\\n\\nConclusionsCF intestine exhibits increased ISC proliferation and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Loss of Cftr increases pHi in ISCs which stabilizes the plasma membrane association of the Wnt transducer Dvl, likely facilitating Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Absence of Cftr-dependent suppression of ISC proliferation in the CF intestine may contribute to increased risk for intestinal tumors.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=168 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/156562_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (27K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf807forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd24baorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@176497dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d2b265_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGraphical AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

However, the matrices used, such as agarose pads, lack the structured geometry of many natural microbial habitats, including in the soil or on the surfaces of plants or animals. Here we address the important question of how such geometry may control diffusive exchanges and microbial interaction. We model mathematically mutualistic interactions within a minimal unit of structure: two growing reservoirs linked by a diffusive channel through which metabolites are exchanged. The model is applied to study a synthetic mutualism, experimentally parameterised on a model algal-bacterial co-culture. Analytical and numerical solutions of the model predict conditions for the successful establishment of remote mutualisms, and how this depends, often counterintutively, on diffusion geometry. We connect our findings to understanding complex behaviour in synthetic and naturally occurring microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Several contemporary models of associative learning anticipate that the higher responding to a compound of two cues separately trained with a common outcome than to each of the cues alone -a summation effect-is modulated by the similarity between the cues forming the compound. Here, we explored this hypothesis in a series of causal learning experiments with humans. Participants were presented with two visual cues that separately predicted a common outcome and later asked for the outcome predicted by the compound of the two cues. Importantly, the cues similarity was varied between groups through changes in shape, spatial position, color, configuration and rotation. In variance with the predictions of these models, we observed similar and strong levels of summation in both groups across all manipulations of similarity (Experiments 1-5). The summation effect was significantly reduced by manipulations intended to impact assumptions about the causal independence of the cues forming the compound, but this reduction was independent of stimulus similarity (Experiment 6). These results are problematic for similarity-based models and can be more readily explained by rational approaches to causal learning.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell spreading takes place in spatially continuous environments, yet it is often modelled using discrete lattice-based approaches. Here, we use data from a series of cell proliferation assays, with a prostate cancer cell line, to calibrate a spatially continuous individual based model (IBM) of collective cell migration and proliferation. The IBM explicitly accounts for crowding effects by modifying the rate of movement, direction of movement, and the rate of proliferation by accounting for pair-wise interactions. Taking a Bayesian approach we estimate the free parameters in the IBM using rejection sampling on three separate, independent experimental data sets. Since the posterior distributions for each experiment are similar, we perform simulations with parameters sampled from a new posterior distribution generated by combining the three data sets. To explore the predictive power of the calibrated IBM, we forecast the evolution of a fourth experimental data set. Overall, we show how to calibrate a lattice-free IBM to experimental data, and our work highlights the importance of interactions between individuals. Despite great care taken to distribute cells as uniformly as possible experimentally, we find evidence of significant spatial clustering over short distances, suggesting that standard mean-field models could be inappropriate.",

    "abstract": "Cell assembly is a hypothetical functional unit of information processing in the brain. While technologies for recording large-scale neural activity have been advanced, mathematical methods to analyze sequential activity patterns of cell-assembly are severely limited. Here, we propose a method to extract cell-assembly sequences repeated at multiple time scales and various precisions from irregular neural population activity. The key technology is to combine \\\"edit similarity\\\" in computer science with machine-learning clustering algorithms, where the former defines a \\\"distance\\\" between two strings as the minimal number of operations required to transform one string to the other. Our method requires no external references for pattern detection, and is tolerant of spike timing jitters and length irregularity in assembly sequences. These virtues enabled simultaneous automatic detections of hippocampal place-cell sequences during locomotion and their time-compressed replays during resting states. Furthermore, our method revealed previously undetected cell-assembly structure in the rat prefrontal cortex during goal-directed behavior. Thus, our method expands the horizon of cell-assembly analysis.",

    "abstract": "The present study is designed to identify the influences of genetic background to optic nerve regeneration using the two parental strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and 7 BXD recombinant inbred strains. To study regeneration in the optic nerve, Pten was knocked down in the retinal ganglion cells using AAV, and a mild inflammatory response was induced by an intravitreal injection of zymosan with CPT-cAMP, and the axons were damaged by optic nerve crush (ONC). Regenerating axons were labeled by Cholera Toxin B and quantified 14 days after ONC. The number of axons at 0.5 mm and 1 mm from the crush site were counted. In addition, we measured the distance that 5 axons had grown down the nerve and the longest distance a single axon reached. Results showed a considerable amount of differential axonal growth across all 9 BXD strains. There was a significant difference (P=0.014 Mann-Whitney U test) in the regenerative capacity in the number of axons reaching 0.5 mm from a low of 1487.6 {+/-} 264.9 axons in BXD102 to a high of 4175.8 {+/-} 648.6 axons in BXD29.

    "abstract": "With growing interest in monitoring mutational processes in normal tissues, tumor heterogeneity, and cancer evolution under therapy, the ability to accurately and economically detect ultra-rare mutations is becoming increasingly important. However, this capability has often been compromised by significant sequencing, PCR and DNA preparation error rates. Here, we describe FERMI (Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification) - a novel method designed to eliminate majority of these sequencing and library preparation errors in order to significantly improve rare somatic mutation detection. This method leverages barcoded targeting probes to capture and sequence DNA of interest with single copy resolution. The variant calls from the barcoded sequencing data then further filtered in a position-dependent fashion against an adaptive, context-aware null model in order to distinguish true variants. As a proof of principle, we employ FERMI to probe bone marrow biopsies from leukemia patients, and show that rare mutations and clonal evolution can be tracked throughout cancer treatment, including during historically intractable periods like minimum residual disease. Importantly, FERMI is able to accurately detect nascent clonal expansions within leukemias in a manner that may facilitate the early detection and characterization of cancer relapse.",

    "abstract": "Acquired therapy resistance to cancer treatment is a common and serious clinical problem. The classic U-shape model for the emergence of resistance supposes that: (1) treatment changes the selective pressure on the treatment-naive tumour; (2) this shifting pressure creates a proliferative or survival difference between sensitive cancer cells and either an existing or de novo mutant; (3) the resistant cells then out-compete the sensitive cells and - if further interventions (like drug holidays or new drugs or dosage changes) are not pursued - take over the tumour: returning it to a state dangerous to the patient. The emergence of ruxolitinib resistance in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) seems to challenge the classic model: we see the global properties of resistance, but not the drastic change in clonal architecture expected with the selection bottleneck. To study this, we explore three population-level models as alternatives to the classic model of resistance. These three effective models are designed in such a way that they are distinguishable based on limited experimental data on the time-progression of resistance in CMML. We also propose a candidate reductive implementation of the proximal cause of resistance to ground these effective theories. With these reductive implementations in mind, we also explore the impact of oxygen diffusion and spatial structure more generally on the dynamics of CMML in the bone marrow concluding that, even small fluctuations in oxygen availability can seriously impact the efficacy of ruxolitinib. Finally, we look at the ability of spatially distributed cytokine signaling feedback loops to produce a relapse in symptoms similar to what we observe in the clinic.",

We tested the hypothesis that the altered behavior of hosts due to parasitic manipulation is also subject to selection imposed by changes in environmental conditions over time. Our model system is ants manipulated by parasitic fungi to bite onto vegetation. We analyzed the correlation between forest type (tropical vs. temperate) and biting substrate (leaf vs. twigs), the time required for the fungi to reach reproductive maturity, and the phylogenetic relationship among specimens from tropical and temperate forests in different parts of the globe. We show that the fungal development in temperate forest is longer than the period of time leaves are present and the ants are manipulated to bite twigs. When biting twigs, 90% of the we examined dead ants had their legs wrapped around twigs, which appears to provide better attachment to the plant. Ancestral state character reconstruction suggests that the leaf biting is the ancestral trait and that twig biting is a convergent trait in temperate regions of the globe. These three lines of evidence suggest that changes in environmental conditions have shaped the manipulative behavior of the host by its parasite.",

We demonstrate a simple tensor components analysis (TCA) can meet this challenge by extracting three interconnected low dimensional descriptions of neural data: neuron factors, reflecting cell assemblies; temporal factors, reflecting rapid circuit dynamics mediating perceptions, thoughts, and actions within each trial; and trial factors, describing both long-term learning and trial-to-trial changes in cognitive state. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TCA by revealing insights into diverse datasets derived from artificial neural networks, large-scale calcium imaging of rodent prefrontal cortex during maze navigation, and multielectrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during brain machine interface learning.",

While significant in vivo work has been done to elaborate BF function in nonhuman rodents and primates, comparatively limited work has examined the in vivo function of the human BF. In the current study we used multi-echo resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) from 100 young adults (18-34 years) to assess the potential segregation of human BF nuclei as well as their associated projections. Bottom-up clustering of voxel-wise functional connectivity maps yielded adjacent functional clusters within the BF that closely aligned with the distinct, hypothesized nuclei important to cognition: the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and the me-dial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DB). Examining their separate functional connections, the NBM and MS/DB revealed distinct projection patterns, suggesting a conservation of nuclei-specific functional connectivity with homologous regions known to be anatomically innervated by the BF. Specifically, the NBM demonstrated coupling with a widespread cortical network as well as the amygdala, whereas the MS/DB revealed coupling with a more circumscribed net-work, including the orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampal complex. Collectively, these in vivo rs-fMRI data demonstrate that the human BF nuclei support functional networks distinct as-pects of resting-state functional networks, suggesting the human BF may be a neuromodulatory hub important for orchestrating network dynamics.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe basal forebrain NBM and the MS/DB support two distinct functional networks\\nC_LIO_LIFunctional networks closely overlap with known anatomical basal forebrain\\nC_LIO_LIBasal forebrain networks are distinct from known resting-state functional networks\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota are shaped by a combination of ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in [~]30 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over [~]6 month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps are seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.",

    "abstract": "Dinoflagellates are one of the most abundant and functionally diverse groups of eukaryotes. Despite an overall scarcity of genomic information for dinoflagellates, constantly emerging high-throughput sequencing resources can be used to characterize and compare these organisms. We assembled de novo and processed 46 dinoflagellate transcriptomes and used a sequence similarity network (SSN) to compare the underlying genomic basis of functional features within the group. This approach constitutes the most comprehensive picture to date of the genomic potential of dinoflagellates. A core proteome composed of 252 connected components (CCs) of putative conserved protein domains (pCDs) was identified. Of these, 206 were novel and 16 lacked any functional annotation in public databases. Integration of functional information in our network analyses allowed investigation of pCDs specifically associated to functional traits. With respect to toxicity, sequences homologous to those of proteins involved in toxin biosynthesis pathways (e.g. sxtA1-4 and sxtG) were not specific to known toxin-producing species. Although not fully specific to symbiosis, the most represented functions associated with proteins involved in the symbiotic trait were related to membrane processes and ion transport. Overall, our SSN approach led to identification of 45,207 and 90,794 specific and constitutive pCDs of respectively the toxic and symbiotic species represented in our analyses. Of these, 56% and 57% respectively (i.e. 25,393 and 52,193 pCDs) completely lacked annotation in public databases. This stresses the extent of our lack of knowledge, while emphasizing the potential of SSNs to identify candidate pCDs for further functional genomic characterization.",

Frequency dependent capacitive spectra further indicated presence of electrical isosbestic points(at 0.8 and 9MHz), implying two state dieletric transitions at critical frequencies. A notable reult was a Schottky diode like behavior in the IV curve. Voltage dependent conductance with conductance peaks near the Schottky diode threshold was observed. We obtained facilitated growth of photosynthetic biofilm in presence of graphene. Lastly higher bacterial metabolism was seen in graphene incorporated biofilm. For this zero band gap Dirac material this can only be interpreted as coupling of the electron transport chain of the bacterial biofilm and the graphene electron cloud.",

    "abstract": "Culture-independent molecular techniques and advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies make large-scale epidemiological studies on microbiota feasible. A challenge using NGS is to obtain high reproducibility and repeatability, which is mostly attained through robust amplification. We aimed to assess the reproducibility of saliva microbiota by comparing triplicate samples. The microbiota was produced with simplified in-house 16S amplicon assays taking advantage of large number of barcodes. The assays included primers with Truseq (TS-tailed) or Nextera (NX-tailed) adapters and either with dual index or dual index plus a 6-nt internal index. All amplification protocols produced consistent microbial profiles for the same samples. Although, in our study, reproducibility was highest for the TS-tailed method. Five replicates of a single sample, prepared with the TS-tailed 1-step protocol without internal index sequenced on the HiSeq platform provided high alpha-diversity and low standard deviation (mean Shannon and Inverse Simpson diversity was 3.19 {+/-} 0.097 and 13.56 {+/-} 1.634 respectively). Large-scale profiling of microbiota can consistently be produced by all 16S amplicon assays. The TS-tailed-1S dual index protocol is preferred since it provides repeatable profiles on the HiSeq platform and are less labour intensive.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, including data acquisition, pre-processing and analysis, have enabled research on the contributions of subcortical brain nuclei to human cognition and behavior. At the same time, these developments have led to an increasing need for a high-resolution probabilistic in-vivo anatomical atlas of subcortical nuclei. In order to fill this gap, we constructed high spatial resolution, three-dimensional templates, using joint high accuracy diffeomorphic registration of T1- and T2- weighted structural images from 168 typical adults between 22 and 35 years old. In these templates, many tissue boundaries are clearly visible, which would otherwise be impossible to delineate in data from individual studies. The resulting delineation provides a more accurate parcellation of subcortical nuclei than current histology-based atlases. We further created a companion library of software tools for atlas development, to offer an open and evolving resource for the creation of a crowd-sourced in-vivo probabilistic anatomical atlas of the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Damage following traumatic brain injury or stroke can often extend beyond the boundaries of the initial insult and can lead to maladaptive cortical reorganisation. On the other hand, beneficial cortical reorganisation leading to recovery of function can also occur. Here, we used resting state FMRI (rsFMRI) to examine how functional connectivity in the macaque brain changed across time in response to lesions to the prefrontal cortex, and how this reorganisation correlated with changes in behaviour. Two monkeys were trained to perform location-based and object-based delayed match-to-sample tasks. We also collected rsFMRI data under general anaesthesia at two pre-lesion time-points, separated by 3-4 weeks. After two cycles of testing and scanning, the animals received a principal sulcus lesion followed by an additional 4 cycles of testing and scanning. Later, the same animals received a second lesion to the opposite hemisphere and additional cycles of testing and scanning.\\n\\nBoth animals showed a marked behavioural impairment following the first lesion, which was associated with a decrease in functional connectivity, predominantly within frontal-frontal networks in both hemispheres. Approximately 8 weeks following the lesion, performance improved, as did functional connectivity within these networks. Following the second lesion, functional connectivity again decreased and this was associated with a marginal behavioural deficit that did not recover.\\n\\nOur data show that behavioural impairments reflect not just the removal of the lesioned area, but also disturbance to an extensive cortical network. This network can recover by restoring and/or strengthening pre-existing connections, leading to improvement in behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In bacterial type 3 secretion, substrate proteins are actively transported from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host cell cytoplasm by a large membrane-embedded machinery called the injectisome. Injectisomes transport secretion substrates in response to specific environmental signals, but the molecular details by which the cytosolic secretion substrates are selected and transported through the type 3 secretion pathway remain unclear. Secretion activity and substrate selectivity are thought to be controlled by a sorting platform consisting of the proteins SctK, SctQ, SctL, and SctN, which together localize to the cytoplasmic side of membrane-embedded injectisomes. However, recent work revealed that sorting platform proteins additionally exhibit substantial cytosolic populations and that SctQ reversibly binds to and dissociates from the cytoplasmic side of membrane-embedded injectisomes. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that dynamic molecular turnover at the injectisome and cytosolic assembly among sorting platform proteins is a critical regulatory component of type 3 secretion. To determine whether sorting platform complexes exist in the cytosol, we measured the diffusive properties of the two central sorting platform proteins, SctQ and SctL, using live cell high-throughput 3D single-molecule tracking microscopy. Single-molecule trajectories, measured in wild-type and mutant Yersinia enterocolitica cells, reveal that both SctQ and SctL exist in several distinct diffusive states in the cytosol, indicating that these proteins form stable homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes in their native environment. Our findings provide the first diffusive state-resolved insights into the dynamic regulatory network that interfaces stationary membrane-embedded injectisomes with the soluble cytosolic components of the type 3 secretion system.",

Recently, biochemical analyses have identified secreted small ALKAL proteins (FAM150, AUG) as potential ligands for human ALK and the related Leukocyte Tyrosine Kinase (LTK). In the zebrafish Danio rerio, DrLtk, which is similar to human ALK in sequence and domain structure, controls the development of iridophores, neural crest-derived pigment cells. Hence, the zebrafish system allows studying Alk/Ltk and Alkals involvement in neural crest regulation in vivo. Using zebrafish pigment pattern formation, Drosophila eye patterning, and cell culture-based assays, we show that zebrafish Alkals potently activate zebrafish Ltk and human ALK driving downstream signalling events. Overexpression of the three Dr Alkals cause ectopic iridophore development whereas loss of function alleles lead to spatially distinct patterns of iridophore loss in zebrafish larvae and adults. alkal loss of function triple mutants completely lack iridophores and are larval lethal as is the case for ltk null mutants. Our results provide the first in vivo evidence of (i) activation of ALK/LTK family receptors by ALKALs and (ii) an involvement of these ligand-receptor complexes in neural crest development.",

Using the expression profiling of fluorescent clones from two independent libraries from soil samples, we directly analysed the regulatory dynamics of novel promoter elements, addressing the relationship between the \\\"metaconstitutome\\\" of a bacterial community and its environmental context. Through the construction and screening of plasmid-based metagenomic libraries followed by in silico analyses, we were able to provide both (i) a consensus exogenous promoter elements recognizable by Escherichia coli and (ii) an estimation of the accessible promoter sequences in a metagenomic library, which was close to 1% of the whole set of available promoters. The results presented here should provide new directions for the exploration through functional metagenomics of novel regulatory sequences in bacteria, which could expand the Synthetic Biology toolbox for novel biotechnological and biomedical applications.",

The McrA subunit possesses up to five post-translational modifications (PTM) at its active site. Bioinformatic analyses had previously suggested that methanogenesis marker protein 10 (Mmp10) could play an important role in methanogenesis. To examine its role, MMP1554, the gene encoding Mmp10 in Methanococcus maripaludis, was deleted with a new genetic tool, resulting in the specific loss of the 5-(S)-methylarginine PTM of residue 275 in the McrA subunit and a 40~60 % reduction in the maximal rates of methane formation by whole cells. Methylation was restored by complementations with the wild-type gene. However, the rates of methane formation of the complemented strains were not always restored to the wild type level. This study demonstrates the importance of Mmp10 and the methyl-Arg PTM on Mcr activity.",

We have identified auxin regulated proteins in whole seedlings, roots and hypocotyls and at three different time points (30 min, 120 min and 3 hours) using an iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification) based quantitative proteomics approach. These profiling experiments detected 4,701 proteins from seedling tissue, 6,740 proteins from root tissue and 3,925 proteins from hypocotyl tissue. Comparisons between the differentially expressed proteins data sets showed little overlap, suggesting that auxin proteomes exhibit both temporal and spatial specificity. Numerous proteins showed significant changes in abundance following auxin treatment independent of changes in cognate transcript abundance. This includes several well characterized proteins with various roles in auxin pathways, suggesting that complex gene regulation mechanisms follow auxin signaling events. Specifically, regulation of translation may play a role as inferred from MapMan categorization analyses and protein interaction networks comprised of auxin regulated proteins. Additionally, functional categorization of auxin regulated proteins indicates rapid and complex metabolic changes occur in both roots and hypocotyls in response to auxin which are not apparent from transcriptome analyses. Altogether these data describe novel auxin-regulated proteomes and are an excellent resource for identifying new downstream signaling components related to auxin-mediated plant growth and development.",

While lacking inherent structure, the majority of IDPs do reach a folded state via interaction with a protein partner, presenting a deep entanglement of the folding and binding process. Protein disorder has been recognized as a major determinant in several properties of proteins; yet the way the binding process is reflected in these features in general lacks this detail of description. Recent advances in database development enabled us to identify three basic scenarios of the interplay between folding and binding in unprecedented detail. These scenarios have fundamentally different properties in terms of protein sequence, structure, function and regulation, depending on the structural properties of the interacting partners. Strikingly, the existence of a binding partner and its structural properties influence all analyzed properties of proteins to the same extent as the divide between inherent order or disorder. The appreciation of this interplay between folding and binding is the basis for the successful charting of unknown territories in the protein interactome, the understanding of how different binding modes assemble regulatory networks, and the development of future pharmaceutical applications.",

    "abstract": "Proteasomes are large intracellular complexes responsible for the degradation of cellular proteins. The altered protein homeostasis of cancer cells results in increased dependency on proteasome function. There are several different proteasome complexes that may be assembled in cells, with the 20S catalytic core common to them all. 20S proteasomes can function in isolation, or as part of larger complexes (26S) with regulatory particles (RP) such as the 19S that is needed for the targeting and processing of ubiquitinated substrates. Proteasome inhibitors target the catalytic barrel (20S) and thus this inhibition does not allow the deconvolution of the distinct roles of 20S vs. 26S proteasomes in cancer progression. We examined the degree of dependency of cancer cells specifically to the level of the 26S proteasome complex. We found that oncogenic transformation of human and mouse immortalized cells with mutant Ras induced a strong increase in the translation of the 26S proteasome subunits, giving rise to high 26S complex levels. We show that depletion of a single subunit of the 19S RP was sufficient to significantly reduce the 26S proteasome level and lower the cellular 26S/20S ratio. We further demonstrate that the accumulated 26S proteasome was essential for the viability of the transformed cells. Moreover, the viability of 20 different cancer cell lines, but not normal human fibroblasts, was severely compromised upon specific 26S proteasome suppression regardless of their p53 status. Suppression of 26S activated the UPR and Caspase-3, which at least partially explains the cell-killing effect. Morphologically, suppression of the 26S proteasome resulted in cytoplasm shrinkage and nuclear deformation. Thus, the tumor cell-specific addiction to high 26S proteasome levels sets the stage for future strategies in cancer therapy.",

Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5  trios of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a new pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Comparison of genomic events in the tumours and matched disease models displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, and genome-wide similarities of copy number changes. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events revealed high variability across tumours and disease models, but also highlighted previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. Our approach and results demonstrate that PDX and PDO recapitulate PDAC tumourigenesis with respect to simple somatic mutations and copy number changes, and capture major SV events that are found in both resected and metastatic tumours.",

    "abstract": "Blue light has been shown to elicit a tumbling response in E. coli, a non-phototrophic bacterium. The exact mechanism of this phototactic response is still unknown, and its biological significance remains unclear. Here, we quantify phototaxis in E. coli by analyzing single-cell trajectories in populations of free-swimming bacteria before and after light exposure. Bacterial strains expressing only one type of chemoreceptor reveal that all five E. coli receptors - Aer, Tar, Tsr, Tap and Trg - are capable of mediating a response to light. In particular, light exposure elicits a running response in Tap-only strain, the opposite of the tumbling response observed for all other strains. Light therefore emerges as a universal stimulus for all E. coli chemoreceptors. We also show that blue light exposure causes a reversible decrease in swimming velocity, a proxy for proton motive force. We hypothesize that rather than sensing light directly, chemoreceptors sense light-induced perturbations in proton motive force.\\n\\nImportanceOur findings provide new insights on the mechanism of E. coli phototaxis, showing that all five chemoreceptor types respond to light and that their interactions play an important role in cell behavior. Our results also open up new avenues for examining and manipulating E. coli taxis. Since light is a universal stimulus, it may provide a way to quantify interactions between different types of receptors. Since light is easier to control spatially and temporally than chemicals, it may be used to study swimming behavior in complex environments.

    "abstract": "Purifying selection reduces genetic diversity, both at sites under direct selection and at linked neutral sites. This process, known as background selection, is thought to play an important role in shaping genomic diversity in natural populations. Yet despite its importance, the effects of background selection are not fully understood. Previous theoretical analyses of this process have taken a backwards-time approach based on the structured coalescent. While they provide some insight, these methods are either limited to very small samples or are computationally prohibitive. Here, we present a new forward-time analysis of the trajectories of both neutral and deleterious mutations at a nonrecombining locus. We find that strong purifying selection leads to remarkably rich dynamics: neutral mutations can exhibit sweep-like behavior, and deleterious mutations can reach substantial frequencies even when they are guaranteed to eventually go extinct. Our analysis of these dynamics allows us to calculate analytical expressions for the full site frequency spectrum. We find that whenever background selection is strong enough to lead to a reduction in genetic diversity, it also results in substantial distortions to the site frequency spectrum, which can mimic the effects of population expansions or positive selection. Because these distortions are most pronounced in the low and high frequency ends of the spectrum, they become particularly important in larger samples, but may have small effects in smaller samples. We also apply our forward-time framework to calculate other quantities, such as the ultimate fates of polymorphisms or the fitnesses of their ancestral backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Gap junctions (GJs) assembled from connexin (Cx) proteins play a pivotal role in cell-to-cell communication by forming channels that connect the cytosols of adjacent cells. Connexin 43, the best-studied Cx, is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates. While phosphorylation is known to regulate multiple aspects of GJ function, much less is known about the role ubiquitination plays in these processes. Here we show by using ubiquitination-type specific antibodies and Cx43 lysine (K) to arginine (R) mutants that a portion of Cx43 in GJs can become K63-polyubiquitinated on K264 and K303. Relevant Cx43 K/R mutants assembled significantly larger GJ plaques, exhibited much longer protein half-lives and were internalization impaired. Interestingly, ubiquitin-deficient Cx43 mutants accumulated as hyper-phosphorylated polypeptides in the plasma membrane, suggesting that K63-polyubiquitination may be triggered by phosphorylation. Phospho-specific Cx43 antibodies revealed that upregulated phosphorylation affected serines 368, 279/282, and 255, well-known regulatory PKC and MAPK phosphorylation sites. Together, these novel findings suggest that upon internalization, some Cx43 in GJs becomes K63-polyubiquitinated, ubiquitination is critical for GJ internalization, and that K63-polyubiquitination may be induced by Cx phosphorylation.\\n\\nSummary StatementHere we show that connexin 43 in gap junctions becomes K63-poly ubiquitinated on lysines 264 and 303 and its requirement for gap junction endocytosis. These novel findings significantly contribute to our understanding of GJ turnover and patho-/physiology.\\n\\nAbbreviations used",

    "abstract": "State-space and action representations form the building blocks of decision-making processes in the brain; states map external cues to the current situation of the agent whereas actions provide the set of motor commands from which the agent can choose to achieve specific goals. Although these factors differ across environments, it is not currently known whether or how accurately state and action representations are acquired by the agent because previous experiments have typically provided this information a priori through instruction or pre-training. Here we show that, in the absence of such a priori knowledge, state and action representations adapt to reflect the structure of the world. We used a sequential decision-making task in rats in which they were required to pass through multiple states before reaching the goal, and for which the number of states and how they map onto external cues were not known a priori. We found that, early in training, animals selected actions as if the task was not sequential and outcomes were the immediate consequence of the most proximal action. During the course of training, however, rats recovered the true structure of the environment and made decisions based on the expanded state-space, reflecting the multiple stages of the task. We found a similar pattern with actions; early in training animals only considered the execution of single actions whereas, after training, they created useful action sequences that expanded the set of available actions. We conclude that the profile of choices shows a gradual shift from simple representations of actions and states to more complex structures compatible with the structure of the world.",

    "abstract": "Active modules identification has received much attention due to its ability to reveal regulatory and signaling mechanisms of a given cellular response. Most existing algorithms identify active modules by extracting connected nodes with high activity scores from a graph. These algorithms do not consider other topological properties such as community structure, which may correspond to functional units. In this paper, we propose an active module identification algorithm based on a novel objective function, which considers both and network topology and nodes activity. This objective is formulated as a constrained quadratic programming problem, which is convex and can be solved by iterative methods. Furthermore, the framework is extended to the multilayer dynamic PPI networks.

    "abstract": "BackgroundVultures have adapted the remarkable ability to feed on carcasses that may contain microorganisms that would be pathogenic to most other animals. The holobiont concept suggests that the genetic basis of such adaptation may not only lie within their genomes, but additionally in their associated microbes. To explore this, we generated shotgun DNA sequencing datasets of the facial and gut microbiomes from the black and turkey vultures. We characterized i) the functional potential and taxonomic diversity of their microbiomes, ii) the potential pathogenic challenges they face, and iii) elements in the microbiome that could play a protective role to the vultures face and gut.\\n\\nResultsWe found elements involved in diseases, such as periodontitis and pneumonia (more abundant in the face), and gas gangrene and food poisoning (more abundant in the gut). Interestingly, we found taxa and functions with potential for playing health beneficial roles, such as antilisterial bacteria in the gut, and genes for the production of antiparasites and antiinsectisides in the face. Based on the identified phages, we suggest that phages aid in the control, and possibly elimination as in phage therapy, of microbes reported as pathogenic to a variety of species. Interestingly, we also identified Adineta vaga in the gut, an invertebrate that feeds on dead bacteria and protozoans, suggesting a defensive predatory mechanism. Finally, we suggest a colonization resistance role though biofilm formation played by Fusobacteria and Clostridia in the gut.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of complementing genomic analyses with metagenomics in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the host-microbial alliance and show the importance of microbiome-mediated health protection for adaptation to extreme diets, such as scavenging.",

    "abstract": "The success of social insect colonies is dependent upon efficient and dynamic allocation of resources to alternate queen and worker castes. The developmental and molecular mechanisms regulating the caste fate of individual larvae in response to environmental cues have been the focus of intense study. However, the mechanisms regulating colony-level resource allocation into alternate castes (i.e. caste allocation ratios) are less well studied. Here, we systematically manipulate colony demography to elucidate the social regulatory mechanisms of caste allocation in the ant Monomorium pharaonis. We find that differences in caste allocation result from differences in timing and efficiency of culling of very young reproductive-destined larvae, which are always present in colonies. Based on our results, we develop a conceptual model depicting how colonies integrate numerous individual-level caste determination decisions to regulate colony-level caste allocation. We propose that adult workers make decisions about culling larvae based on the ratio of the number of workers to the number of eggs contained in colonies, likely signalled by pheromone present on eggs. This strategy is a bet-hedging strategy which enables the dynamic alteration of colony demography in response to internal and external conditions. The strategy is likely key to the ability of M. pharaonis and similar ants to thrive in disturbed habitats and to become widespread invasive species.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe defining feature of social insect societies is the presence of alternate queen (reproductive) and worker (non-reproductive) castes of individuals. The fitness of social insect colonies is dependent upon efficient allocation of resources to alternate castes, particularly in the case of highly polygynous (multi-queen) societies. However, the mechanisms by which such societies regulate caste allocation are largely unknown. In this study, we show that colonies manipulate their production of queens (and also males) versus workers according to the present density of eggs in the colony, which serves as a reliable indicator of queens fertility. Provided egg density is high, colonies kill queen-and male-destined larvae; when egg density falls, colonies begin to rear queens and males. This flexible resource allocation strategy is key to the ability of highly polygynous species to thrive in marginal (often human-associated) habitats.",

This diploid plant is native to South America and is one of the first Nicotiana species with Agrobacterium cellular T-DNA (cT-DNA). Its cT-DNA is a partial, inverted repeat, called gT. Tree tobacco belongs to the section Noctiflorae. Sequencing of the genomes of N. tomentosiformis and N. otophora (section Tomentosae) and N. tabacum (section Nicotiana) allowed the detection of previously unknown multiple cT-DNAs, raising the question whether there are other T-DNA insertions in the N. glauca. NGS data can help answer this question. Besides, N. glauca contains a profile of alkaloids different from N. tabacum. The plant is used for medicinal purposes. Comparative analysis of genomic data of phylogenetically distant tobacco species will provide valuable information on the genetic basis for various traits, especially secondary metabolism.\\n\\nFindingsWe report a high-depth sequencing and de novo assembly of N. glauca full genome, which was obtained from 210 Gb Illumina HiSeq data. The final draft genome is 3.2 Gb, with N50 size of 31.1 kbp. T-DNA analysis confirmed the presence of the previously described gT insertion and the absence of other ones.\\n\\nConclusionWe provide the first comprehensive de novo full genome assembly of three tobacco, and a cT-DNA insertion analysis.

Specific antibiotic classes correlate more strongly with recurrent or persistent C. difficile infection. As such, we utilized a mouse model of infection to explore the effect of distinct antibiotic classes on the impact that infection has on community-level transcription and metabolic signatures shortly following pathogen colonization and how those changes may associate with persistence of C. difficile. Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed that C. difficile infection had significantly larger impacts on the metabolic environment across cefoperazone and streptomycin-pretreated mice, which become persistently colonized compared to clindamycin-pretreated mice where infection quickly became undetectable. Through metagenome-enabled metatranscriptomics we observed that transcripts for genes associated with carbon and energy acquisition were greatly reduced in infected animals, suggesting those niches were instead occupied by C. difficile. Furthermore, the largest changes in transcription were seen in the least abundant species indicating that C. difficile may \\\"attack the loser\\\" in gut environments where sustained infection occurs more readily. Overall, our results suggest that C. difficile is able to restructure the nutrient-niche landscape in the gut to promote persistent infection.",

We study spatial theta cells in simulations and single-unit recordings from exploring rats to ask whether temporal phase codes may anchor spatial representations to the outside world. We theorize that an experience-independent mechanism for temporal coding may combine with burst synchronization to continuously calibrate self-motion to allocentric reference frames. Subcortical recordings revealed spatial theta cells with strong rate-phase correlations related to distinct theta phases. Simulations of bursting neurons and networks explained that relationship and, with competitive learning, demonstrated flexible spatial synchronization patterns when driven by low-dimensional spatial components from the recording data.

The dominant neuropsychological approach to exercise behavior explains physical activity as a reward.

Three types of automatic processes were tested: Affective reactions, attentional capture, and approach tendencies. Results show that automatic reactions toward stimuli depicting exercise behaviors explained individuals level of physical activity. Brain imaging results show that stimuli associated with exercise behavior activate regions associated with reward, but these studies were scarce.\\n\\nConclusionReward is an important factor of exercise behavior. There is strong evidence showing that physical activity is a reward. While brain imaging results suggest that sedentary behaviors are also a reward, behaviors minimizing energetic cost have not been investigated so far. Additional studies are required to establish a strong and complete framework of reward in exercise behavior.\\n\\nKey points- Behavioral and brain imaging studies using different types of automatic behavior show that physical activity is a reward\\n- Behaviors minimizing energetic cost have been essential to evolutionary survival and are likely to be a reward. However, experimental evidence remains scarce\\n- The dominant neuropsychological approaches to exercise behavior may be incomplete, which may partly explain our current inability to counteract the pandemic of physical inactivity",
