    "abstract": "Functional characterization of the noncoding genome is essential for the biological understanding of gene regulation and disease. Here, we introduce the computational framework PINES (Phenotype-Informed Noncoding Element Scoring) which predicts the functional impact of noncoding variants by integrating epigenetic annotations in a phenotype-dependent manner. A unique feature of PINES is that analyses may be customized towards genomic annotations from cell types of the highest relevance given the phenotype of interest. We illustrate that PINES identifies functional noncoding variation more accurately than methods that do not use phenotype-weighted knowledge, while at the same time being flexible and easy to use via a dedicated web portal.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences, colloquially known as  jumping genes because of their ability to replicate to new genomic locations. Given a vector of transfer (e.g. tick or virus), TEs can jump further: between organisms or species in a process known as horizontal transfer (HT). Here we propose that LINE-1 (L1) and Bovine-B (BovB), the two most abundant TE families in mammals, were initially introduced as foreign DNA via ancient HT events. Using a 503-genome dataset, we identify multiple ancient L1 HT events in eukaryotes and provide evidence that L1s infiltrated the mammalian lineage after the monotreme-therian split. We also extend the BovB paradigm by increasing the number of estimated transfer events compared to previous studies, finding new potential blood-sucking parasite vectors and occurrences in new lineages (e.g. bats, frog). Given that these TEs make up nearly half of the genome sequence in todays mammals, our results provide the first evidence that HT can have drastic and long-term effects on the new host genomes. This revolutionizes our perception of genome evolution to consider external factors, such as the natural introduction of foreign DNA. With the advancement of genome sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, we anticipate our study to be the first of many large-scale phylogenomic analyses exploring the role of HT in genome evolution.\\n\\nSignificance statementLINE-1 (L1) elements occupy about half of most mammalian genomes (1), and they are believed to be strictly vertically inherited (2). Mutagenic L1 insertions are thought to account for approximately 1 of every 1000 random, disease-causing insertions in humans (4-7). Our research indicates that the very presence of L1s in humans, and other therian mammals, is due to an ancient transfer event - which has drastic implications for our perception of genome evolution. Using a machina analyses over 503 genomes, we trace the origins of L1 and BovB retrotransposons across the tree of life, and provide evidence of their long-term impact on eukaryotic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience has long focused on finding encoding models that effectively ask \\\"what predicts neural spiking?\\\" and generalized linear models (GLMs) are a typical approach. It is often unknown how much of explainable neural activity is captured, or missed, when fitting a GLM. Here we compared the predictive performance of GLMs to three leading machine learning methods: feedforward neural networks, gradient boosted trees (using XGBoost), and stacked ensembles that combine the predictions of several methods. We predicted spike counts in macaque motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices from standard representations of reaching kinematics, and in rat hippocampal cells from open field location and orientation. In general, the modern methods (particularly XGBoost and the ensemble) produced more accurate spike predictions and were less sensitive to the preprocessing of features. This discrepancy in performance suggests that standard feature sets may often relate to neural activity in a nonlinear manner not captured by GLMs. Encoding models built with machine learning techniques, which can be largely automated, more accurately predict spikes and can offer meaningful benchmarks for simpler models.",

Here we present iREAD (intron REtention Analysis and Detector), a tool to detect IR events genome-wide from high-throughput RNA-seq data. The command line interface for iREAD is implemented in Python. iREAD takes as input an existing BAM file, representing the transcriptome, and a text file containing the intron coordinates of a genome. It then 1) counts all reads that overlap intron regions, 2) detects IR vents by analyzing features of reads such as depth and distribution patterns, and 3) outputs a list of retained introns into a tab-delimited text file. The output can be directly used for further exploratory analysis such as differential intron expression and functional enrichment. iREAD provides a new and generic tool to interrogate poly-A enriched transcriptomic data of intron regions.\\n\\nAvailabilitywww.libpls.net/iread\\n\\nContactNathan.Price@systemsbiology.org",

    "abstract": "This preprint has been reviewed and recommended by Peer Community In Evolutionary Biology (http://dx.doi.org/10.24072/pci.evolbiol.100034). Despite being able to conclusively demonstrate local adaptation, we are still often unable to objectively determine the climatic drivers of local adaptation. Given the rapid rate of global change, understanding the climatic drivers of local adaptation is vital. Not only will this tell us which climate axes matter most to population fitness, but such knowledge is critical to inform management strategies such as translocation and targeted gene flow. While simple assessments of geographic trait variation are useful, geographic variation (and its associations with environment) may represent plastic, rather than evolved, differences. Additionally, the vast number of trait-environment combinations makes it difficult to determine which aspects of the environment populations adapt to. Here we argue that by incorporating a measure of landscape connectivity as a proxy for gene flow, we can differentiate between trait-environment relationships underpinned by genetic differences versus those that reflect phenotypic plasticity. By doing so, we can rapidly shorten the list of trait-environment combinations that may be of adaptive significance. We demonstrate how this reasoning can be applied using data on geographic trait variation in a lizard species from Australia's Wet Tropics rainforest. Our analysis reveals an overwhelming signal of local adaptation for the traits and environmental variables we investigated. Our analysis also allows us to rank environmental variables by the degree to which they appear to be driving local adaptation. Although encouraging, methodological issues remain: we point to these issue in the hope that the community can rapidly hone the methods we sketch here. The promise is a rapid and general approach to identifying the environmental drivers of local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAnalysis toolkits for shotgun metagenomic data achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation. Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe binary is freely available for non-commercial users at enterome.fr/site/downloads/ Contact: florian.plaza-onate@inra.fr\\n\\nSupplementary informationAvailable in the file named Supplementary Information.pdf",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional bursting involves genes rapidly switching between active and inactive states. Chromatin remodelers actively target arrays of acetylated nucleosomes at select enhancers and promoters to facilitate or shut down the repeated recruitment of RNA Pol II during transcriptional bursting. It is unknown how acetylated chromatin is dynamically targeted and regulated by chromatin remodelers such as PBAF. Thus, we sought to understand how PBAF targets acetylated chromatin using live-cell single molecule fluorescence microscopy. Our work reveals chromatin hubs throughout the nucleus where PBAF rapidly cycles on and off the genome. Deletion of PBAFs bromodomains impairs targeting, stable engagement and persistent binding on chromatin in hubs. Interestingly, PBAF has a higher probability to stably engage chromatin inside hubs indicating that hubs contain a unique nucleosomal scaffold compared to global chromatin. Dual color imaging of PBAF in hubs near H3.3 or HP1 reveals that PBAF targets both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions with distinct genome binding kinetics that mimic chromatin stability. Removal of PBAFs bromodomains stabilizes H3.3 and HP1 binding within chromatin indicating that bromodomains may play a direct role in remodeling of the nucleosome. Our data, suggests that PBAF differentially and dynamically engages a variety of chromatin structures involved in both activation and repression of transcription via bromodomains. Furthermore, PBAFs binding stability on chromatin may reflect the chromatin remodeling potential of different bound chromatin states.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTranscriptional bursting involves a gene rapidly switching between transcriptionally active and inactive states. To regulate transcriptional bursting, chromatin must interchange between euchromatin and heterochromatin to permit or restrict access of transcription factors including RNA Polymerase II to enhancer and gene promoters. However, little is known regarding how chromatin remodelers dynamically read a rapidly changing 4D epigenome. We used live-cell single molecule imaging to characterize the spatiotemporal chromatin binding dynamics of PBAF, a chromatin remodeler that accesses both euchromatin and heterochromatin to regulate transcription. PBAF cycles on and off chromatin hubs in select nuclear regions where it distinctly engages euchromatin and heterochromatin via bromodomains in its BAF180 subunit. Our study provides the framework to understand how the 4D epigenome is regulated.",

    "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae infection of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) is a major cause of disease-induced wilting in soil-grown strawberries across the world. To understand what components of the pathogen are affecting disease expression, the presence of the known effector VdAve1 was screened in a sample of Verticillium dahliae isolates. Isolates from strawberry were found to contain VdAve1 and were divided into two major clades, based upon their vegetative compatibility groups (VCG); no UK strawberry isolates contained VdAve1. VC clade was strongly related to their virulence levels. VdAve1-containing isolates pathogenic on strawberry were found in both clades, in contrast to some recently published findings.\\n\\nOn strawberry, VdAve1-containing isolates had significantly higher virulence during early infection, which diminished in significance as the infection progressed. Transformation of a virulent non-VdAve1 containing isolate, with VdAve1 was found neither to increase nor decrease virulence when inoculated on a susceptible strawberry cultivar. There are therefore virulence factors that are epistatic to VdAve1 and potentially multiple independent routes to high virulence on strawberry in V. dahliae lineages.\\n\\nGenome sequencing a subset of isolates across the two VCGs revealed that isolates were differentiated at the whole genome level and contained multiple changes in putative effector content, indicating that different clonal VCGs may have evolved different strategies for infecting strawberry, leading to different virulence levels in pathogenicity tests. It is therefore important to consider both clonal lineage and effector complement as the adaptive potential of each lineage will differ, even if they contain the same race determining effector.",

Here, we report that somatic piRNAs were likely present in the ancestral arthropod more than 500 million years ago. Analysis of 20 species across the arthropod phylum suggests that somatic piRNAs targeting TEs and mRNAs are common among arthropods. The presence of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in chelicerates (horseshoe crabs, spiders, scorpions) suggests that arthropods originally used a plant-like RNA interference mechanism to silence TEs. Our results call into question the view that the ancestral role of the piRNA pathway was to protect the germline and demonstrate that small RNA silencing pathways have been repurposed for both somatic and germline functions throughout arthropod evolution.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to FAIR guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet lab procedures to computational methods.

This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the BioCompute framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses.

    "abstract": "RNA-seq is a reference technology for determining alternative splicing at genome-wide level. Exon arrays remain widely used for the analysis of gene expression, but show poor validation rate with regard to splicing events. Commercial arrays that include probes within exon junctions have been developed in order to overcome this problem.\\n\\nWe compare the performance of RNA-seq (Illumina HiSeq) and junction arrays (Affymetrix Human Transcriptome array) for the analysis of transcript splicing events. Three different breast cancer cell lines were treated with CX-4945, a drug that severely affects splicing. To enable a direct comparison of the two platforms, we adapted EventPointer, an algorithm that detects and labels alternative splicing events using junction arrays, to work also on RNA-seq data. Common results and discrepancies between the technologies were validated and/or resolved by over 200 PCR experiments.\\n\\nAs might be expected, RNA-seq appears superior in cases where the technologies disagree, and is able to discover novel splicing events beyond the limitations of physical probe-sets. We observe a high degree of coherence between the two technologies, however, with correlation of EventPointer results over 0.90. Through decimation, the detection power of the junction arrays is equivalent to RNA-seq with up to 60 million reads. Our results suggest, therefore, that exon-junction arrays are a viable alternative to RNA-seq for detection of alternative splicing events when focusing on well-described transcriptional regions.",

    "abstract": "Mannheimia haemolytica serotype A2 is a common commensal species present in the nasopharynx of healthy cattle. However, prior to the onset of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis, there is sudden increase in M. haemolytica serotype A1 within the upper respiratory tract. The events during this selective proliferation of serotype A1 strains are poorly characterised. In this investigation, a differentiated bovine airway epithelial cell culture was used to study the interactions of A1 and A2 bovine isolates with the respiratory epithelium. This model reproduced the key defences of the airway epithelium, including tight junctions and mucociliary clearance. Although initial adherence of the serotype A1 strains was low, by 12 hours post-infection the bacteria was able to traverse the tight junctions to form foci of infection below the apical surface. The size, density and number of these foci increased with time, as did the cytopathic effects observed in the bovine bronchial epithelial cells. Penetration of M. haemolytica A1 into the sub-apical epithelium was shown to be through transcytosis but not paracytosis. Commensal A2 bovine isolates however were not capable of colonising the model to a high degree, and did not penetrate the epithelium following initial adherence at the apical surface. This difference in their ability to colonise the respiratory epithelium may account for the sudden proliferation of serotype A1 in the onset of pneumonia pasteurellosis. The pathogenesis observed was replicated by virulent A2 ovine isolates; however colonisation was 10-fold lower in comparison to bovine A1 strains. This investigation provides new insight into the interactions of M. haemolytica with bovine airway epithelial cells which are occurring in vivo during pneumonia pasteurellosis.",

    "abstract": "As predicted by the notion that sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by entrapment of sister DNAs inside cohesin rings, there is a perfect correlation between co-entrapment of circular minichromosomes and sister chromatid cohesion in a large variety of mutants. In most cells where cohesin loads onto chromosomes but fails to form cohesion, loading is accompanied by entrapment of individual DNAs. However, cohesin with a hinge domain whose positively charged lumen has been neutralized not only loads onto and translocates along chromatin but also organizes it into chromatid-like threads, despite largely failing to entrap DNAs inside its ring. Thus, cohesin engages chromatin in a non-topological as well as a topological manner. Our finding that hinge mutations, but not fusions between Smc and kleisin subunits, abolish entrapment suggests that DNAs may enter cohesin rings through hinge opening. Lastly, mutation of three highly conserved lysine residues inside the Smc1 moiety of Smc1/3 hinges abolishes all loading without affecting cohesins initial recruitment to CEN loading sites or its ability to hydrolyze ATP. We suggest that loading and translocation are mediated by conformational changes in cohesins hinge driven by cycles of ATP hydrolysis.",

There was no significant interaction between subtypes and diagnostic groups. Finally, analysis of FC patterns with behavioural measures of IQ, social responsiveness and ASD severity showed unique brain-behaviour relations in each subtype, and a continuum of brain-behavior relations from ASD to controls within one subtype.

Most often the causative pathogen is the common gut microbe Escherichia coli. One such E. coli, strain D3, caused a bladder infection in a male adult, and was resistant to multiple antibiotics. We sequenced and assembled the genome of D3, and present it along with a comparative analysis against other pathogenic and nonpathogenic E. Coli strains.\\n\\nResultsBy comparing the predicted proteins of D3 with those from 5 uropathogenic and 7 nonpathogenic E. Coli strains, we generated a list of 38 genes present in most (4-5) pathogenic strains, but absent in all nonpathogenic strains. Among these were 9 proteins of the Pap fimbrial operon, which has previously been associated with cell adherence and the formation of biofilms. Lastly, we analyzed the list of predicted genes uniquely present in D3 compared to all other strains, and identified multiple transposable elements.\\n\\nConclusionsThe presence of fimbria in most pathogenic E. coli strains, and their absence in nonpathogenic ones, suggests that they play a role in pathogenicity, a notion supported by previous work. We also found that D3-specific genes are strongly enriched with transposases, recombinases, and integrase, suggesting that these mobile elements have been inserted or expanded in D3, relative to other strains in the study.",

    "abstract": "The human zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 is an integral membrane protein critical for the final step in the biogenesis of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A, encoded by LMNA. After farnesylation and carboxyl methylation of its C-terminal CAAX motif, the lamin A precursor, prelamin A, undergoes proteolytic removal of its modified C-terminal 15 amino acids by ZMPSTE24. Mutations in LMNA or ZMPSTE24 that impede this prelamin A cleavage step cause the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and the related progeroid disorders mandibuloacral dysplasia-type B (MAD-B) and restrictive dermopathy (RD). Here we report a \\\"humanized yeast\\\" system to assay ZMPSTE24-dependent cleavage of prelamin A and examine the eight known disease-associated ZMPSTE24 missense mutations. All show diminished prelamin A processing and fall into three classes, with defects in activity, protein stability, or both. Notably, some ZMPSTE24 mutants can be rescued by deleting the E3 ubiquitin ligase Doa10, involved in ER-associated degradation of misfolded membrane proteins, or by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, which may have important therapeutic implications for some patients. We also show that ZMPSTE24-mediated prelamin A cleavage can be uncoupled from the recently discovered role of ZMPSTE24 in clearance of ER membrane translocon-clogged substrates. Together with the crystal structure of ZMPSTE24, this \\\"humanized yeast system\\\" can guide structure-function studies to uncover mechanisms of prelamin A cleavage, translocon unclogging, and membrane protein folding and stability.",

This extrapolation occurs when models of helping behavior are applied to explain aggregation or fusion, and when models of discriminatory helping behavior are applied to explain discriminatory segregation or discriminatory rejection. Here, I outline an alternative theoretical approach that explicitly distinguishes a social action as a helping or harming behavior, and an association as the context for a social action. Based on this distinction, I define a list of terms that allows a classification of association phenomena and the conceptual framework necessary to explain their evolution. I apply the resulting theory, which I call \\\"association theory,\\\" to identify a series of steps common to major and minor transitions in social evolution. These steps include the evolution of association, the evolution of differential treatment, the evolution of association preference, and the evolution of genetic kin recognition. I explain how to measure the parameters of association theory and I apply the theory to test Hamiltons rule. I evaluate the evidence for association theory, including how it resolves anomalies of a former paradigm. Finally, I discuss association theorys assumptions, and I explain why it may become the dominant framework for analyzing social evolution.",

    "abstract": "Wetland ecosystems are important reservoirs of biodiversity and significantly contribute to emissions of the greenhouse gases CO2, NO2 and CH4. High anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs from agriculture and fossil fuel combustion have been recognized as a severe threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning such as control of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore it is important to understand how increased N input into pristine wetlands affects the composition and activity of micro-organisms, especially in interaction with dominant wetland plants. In a series of incubations analyzed over 90 days, we disentangle the effects of N fertilization on the microbial community in bulk soil and the rhizosphere of Juncus acutiflorus, a common and abundant graminoid wetland plant. We observed an increase in greenhouse gas emissions when N is increased in incubations with J. acutiflorus, changing the system from a greenhouse gas sink to a source. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomics, we determined that the bacterial orders Opitutales, Subgroup-6 Acidobacteria and Sphingobacteriales significantly responded to high N availability and we hypothesize that these groups are contributing to the increased greenhouse gas emissions. These results indicated that increased N input leads to shifts in microbial activity within the rhizosphere, severely altering N cycling dynamics. Our study provides a framework for connecting environmental conditions of wetland bulk and rhizosphere soil to the structure and metabolic output of microbial communities.",

Secretion of coumarins by Arabidopsis thaliana roots is induced under Fe-deficiency. An essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of major Arabidopsis coumarins, scopoletin and its derivatives, is Feruloyl-CoA 6-Hydroxylase1 (F6'H1) that belongs to a large enzyme family of the 2-oxoglutarate and Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases. Another member of this family that is a close homologue of F6H1 and is encoded by a strongly Fe-responsive gene, At3g12900, is functionally characterized in the presented work. We purified the At3g12900 protein heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and demonstrated that it is involved in the conversion of scopoletin into fraxetin via hydroxylation at the C8-position. Consequently, it was named scopoletin 8-hydroxylase (S8H). Its function in plant cells was confirmed by the transient expression of S8H protein in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves followed by the metabolite profiling and the biochemical and ionomic characterization of Arabidopsis s8h knockout lines grown under various regimes of Fe availability. Our results indicate that S8H is involved in coumarin biosynthesis as part of the Fe acquisition machinery.",

    "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian cancer exhibits extensive intratumoral heterogeneity coupled with widespread intraperitoneal disease. Despite this, metastatic spread of tumor clones is non-random, implying the existence of local microenvironmental factors that shape tumor progression. We interrogated the molecular interface between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and cancer cells in 143 samples from 21 patients using whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression profiling, and T- and B-cell receptor sequencing. We identify 3 immunologic response categories, which frequently co-exist within individual patients. Furthermore, epithelial CD8+ TIL were inversely associated with malignant cell diversity, evidenced by subclonal neoepitope elimination and spatial tracking between tumor and T-cell clones. Intersecting mutational signatures and immune analysis showed that foldback inversion genomic aberrations lead to worse outcomes even in the presence of cytotoxic TIL (n=433). Thus, regional variation in immune contexture mirrors the pattern of intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new perspectives for treatment of this challenging disease.",

    "abstract": "The Pseudomonas fluorescens genome encodes for 50+ proteins involved in -di-GMP signaling. Here, we demonstrate that when tested across 188 nutrients, these enzymes and effectors appear capable of impacting biofilm formation. Transcriptional analysis of network members across [~]50 nutrient conditions indicates that altered gene expression can explain a subset, but not all, of biofilm-formation responses to the nutrients. Additional organization of the network is likely achieved through physical interaction, as determined via probing [~]2000 interactions by bacterial two-hybrid assays. Our analysis revealed a multimodal regulatory strategy, using combinations of ligand-mediated signals, protein-protein interaction and/or transcriptional regulation to further fine-tune c-di-GMP-mediated responses.

Thus, a major open question in the field is how signalling specificity is conferred in this context with a soluble signalling molecule. Here, we take a systems approach, using mutational analysis, transcriptional studies and bacterial two-hybrid analysis to interrogate this network. We find that the network typically combines two or more modes of regulation (i.e., transcriptional control with protein-protein interaction) to generate an observed output.",

    "abstract": "The WNT signaling pathway regulates patterning and morphogenesis during embryonic development and promotes tissue renewal and regeneration in adults. Some WNT responses in vertebrates depend on a second signal provided by the R-spondin family of four secreted proteins (RSPO1-4) that drive the renewal of stem cells in many tissues. RSPOs markedly amplify target cell sensitivity to WNT ligands by neutralizing two transmembrane E3 ligases, ZNRF3 and RNF43, which reduce cell-surface levels of WNT receptors. Chromosomal translocations that increase RSPO expression or that inactivate ZNRF3/RNF43 can drive human cancers. RSPOs contain tandem furin-like repeats (FU1 and FU2), a thrombospondin type I (TSP) domain, and a basic region (BR). RSPOs simultaneously engage ZNRF3/RNF43 through their FU1 domain and one of three leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors (LGR4-6) through their FU2 domain, triggering the clearance of ZNRF3/RNF43 and the consequent rise in WNT receptor levels. LGRs are selectively expressed in various tissue stem cells and are considered the primary high-affinity receptors for RSPOs. Using purified mutant and chimeric RSPOs and cell lines lacking various receptors, we show that RSPO2 and RSPO3, but not RSPO1 and RSPO4, can potentiate WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling in the absence of all three LGRs. The ZNRF3/RNF43-interacting FU1 domain was necessary for LGR-independent signaling, while the LGR-interacting FU2 domain was dispensable. The FU1 domain of RSPO3 was also sufficient to confer LGR-independence when transplanted to RSPO1, demonstrating that its interaction with ZNRF3/RNF43 dictates LGR-independent signaling. The enigmatic TSP/BR domains of RSPOs and their interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), previously considered dispensable for WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling, became essential in the absence of LGRs. These results define two alternative modes of RSPO-mediated signaling that share a common dependence on ZNRF3/RNF43, but differ in their use of either LGRs or HSPGs, with implications for understanding their mechanism of action, biological functions and evolutionary origins.",

Using a xenobiotic, we find that permeability of the Drosophila \\\"blood\\\"-brain barrier (BBB) is higher at night. The permeability rhythm is driven by circadian regulation of efflux and depends upon a molecular clock in the perineurial glia of the BBB, although efflux transporters are restricted to subperineurial glia (SPG). We show that transmission of circadian signals across the layers requires gap junctions, which are expressed cyclically. Specifically, during nighttime gap junctions reduce intracellular magnesium ([Mg2+]i), a positive regulator of efflux, in SPG. Consistent with lower nighttime efflux, nighttime administration of the anti-epileptic phenytoin is more effective at treating a Drosophila seizure model. These findings identify a novel mechanism of circadian regulation and have therapeutic implications for drugs targeted to the central nervous system.",

Thus, individual differences in redox status can give rise to distinct sub-populations even among cells with identical genetic backgrounds. Here, we have created a novel methodology to track redox status at single cell resolution using the redox-sensitive probe roGFP. Our method allows identification and sorting of sub-populations with different oxidation levels in either the cytosol, mitochondria or peroxisomes. Using this approach we defined redox-dependent heterogeneity of yeast cells, and characterized growth, as well as proteomic and transcriptomic profiles of subpopulations of cells that differ in their redox status, but are similar in age. We report that, starting in late logarithmic growth, cells of the same age have a bi-modal distribution of oxidation status. A comparative proteomic analysis between these populations identified three key proteins, Hsp30, Dhh1, and Pnc1, which affect basal oxidation levels and may serve as first line of defense proteins in redox homeostasis.",

However, cooperating microbial groups can be evolutionarily unstable, since a cheating strain that does not secrete the public good can reproduce quicker and take over. Here we study the effects of fluid advection patterns on group reproduction as a mechanism to enable or enhance social behavior in microbial populations. We use a realistic advection-diffusion-reaction model to describe microbial growth and mutation in a flow environment. Social groups arise naturally from our model as self-reproducing Turing patterns that can avoid mutant takeovers at steady state. Our central finding is that flow shear enables and promotes social behavior in microbes by limiting the spread of cheating strains. Regions of the flow domain with higher shear admits high cooperativity and large population density, whereas low shear regions are devoid of life due to opportunistic mutations.",

We adapted ENCoM to simulate the dynamics of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules.\\n\\nResultsENCoM outperforms the most commonly used coarse-grained model on RNA, Anisotropic Network Model (ANM), in the prediction of b-factors, in the prediction of conformational change as measured by overlap (a measure of effective prediction of structural transitions) and in the prediction of structural variance from NMR ensembles. These benchmarks were derived from the set of all RNA structures available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and contain more total cases than previous studies applying NMA to RNA. We thus established ENCoM as an attractive tool for fast and accurate exploration of the conformational space of RNA molecules.\\n\\nAvailabilityENCoM is open source software available at https://github.com/NRGlab/ENCoM",

The latter can involve movement by blebbing or other cyclic shape changes, and both highly-simplified and more realistic models of these modes have been studied previously. Herein we study swimming that is driven by membrane tension gradients that arise from flows in the actin cortex underlying the membrane, and does not involve imposed cyclic shape changes. Such gradients can lead to a number of different characteristic cell shapes, and our first objective is to understand how different distributions of membrane tension influence the shape of cells in a quiescent fluid. We then analyze the effects of spatial variation in other membrane properties, and how they interact with tension gradients to determine the shape. We also study the effect of fluid-cell interactions and show how tension leads to cell movement, how the balance between tension gradients and a variable bending modulus determine the shape and direction of movement, and how the efficiency of movement depends on the properties of the fluid and the distribution of tension and bending modulus in the membrane.\\n\\nDedicated to the memory of Karl P.

    "abstract": "Expression levels of retinoic acid receptor gamma (NR1B3/RARG, encodes RAR{gamma}), are commonly reduced in prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore we sought to establish the cellular and gene regulatory consequences of reduced RAR{gamma} expression, and determine RAR{gamma} regulatory mechanisms. RARG shRNA approaches in non-malignant (RWPE-1 and HPr1-AR) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate models revealed that reducing RAR{gamma} levels, rather than adding exogenous retinoid ligand, had the greatest impact on prostate cell viability and gene expression. ChIP-Seq defined the RAR{gamma} cistrome which was significantly enriched at active enhancers associated with AR binding sites. Reflecting a significant genomic role for RAR{gamma} to regulate androgen signaling, RAR{gamma} knockdown in HPr1-AR cells significantly regulated the magnitude of the AR transcriptome. RAR{gamma} down-regulation was explained by increased miR-96 in PCa cell and mouse models, and TCGA PCa cohorts. Biochemical approaches confirmed that miR-96 directly regulated RAR{gamma} expression and function Capture of the miR-96 targetome by biotin-miR96 identified that RAR{gamma} and a number of RAR{gamma} interacting co-factors including TACC1 were all targeted by miR-96, and expression of these genes were prominently altered, positively and negatively, in the TCGA-PRAD cohort. Differential gene expression analyses between tumors in the TCGA-PRAD cohort with lower quartile expression levels of RARG and TACC1 and upper quartile miR-96, compared to the reverse, identified a gene network including several RAR{gamma} target genes (e.g. SOX15) that significantly associated with worse disease free survival (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.88, p=0.015). In summary, miR-96 targets a RAR{gamma} network to govern AR signaling, PCa progression and disease outcome.\\n\\nConflict of interestThe authors certify that they have NO affiliations with or involvement in any organization or entity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participation in speakers bureaus; membership, employment, consultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements), or non-financial interest (such as personal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge or beliefs) in the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript.\\n\\nFUNDINGLESC acknowledges support, in part, of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center-University of Pittsburg Cancer Institute Ovarian Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence National Institutes of Health [P50CA159981-01A1].\\n\\nMDL acknowledges support of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics NRSA T32 program [T32CA009072] held at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.\\n\\nMJC and DJS acknowledges support in part from the Prostate program of the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs [W81XWH-14-1-0608, W81XWH-11-2-0033] and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant P30CA016056 involving the use of Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centers Genomic Shared Resource.\\n\\nMJC, GL, AR, HW and PvdB acknowledges support from the European Union-United States Atlantis Program [P116J090011].\\n\\nMJC and LESC acknowledge support from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant P30CA016056 involving the use of OSUCCC The James, CCSG P30CA016058",

With a monthly time series of H3N2 incidence in the United States over 10 years, we demonstrate the feasibility of prediction ahead of season and an accurate real-time forecast for the 2016/2017 influenza season.\\n\\nSUMMARYSkillful forecasting of seasonal (H3N2) influenza incidence ahead of the season is shown to be possible by means of a transmission model that explicitly tracks evolutionary change in the virus, integrating information from both epidemiological surveillance and readily available genetic sequences.",

    "abstract": "Multivalency, the presence of multiple interfaces for intermolecular interactions, underlies many biological phenomena, including receptor clustering and cytosolic condensation. One of its ultimate purposes is to increase binding affinity, but systematic analyses of its role in complex biological assemblies have been rare. Presence of multiple copies of the microtubule-binding NDC80 complex is an evolutionary conserved but poorly characterized feature of kinetochores, the points of attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules. To address its significance, we engineered modules allowing incremental addition of NDC80 complexes. The modules residence time on microtubules increased exponentially with the number of NDC80 complexes. While modules containing a single NDC80 complex were unable to track depolymerizing microtubules, modules with two or more complexes tracked depolymerizing microtubules and stiffened the connection with microtubules under force. Cargo-conjugated modules of divalent or trivalent NDC80 stalled and rescued microtubule depolymerization in a force-dependent manner. Thus, multivalent microtubule binding through NDC80 clustering is crucial for force-induced modulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments.",

    "abstract": "Computational modeling of the genome-wide metabolic network is essential for designing new therapeutics targeting cancer-associated metabolic disorder, which is a hallmark of human malignancies. However, previous studies generally assumed that metabolic fluxes of cancer cells are subjected to the maximization of biomass production, despite the wide existence of trade-offs among multiple metabolic objectives. To address this issue, we developed a multi-objective model of cancer metabolism with algorithms depicting approximate Pareto surfaces and incorporating multiple omics datasets. To validate this approach, we built individualized models for NCI-60 cancer cell lines, and accurately predicted cell growth rates and other biological consequences of metabolic perturbations in these cells. By analyzing the landscape of approximate Pareto surface, we identified a list of metabolic targets essential for cancer cell proliferation and the Warburg effect, and further demonstrated their close association with cancer patient survival. Finally, metabolic targets predicted to be essential for tumor progression were validated by cell-based experiments, confirming this multi-objective modelling method as a novel and effective strategy to identify cancer-associated metabolic vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Musical rhythm, in all its cross-cultural diversity, exhibits several commonalities across world cultures. Traditionally, music research has been split in two fields. Some scientists focused on musicality, namely the human biocognitive predispositions for music, with an emphasis on cross-cultural similarities. Other scholars investigated music, seen as cultural product, focusing on the large variation in world musical cultures. Recent experiments found deep connections between music and musicality, reconciling these opposing views. Here we address the question of how individual cognitive biases affect the process of cultural evolution of music. Data from two experiments is analyzed using two different, complementary techniques. In the experiments, participants hear drumming patterns and imitate them. These patterns are then given to the same or another participant to imitate. The structure of these - initially random - patterns is tracked down to later experimental  generations. Frequentist statistics show how participants biases are amplified by cultural transmission, making drumming patterns more structured. Structure is achieved faster than in transmission within, rather than between, participants. A Bayesian model approximates the motif structures participants learned and created. Overall, our data and model show that individual biases for musicality play a central role in shaping cultural transmission of musical rhythm.",

Consequently, we investigated whether mens (N=59) scores on the Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale were related to either within-subject changes or between-subject differences in mens testosterone levels. Mens responses on the Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale did not appear to track within-subject changes in testosterone. By contrast with one recent study, mens Intrasexual Competitiveness Scale also did not appear to be related to between-individual differences in testosterone.

To investigate how these different sorts of memories are created, we developed a new behavioral task in rodents. The task consists of three distinct conditions (stable, overlapping, random). Rodents are exposed to multiple sample trials, in which they explore objects in specific spatial arrangements. In the stable condition, the locations are constant during all sample trials; in the test trial, one objects location is changed. In the random condition, object locations are presented in the sample phase without a specific spatial pattern. In the overlapping condition, one location is shared (overlapping) between all trials while the other location changes during sample trials. We show that in the overlapping condition, instead of only remembering the last sample trial, rodents form a cumulative memory of the sample trials.\\n\\nHere we could show that both mice and rats can accumulate information across multiple trials and express a long-term abstracted memory.",

Here, we report responses to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in four patients and characterize the immune landscape of SCCOHT tumors using quantitative immunofluorescence and gene expression profiling. Unexpectedly for a low mutation burden cancer, the majority of the tumors demonstrated PD-L1 expression with strong associated T cell infiltration. PD-L1 expression was detected in both tumor and stromal cells, with macrophages being the most abundant PD-L1 positive cells in some tumors. Transcriptional profiling revealed increased expression of genes related to Th1 and cytotoxic cell function in PD-L1 high tumors, suggesting that PD-L1 acts as a pathway of adaptive immune resistance in SCCOHT. These findings suggest that although SCCOHT are low-mutational-burden tumors, their immunogenic microenvironment that resembles the landscape of tumors that respond well to treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",

    "abstract": "InvadopodiInvadopodia are membrane protrusions dynamically assembled by invasive cancer cells in contact with extracellular matrix (ECM). Invadopodia are enriched for the structural proteins actin and cortactin, as well as metalloproteases such as MT1-MMP, whose function is to degrade the surrounding ECM. During metastasis, invadopodia are necessary for cancer cell intravasation and extravasation. While signaling pathways involved in the assembly and function of invadopodia are well studied, few studies address invadopodia dynamics and how the cell-ECM interactions contribute to cell invasion. Using iterative analysis based on time-lapse microscopy and mathematical modeling of invasive cancer cells, we found that cells oscillate between invadopodia presence and cell stasis, termed Invadopodia state and invadopodia absence during cell translocation, termed Migration state. Our data suggests that {beta}1-integrin-ECM binding and ECM cross-linking control the duration of each of the two states. By changing the concentration of cross-linkers in 2D and 3D cultures, we generate ECM where 0-0.92 of total lysine residues are cross-linked. Using ECM with a range of cross-linking degrees we demonstrate that the dynamics of invadopodia-related functions have a biphasic relationship to ECM cross-linking. At intermediate levels of ECM cross-linking (0.39), cells exhibit rapid invadopodia protrusion-retraction cycles and rapid calcium spikes, which lead to more frequent MT1-MMP delivery, causing maximal invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation. In contrast, both extremely high or low levels of cross-linking lead to slower invadopodia-related dynamics and lower ECM degradation. Additionally, {beta}1-integrin inhibition modifies dynamics of invadopodia-related functions, as well as the length of time cells spend in either of the states. Collectively, these data suggest that {beta}1-integrin-ECM binding non-linearly translates small physical differences in extracellular environment to differences in the dynamics of cancer cell behaviors. Understanding conditions under which invadopodia can be reduced by subtle environment-targeting treatments may lead to combination therapies for preventing metastatic spread.",

    "abstract": "Species declines and losses of biota are often associated with shifting baselines in perceived historical abundances, and/or neglect or abandonment of recovery actions aimed at ecological restoration. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in the geographical distribution of the species, with associated negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we show using citizen science and other data that after 50-60 years of near total absence, the iconic top predator and highly migratory species bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, returned by the hundreds if not thousands in waters near Denmark, Norway and Sweden during August-October 2015-2017. The re-utilisation of this former habitat is part of a geographically more widespread expansion of the summer foraging area to the northern part of the northeast Atlantic Ocean, encompassing waters from east Greenland to west Sweden. The remarkable return to the Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea has been facilitated by improved fishery management for bluefin tuna and its prey. Bluefin tuna biomass in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean has been increasing since a recovery plan was implemented in the late 2000s, and biomasses of two key prey species (herring, Clupea harengus; mackerel, Scomber scombrus) recovered during the late 1980s-1990s. The reappearance of bluefin tuna in the Skagerrak-Kattegat and other waters of northern Europe, despite a recent history of mismanagement and illegal fishing in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean which led to a critical population decline, offers hope that other marine ecological recoveries are possible under improved management of fisheries and ecosystems.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryImproved management promotes the return of an ocean icon to northern Europe.\n\nSignificance StatementCommercial fisheries are often perceived being in a state of decline and collapse, putting food and economic security at risk. Such declines are frequently accompanied by contractions in stock distribution, negative ecological impacts and diminishing socio-economic benefits. Here we present an example based on one of the worlds most valuable and iconic fish species, bluefin tuna, which demonstrates that effective management of both bluefin tuna and its prey has been a key factor leading to a remarkable reoccupation of formerly lost habitat. This reappearance, following decades of absence, occurred despite the bluefin tuna stock having had a recent, long history of unsustainable and illegal exploitation. Marine ecological recovery actions can be successful, even in situations which may initially appear intractable.",

    "abstract": "Economic experiments have shown that punishment can increase public goods game contributions over time. However, the effectiveness of punishment is challenged by second-order freeriding and antisocial punishment. The latter implies that non-cooperators punish cooperators, while the former implies unwillingness to shoulder the cost of punishment. Here we extend the theory of cooperation in the spatial public goods game by considering four competing strategies, which are traditional cooperators and defectors, as well as cooperators who punish defectors and defectors who punish cooperators. We show that if the synergistic effects are high enough to sustain cooperation based on network reciprocity alone, antisocial punishment does not deter public cooperation. Conversely, if synergistic effects are low and punishment is actively needed to sustain cooperation, antisocial punishment does act detrimental, but only if the cost-to-fine ratio is low. If the costs are relatively high, cooperation again dominates as a result of spatial pattern formation. Counterintuitively, defectors who do not punish cooperators, and are thus effectively second-order freeriding on antisocial punishment, form an active layer around punishing cooperators, which protects them against defectors that punish cooperators. A stable three-strategy phase that is sustained by the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance is also possible via the same route. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported evolutionary outcomes can be explained by the comparison of invasion rates that determine the stability of subsystem solutions. Our results reveal an unlikely evolutionary escape from adverse effects of antisocial punishment, and they provide a rationale for why second-order freeriding is not always an impediment to the evolutionary stability of punishment.",

However, the mechanistic basis underlying inter-individual differences remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, we performed a large-scale genome wide analysis of HR-increase and HR-recovery in 58,818 individuals. A total of 25 significant independent SNPs in 23 loci (P<8.3x10-9) were associated with HR-increase or HR-recovery, and 36 candidate causal genes were prioritized that were enriched for pathways related to neuron biology. There was no evidence of a causal relationship with mortality or cardiovascular diseases, however, a nominal association with parental lifespan was observed (5.5x10-4) that requires further study. In conclusion, our findings provide new biological and clinical insight into the mechanistic under-pinning of HR response to exercise, underscoring the role of the autonomous nervous system in HR-recovery.\\n\\nABBREVIATIONS",

In this study, 30 InDel loci were explored to reveal the genetic diversities and genetic relationships between Chinese Xinjiang Hui group and the 24 previously studied populations using varies methods such as forensic statistical parameter analysis, phylogenetic reconstruction, STRUCTURE analysis, multi-dimensional scaling, and principal component analysis. The observed heterozygosity and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.1971 (HLD118) to 0.5092 (HLD 92), 0.2222 (HLD 114) to 0.5000 (HLD 6), respectively. Besides, after Bonferroni correction, no deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests were found at all 30 loci in Xinjiang Hui group. The cumulative probability of exclusion and combined discrimination power were 0.988849 and 0.99999999999378, respectively, which indicated that the 30 loci could be used as complementary genetic markers for paternity test and be qualified for personal identification in forensic cases. In this study, we found that Xinjiang Hui group had close relationships with most Chinese groups, especially Han populations, and all the results based on different genetic methods we used had a strong support for this finding. The 30 InDel loci has important significance in forensic identification research, in spite of this, for a better understanding of genetic background of the Chinese Xinjiang Hui group, molecular genetic genotyping at various genetic markers is necessary in future studies.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe report here, a promising Individual identification and population differentiation maker which could be used in forensic cases.",

This enzyme is therefore ideal to target with enzymatic inhibitors that could overcome resistance to aminoglycosides. The search for inhibitors was carried out using mixture-based combinatorial libraries, the scaffold ranking approach, and the positional scanning strategy. A library with high inhibitory activity had pyrrolidine pentamine scaffold and was selected for further analysis.

    "abstract": "Pillar-based passive microfluidic devices combine the advantages of simple designs, low device footprint, and high selectivity for size-based separation of blood cells. Most of these device designs have been validated with dilute blood samples. Handling whole blood in pillar-based devices is extremely challenging due to clogging. The high proportion of cells (particularly red blood cells) in blood, the varying sizes and stiffness of the different blood cells, and the tendency of the cells to aggregate lead to clogging of the pillars within a short period. We recently reported a radial pillar device (RAPID) design for contin-uous and high throughput separation of multi-sized rigid polystyrene particles in a single experiment. In this manuscript, we have given detailed guidelines to modify the design of RAPID for any application with deformable objects (e.g. cells). We have adapted RAPID to work with blood samples directly without any pre-processing steps. We were successful in operating the device with whole blood for almost 6 hours, which is difficult to achieve with most pillar-based devices. Finally, we demonstrated up to ~ 60-fold enrichment of platelets as an illustration of the improved device design. Whole blood pillar-based platelet clog-free RAPID",

    "abstract": "Changes in the control of the lower extremities post-stroke lead to persistent biomechanical asymmetries during walking. These asymmetries are associated with an increase in energetic cost, leading to the possibility that reduction of asymmetry can improve economy. However, the influence of asymmetry on economy may depend on the direction and cause of asymmetry. For example, impairments with paretic limb advancement may result in shorter paretic steps while deficits in paretic support or propulsion result in shorter non-paretic steps. Given differences in the underlying impairments responsible for each type of step length asymmetry, the capacity to reduce asymmetry, and the associated changes in energetic cost may not be consistent across this population. Here, we identified factors explaining individual differences in the capacity to voluntarily reduce step length asymmetry and modify energetic cost during walking. Twenty-four individuals post-stroke walked on a treadmill with visual feedback of their step lengths to aid explicit modification of asymmetry. We found that individuals who naturally took longer paretic steps had a greater capacity to reduce asymmetry, and were better able to transfer the effects of training to over-ground walking. In addition, baseline energetic cost was negatively correlated with reductions in cost, such that participants with a more economical gait were more likely to reduce energetic cost by improving symmetry. These results demonstrate that many stroke survivors retain the capacity to voluntarily walk more symmetrically on a treadmill and over-ground. However, whether reductions in asymmetry reduce metabolic cost depends on individual differences in impairments affecting locomotor function.",

    "abstract": "(Introduction) Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is characterized by an impairment of urine acidification and can be caused by variations in genes functioning in -intercalated cells such as anion exchanger 1 (AE1). AE1 encodes the Cl-/HCO3- exchanger in erythrocytes (eAE1) and -intercalated cells (kAE1). We previously reported that in human erythroid intron 3 containing the promoter region of human kAE1, a SNP (rs999716) 39 base pairs downstream of the TATA box showed a higher minor allele A frequency in incomplete dRTA patients and such a promoter region showed reduced activities, leading to the hypothesis that those with the A allele may express less kAE1, developing incomplete dRTA. Here, single nucleotide variations were introduced downstream of the TATA box in the murine erythroid intron 3 to investigate changes in the promoter activity for murine kAE1 mRNA. (Methods) The erythroid intron 3 of C57BL/6 was subcloned into the pGL4.17 reporter vector, leading to mu kAE1Pro-pGL4.17. Three types of G to A substitutions were introduced 33, 35, and 36 base pairs downstream of the TATA box in the murine kAE1 promoter region by inverse PCR (Var1, Var2, and Var3, respectively). The HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors. After 24 hours, the firefly luciferase activity was determined. (Results and Discussion) The promoter activity of Var1, as well as that of Var2 to a lesser extent, was reduced compared with that of the wild-type. The introduction of variations such as Var1 and Var2 into the murine genome by genome editing may help to establish mouse models of incomplete dRTA.",

    "abstract": "Francisella tularensis subspecies holarctica is found throughout the northern hemisphere and causes the disease tularemia in humans and animals. An aquatic cycle has been described for this subspecies, which has caused water-borne outbreaks of tularemia in at least 10 countries. In this study, we sought to identify mechanosensitive channel(s) required for the bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to freshwater, which is likely essential for transmission of the bacterium between susceptible hosts. A single mechanosensitive channel MscS (FTL_1753), among the smallest members of the mechanosensitive channel superfamily, was found to protect subsp. holarctia from hypoosmotic shock. Deletion of this channel did not affect virulence within the mammalian host, however mscS was required to survive the transition from the host niche to fresh water. Deletion of mscS did not alter the sensitivity of F. tularensis subspecies holarctica to detergents, H2O2, or antibiotics, suggesting that the role of MscS is specific to protection from hypoosmotic shock. Interestingly, deletion of mscS also led to reduced average cell size without altering gross cell morphology. The small mechanosensitive channel identified and characterized in this study likely contributes to the transmission of tularemia between hosts by allowing the bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to fresh water.",

    "abstract": "Individual cells of the bacterium Proteus mirabilis can elongate up to 40-fold on surfaces before engaging in a cooperative surface-based motility termed swarming. How cells regulate this dramatic morphological remodeling remains an open question. In this paper, we move forward the understanding of this regulation by demonstrating that P. mirabilis requires the gene rffG for swarmer cell elongation and subsequent swarm motility. The rffG gene encodes a protein homologous to the dTDP-glucose 4,6 dehydratase protein of Escherichia coli, which contributes to Enterobacterial Common Antigen biosynthesis. Here we characterize the rffG gene in P. mirabilis, demonstrating that it is required for the production of large lipopolysaccharide-linked moieties necessary for wild-type cell envelope integrity. We show that absence of the rffG gene induces several stress-responsive pathways including those controlled by the transcriptional regulators RpoS, CaiF, and RcsB. We further show that in rffG-deficient cells, suppression of the Rcs phosphorelay, via loss of RcsB, is sufficient to induce cell elongation and swarm motility. However, loss of RcsB does not rescue cell envelope integrity defects and instead results in abnormally shaped cells, including cells producing more than two poles. We conclude that a RcsB-mediated response acts to suppress emergence of shape defects in cell envelope-compromised cells, suggesting an additional role for RcsB in maintaining cell morphology under stress conditions. We further propose that the composition of the cell envelope acts as a checkpoint before cells initiate swarmer cell elongation and motility.\\n\\nImportance statementP. mirabilis swarm motility has been implicated in pathogenesis. We have found that cells deploy multiple uncharacterized strategies to handle cell envelope stress beyond the Rcs phosphorelay when attempting to engage in swarm motility. While RcsB is known to directly inhibit the master transcriptional regulator for swarming, we have shown an additional role for RcsB in protecting cell morphology. These data support a growing appreciation that the Rcs phosphorelay is a multi-functional regulator of cell morphology in addition to its role in microbial stress responses. These data also strengthen the paradigm that outer membrane composition is a crucial checkpoint for modulating entry into swarm motility. Furthermore, the rffG-dependent moieties provide a novel, attractive target for potential antimicrobials.",

    "abstract": "Brain networks related to human learning can interact in cooperative but also competitive ways to optimize performance. The investigation of such interactive processes is rare in research on learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that manipulations reducing the engagement of prefrontal cortical areas could lead to improved statistical learning performance. However, no study has investigated how disruption of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) affects the acquisition and consolidation of non-adjacent second-order dependencies. The present study aimed to test the role of the DLPFC, more specifically, the Brodmann 9 area in implicit temporal statistical learning of non-adjacent dependencies. We applied 1 Hz inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation or sham stimulation over both the left and right DLPFC intermittently during the learning. The DLPFC-stimulated group showed better performance compared to the sham group after a 24-hour consolidation period. This finding suggests that the disruption of DLPFC during learning induces qualitative changes in the consolidation of non-adjacent statistical regularities. A possible mechanism behind this result is that the stimulation of the DLPFC promotes a shift to model-free learning by weakening the access to model-based processes.",

These subcortical structures interact indirectly through their respective loops with thalamo-cortical and brainstem networks, and directly via subcortical pathways, but the role of their interaction during sensorimotor learning remains undetermined. While songbirds and their song-dedicated basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry offer a unique opportunity to study subcortical circuits involved in vocal learning, the cerebellar contribution to avian song learning remains unknown. We demonstrate that the cerebellum provides a strong input to the song-related basal ganglia nucleus in zebra finches. Cerebellar signals are transmitted to the basal ganglia via a disynaptic connection through the thalamus and then conveyed to their cortical target and to the premotor nucleus controlling song production. Finally, cerebellar lesions impair juvenile song learning, opening new opportunities to investigate how subcortical interactions between the cerebellum and basal ganglia contribute to sensorimotor learning.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) impairs metacognitive awareness in visual perception (Rounis et al., 2010). Bor et al. (2017) recently attempted to replicate this result. However, the authors modified the experimental design of the original study considerably, meaning that this was not strictly a replication. In some cases, the changes are a priori expected to lower the chance of obtaining positive findings. Despite these changes, the researchers in fact still found an effect similar to Rounis et al.s, but they claimed that it was necessary to adopt certain criteria to discard {bsim}30% of their subjects, after which a null result was reported. Using computer simulations, we evaluated whether the subject exclusion criteria Bor et al. adopted was appropriate or beneficial. We found that, contrary to their intended purpose, excluding subjects by their criteria does not actually reduce false positive rates. Taking into account both their positive result (without subject exclusion) and negative result (after exclusion) in a Bayesian framework, we further found that their results suggest a 75% or greater likelihood that TMS to DLPFC does in fact impair metacognition, directly contradicting their claim of replication failure. That lesion and chemical inactivation studies are known to demonstrate positive effects in similar paradigms further suggests that Bor et al.s alleged negative finding cannot be taken as evidence against the role of the prefrontal cortex in conscious perception in general.",

Atomistic simulations of these structures demonstrated that bound ATP stabilizes the dimer by  tensing each protomer, while ADP and apo configurations  relax the complex by increasing global flexibility. Dynamic residue network analysis revealed regions of the protein involved in intra-protein communication, and identified several overlapping key communication hubs that correlate with known functional sites. Perturbation response scanning analysis identified several potential residue sites capable of modulating conformational change in favour of interstate conversion. For the ATP-bound open conformation, these sites were found to overlap with known Aha1 and client binding sites, demonstrating how naturally occurring forces associated with co-factor binding could allosterically modulate conformational dynamics.",
