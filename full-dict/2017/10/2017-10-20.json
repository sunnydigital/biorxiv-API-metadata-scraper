    "abstract": "The ever-increasing number of biomedical data sets provides tremendous opportunities for re-use but current data repositories provide limited means of exploration apart from text-based search. Ontological metadata annotations provide context by semantically relating data sets. Visualizing this rich network of relationships can improve the explorability of large data repositories and help researchers find data sets of interest. We developed SATORI--an integrative search and visual exploration interface for the exploration of biomedical data repositories. The design is informed by a requirements analysis through a series of semi-structured interviews. We evaluated the implementation of SATORI in a field study on a real-world data collection.SATORI enables researchers to seamlessly search, browse, and semantically query data repositories via two visualizations that are highly interconnected with a powerful search interface. SATORI is an open-source web application,which is freely available at http://satori.refinery-platform.org and integrated into the Refinery Platform.",

    "abstract": "In the cerebral cortex, sensory information travels along feedforward connections through a hierarchy of areas, which, in turn, send a denser network of feedback connections to lower-order areas. Feedback has been implicated in attention, expectation, and sensory context, but the cellular mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Using specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections in the primate visual cortex, we have identified the cellular mechanisms of feedback-mediated modulations of early sensory processing. Specifically, we found that feedback modulates receptive field size, surround suppression and response gain, similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention. A recurrent network model captured these effects. These feedback-mediated modulations allow higher-order cortical areas to dynamically regulate spatial resolution, sensitivity to image features, and efficiency of coding natural images in lower-order cortical areas.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the food web structure and complexity are central to better understand ecosystem functioning. A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.",

    "abstract": "Predicting whether individuals will colonize a novel habitat is of fundamental ecological interest and is crucial to both conservation efforts and invasive species management. A consistently supported predictor of colonization success is the number of individuals introduced, also called propagule pressure. Propagule pressure increases with the number of introductions and the number of individuals per introduction (the size of the introduction), but it is unresolved which process is a stronger driver of colonization success. Furthermore their relative importance may depend upon the environment, with multiple introductions potentially enhancing colonization of fluctuating environments. To evaluate the relative importance of the number and size of introductions and its dependence upon environmental variability, we paired demographic simulations with a microcosm experiment. Using Tribolium flour beetles as a model system, we introduced a fixed number of individuals into replicated novel habitats of stable or fluctuating quality, varying the number of introductions through time and size of each introduction. We evaluated establishment probability and the size of extant populations after 7 generations. In the simulations and microcosms, we found that establishment probability increased with more, smaller introductions, but was not affected by biologically realistic fluctuations in environmental quality. Population size was not significantly affected by environmental variability in the simulations, but populations in the microcosms grew larger in a stable environment, especially with more introduction events. In general, the microcosm experiment yielded higher establishment probability and larger populations than the demographic simulations. We suggest that genetic mechanisms likely underlie these differences and thus deserve more attention in efforts to parse propagule pressure. Our results highlight the importance of preventing further introductions of undesirable species to invaded sites, and suggest conservation efforts should focus on increasing the number of introductions or re-introductions of desirable species rather than increasing the size of those introduction events.",

    "abstract": "Frequency-specific oscillations and phase-coupling of neuronal populations have been proposed as an essential mechanism for the coordination of activity between brain areas during cognitive tasks. To provide an effective substrate for cognitive function, we reasoned that ongoing functional brain networks should also be able to reorganise and coordinate in a similar manner. To test this hypothesis, we use a novel method for identifying repeating patterns of network dynamics, and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states, with spatially distinct power and phase-coupling in specific frequency bands. Brain states were identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks; the latter include a posterior higher-order cognitive network in the alpha range (8-12Hz) and an anterior cognitive network in the delta/theta range (1-7Hz). Both higher-order cognitive networks exhibit especially high power and coherence, and contain brain areas corresponding to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks operate in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales.",

    "abstract": "A segmental deletion resulting in DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion is now recognized as the signature genetic event of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC), a rare but lethal liver cancer that primarily affects adolescents and young adults. Here, we implement CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and transposon-mediated somatic gene transfer to demonstrate that expression of both the endogenous fusion protein or a chimeric cDNA leads to the formation of indolent liver tumors in mice that closely resemble human FL-HCC. Notably, overexpression of the wild type PRKACA was unable to fully recapitulate the oncogenic activity of DNAJB1-PRKACA, implying that FL-HCC does not simply result from enhanced PRKACA expression. Tumorigenesis was significantly enhanced by genetic activation of {beta}-catenin, an observation supported by evidence of recurrent Wnt pathway mutations in human FL-HCC, as well as treatment with hepatotoxin 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), which causes tissue injury, inflammation and fibrosis. Our study validates the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion kinase as an oncogenic driver and candidate drug target for FL-HCC and establishes a practical model for preclinical studies to identify strategies to treat this disease.\\n\\nSignificanceEfforts to understand and treat FL-HCC have been confounded by a lack of models that accurately reflect the genetics and biology of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion drives tumorigenesis in mice, and that fusion to DNAJB1 drives FL-HCC initiation more effectively than wild type PRKACA overexpression. The requirement of the PRKACA kinase domain in tumor initiation establishes the potential utility of kinase inhibitors targeting the fusion. By identifying genetic and environmental factors that can enhance the consistency and aggressiveness of disease progression, we reveal biological characteristics of the disease and advance a robust platform for future pre-clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Hemiptera (aphids, cicadas, and true bugs) are a key insect order, with high diversity for feeding ecology and excellent experimental tractability for molecular genetics. Building upon recent sequencing of hemipteran pests such as phloem-feeding aphids and blood-feeding bed bugs, we present the genome sequence and comparative analyses centered on the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, a seed feeder of the family Lygaeidae.\\n\\nResultsThe 926-Mb Oncopeltus genome is well represented by the current assembly and official gene set. We use our genomic and RNA-seq data not only to characterize the protein-coding gene repertoire and perform isoform-specific RNAi, but also to elucidate patterns of molecular evolution and physiology. We find ongoing, lineage-specific expansion and diversification of repressive C2H2 zinc finger proteins. The discovery of intron gain and turnover specific to the Hemiptera also prompted evaluation of lineage and genome size as predictors of gene structure evolution. Furthermore, we identify enzymatic gains and losses that correlate with feeding biology, particularly for reductions associated with derived, fluid-nutrition feeding.\\n\\nConclusionsWith the milkweed bug, we now have a critical mass of sequenced species for a hemimetabolous insect order and close outgroup to the Holometabola, substantially improving the diversity of insect genomics. We thereby define commonalities among the Hemiptera and delve into how hemipteran genomes reflect distinct feeding ecologies. Given Oncopeltus's strength as an experimental model, these new sequence resources bolster the foundation for molecular research and highlight technical considerations for the analysis of medium-sized invertebrate genomes.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical work predicts that dispersal and self-fertilisation (selfing) should always be negatively correlated and the Good Coloniser Syndrome (GCS) of high dispersal and selfing should not occur when both traits are free to evolve. This contradicts positive relationships between selfing and dispersal in empirical data. Critically, previous work assumes density of adults is spatially and temporally homogeneous, so selfing results in homogeneity in propagule production and competition, which eliminates the benefit of dispersal for escaping from local resource competition. We investigate the joint evolution of dispersal and selfing in a demographically structured metapopulation model where local density varies due to stochastic extinction-recolonisation dynamics. Increasing local extinction rate reduces local density across the metapopulation, which favours high selfing to mitigate mate limitation, but increases heterogeneity in density, which favours high dispersal for escape from competition. Together, these effects produce a positive relationship between selfing and dispersal, and evolution of the GCS. Nevertheless, the relationship between selfing and dispersal is context-dependent, as varying dispersal cost yields a negative relationship. Our results imply that if spatiotemporal heterogeneity in environmental suitability increases towards the range edge, the GCS may evolve there, favouring further range expansion (Cf. Bakers Law).",

    "abstract": "Recent molecular genetic studies have shown that the majority of genes associated with obesity are expressed in the central nervous system. Obesity has also been associated with neurobehavioural factors such as brain morphology, cognitive performance, and personality. Here, we tested whether these neurobehavioural factors were associated with the heritable variance in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) in the Human Connectome Project (N=895 siblings). Phenotypically, cortical thickness findings supported the \\\"right brain hypothesis\\\" for obesity. Namely, increased BMI associated with decreased cortical thickness in right frontal lobe and increased thickness in the left frontal lobe, notably in lateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, lower thickness and volume in entorhinal-parahippocampal structures, and increased thickness in parietal-occipital structures in obese participants supported the role of visuospatial function in obesity. Brain morphometry results were supported by cognitive tests, which outlined obesitys negative association with visuospatial function, verbal episodic memory, impulsivity, and cognitive flexibility. Personality-obesity correlations were inconsistent. We then aggregated the effects for each neurobehavioural factor for a behavioural genetics analysis and demonstrated the factors genetic overlap with obesity. Namely, cognitive test scores and brain morphometry had 0.25 - 0.45 genetic correlations with obesity, and the phenotypic correlations with obesity were 77-89% explained by genetic factors. Neurobehavioural factors also had some genetic overlap with each other. In summary, obesity has considerable genetic overlap with brain and cognitive measures. This supports the theory that obesity is inherited via brain function, and may inform intervention strategies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementObesity is a widespread heritable health condition. Evidence from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and genetics has proposed links between obesity and the brain. The current study tested whether the heritable variance in obesity is explained by brain and behavioural factors in a large brain imaging cohort that included multiple related individuals. We found that the heritable variance in obesity had genetic correlations 0.25 - 0.45 with cognitive tests, cortical thickness, and regional brain volume. In particular, obesity was associated with frontal lobe asymmetry and differences in temporal-parietal perceptual systems. Further, we found genetic overlap between certain brain and behavioural factors. In summary, the genetic vulnerability to obesity is expressed in the brain. This may inform intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "While many of our motor skills are acquired through physical practice, we can also learn how to make movements by observing others. For example, individuals can learn how to reach in novel dynamical environments ( force fields, FF) by observing the movements of a tutor. Previous neurophysiology and neuroimaging studies in humans suggest a role for the motor system in motor learning by observing. Here we tested the role of primary motor cortex (M1) in motor learning by observing. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in right hand muscles at rest. MEPs were elicited before and after participants observed either a video adapting her reaches to a FF or a control video showing a tutor performing reaches in an unlearnable FF. We predicted that observing motor learning would increase M1 excitability to a greater extent than observing movements that did not involve learning. We found that observing FF learning increased MEP amplitudes recorded from right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles. There were no changes in MEP amplitudes for control participants who observed a tutor performing reaches in an unlearnable, randomly varying FF. The observed MEP changes can thus be specifically linked to observing motor learning. These results are consistent with the idea that observing motor learning produces functional changes in M1, or corticospinal networks or both.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin folding is increasingly recognized as a regulator of genomic processes such as gene activity. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods have been developed to unravel genome topology through the analysis of pair-wise chromatin contacts and have identified many genes and regulatory sequences that, in populations of cells, are engaged in multiple DNA interactions. However, pair-wise methods cannot discern whether contacts occur simultaneously or in competition on the individual chromosome. We present a novel 3C method, Multi-Contact 4C (MC-4C), that applies Nanopore sequencing to study multi-way DNA conformations of tens of thousands individual alleles for distinction between cooperative, random and competing interactions. MC-4C can uncover previously missed structures in sub-populations of cells. It reveals unanticipated cooperative clustering between regulatory chromatin loops, anchored by enhancers and gene promoters, and CTCF and cohesin-bound architectural loops. For example, we show that the constituents of the active b-globin super-enhancer cooperatively form an enhancer hub that can host two genes at a time. We also find cooperative interactions between further dispersed regulatory sequences of the active proto-cadherin locus. When applied to CTCF-bound domain boundaries, we find evidence that chromatin loops can collide, a process that is negatively regulated by the cohesin release factor WAPL. Loop collision is further pronounced in WAPL knockout cells, suggestive of a \\\"cohesin traffic jam\\\". In summary, single molecule multi-contact analysis methods can reveal how the myriad of regulatory sequences spatially coordinate their actions on individual chromosomes. Insight into these single allele higher-order topological features will facilitate interpreting the consequences of natural and induced genetic variation and help uncovering the mechanisms shaping our genome.",

    "abstract": "The motor systems ability to adapt to changes in the environment is essential for maintaining accurate movements. During such adaptation several distinct systems are recruited: cerebellar sensory-prediction error learning, success-based reinforcement, and explicit strategy-use. Although much work has focused on the relationship between cerebellar learning and strategy-use, there is little research regarding how reinforcement and strategy-use interact. To address this, participants first learnt a 20{degrees} visuomotor displacement. After reaching asymptotic performance, binary, hit-or-miss feedback (BF) was introduced either with or without visual feedback, the latter promoting reinforcement. Subsequently, retention was assessed using no-feedback trials, with half of the participants in each group being instructed to stop using any strategy. Although BF led to an increase in retention of the visuomotor displacement, instructing participants to remove their strategy nullified this effect, suggesting strategy-use is critical to BF-based reinforcement. In a second experiment, we prevented the expression or development of a strategy during BF performance, by either constraining participants to a short preparation time (expression) or by introducing the displacement gradually (development). As both strongly impaired BF performance, it suggests reinforcement requires both the development and expression of a strategy. These results emphasise a pivotal role of strategy-use during reinforcement-based motor learning.",

Female flies emit Z4-11Al for species-specific communication and mate-finding. A sensory panel finds that synthetic Z4-11Al has a characteristic flavour, which we perceive even at the small amounts produced by one female fly. Since only females produce Z4-11Al, and not males, we can reliably distinguish between single D. melanogaster males and females, according to their scent. Females release Z4-11Al at 2.4 ng/h and we readily sense 1 ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine (0.03 nmol/L), while a tenfold concentration is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al. The biological role of Z4-11Al or structurally related aldehydes in humans and the basis for this semiochemical convergence remains yet unclear.",

Its activity is regulated by a positive feedback loop whereby its terminal enzymatic product, H3K27me3, is specifically recognized and bound by an aromatic cage present in its EED subunit. The ensuing allosteric activation of the complex stimulates H3K27me3 deposition on chromatin. Here, we report a step-wise feedback mechanism entailing key residues within distinctive interfacing motifs of EZH2 or EED that are found mutated in cancers and/or Weaver syndrome. PRC2 harboring these EZH2 or EED mutants manifest little activity in vivo but, unexpectedly, exhibited similar chromatin association as wild-type PRC2, indicating an uncoupling of PRC2 activity and recruitment. With genetic and chemical tools, we further demonstrated that targeting allosteric activation overrode the gain-of-function effect of EZH2Y646X oncogenic mutations. These results revealed critical implications to the regulation and biology of PRC2 and a novel vulnerability in tackling PRC2-addicted cancers.",

    "abstract": "A game theoretic treatment is introduced to explore the role of nutrition of the gut bacterial microflora as a potential pro-biotic therapy. Rational design of functional foods and nutraceuticals has far reaching public health and therapeutic benefits. Understanding ecological dynamics and how phenotypic manipulations of microbe-microbe interactions of the gut microbiota can provide direct health benefit is currently a fundamental question in bioengineering and more widely in the food, diet and health industries. This work considers a hypothetical adjustment of the microbiome by introducing a transgenic bacterial species that contributes to increased exposure of omega 3 fats in the gut by converting them from the omega 6 fats, dominant in the Western diet. The ratio of the two fats circulating in blood are risk markers, indicators of metabolic syndrome and related conditions. In this work, we consider nutritional exposure to a pro-biotic, a live culture of transgenic bacteria contributing omega 3 fats from omega 6 in the diet. Maintaining a long-term co-existence between native (indigenous) and transgenic bacteria is a challenge. Game theory is the appropriate tool for handling this conflict. The long-term co-existence is guaranteed if the two strains engage in the Snowdrift game. Our game theoretic treatment provides the basis of a model mechanism for prophylactic nutritional therapy for metabolic syndrome by the transgenic bacteria, providing support of indigenous gut microbiota and additional supplementation of a pro-biotic.",

    "abstract": "As single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have become more widespread the number of tools designed to analyse these data has dramatically increased. Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records of the growth of the field over time.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn recent years single-cell RNA-sequeing technologies have emerged that allow scientists to measure the activity of genes in thousands of individual cells simultaneously. This means we can start to look at what each cell in a sample is doing instead of considering an average across all cells in a sample, as was the case with older technologies. However, while access to this kind of data presents a wealth of opportunities it comes with a new set of challenges. Researchers across the world have developed new methods and software tools to make the most of these datasets but the field is moving at such a rapid pace it is difficult to keep up with what is currently available. To make this easier we have developed the scRNA-tools database and website (www.scRNA-tools.org). Our database catalogues analysis tools, recording the tasks they can be used for, where they can be downloaded from and the publications that describe how they work. By looking at this database we can see that developers have focued on methods specific to single-cell data and that they embrace an open-source approach with permissive licensing, sharing of code and preprint publications.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cell mechanotransduction is important for discerning matrix structure-cell function relationships underlying health and disease. Despite the crucial role of mechanochemical signaling in phenomena such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, measuring the cell-generated forces at the interface with the extracellular matrix during these biological processes remains challenging. An ideal method would provide continuous, non-destructive images of the force field applied by cells, over broad spatial and temporal scales, while simultaneously revealing the cell biological process under investigation. Toward this goal, we present the integration of a new real-time traction stress imaging modality, Hilbert phase dynamometry (HPD), with the technique of spatial light interference microscopy (SLIM) for label free monitoring of cell growth. HPD relies on extracting the displacement field in a deformable substrate, which is chemically patterned with a fluorescent grid. The displacements introduced by the cell are captured by the phase of the periodic signal associated with the grid, borrowing concepts from holography. The displacement field is uniquely converted into forces by solving an elasticity inverse problem. Because the measurement of displacement only uses the epi-fluorescence channel of an inverted microscope, we can simultaneously achieve measurements in transmission. We performed SLIM and extracted cell mass on the same field of view in addition to the measured displacement field. We used this technique to study mesenchymal stem cells and found that cells undergoing osteogenesis and adipogenesis exerted larger and more dynamic stresses than their precursor. Our results indicate that the MSCs develop the smallest forces and growth rates. We anticipate that simultaneous cell growth and traction measurements will improve our understanding of mechanotransduction, particularly during dynamic processes where the matrix properties provide context to guide cells towards a physiological or pathological outcome, e.g., tissue morphogenesis, or cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Cilia perform essential signalling functions during development and tissue homeostasis. Ciliary malfunction causes a variety of diseases, named ciliopathies. The key role that the mother centriole plays in cilia formation can be attributed to appendage proteins that associate exclusively with the mother centriole. The distal appendages form a platform that docks early ciliary vesicles and removes CP110/Cep97 inhibitory complexes from the mother centriole. Here, we analysed the role played by LRRC45 in appendage formation and ciliogenesis. We show that the core appendage proteins Cep83 and SCLT1 recruit LRRC45 to the mother centriole. Once there LRRC45 recruits FBF1. The association of LRRC45 with the basal body of primary and motile cilia in differentiated and stem cells reveals a broad function in ciliogenesis. In contrast to the appendage components Cep164 and Cep123, LRRC45 was neither essential for docking of early ciliary vesicles nor for removal of CP110. Rather, LRRC45 promotes cilia biogenesis in CP110-uncapped centrioles by organising centriolar satellites and promoting the docking of Rab8 GTPase-positive vesicles. We propose that, instead of acting solely as a platform to recruit early vesicles, centriole appendages form discrete scaffolds of cooperating proteins that execute specific functions that promote the initial steps of ciliogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of the high-mortality disease melioidosis, is a Gram-negative bacterium that is naturally resistant to many antibiotics. There is no vaccine for melioidosis, and effective eradication is reliant on biphasic and prolonged antibiotic administration. The carbapenem drug, meropenem, is the current gold-standard option for treating severe melioidosis. Intrinsic B. pseudomallei resistance towards meropenem has not yet been documented; however, resistance could conceivably develop over the course of infection, leading to prolonged sepsis and treatment failure. Here, we document 11 melioidosis cases in which B. pseudomallei isolates developed decreased susceptibility towards meropenem during treatment, including two cases not treated with this antibiotic. Meropenem minimum inhibitory concentrations increased over time from 0.5-0.75 to 3-8 g/mL. Using comparative genomics, we identified multiple mutations affecting multidrug resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump regulators, leading to over-expression of their corresponding pumps. The most commonly affected pump was AmrAB-OprA, although alterations in the local regulators of BpeEF-OprC or BpeAB-OprB were observed in three cases. This study confirms the role of RND efflux pumps in decreased meropenem susceptibility in B. pseudomallei. Further, we document two concerning examples of severe melioidosis where the reduced treatment efficacy of meropenem was associated with a fatal outcome.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes the often-fatal tropical disease melioidosis, is difficult to eradicate. Due to high levels of intrinsic antibiotic resistance, only a handful of antibiotics are effective against this pathogen. One of these, meropenem, is commonly used in the treatment of melioidosis patients who are unresponsive to other treatments or are critically ill. Here, we describe 11 melioidosis cases whereby patients exhibited prolonged or repeated infections that were associated with the development of decreased meropenem susceptibility. We identified the molecular basis for this decreased susceptibility in latter B. pseudomallei isolates obtained from these patients, and functionally confirmed the mechanism conferring this phenotype. Our findings have important ramifications for the diagnosis, treatment and management of life-threatening melioidosis cases.",

Yet, our motor system uses a specific muscle activity pattern to generate reaching movements that have similar characteristics. For many decades, we know that this pattern features activity bursts and silent periods. We suggest that these bursts are a strong evidence against the common view that the brain continuously controls the commands to the muscles. Instead, we suggest a model that changes these commands in a discrete way. We use unsupervised machine learning to identify transitions in the state of the muscles, and show that fitting a discrete model to the kinematics of movement using only one parameter predicts the transitions in the state of the muscles. Such discrete controller suggests that the brain reduces the complexity of the motor control problem as well as the wear-and-tear of the muscles by sending commands to the muscles at sparse times. Identifying this discrete controller can be applied in the control of prostheses and physical human-robot interaction systems such as exoskeletons and assistive devices.",

The neuro-transmitter GABA regulates neuronal activity but its role in modulating AP dynamics itself is unclear. Here we show that GABA indeed changes the AP mechanism: it causes regularly firing hippocampal CA3 neurons to bistably switch between spiking and quiescence, converts graded discharge-to-current relationships to have abrupt onsets, and induces resonance. Modeling reveals that A-currents enable these GABA-induced transitions. Mathematically, we prove that this transition sequence originates from a single universal principle that generically underlies the modulation of AP dynamics in any conductance-based neuron model. Conductance clamp experiments in hippocampal and brainstem neurons show the same transitions, confirming the universal theory. In simulated networks, synaptically controlled AP dynamics, permits dynamic gating of signals and targeted synchronization of neuronal sub-ensembles. These results advance the systematic understanding of AP modulation and its role in neuronal and network function.",

    "abstract": "1.Active sensing using light, or active photolocation, is only known from deep sea and nocturnal fish with chemiluminescent \\\"search\\\" lights. Bright irides in diurnal fish species have recently been proposed as a potential analogue. Here, we contribute to this discussion by testing whether iris radiance is actively modulated. The focus is on behaviourally controlled iris reflections, called \\\"ocular sparks\\\". The triplefin Tripterygion delaisi can alternate between red and blue ocular sparks, allowing us to test the prediction that spark frequency and hue depend on background hue and prey presence. In a first experiment, we found that blue ocular sparks were significantly more often \\\"on\\\" against red backgrounds, and red ocular sparks against blue backgrounds, particularly when copepods were present. A second experiment tested whether hungry fish showed more ocular sparks, which was not the case. Again, background hue resulted in differential use of ocular spark types. We conclude that iris radiance through ocular sparks in T. delaisi is not a side effect of eye movement, but adaptively modulated in response to the context under which prey are detected. We discuss the possible alternative functions of ocular sparks, including an as yet speculative role in active photolocation.",

    "abstract": "Microarray batch effect (BE) has been the primary bottleneck for large-scale integration of data from multiple experiments. Current BE correction methods either need known batch identities (ComBat)or have the potential to overcorrect, by removing true but unknown biological differences (SVA).Even though the effects of technical differences on measured expression have been published, there are no BE correction algorithms that take the approach of predicting technical effects from parameters computed from a fixed reference sample set. We show that a set of signatures, each of which is a vector the length of the number of probes, calculated on a Reference set of microarray samples can predict much of the batch effect in other Validation sets. We present a rationale of selecting a Reference set of samples designed to estimate technical differences without removing biological differences. Putting both together, we introduce the Batch Effect Signature Correction (BESC) algorithm that uses the BES calculated on the Reference set to efficiently predict and remove BE. Using two independent Validation sets, we show that BESC is capable of removing batch effect without removing unknown but true biological differences. Much of the variations due to batch effect is shared between different microarray datasets. That shared information can be used to predict signatures (i.e. directions of perturbation) due to batch effect in new datasets. The correction is blind (without needing to re-compute the parameters on new samples to be corrected), single sample, (each sample is corrected independently of each other) and conservative (only those perturbations known to be likely to be due to technical differences are removed ensuring that unknown but important biological differences are maintained). Those three characteristics make it ideal for high-throughput correction of samples for a microarray data repository. An R Package besc implementing the algorithm is available from http://explainbio.com.",

To date, it remains largely unclear to what extent chromatin machinery contributes to the susceptibility and progression of complex diseases. Here, we combined deep epigenome mapping with single cell transcriptomics to mine for evidence of chromatin dysregulation in type-2 diabetes. We identify two chromatin-state signatures that track the trajectory of {beta}-cell dysfunction in mice and humans: ectopic activation of bivalent Polycomb-domains and a loss of expression at a subclass of highly active domains containing key lineage-defining genes. {beta}-cell specific deletion of Polycomb (Eed/PRC2) triggers parallel transcriptional signatures. Intriguingly, these {beta}-cell Eed-knockouts also exhibit highly penetrant hyperglycemia-independent dedifferentiation indicating that Polycomb dysregulation sensitizes the {beta}-cell for dedifferentiation. These findings provide novel resources for exploring transcriptional and epigenetic control of {beta}-cell (dys)function. They identify PRC2 as necessary for long-term maintenance of {beta}-cell identity. The data suggest a two-hit model for loss of {beta}-cell identity in diabetes and highlight epigenetic therapeutic potential to block dedifferentiation.",

    "abstract": "Drug susceptibility, defined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), often does not predict whether fungal infections will respond to therapy in the clinic. Tolerance at supra-MIC antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels. Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia displayed significantly higher tolerance than isolates that were readily cleared by fluconazole. Thus, tolerance correlates with the response to fluconazole therapy in patients and may help predict whether infections will respond to fluconazole alone. Similarly, measuring tolerance may provide a useful clinical parameter for choosing appropriate therapeutic strategies to overcome persistent clinical candidemia.",

    "abstract": "The nature of artificial vision with a retinal prosthesis, and the degree to which the brain can adapt to the unnatural input from such a device, are poorly understood. Therefore, the development of current and future devices may be aided by theory and simulations that help to infer and understand what prosthesis patients see. A biologically-informed, extensible computational framework is presented here to predict visual perception and the potential effect of learning with a subretinal prosthesis. The framework relies on optimal linear reconstruction of the stimulus from retinal responses to infer the visual information available to the patient. A simulation of the physiological optics of the eye and light responses of the major retinal neurons was used to calculate the optimal linear transformation for reconstructing natural images from retinal activity. The result was then used to reconstruct the visual stimulus during the artificial activation expected from a subretinal prosthesis in a degenerated retina, as a proxy for inferred visual perception. Several simple observations reveal the potential utility of such a simulation framework. The inferred perception obtained with prosthesis activation was substantially degraded compared to the inferred perception obtained with normal retinal responses, as expected given the limited resolution and lack of cell type specificity of the prosthesis. Consistent with clinical findings and the importance of cell type specificity, reconstruction using only ON cells, and not OFF cells, was substantially more accurate. Finally, when reconstruction was re-optimized for prosthesis stimulation, simulating the greatest potential for learning by the patient, the accuracy of inferred perception was much closer to that of healthy vision. The reconstruction approach thus provides a more complete method for exploring the potential for treating blindness with retinal prostheses than has been available previously. It may also be useful for interpreting patient data in clinical trials, and for improving prosthesis design.",

Previous studies have observed a dependence of TMS-induced responses on ongoing brain activity, for instance sensorimotor rhythms. This suggests an opportunity for the development of more effective stimulation protocols through closed-loop TMS-EEG. However, it is not yet clear how features of ongoing activity affect the responses of cortical circuits to TMS.\\n\\nObjective/HypothesisHere we investigate the dependence of TMS-responses on power and phase of ongoing oscillatory activity in a computational model of TMS-induced I-waves.\\n\\nMethodsThe model comprises populations of cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons and a population of cortical layer 5 (L5) neurons and generates I-waves in response to TMS. Oscillatory input to the L2/3 neurons induces rhythmic fluctuations in activity of L5 neurons. TMS pulses are simulated at different phases and amplitudes of the ongoing rhythm.\\n\\nResultsThe model shows a robust dependence of I-wave properties on phase and power of ongoing rhythms, with the strongest response occurring for TMS at maximal L5 depolarization. The amount of phase-modulation depends on stimulation intensity, with stronger modulation for lower intensity.\\n\\nConclusionThe model predicts that responses to TMS are highly variable for low stimulation intensities if ongoing brain rhythms are not taken into account.

We used native mass spectrometry in combination with molecular dynamics simulations and in vivo analyses to investigate the roles of membrane lipids in the structure and transport activity of the purine transporter, UapA, from Aspergillus nidulans. We revealed that UapA exists mainly as a dimer and that two lipid molecules bind per UapA dimer. We identified three classes of phospholipids: phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) which co-purified with UapA. Delipidation of UapA caused dissociation of the dimer into individual protomers. Subsequent addition of PI or PE rescued the UapA dimer and allowed recovery of bound lipids, suggesting a central role of these lipids in stabilising the dimer. We predicted a putative lipid-binding site near the UapA dimer interface. Mutational analyses established that lipid binding at this site is essential for formation of functional UapA dimers. Our findings reveal unprecedented level of detail into the nature of UapA-lipid interactions and provide a framework for studying similar eukaryotic systems.",

    "abstract": "The physical mechanism of aerial dispersal of spiders, \\\"ballooning behavior,\\\" is still unclear because of the lack of serious scientific observations and experiments. Therefore, as a first step in clarifying the phenomenon, we studied the ballooning behavior of relatively large spiders (heavier than 5 mg) in nature. Additional wind tunnel tests to identify ballooning silks were implemented in the laboratory. From our observation, it seems obvious that spiders actively evaluate the condition of the wind with their front leg (leg I) and wait for the preferable wind condition for their ballooning takeoff. In the wind tunnel tests, as yet unknown physical properties of ballooning fibers (length, thickness and number of fibers) were identified. Large spiders, 16-20 mg Xysticus species, spun 50 to 60 nanoscale fibers, with a diameter of 121 to 323 nm. The length of these threads was 3.22 {+/-} 1.31 m (N = 22). These physical properties of ballooning fibers can explain the ballooning of large spiders with relatively light updrafts, 0.1-0.5 m s-1, which exist in a light breeze of 1.5-3.3 m s-1. Additionally, in line with previous research on turbulence in atmospheric boundary layers and from our wind measurements, it is hypothesized that spiders use the ascending air current for their aerial dispersal, the \\\"ejection\\\" regime, which is induced by hairpin vortices in the atmospheric boundary layer turbulence. This regime is highly correlated with lower wind speeds. This coincides well with the fact that spiders usually balloon when the wind speed is lower than 3 m s-1.",

Here, we provide such evidence from a large forest biodiversity experiment with a novel design2 in subtropical China. Productivity (stand-level tree basal area, aboveground volume and carbon and their annual increment) increased linearly with the logarithm of tree species richness. Additive partitioning3 showed that increasing positive complementarity effects combined with weakening negative selection effects caused a strengthening of the relationship over time. In 2-species mixed stands, complementary effects increased with functional distance and selection effects with vertical crown dissimilarity between species. Understorey shrubs reduced stand-level tree productivity, but this effect of competition was attenuated by shrub species richness, indicating that a diverse understorey may facilitate overall ecosystem functioning. Identical biodiversity-productivity relationships were found in plots of different size, suggesting that extrapolation to larger scales is possible.

    "abstract": "O_LIEconomic development and energy exploration are increasing in the Arctic. Important breeding habitats for many waterbird species, which have previously been relatively undisturbed, are now being subjected to these anthropogenic pressures. The conservation of the habitats and the species they support is a significant challenge for sustainable development. Even if governments and corporates operating in this fragile environment are committed to sustainable development, there is little information available to avoid, mitigate and manage environmental risk and impacts. Taking a risk management perspective, we followed the International Finance Corporations (IFC) Performance Standard 6 (PS6) criteria on Environmental and Social Sustainability and developed an approach to identify \\\"critical habitat\\\", as defined in IFC PS6, for waterbird species breeding in the Arctic. While the range of these waterbirds is roughly known, more accuracy is needed for proper risk assessment.\\nC_LIO_LIWe have therefore gone a step further by modelling suitable habitat within these ranges. Depending on the relevance of the species for IFC PS6 and the level of certainty we separated the classes likely and potential critical habitat. We tested the approach for Russian breeding populations of five Anatidae species (White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons, Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, Brent Goose Branta bernicla, Redbreasted Goose Branta ruficollis and Bewicks Swan Cygnus columbianus bewicki). Likely critical habitats were identified through a review of literature and available data for these waterbird species and multi-species congregations. To address the information gap for most of the Russian Arctic a species distribution modelling approach was used. The outputs of this approach were labelled as potential critical habitat, indicating the lower level of certainty than likely critical habitat.\\nC_LIO_LIBased on existing information the amount of likely critical habitat is estimated to be at least x,xxx,xxx km2. For the five Anatidae species, X,XXX,XXX km2 potential critical habitat was identified; 95% of these areas were outside of the area boundaries of likely critical habitat for the species.\\nC_LIO_LIInsufficient data in the east of the study area did affect the results, as some areas known to support breeding populations were not identified as suitable. Conversely, species distributions may be overpredicted in other areas; It should also be recognized that the analyzed species currently have depressed populations and may therefore only utilize a proportion of suitable habitat available.\\nC_LIO_LIFor risk assessment purposes however, it is better to predict false positives, rather than false negatives. The study indicates that there are large areas in the Arctic that are potentially important for each of the Anatidae species modelled, but are not yet recognised as key important areas. The results confirm that there is still much to learn about waterbird distribution and abundance in the Russian Arctic.\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications The critical habitat maps produced do not just provide a new source of information for the economic development sector, but provide it in a way that is relevant to the sector and directly applicable. The maps are useful for initial risk assessments of potential developments, to identify likely impacts and to consider mitigation options, in accordance with IFC PS6. Risk assessors should exercise caution and detailed surveys for any development in areas predicted to be suitable for each species should be carried out.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Determining the fitness of viral genotypes has become a standard practice in virology as it is essential to evaluate their evolutionary potential. Darwinian fitness, defined as the advantage of a given genotype with respect to a reference one, is a mesoscopic property that captures into a single figure differences in performance at every stage of viral infection. But to which extent viral fitness results from particular molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes, and then functional classes, whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, that led to close fitness values, also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with TEV fitness. Over-expression of genes with positive correlation activates hormone-and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. By contrast, under-expression of genes negatively correlated reduces metabolism, growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness, and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.",

    "abstract": "All else being equal, the ratio of genetic diversity levels on X and autosomes at selectively neutral sites should mirror the ratio of their numbers in the population and thus equal [3/4]. Because X chromosomes spend twice as many generations in females as in males, however, the ratio of diversity levels is also affected by sex differences in life history. The effects of life history on diversity levels, notably those of sex-specific age structures and reproductive variances, have been studied for decades, yet existing theory relies on many parameters that are difficult to measure and lacks generality in ways that limit their applicability. We derive general yet simple expressions for these effects and show that life history effects on X-to-autosome (X:A) ratios of diversity levels depend only on sex-ratios of mutation rates, generation times, and reproductive variances. These results reveal that changing the sex-ratio of generation times has opposite effects on X:A ratios of polymorphism and divergence. They also explain how sex-specific life histories modulate the response of X:A polymorphism ratios to changes in population size. More generally, they clarify that sex-specific life history--generation times in particular--should have a marked effect on X:A polymorphism ratios in many taxa and enable the investigation of these effects.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the determinants of neutral diversity patterns on autosomes and sex chromosomes provides a bedrock for our interpretation of population genetic data. Sex-specific age-structure and variation in reproductive success have long been thought to affect neutral diversity, but theoretical descriptions of these effects were complicated and/or lacked in generality, stymying attempts to relate diversity patterns of species with their life history. We derive general yet simple expressions for these effects, which clarify how they impact neutral diversity and should enable studies of relative diversity levels on the autosomes and sex chromosomes in many taxa.",

    "abstract": "As a locally adapted complex trait, flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana has attracted much attention in genetics. Most studies have, however, focused on contributions by individual loci rather than the joint contributions by the large number of loci in the genetic architecture of flowering time to local and global adaptation. In an earlier study, we reported 46 loci associated with flowering time variation during growth at 10{degrees}C, 16{degrees}C or both in the 1,001-genomes collection of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Here, we explore how these loci together contribute to differences among genetically defined, and geographically divided, subpopulations across the native range of this species. Our approach was to define flowering time as a trait, and the measurements at 10 and 16 {degrees}C as two independent measurements of it. This facilitated explorations of the dynamics in the genetic architecture -which loci contribute and their effects- of flowering time across growth temperatures and their potential roles in local and global adaptation. The overall flowering time differences between populations could be explained by subtle changes in allele-frequencies and gradual changes in phenotype due to globally present alleles. More extreme local adaptations were on several occasions due to contributions by regional alleles with relatively large effects. About 2/3 of the 48 evaluated flowering time loci had similar effects on flowering time at 10{degrees}C and 16{degrees}C, while the remaining 1/3 had different effects in the two temperatures, suggesting an important contribution of gene by temperature interactions to this trait. There are also indications that co-evolution of functionally connected alleles in local populations has been important for local adaptation. Overall, this study provides deeper insights to the polygenic genetic basis of flowering time variation in Arabidopsis thaliana across a wide range of ecological habitats.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMany genes can affect flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana, but their contribution to natural flowering time variation in the worldwide population is largely unknown. We explored how 48 loci associated with flowering time, measured at 10{degrees}C and 16{degrees}C, or their difference, for the same wild collected 1,001-genomes Arabidopsis thaliana accessions together contribute to differences among the genetically defined and geographically divided subpopulations from the native species range. The overall flowering time differences among these subpopulations could be explained by the joint small effects of globally present alleles, suggesting an important contribution by polygenic adaptation for this trait. Most alleles with large effects on flowering were present only in some populations, facilitating more extreme local adaptations. Long-range LD was observed between genes in several biological pathways, indicating possible local adaptation via co-evolution of functionally connected polymorphisms. The genetic architecture of flowering time was also found to depend on the growth temperature. Most flowering time loci had similar effects on flowering time measured at 10{degrees}C and 16{degrees}C, but the effects of about 1/3 of them had effects that varied with temperature. Overall, new insights are provided to how the polygenic architecture of flowering time has facilitated its colonisation of a wide range of ecological habitats.",

Existing single-cell sequencing technologies, however, are unable to analyse nuclear (nuc) and cytoplasmic (cyt) RNAs separately and simultaneously. Hence, there remain challenges to discern correlation, localisation, and translocation between them.\\n\\nResultsHere we report a microfluidic system that physically separates nucRNA and cytRNA from a single cell and enables single-cell integrated nucRNA and cytRNA-sequencing (SINC-seq). SINC-seq constructs two individual RNA-seq libraries, nucRNA and cytRNA per cell, quantifies gene expression in the subcellular compartments and combines them to create a novel single-cell RNA-seq data enabled by our system, which we here term in-silico single cell.\\n\\nConclusionsLeveraging SINC-seq, we discovered three distinct natures of correlation among cytRNA and nucRNA that reflected the physiological state of single cells: The cell-cycle-related genes displayed highly correlated expression pattern with minor differences; RNA splicing genes showed lower nucRNA-to-cytRNA correlation, suggesting a retained intron may be implicated in inhibited mRNA transport; A chemical perturbation, sodium butyrate treatment, transiently distorted the correlation along differentiating human leukemic cells to erythroid cells.

    "abstract": "Based on a novel kind of single strand adaptor (SSA), this study developed a new method to construct next-generation sequencing (NGS) library, named as SALP, representing Single strand Adaptor Library Preparation. The key creativity of the method lies in the design and verification of a special adaptor that can be efficiently linked to the 3' end of single-stranded DNA, which is a double-stranded oligonucleotide with a 3' overhang of 3 random nucleotides. This method can start with the denatured DNAs or chromatins fragmented by different methods such as Tn5 tagmentation, enzyme digestion and sonication. When applied to Tn5-tagmented chromatin, SALP overcomes the key limitation of the current ATAC-seq method and develops a high-throughput NGS library construction and sequencing approach, SALP-seq, which can be used to comparatively characterize the chromatin openness state of multiple cells simply and unbiasly. In this way, the comparative chromatin openness states of four different cell lines, including GM12878, HepG2, HeLa and 293T, were successfully characterized. This study also demonstrated that SALP-seq could characterize the chromatin openness states with 105 to 500 cells, indicating the high sensitivity of SALP-seq in characterizing chromatin state of cells. SALP should have wide applications in the future biological sciences and biomedicine.",

    "abstract": "The Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention (WRAP) is a longitudinal observational cohort study enriched with persons with a parental history (PH) of probable Alzheimers Disease (AD) dementia. Since late 2001, WRAP has enrolled 1,561 people at a mean baseline age of 54. Participants return for a second visit four years after baseline and subsequent visits occur every two years. Eighty-one percent (1270) of participants remain active in the study at a current mean age of 64 and 9 years of follow-up. Serially assessed cognition, self-reported medical and lifestyle histories (e.g. diet, physical and cognitive activity, sleep, and mood), laboratory tests, genetics, and linked studies comprising molecular imaging, structural imaging and cerebrospinal fluid data, have yielded many important findings. In this cohort, PH of probable AD is associated with 46% APOE {varepsilon}4 positivity, more than twice the rate of 22% among persons without PH. Subclinical or worse cognitive decline relative to internal normative data has been observed in 17.6% of the cohort. Twenty-eight percent exhibit amyloid and/or tau positivity. Biomarker elevations, but not APOE or PH status, are associated with cognitive decline. Salutary health and lifestyle factors are associated with better cognition and brain structure, and lower AD pathophysiologic burden. Of paramount importance is establishing the amyloid and tau AD endophenotypes to which cognitive outcomes can be linked. Such data will provide new knowledge on the early temporal course of AD pathophysiology and inform the design of secondary prevention clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Whereas sleep-dependent consolidation and its neurochemical underpinnings have been strongly researched, less is known about how consolidation during sleep affects subsequent learning. Since sleep enhances memory, it can be expected to pro-actively interfere with learning after sleep, in particular of similar materials. This pro-active interference should be enhanced by substances that benefit consolidation during sleep, such as D-cycloserine. We tested this hypothesis in two groups (Sleep, Wake) of young healthy participants receiving on one occasion D-cycloserine (175 mg) and on another occasion placebo, according to a double-blind balanced cross-over design. Treatment was administered after participants had learned a set of word-pairs (A-B list) and before nocturnal retention periods of sleep vs. wakefulness. After D-cycloserine blood plasma levels had dropped to negligible amounts, i.e., the next day in the evening, participants learned, in three sequential runs, new sets of word-pairs. One list - to enhance interference - consisted of the same cue words as the original set paired with a new target word (A-C list) and the other of completely new cue words (D-E set). Unexpectedly, during post-retention learning the A-C interference list was generally better learned than the completely new D-E list, which suggests that consolidation of previously encoded similar material enhances memory integration rather than pro-active interference. Consistent with this view, new learning of word-pairs was better after sleep than wakefulness. Similarly, D-cycloserine generally enhanced learning of new word-pairs, compared to placebo. This effect being independent of sleep or wakefulness, leads us to speculate that D-cycloserine, in addition to enhancing sleep-dependent consolidation, might mediate a time-dependent process of active forgetting.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive human electroencephalography (EEG) coupled with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is currently used to measure coarse stimulus-response relationships in brain physiology during behavior. However, with key modifications, the TMS-EEG technique holds even greater promise for monitoring fine-scale neural signatures of human behavior. Here, we demonstrate that a novel TMS-EEG co-registration technique can dynamically monitor individual human variation in perception based solely on EEG resting-state intrinsic effective connectivity probed by TMS-based phase resetting of ongoing activity. We used a bistable stimulus task, where the percept is perceived as either horizontal or vertical apparent motion, to record gamma band interhemispheric integration of information. Fine-grained inter-individual behavioral differences in horizontal motion bias could be measured by tracking resting-state gamma-band effective connectivity from right hMT+ to left hMT+. Thus, our method of triggering intrinsic resting-state effective connectivity in oscillatory dynamics can monitor individual differences in perception via the long-range integration of information. This technique will be useful for the manipulative dissection of individual-scale human cognition mediated by neural dynamics and may also expand neurofeedback approaches.",

    "abstract": "In Gram-negative bacteria, porins span the outer membrane and control the influx of several prominent groups of antibiotics. Thus, it should not be surprising that expression of these porins is often altered in clinical isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). The major regulator of porin expression in Escherichia coli is EnvZ, a canonical sensor histidine kinase (SHK). It allosterically processes periplasmic interactions with MzrA and cytoplasmic osmosensing into a single unified change in the ratio of its kinase and phosphatase activities. Unfortunately, the role of the EnvZ transmembrane domain (TMD) in bidirectional communication of these signals remains not well understood. Here, we employed in vivo sulfhydryl-reactivity to probe the dynamics of the TM2 helices and demonstrate that upon stimulus perception, only the region proximal to the periplasm undergoes conformational rearrangement. Furthermore, in silico coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations with aromatically tuned variants of EnvZ TM2 demonstrate the existence of both tilting and azimuthal rotational components to transmembrane communication while ruling out piston-type repositioning of TM2. Finally, in contrast to a similar analysis of TM1, we identified position-specific mutants possessing a \\\"flipped\\\" phenotype by dual-color fluorescent reporter analysis suggesting that both the periplasmic and cytoplasmic ends of TM2 are critical for maintenance of EnvZ signal output. Taken together, these data strongly support that EnvZ employs a non-piston-type mechanism during transmembrane communication. We conclude by discussing these results within the context of allosteric processing by EnvZ and propose that these results can be used to predict and classify transmembrane communication by various SHKs.\\n\\nImportanceThe EnvZ sensor histidine kinase serves as the major regulator of porin expression within Escherichia coli. A long-standing question is how stimulus perception by a bacterial receptor on one side of a biological membrane is transmitted to the opposite side of the membrane. To address this question, we monitored the dynamics of the transmembrane domain of EnvZ in vivo and coupled these results with in silico simulations of membrane-embedded EnvZ transmembrane domains. Taken together, these results demonstrate that detection of osmotic stress by the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ results in non-piston communication across the inner membrane of E. coli. Thus, in addition to understanding how EnvZ regulates porin balance and antibiotic influx, these results contribute to answering the long-standing question of how transmembrane communication is performed by bacterial receptors. Our work concludes with a framework that correlates receptor domain composition and signal transduction mechanisms that could be employed by other research groups on their particular receptors of interest.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin modifying enzymes are frequently mutated in cancer, resulting in a cascade of epigenetic deregulation. Recent reports indicate that inactivating mutations in the histone methyltransferase NSD1 define an intrinsic subtype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) that features widespread DNA hypomethylation. Here, we describe a similar DNA hypomethylated subtype of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) that is enriched for both inactivating mutations and deletions in NSD1. The  NSD1 subtype of HNSC and LUSC are highly correlated at the DNA methylation and gene expression levels, with concordant DNA hypomethylation and overexpression of a strongly overlapping set of genes, a subset of which are also hypomethylated in Sotos syndrome, a congenital growth disorder caused by germline NSD1 mutations. Further, the NSD1 subtype of HNSC displays an  immune cold phenotype characterized by low infiltration of tumor-associated leukocytes, particularly macrophages and CD8+ T cells, as well as low expression of genes encoding the immunotherapy target PD-1 immune checkpoint receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Using an in vivo model, we demonstrate that NSD1 inactivation results in a reduction in the degree of T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, implicating NSD1 as a tumor cell-intrinsic driver of an immune cold phenotype. These data have important implications for immunotherapy and reveal a general role of NSD1 in maintaining epigenetic repression.",

    "abstract": "Whether common principles regulate the self-renewing potential of neural stem cells (NSCs) throughout the developing central nervous system is still unclear. In the Drosophila ventral nerve cord and central brain, asymmetrically dividing NSCs, called neuroblasts (NBs), progress through a series of sequentially expressed transcription factors that limits self-renewal by silencing a genetic module involving the transcription factor Chinmo. Here, we find that Chinmo also promotes neuroepithelium growth in the optic lobe during early larval stages by boosting symmetric self-renewing divisions while preventing differentiation. Neuroepithelium differentiation in late larvae requires the transcriptional silencing of chinmo by ecdysone, the main steroid hormone, therefore allowing coordination of NSC self-renewal with organismal growth. In contrast, chinmo silencing in NBs is post-transcriptional and does not require ecdysone. Thus, during Drosophila development, humoral cues or tissue-intrinsic temporal specification programs respectively limit self-renewal in different types of neural progenitors through the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the same transcription factor.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTHere, we demonstrate that the transcription factor chinmo acts as a master gene of NSC self-renewal in the different regions of the developing Drosophila brain where it is controlled by distinct regulatory strategies.",

In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes, using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, LDL cholesterol and Crohns disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene, as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some of which are unlikely to be causal, because they share the same variants as eQTLs. We illustrate that TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization when using expression data from tissues or cell types that are less related to the trait, due to substantial variation in both expression levels and eQTL strengths across cell types. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes at GWAS loci more accurately than simple baselines based on proximity to lead GWAS variant and expression in trait-related tissue. We discuss current strategies and future opportunities for improving the performance of TWAS for causal gene prioritization. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using expression variation across individuals to determine causal genes at GWAS loci and provide guidelines and best practices when using TWAS to prioritize candidate causal genes.",

Here we use Structured-Illumination Microscopy to investigate the dynamic architecture of DSB repair complexes at meiotic recombination sites in relationship to the synaptonemal complex (SC). DSBs resected at both ends are rapidly converted into inter-homolog repair intermediates harboring two populations of BLM helicase and RPA, flanking a single population of MutS{gamma} . These intermediates accumulate until late pachytene, when repair proteins disappear from non-CO sites and CO-designated sites become enveloped by SC-central region proteins, acquire a second MutS{gamma} population, and lose RPA. These and other data suggest that the SC protects CO intermediates from being dismantled inappropriately and promotes step-wise CO maturation by generating a transient CO-specific repair compartment, thereby enabling differential timing and outcome of repair at CO and non-CO sites",

Genetic polymorphisms in molecular pathways involving G protein coupled receptor signalling, the Akt/PI3K cascade, the mitotic cell cycle and immune response have been identified in association with the development of trachomatous scarring, an ocular form of chlamydia-related fibrotic pathology. In this case control study, we performed genome-wide association and pathways based analysis in a sample of 71 Dutch women who attended an STI clinic who were seropositive for Chlamydia trachomatis antibodies and 169 high risk Dutch women who sought similar health services but who were seronegative. We identified two regions of within-gene SNP association with Chlamydia trachomatis serological response and found that GPCR signalling and cell cycle pathways were also associated with the trait. These pathway level associations appear to be common to immunological sequelae of Chlamydial infections in both ocular and urogenital tropisms. These pathways may be central mediators of human refractoriness to chlamydial diseases.",

In Drosophila melanogaster, exposure to parasitoid wasps leads to a decline in egg laying, and exposed females communicate this threat to naive flies, which also depress egg laying. We find that species across the genus Drosophila respond to wasps by egg laying reduction, activate cleaved caspase in oocytes, and communicate the presence of wasps to naive individuals. communication within a species and between closely related species is efficient, while more distantly related species exhibit partial communication. Remarkably, partial communication between some species is enhanced after a cohabitation period that requires exchange of visual and olfactory signals. This interspecies \\\"dialect learning\\\" requires neuronal cAMP signaling in the mushroom body, suggesting neuronal plasticity facilitates dialect learning and memory. These observations establish Drosophila as genetic models for inter-species social communication and evolution of dialects.",

    "abstract": "The sense of smell influences behaviors in animals, yet how odors are represented in the brain remains unclear. The nose contains different types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), each expressing a particular odorant receptor, and OSNs expressing the same receptors converge their axons on a brain region called a glomerulus. In Drosophila, second order neurons (projection neurons) typically innervate a single glomerulus and send stereotyped axonal projections to the lateral horn. One of the greatest challenges to studying olfaction is the lack of methods allowing activation of specific types of olfactory neurons in an ethologically relevant setting. Most odorants activate many olfactory neurons, and many olfactory neurons are activated by a variety of odorants. As such, it is difficult to identify if individual types of olfactory neurons directly influence a behavior. To address this, we developed a genetic method in Drosophila called olfactogenetics in which a narrowly tuned odorant receptor, Or56a, is ectopically expressed in different olfactory neuron types. Stimulation with geosmin (the only known Or56a ligand), in an Or56a mutant background leads to specific activation of only the target olfactory neuron type. We used this approach to identify which types of olfactory neurons can directly guide oviposition decisions. We identified 5 OSN-types (Or71a, Or47b, Or49a, Or67b, and Or7a) that, when activated alone, suppress oviposition. Projection neurons partnering with these OSNs share a region of innervation in the lateral horn, suggesting that oviposition site-selection might be encoded in this brain region.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe sense of smell begins by activation of olfactory neurons in the nose. These neurons express an olfactory receptor that binds odorants (volatile chemicals). How the sense of smell is encoded in the brain remains unclear. A key challenge is due to the nature of olfactory receptors themselves - most respond to a wide range of odorants - so it is often impossible to activate just a single olfactory neuron type. We describe here a novel approach in Drosophila called  olfactogenetics which allows the specific experimental activation of any desired olfactory neuron. We use olfactogenetics to identify olfactory neurons and brain regions that guide egg-laying site selection. Olfactogenetics could be a valuable method to link olfactory neuron activities with circuits and behaviors.",

Three ion-channel data-sets were extracted from literature. Each compound was designated a cardiac risk category based on information within CredibleMeds. The predictive performance of each model within each data-set was assessed via a leave-one-out cross validation. In two of the data-sets Bnet performed equally as well as the leading cardiac model, cardiac safety simulator, both of these outperformed the gold-standard model. In the 3rd data-set, which contained the most detailed ion-channel pharmacology, Bnet outperformed both cardiac models. These results highlight the importance of benchmarking models but also encourage the development of simple models.",

    "abstract": "Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) initiates a broad transcriptional response to proteotoxic stress while also mediating a cancer-specific transcriptional program. HSF1 is thought to be regulated by molecular chaperones, including Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90). HSP90 is proposed to sequester HSF1 in unstressed cells, but visualization of this interaction in vivo requires protein crosslinking. In this report, we show that HSP90 binding to HSF1 depends on HSP90 conformation and is only readily visualized for the ATP-dependent, N-domain dimerized chaperone, a conformation only rarely sampled by mammalian HSP90. We have used this mutationally fixed conformation to map HSP90 binding sites on HSF1. Further, we show that ATP-competitive, N-domain targeted HSP90 inhibitors disrupt this interaction, resulting in the increased duration of HSF1 occupancy of the hsp70 promoter and significant prolongation of both the constitutive and heat-induced HSF1 transcriptional activity. While our data do not support a role for HSP90 in sequestering HSF1 monomers to suppress HSF1 transcriptional activity, our findings do identify a noncanonical role for HSP90 in providing dynamic modulation of HSF1 activity by participating in removal of HSF1 trimers from heat shock elements in DNA, thus terminating the heat shock response.",

Across different environments, however, the hippocampal map seems to be randomized, making it unclear how goal locations might be encoded. To address this question, we trained mice to seek reward at several locations on virtual linear tracks, and optical recordings of calcium activity were made at cellular resolution from two major hippocampal output structures, CA1 and the subiculum. These experiments revealed a population of neurons that were consistently active near reward locations. Their pattern of activity sharply contrasted with simultaneously-recorded place cells and even persisted across environments, when other cells remapped randomly. Their timing was closely correlated with reward anticipation behaviors, yet could not be explained by the behaviors themselves, raising the possibility that reward-associated cell signals were used by mice to identify the reward location.
