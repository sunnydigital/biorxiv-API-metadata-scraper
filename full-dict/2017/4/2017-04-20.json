    "abstract": "Microbial functional diversification is driven by environmental factors, i.e. microorganisms inhabiting the same environmental niche tend to be more functionally similar than those from different environments. In some cases, even closely phylogenetically related microbes differ more across environments than across taxa. While microbial similarities are often reported in terms of taxonomic relationships, no existing databases directly links microbial functions to the environment. We previously developed a method for comparing microbial functional similarities on the basis of proteins translated from the sequenced genomes. Here we describe fusionDB, a novel database that uses our functional data to represent 1,374 taxonomically distinct bacteria annotated with available metadata: habitat/niche, preferred temperature, and oxygen use. Each microbe is encoded as a set of functions represented by its proteome and individual microbes are connected via common functions. Users can search fusionDB via combinations of organism names and metadata. Moreover, the web interface allows mapping new microbial genomes to the functional spectrum of reference bacteria, rendering interactive similarity networks that highlight shared functionality. fusionDB provides a fast means of comparing microbes, identifying potential horizontal gene transfer events, and highlighting key environment-specific functionality.\\n\\nfusionDB is publicly available at http://services.bromberglab.org/fusiondb/.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing speciation in most African malaria vectors gives rise to cryptic populations, which differ remarkably in their behaviour, ecology and capacity to vector malaria parasites. Understanding the population structure and the drivers of genetic differentiation among mosquitoes is critical for effective disease control because heterogeneity within species contribute to variability in malaria cases and allow fractions of vector populations to escape control efforts. To examine the population structure and the potential impacts of recent large-scale control interventions, we have investigated the genomic patterns of differentiation in mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles nili group, a large taxonomic group that diverged [~]3-Myr ago. Using 4343 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we detected strong population structure characterized by high FST values between multiple divergent populations adapted to different habitats within the Central African rainforest. Delineating the cryptic species within the Anopheles nili group is challenging due to incongruence between morphology, ribosomal DNA and SNP markers consistent with incomplete lineage sorting and/or interspecific gene flow. A very high proportion of loci are fixed (FST = 1) within the genome of putative species, which suggests that ecological and/or reproductive barriers are maintained by strong selection on a substantial number of genes.",

    "abstract": "The interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density, i.e. the selection coefficient per base pair, is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared to what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.",

These resources facilitate elucidation of biological processes and support translation of research findings into improved and sustainable agricultural technologies. Many reference genomes for crop plants have been generated over the past decade, but these genomes are often fragmented and missing complex repeat regions. Here, we report the assembly and annotation of maize, a genetic and agricultural model species, using Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing and high-resolution optical mapping. Relative to the previous reference genome, our assembly features a 52-fold increase in contig length and significant improvements in the assembly of intergenic spaces and centromeres. Characterization of the repetitive portion of the genome revealed over 130,000 intact transposable elements (TEs), allowing us to identify TE lineage expansions unique to maize. Gene annotations were updated using 111,000 full-length transcripts obtained by SMRT sequencing. In addition, comparative optical mapping of two other inbreds revealed a prevalence of deletions in the low gene density region and maize lineage-specific genes.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies of multidimensional phenotypes can potentially link genetic variation, gene expression, and physiological data to create multi-scale models of complex traits. Multi-parent populations provide a resource for developing methods to understand these relationships. In this study, we simultaneously modeled body composition, serum biomarkers, and liver transcript abundances from 474 Diversity Outbred mice. This population contained both sexes and two dietary cohorts. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we summarized transcript data into functional modules which we then used as summary phenotypes representing enriched biological processes. These module phenotypes were jointly analyzed with body composition and serum biomarkers in a combined analysis of pleiotropy and epistasis (CAPE), which inferred networks of epistatic interactions between quantitative trait loci that affect one or more traits. This network frequently mapped interactions between alleles of different ancestries, providing evidence of both genetic synergy and redundancy between haplotypes. Furthermore, a number of loci interacted with sex and diet to yield sex-specific genetic effects. We were also able to identify alleles that potentially protect individuals from the effects of a high-fat diet. Although the epistatic interactions explained small amounts of trait variance, the combination of directional interactions, allelic specificity, and high genomic resolution provided context to generate hypotheses for the roles of specific genes in complex traits. Our approach moves beyond the cataloging of single loci to infer genetic networks that map genetic etiology by simultaneously modeling all phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts of aerobic metabolism and contribute to both physiological and pathological conditions as second messengers. ROS are essential for antigen specific activation of T cells, but little is known about what role ROS play in NKT cells. In the current study, we investigated the role of ROS in NKT cell function. We found that ROS levels are similar among CD4, CD8 and NKT cell subsets in the thymus. However, NKT cells, but neither CD4 nor CD8 T cells, showed dramatically increased ROS in the spleen and liver but not in adipose tissues. ROS in the peripheral NKT cells were primarily produced by NADPH oxidases not mitochondria. Accordingly, ROS-high NKT cells were susceptible to oxidative stress and underwent apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, ROS play an important role in regulating the inflammatory function of NKT cells because antioxidant treatment of NKT cells showed reduced frequencies of IFN-{gamma}+ and IL-17+ cells. In line with this, freshly isolated ROS-high NKT cells had more NKT1 and NKT17 cells but less NKT2 than ROS-low cells. These characteristics are regulated by promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) as evidenced by low ROS in NKT cells from PLZF haplodeficient mice and also from adipose tissues that do not express PLZF. Conversely, ROS were highly elevated in CD4 T cells from mice ectopically expressing PLZF. Together, our study revealed for the first time that ROS regulate NKT cell functions through PLZF.",

    "abstract": "Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measure to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial standard deviation of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a variance decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the average variance between adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects, and each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE ANOVA table, which decomposes the total and global variance into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each variance component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variance and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a sampling distribution for squared DVARS (a multiple of D-var) and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computations of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and ANOVA table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.",

    "abstract": "Inter-sample comparisons of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire are crucial for gaining a better understanding into the immunological states determined by different collections of T cells from different donor sites, cell types, and genetic and pathological backgrounds. As a theoretical approach for the quantitative comparison, previous studies utilized the Poisson abundance models and the conventional methods in ecology, which focus on the abundance distribution of observed TCR sequences. However, these methods ignore the details of the measured sequences and are consequently unable to identify sub-repertoires that might have the contributions to the observed inter-sample differences. In this paper, we propose a new comparative approach based on TCR sequence information, which can estimate the low-dimensional structure by projecting the pairwise sequence dissimilarities in high-dimensional sequence space. The inter-sample differences are then quantified according to information-theoretic measures among the distributions of data estimated in the embedded space. Using an actual dataset of TCR sequences in transgenic mice that have strong restrictions on somatic recombination, we demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately identify the inter-sample hierarchical structure, which is consistent with that estimated by previous methods based on abundance or count information. Moreover, we identified the key sequences that contribute to the pairwise sample differences. Such identification of the sequences contributing to variation in immune cell repertoires may provide substantial insight for the development of new immunotherapies and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Zoroastrianism is one of the oldest extant religions in the world, originating in Persia (present-day Iran) during the second millennium BCE. Historical records indicate that migrants from Persia brought Zoroastrianism to India, but there is debate over the timing of these migrations. Here we present novel genome-wide autosomal, Y-chromosome and mitochondrial data from Iranian and Indian Zoroastrians and neighbouring modern-day Indian and Iranian populations to conduct the first genome-wide genetic analysis in these groups. Using powerful haplotype-based techniques, we show that Zoroastrians in Iran and India show increased genetic homogeneity relative to other sampled groups in their respective countries, consistent with their current practices of endogamy. Despite this, we show that Indian Zoroastrians (Parsis) intermixed with local groups sometime after their arrival in India, dating this mixture to 690-1390 CE and providing strong evidence that the migrating group was largely comprised of Zoroastrian males. By exploiting the rich information in DNA from ancient human remains, we also highlight admixture in the ancestors of Iranian Zoroastrians dated to 570 BCE-746 CE, older than admixture seen in any other sampled Iranian group, consistent with a long-standing isolation of Zoroastrians from outside groups. Finally, we report genomic regions showing signatures of positive selection in present-day Zoroastrians that might correlate to the prevalence of particular diseases amongst these communities.",

    "abstract": "It is a truism that antimicrobial drugs select for resistance, but explaining pathogen- and population-specific variation in patterns of resistance remains an open problem. Like other common commensals, Streptococcus pneumoniae has demonstrated persistent coexistence of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. Theoretically, this outcome is unlikely. We modeled the dynamics of competing strains of S. pneumoniae to investigate the impact of transmission dynamics and treatment-induced selective pressures on the probability of stable coexistence. We find that the outcome of competition is extremely sensitive to structure in the host population, although coexistence can arise from age-assortative transmission models with age-varying rates of antibiotic use. Moreover, we find that the selective pressure from antibiotics arises not so much from the rate of antibiotic use per se but from the frequency of treatment: frequent antibiotic therapy disproportionately impacts the fitness of sensitive strains. This same phenomenon explains why serotypes with longer durations of carriage tend to be more resistant. These dynamics may apply to other potentially pathogenic, microbial commensals and highlight how population structure, which is often omitted from models, can have a large impact.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal inversions are an ubiquitous feature of genetic variation. Theoretical models describe several mechanisms by which inversions can drive adaptation and be maintained as polymorphisms. While inversions have been shown previously to be under selection, or contain genetic variation under selection, the specific phenotypic consequences of inversions leading to their maintenance remain unclear. Here we use genomic sequence and expression data from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel to explore the effects of two cosmopolitan inversions, In(2L)t and In(3R)Mo, on patterns of transcriptional variation. We demonstrate that each inversion has a significant effect on transcript abundance for hundreds of genes across the genome. Inversion affected loci (IAL) appear both within inversions as well as on unlinked chromosomes. Importantly, IAL do not appear to be influenced by the previously reported genome-wide expression correlation structure. We found that five genes involved with sterol uptake, four of which are Niemann-Pick Type 2 orthologs, are upregulated in flies with In(3R)Mo but do not have SNPs in LD with the inversion. We speculate that this upregulation is driven by genetic variation in mod(mdg4) that is in LD with In(3R)Mo. We find that there is little evidence for regional or position effect of inversions on gene expression at the chromosomal level but do find evidence for the distal breakpoint of In(3R)Mo interrupting one gene and possibly disassociating the two flanking genes from regulatory elements.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is a parasite protein encoded by a multigene family known as var. Expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells, PfEMP1 plays a central role in parasite virulence. The DBL domain of PfEMP1 contains short sequence motifs termed homology blocks. Variation within homology blocks, at the level of single amino-acid modifications, has not been considered before in association with severe disease. Here we identify a total of 2701 amino-acid polymorphisms within DBL homology blocks, the majority of which are shared between two geographically distant study populations in existing transcription data from Kenya and in a new genomic dataset sampled in Ghana. Parasitemia levels and the transcription levels of specific polymorphisms are as predictive of severe disease (AUC=0.83) and of the degree of rosetting (forecast skill SS=0.45) as the transcription of classic var groups. 11 newly categorized polymorphisms were strongly correlated with grpA var gene expression (SS=0.93) and a different set of 16 polymorphisms was associated with the H3 subset (SS=0.20). These associations provide the basis for a novel method of relating pathophysiology to parasite gene expression levels--one that, being site-specific, has more molecular detail than previous models based on var groups or homology blocks. This newly described variation influences disease outcome, and can help develop anti-malarial intervention strategies such as vaccines that target severe disease. Further replication of this analysis in geographically disparate populations and for larger sample sizes can help improve the identification of the molecular causes of severe disease.",

Injection of CDCs into the hearts of mdx mice augments cardiac function, ambulatory capacity and survival. Exosomes secreted by human CDCs reproduce the benefits of CDCs in mdx mice and in human Duchenne cardiomyocytes.

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular basis of mosquito behavioral complexity is central to the design of novel molecular tool to fight against their vector borne diseases. Although, olfactory system play important role to guide and manage many behavioral co-ordinates including feeding, mating, breeding etc., but the sex specific regulation of olfactory responses remains unanswered. From our ongoing transcriptomic data annotation of blood fed adult female olfactory tissue of A. culicifacies mosquito, we identified a 383 bp long unique transcript encoding Drosophila homolog of Quick-To-Court protein, previously shown to regulate the courtship behavior in adult male Drosophila. A comprehensive in silico analysis predicts Ac-qtc is 1536 bp long single copy gene encoding 511 AA long protein, having high degree of conservation with other insect homolog. Age dependent increased expression of putative Ac-qtc in the naive mosquitoes correlates the maturation of olfactory system, necessary to meet sex specific conflicting demand of mating (mate finding) vs. host-seeking behavioral responses. Though, 16-18 hour of starvation did not altered Ac-qtc expression in both the sexes, however blood feeding significantly modulated its response in the adult female mosquitoes, confirming that it may not be involved in sugar feeding associated behavioural regulation. Finally, a behavioural-cum-molecular assay indicated that natural dysregulation of Ac-qtc in late evening may promotes key mating event of successful insemination process. We hypothesize that Ac-qtc may play unique role to meet and manage the sex specific conflicting demand of mosquito courtship behaviour and/or blood feeding behaviour in the adult female mosquitoes. A molecular mechanism elucidation may provide new knowledge to consider Ac-qtc as a key molecular target for mosquito borne disease management.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric glioblastoma (pedGBM) represent a highly malignant primary brain tumor with recurrent mutations in the chromatin remodeler ATRX and the histone variant H3.3 that is typically associated with a fatal outcome. ATRX acts as suppressor of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway, which is frequently activated in pedGBM. However, telomere features of pedGBMs have not been studied in detail, and ALT-positive model cell lines are lacking. Here, we systematically characterized a panel of pedGBM models that carry a representative set of recurrent genomic mutations for a variety of telomere features. These included the presence of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and C-circles, a specific type of extrachromosomal telomeric repeats, the telomere repeat content, and phosphorylation of histone H3.3 at serine 31. From an integrated analysis of seven pedGBM cell lines and 57 primary tumor samples we identified cell lines and tumors that represent the different telomere maintenance mechanisms and conclude the following: (i) A positive signal in the C-circle assay is a reliable ALT marker. (ii) ALT features occur heterogeneously and one pedGBM subgroup uses a  non-canonical ALT mechanism in the presence of wild-type ATRX. (iii) The spreading of H3.3S31 phosphorylation during mitosis is associated with loss of ATRX but not with ALT per se. (iv) In contrast to a previous study in glioma stem cells, we did not find a hypersensitivity of ALT cells towards the ATR inhibitor VE-821. (v) ALT-positive pedGBMs can be reliably identified from a classification scheme developed here that evaluates various combinations of cytogenetic and/or genomic data. Thus, our findings elucidate further details of the ALT pathway in pedGBMs, provide valuable models for evaluating ALT targeted therapies in a preclinical setting, and introduce an ALT classification scheme for primary tumor samples.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of advanced cancers has benefited from new agents that supplement or bypass conventional therapies. However, even effective therapies fail as cancer cells deploy a wide range of resistance strategies. We propose that evolutionary dynamics ultimately determine survival and proliferation of resistant cells, therefore evolutionary strategies should be used with conventional therapies to delay or prevent resistance. Using an agent-based framework to model spatial competition among sensitive and resistant populations, we apply anti-proliferative drug treatments to varying ratios of sensitive and resistant cells. We compare a continuous maximum tolerated dose schedule with an adaptive schedule aimed at tumor control through competition between sensitive and resistant cells. We find that continuous treatment cures mostly sensitive tumors, but with any resistant cells, recurrence is inevitable. We identify two adaptive strategies that control heterogeneous tumors: dose modulation controls most tumors with less drug, while a more vacation-oriented schedule can control more invasive tumors.",

    "abstract": "Membrane tethering is a fundamental process essential for compartmental specificity of intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Rab-family small GTPases and specific sets of Rab-interacting effector proteins, including coiled-coil tethering proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes, have been reported to be responsible for membrane tethering. However, whether and how these key components directly and specifically tether subcellular membranes still remains enigmatic. Using chemically defined proteoliposomal systems reconstituted with purified human Rab proteins and synthetic liposomal membranes to study the molecular basis of membrane tethering, we established here that Rab-family GTPases have a highly conserved function to directly mediate membrane tethering, even in the absence of any types of Rab effectors such as the so-called tethering proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that membrane tethering mediated by endosomal Rab11a is drastically and selectively stimulated by its cognate Rab effectors, class V myosins (Myo5A and Myo5B), in a GTP-dependent manner. Of note, Myo5A and Myo5B exclusively recognized and cooperated with the membrane-anchored form of their cognate Rab11a to support membrane tethering mediated by trans-Rab assemblies on apposing membranes. Our findings support the novel concept that Rab-family proteins provide a bona fide membrane tether to physically and specifically link two distinct lipid bilayers of subcellular membranes. They further indicate that Rab-interacting effector proteins, including class V myosins, can regulate these Rab-mediated membrane tethering reactions.",

    "abstract": "Vaccination is a potentially useful approach for the control of disease in wildlife populations. The effectiveness of vaccination is contingent in part on obtaining adequate vaccine coverage at the population level. However, measuring vaccine coverage in wild animal populations is challenging and so there is a need to develop robust approaches to estimate coverage and so contribute to understanding the likely efficacy of vaccination.\\n\\nWe used a modified capture mark recapture technique to estimate vaccine coverage in a wild population of European badgers (Meles meles) vaccinated by live-trapping and injecting with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin as part of a bovine tuberculosis control initiative in Wales, United Kingdom. Our approach used genetic matching of vaccinated animals to a sample of the wider population to estimate the percentage of badgers that had been vaccinated. Individual-specific genetic profiles were obtained using microsatellite genotyping of hair samples which were collected both directly from trapped and vaccinated badgers and non-invasively from the wider population using hair traps deployed at badger burrows.\\n\\nWe estimated the percentage of badgers vaccinated in a single year and applied this to a simple model to estimate cumulative vaccine coverage over a four year period, corresponding to the total duration of the vaccination campaign.\\n\\nIn the year of study, we estimated that between 44-65% (95% confidence interval, mean 55%) of the badger population received a vaccine dose. Using the model, we estimated that 70-85% of the total population would have received at least one vaccine dose over the course of the four year vaccination campaign.\\n\\nThis study represents the first application of this novel approach for measuring vaccine coverage in wildlife. This is also the first attempt at quantifying the level of vaccine coverage achieved by trapping and injecting badgers. The results therefore have specific application to bovine tuberculosis control policy, and the approach is of significance to the wider field of wildlife vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Viral populations are complex, dynamic, and fast evolving. The evolution of groups of closely related viruses in a competitive environment is termed quasispecies. To fully understand the role that quasispecies play in viral evolution, characterizing the trajectories of viral genotypes in an evolving population is the key. In particular, long-range haplotype information for thousands of individual viruses is critical; yet generating this information is non-trivial. Popular deep sequencing methods generate relatively short reads that do not preserve linkage information, while third generation sequencing methods have higher error rates that make detection of low frequency mutations a bioinformatics challenge. Here we applied BAsE-Seq, an Illumina-based single-virion sequencing technology, to eight samples from four chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients - once before antiviral treatment and once after viral rebound due to resistance. We obtained 248-8,796 single-virion sequences per sample, which allowed us to find evidence for both hard and soft selective sweeps. We were also able to reconstruct population demographic history that was independently verified by clinically collected data. We further verified four of the samples independently on PacBio and Illumina sequencers. Overall, we showed that single-virion sequencing yields insight into viral evolution and population dynamics in an efficient and high throughput manner. We believe that single-virion sequencing is widely applicable to the study of viral evolution in the context of drug resistance, differentiating between soft or hard selective sweeps, and the reconstruction of intra-host viral population demographic history.",

    "abstract": "Inputs of root carbon (C) fuel growth of nearby soil microorganisms. If these microbes associate with soil minerals, then mineral-microbiome complexes near roots could be a gateway towards stabilization of soil carbon and may influence the quantity and quality of persistent SOM. To investigate the interactions between roots, soil minerals, and microbes, we incubated three types of minerals (ferrihydrite, kaolinite, quartz) and a native soil mineral fraction near roots of a common Californian annual grass, Avena barbata, growing in its resident soil. We followed microbial colonization of these minerals for 2.5 months - the plants lifespan. Bacteria and fungi that colonized mineral surfaces during this experiment differed across mineral types and differed from those in the background soil, implying microbial colonization was the result of processes in addition to passive movement with water to mineral surfaces. Null model analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was a dominant factor structuring mineral-associated microbial communities for all mineral types. Once bacteria arrived at a mineral surface, capacity for rapid growth appeared important, as ribosomal copy number was significantly correlated with relative enrichment on minerals. Glomeromycota (a phylum associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) appeared to preferentially associate with ferrihydrite surfaces. The mechanisms enabling colonization of soil minerals may be foundational to the overall soil microbiome composition and partially responsible for the persistence of C entering soil via plant roots.",

    "abstract": "Food-borne infection with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a major cause of diarrheal illness in humans, and can lead to severe complications such as hemolytic uremic syndrome. Cattle and other ruminants are the main reservoir of EHEC, which enters the food-chain through contaminated meat, dairy, or vegetables. However, how EHEC transitions from the transmission vector to colonizing the intestinal tract, and how virulence-specific genes are regulated during this transition, is not well understood. Here, we describe the establishment of a vertebrate model for food-borne EHEC infection, using the protozoan Paramecium caudatum as a vector and the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a host. At 4 days post fertilization, zebrafish have a fully developed intestinal tract, yet are fully transparent. This allows us to follow intestinal colonization, microbe-host cell interactions, and microbial gene induction within the live host and in real time throughout the infection. Additionally, this model can be adapted to compare food- and water-borne infections, under gnotobiotic conditions or against the backdrop of an endogenous (and variable) host microbiota. Finally, the zebrafish allows for investigation of factors affecting shedding and transmission of bacteria to naive hosts. High-resolution analysis of EHEC gene expression within the zebrafish host emphasizes the need for tight transcriptional regulation of virulence factors for within-host fitness.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEEnterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a food-borne pathogen which can cause diarrhea, vomiting and in some cases, severe complications such as kidney problems in humans. Up to 30% of cattle are colonized with EHEC, which can enter the food-chain through contaminated meat, dairy and vegetables. In order to control infections and stop transmission, it is important to understand what factors allow EHEC to colonize its hosts, cause virulence and aid transmission. Since this cannot be systematically studied in humans, it is important to develop animal models of infection and transmission. We developed a model which allows us to study food-borne infection in zebrafish, a vertebrate host that is transparent and genetically tractable. Using the zebrafish host, we can follow the bacterial infection cycle in real time, and gain important information regarding bacterial physiology and microbe-host interactions. This will allow us to identify potential new targets for infection control and prevention.",

However, the practical performance of the models has not been studied in detail for brain networks. In this work, we have two objectives. First, we compare several sparse graphical model estimation procedures and several selection criteria under various experimental settings, such as different dimensions, sample sizes, types of data, and sparsity levels of the true model structures. We discuss in detail the superiority and deficiency of each combination. Second, in the same simulation study, we show the impact of autocorrelation and whitening on the estimation of functional brain networks. We apply the methods to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data set. Our results show that the best sparse graphical model, in terms of detection of true connections and having few false-positive connections, is the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimating method in combination with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and cross-validation (CV) selection method. In addition, the presence of autocorrelation in the data adversely affects the estimation of networks but can be helped by using the CV selection method. These results question the validity of a number of fMRI studies where inferior graphical model techniques have been used to estimate brain networks.",

In previous human intracranial (iEEG) work (Golan et al., 2016) we found that excitatory broadband high-frequency activity transients, driven by eye blinks, are suppressed in higher-level but not early visual cortex. Here, we utilized the broad anatomical coverage of iEEG recordings in 12 eye-tracked neurosurgical patients to test whether a similar stabilizing mechanism operates following small saccades. We compared saccades (1.3{degrees}-3.7{degrees}) initiated during inspection of large individual visual objects with similarly-sized external stimulus displacements. Early visual cortex sites responded with positive transients to both conditions. In contrast, in both dorsal and ventral higher-level sites the response to saccades (but not to external displacements) was suppressed. These findings indicate that early visual cortex is highly unstable compared to higher-level visual regions which apparently constitute the main target of stabilizing extra-retinal oculomotor influences.",

    "abstract": "Beta frequency oscillations (15-29Hz) are among the most prominent signatures of brain activity. Beta power is predictive of many healthy and abnormal behaviors, including perception, attention and motor action. Recent evidence shows that in non-averaged signals, beta can emerge as transient high-power \\\"events\\\". As such, functionally relevant differences in averaged power across time and trials can reflect accumulated changes in the number, power, duration, and/or frequency span of the events. We show for the first time that functionally relevant differences in averaged prestimulus beta power in human sensory neocortex reflects a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial, i.e., the rate of events. Further, high power beta events close to the time of the stimulus were more likely to impair perception. This result is consistent across detection and attention tasks in human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and is conserved in local field potential (LFP) recordings of mice performing a detection task. Our findings suggest transient brain rhythms are best viewed as a \\\"rate metric\\\" in their impact on function, and provides a new framework for understanding and manipulating functionally relevant rhythmic events.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionTobacco use or abstinence may increase or decrease reward sensitivity. Most existing measures of reward sensitivity were developed decades ago, and few have undergone extensive psychometric testing.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a 58-item survey of the anticipated enjoyment from, wanting for, and frequency of common rewards (the Rewarding Events Inventory - REI). The current analyses focuses on ratings of anticipated enjoyment. The first validation study recruited current and former smokers from internet sites. The second study recruited smokers who wished to quit and monetarily reinforced them to stay abstinent in a laboratory study, and a comparison group of former smokers. In both studies, participants completed the inventory on two occasions, 3-7 days apart. They also completed four anhedonia scales and a behavioral test of reduced reward sensitivity.\\n\\nResultsHalf of the enjoyment ratings loaded on four factors: socializing, active hobbies, passive hobbies, and sex/drug use. Cronbach alpha coefficients were all [&ge;] 0.73 for overall mean and factor scores. Test-retest correlations were all [&ge;] 0.83. Correlations of the overall and factor scores with frequency of rewards, anhedonia scales were 0.19 - 0.53, except for the sex/drugs factor. The scores did not correlate with behavioral tests of reward and did not differ between current and former smokers. Lower overall mean enjoyment score predicted a shorter time to relapse.\\n\\nDiscussionInternal reliability and test-retest reliability of the enjoyment outcomes of the REI are excellent, and construct and predictive validity are modest but promising. The REI is comprehensive and up-to-date, yet is short enough to use on repeated occasions. Replication tests, especially predictive validity tests, are needed.\\n\\nImplicationsBoth use of and abstinence from nicotine appears to increase or decrease how rewarding non-drug rewards are; however, self-report scales to test this have limitations. Our inventory of enjoyment from 58 rewards appears to be reliable and valid as well as comprehensive and up-to-date, yet is short enough to use on repeated occasions. Replication tests, especially of the predictive validity of our scale, are needed.",

    "abstract": "Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animals behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. As a particular target, we applied this framework to C. elegans thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, the fed and starved worms prefer and avoid from the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient, respectively. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both absolute and temporal derivative of temperature and that their strategy comprised mixture of two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). The DM is a strategy that the worms efficiently reach to specific temperature, which explained thermotactic behaviors of the fed worms. The IM is a strategy that the worms track along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking well observed in previous studies. We also showed the neural basis underlying the strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. In contrast to fed animals, the strategy of starved animals indicated that they escaped the cultivation temperature using only absolute, but not temporal derivative of temperature. Thus, our IRL-based approach is capable of identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and will be applicable to wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making of other organisms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding animal decision-making has been a fundamental problem in neuroscience and behavioral ecology. Many studies analyze actions that represent decision-making in behavioral tasks, in which rewards are artificially designed with specific objectives. However, it is impossible to extend this artificially designed experiment to a natural environment, because in a natural environment, the rewards for freely-behaving animals cannot be clearly defined. To this end, we must reverse the current paradigm so that rewards are identified from behavioral data. Here, we propose a new reverse-engineering approach (inverse reinforcement learning) that can estimate a behavioral strategy from time-series data of freely-behaving animals. By applying this technique with thermotaxis in C. elegans, we successfully identified the reward-based behavioral strategy.",

    "abstract": "The neural processing of a visual stimulus can be facilitated by attending to its position or by a co-occurring auditory tone. Using frequency-tagging we investigated whether facilitation by spatial attention and audio-visual synchrony rely on similar neural processes. Participants attended to one of two flickering Gabor patches (14.17 and 17 Hz) located in opposite lower visual fields. Gabor patches further \\\"pulsed\\\" (i.e. showed smooth spatial frequency variations) at distinct rates (3.14 and 3.63 Hz). Frequency-modulating an auditory stimulus at the pulse-rate of one of the visual stimuli established audio-visual synchrony. Flicker and pulsed stimulation elicited stimulus-locked rhythmic electrophysiological brain responses that allowed tracking the neural processing of simultaneously presented stimuli. These steady-state responses (SSRs) were quantified in the spectral domain to examine visual stimulus processing under conditions of synchronous vs. asynchronous tone presentation and when respective stimulus positions were attended vs. unattended. Strikingly, unique patterns of effects on pulse- and flicker driven SSRs indicated that spatial attention and audiovisual synchrony facilitated early visual processing in parallel and via different cortical processes. We found attention effects to resemble the classical top-down gain effect facilitating both, flicker and pulse-driven SSRs. Audio-visual synchrony, in turn, only amplified synchrony-producing stimulus aspects (i.e. pulse-driven SSRs) possibly highlighting the role of temporally co-occurring sights and sounds in bottom-up multisensory integration.",

    "abstract": "How motile, free unicellular organisms maximize the rate at which they encounter resources and develop optimal search strategies remains largely unknown. In fact, cell foraging is a very complex activity in which unicellular organisms integrate a diversity of external cues and develop efficient systemic movements to localize nourishment. These foraging strategies are critical when cells face conditions of scarce resources or they dont possess information on where food is located. Here, in order to determine whether nuclear activity is directly involved in cell migration, we placed single, well-isolated, enucleated and non-enucleated starved Amoeba proteus on nutrient-free petri dishes, and we then analyzed their trajectories of movement using non-linear dynamic tools. We found that despite being enucleated, the systemic responses of the protoplasm exhibited typical biological behaviors, moving with apparent normality, creeping along the substrate, developing pseudopodia and gobbling up prey. Our quantitative studies show that both the non-enucleated and enucleated amoebas display a similar migration structure, characterized by super-diffusivity, non-trivial long-term correlations and move-step fluctuations with scale invariant properties. In conclusion, the nuclear activity does not seem to directly control the systemic cellular movements involved in locating sparse resources.",

However until recently nanopore sequencing has been mainly applied to small genomes, due to the limited output attainable. We present nanopore sequencing and assembly of the GM12878 Utah/Ceph human reference genome generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION and R9.4 version chemistry. We generated 91.2 Gb of sequence data ([~]30x theoretical coverage) from 39 flowcells. De novo assembly yielded a highly complete and contiguous assembly (NG50 [~]3Mb). We observed considerable variability in homopolymeric tract resolution between different basecallers. The data permitted sensitive detection of both large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. Further we developed a new approach exploiting the long-read capability of this system and found that adding an additional 5x-coverage of  ultra-long reads (read N50 of 99.7kb) more than doubled the assembly contiguity. Modelling the repeat structure of the human genome predicts extraordinarily contiguous assemblies may be possible using nanopore reads alone.

Considering the necessity to mitigate the cases ZIKV-associated diseases, antiviral interventions against this virus are an urgent necessity. Sofosbuvir, a drug in clinical use against Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), is among the FDA-approved substances endowed with anti-ZIKV activity. In this work, we further investigated the in vivo activity of sofosbuvir against ZIKV. Neonatal Swiss mice were infected with ZIKV (2 x 107 PFU) and treated with sofosbuvir at 20 mg/kg/day, a concentration compatible with pre-clinical development of this drug. We found that sofosbuvir reduced acute levels of ZIKV from 60 to 90 % in different anatomical compartments, such as in blood plasma, spleen, kidney and brain. Early treatment with sofosbuvir doubled the percentage and time of survival of ZIKV-infected animals, despite the aggressive virus challenge assayed and also prevented the acute neuromotor impairment triggered by the virus. On the long-term behavior analysis of ZIKV-associated sequelae, sofosbuvir prevented loss of hippocampal- and amygdala-dependent memory. Our results point out that sofosbuvir inhibits ZIKV replication in vivo, which is consistent with the prospective necessity of antiviral drugs to treat ZIKV-infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "MEG reflects electrical activity of neuronal assemblies that coalesce and decoalesce in time providing for massively parallel and dynamic flow of information exchange in the brain. There is a growing evidence that our behavior is mediated by simultaneous activity of several interacting and simultaneously active cortical networks. Not only the location of network nodes but also the temporal profiles of such interaction are of interest. The existing methods are primarily concerned with proposing novel measures of synchrony to be applied to the cortical region activity signals extracted from the MEG data using beamforming or other spatial filtering approaches.\\n\\nIn this work we propose to render the task of estimating network topology and temporal profiles as a source estimation problem but in the space of interacting topographies. The proposed point of view has a number of benefits as it allows to use the wealth of techniques and intuition accumulated in the community when dealing with source estimation problems. Operating in the interacting topographies space we first propose subspace projection method to significantly reduce the spatial leakage effect in the cross-spectral matrix. We then use subspace matching metrics to extract a set of networks with their synchronicity profiles that explain the variance in the sensor space cross-spectral matrix, much like regular dipoles and their activations explain the variance in the regular evoked responses.\\n\\nThe preliminary results of application of this method to a simple self-paced voluntary finger movement paradigm comparing allowed to observe functional coupling between primary motor and supplementary motor area and establish that this coupling can be characterized with near-zero phase delay between the oscillatory activity of these two regions. This observed synchrony pattern is physiologically plausible and is in agreement with the current hypothesis about the neural mechanics of the motor acts.",

    "abstract": "Most people tend to bisect horizontal lines slightly to the left of their true center (pseudoneglect), and start visual search from left-sided items. This physiological leftward spatial bias may depend on hemispheric asymmetries in the organization of attentional networks, but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here we modeled relevant aspects of the ventral and dorsal attentional networks (VAN and DAN) of the human brain. First, we demonstrated pseudoneglect in visual search in 101 right-handed psychology students. Participants consistently tended to start the task from a left-sided item, thus showing pseudoneglect. Second, we trained populations of simulated neurorobots to perform a similar task, by using a genetic algorithm. The neurorobots behavior was controlled by artificial neural networks, which simulated the human VAN and DAN in the two brain hemispheres. Neurorobots differed in the connectional constraints that were applied to the anatomy and function of the attention networks. Results indicated that (1) neurorobots provided with a biologically plausible hemispheric asymmetry of the VAN-DAN connections, as well as with inter-hemispheric inhibition, displayed the best match with human data; however, (2) anatomical asymmetry per se was not sufficient to generate pseudoneglect; in addition, the VAN must have an excitatory influence on the ipsilateral DAN; (3) neurorobots provided with bilateral competence in the VAN but without inter-hemispheric inhibition failed to display pseudoneglect. These findings provide a proof of concept of the causal link between connectional asymmetries and pseudoneglect, and specify important biological constraints that result in physiological asymmetries of human behavior.\\n\\nSignificance statementMost of us start our exploration of the environment from the left side. Here we demonstrated this tendency in undergraduate students, and trained artificial agents (neurorobots) to perform a similar visual search task. The neurorobots behavior was controlled by artificial neural networks, inspired by the human fronto-parietal attentional system. In seven distinct populations of neurorobots, different constraints were applied on the network connections within and between the brain hemispheres. Only one of the artificial populations behaved in a similar way to the human participants. The connectional constraints applied to this population included known characteristics of the human fronto-parietal networks, but had also additional properties not previously described. Thus, our findings specify biological constraints that induce physiological asymmetries of human behavior.",

    "abstract": "Living systems control cell growth dynamically by processing information from their environment. Although responses to one environmental change have been intensively studied, little is known about how cells react to fluctuating conditions. Here we address this question at the genomic scale by measuring the relative proliferation rate (fitness) of 3,568 yeast gene deletion mutants in out-of-equilibrium conditions: periodic oscillations between two salinity conditions. Fitness and its genetic variance largely depended on the stress period. Surprisingly, dozens of mutants displayed pronounced hyperproliferation at short periods, identifying unexpected controllers of growth under fast dynamics. We validated the implication of the high-affinity cAMP phosphodiesterase and of a regulator of protein translocation to mitochondria in this control. The results illustrate how natural selection acts on mutations in a fluctuating environment, highlighting unsuspected genetic vulnerabilities to periodic stress in molecular processes that are conserved across all eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "There is widespread interest in finding therapeutic vulnerabilities by analyzing the somatic mutations in cancers. Most analyses have focused on identifying driver oncogenes mutated in patient tumors, but this approach is incapable of discovering genes essential for tumor growth yet not activated through mutation. We show that such genes can be systematically discovered by mining cancer sequencing data for evidence of purifying selection. We show that purifying selection reduces substitution rates in coding regions of cancer genomes, depleting up to 90% of mutations for some genes. Moreover, mutations resulting in non-conservative amino acid substitutions are under strong negative selection in tumors, whereas conservative substitutions are more tolerated. Genes under purifying selection include members of the EGFR and FGFR pathways in lung adenocarcinomas, and DNA repair pathways in melanomas. A systematic assessment of purifying selection in tumors would identify hundreds of tumor-specific enablers and thus novel targets for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental studies suggest that, in cortical microcircuits of the mammalian brain, the majority of neuron-to-neuron connections are realized by multiple synapses. However, it is not known whether such redundant synaptic connections provide any functional benefit. Here, we show that redundant synaptic connections enable near-optimal learning in cooperation with synaptic rewiring. By constructing a simple dendritic neuron model, we demonstrate that with multisynaptic connections, synaptic plasticity approximates a sample-based Bayesian filtering algorithm known as particle filtering, and wiring plasticity implements its resampling process. The derived synaptic plasticity rule accounts for many experimental observations, including the dendritic position dependence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity. The proposed framework is applicable to detailed single neuron models, and also to recurrent circuit models. Our study provides a novel conceptual framework for synaptic plasticity and rewiring.",

    "abstract": "The phytohormone auxin is involved in almost all developmental processes in land plants. Most, if not all, of these processes are mediated by changes in gene expression. Auxin acts on gene expression through a short nuclear pathway that converges upon the activation of a family of DNA-binding transcription factors. These AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARFs) are thus the effector of auxin response and translate the chemical signal to the regulation of a defined set of genes. Given the limited number of dedicated components in auxin signaling, distinct properties among the ARF family likely contributes to the establishment of multiple unique auxin responses in plant development. In the two decades following the identification of the first ARF in Arabidopsis much has been learnt about how these transcription factors act, and how they generate unique auxin responses. Progress in genetics, biochemistry, genomics and structural biology have helped to develop mechanistic models for ARF action. However, despite intensive efforts, many central questions are yet to be addressed. In this review we highlight what has been learnt about ARF transcription factors, and identify outstanding questions and challenges for the near future.",

    "abstract": "Cortical slow waves - the hallmark of NREM sleep - reflect near-synchronous OFF periods in cortical neurons. However, the mechanisms triggering such OFF periods are unclear, as there is little evidence for somatic inhibition. We studied cortical inhibitory interneurons that express somatostatin (SOM), because [~]70% of them are Martinotti cells that target diffusely layer 1 and can block excitatory transmission presynaptically, at glutamatergic terminals, and postsynaptically, at apical dendrites, without inhibiting the soma. In freely moving mice, we show that SOM+ cells can fire immediately before slow waves and their optogenetic stimulation triggers neuronal OFF periods during sleep. Next, we show that chemogenetic activation of SOM+ cells increases slow wave activity (SWA), the slope of individual slow waves, and the duration of NREM sleep; whereas their chemogenetic inhibition decreases SWA and slow wave incidence without changing time spent asleep. By contrast, activation of parvalbumin+ (PV+) cells, the most numerous population of cortical inhibitory neurons, greatly decreases SWA and cortical firing. These results indicate that SOM+ cells, but not PV+ cells, are involved in the generation of sleep slow waves. Whether Martinotti cells are solely responsible for this effect, or are complemented by other classes of inhibitory neurons, remains to be investigated.",
