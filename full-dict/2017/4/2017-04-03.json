    "abstract": "AbstractThe 3D organization of the genome changes concomitantly with expression changes during hematopoiesis and immune activation. However, studies of this phenomenon have focused either on lamina-associated domains (LADs) or on topologically-associated domains (TADs), defined by preferential local chromatin interactions, and chromosome compartments, defined as higher-order interactions between TADs in functionally similar states. However, few studies have investigated how these affect one another. To address this, we mapped LADs using Lamin B1-DamID during Jurkat T-cell activation, finding significant genome re-organization at the nuclear periphery dominated by release of loci frequently important for T-cell function. To assess how these changes at the nuclear periphery influence wider genome organization, our DamID datasets were contrasted with TAD contact domains and compartments identified with high resolution in the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line. Features of specific repositioning events were then tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization. First, considerable overlap between TAD contact domains and LADs was observed and we found that the TAD repositioned as a unit during T-cell activation. Second, sub-compartments of the A compartment, termed A1 and A2, are segregated in 3D space through differences in proximity to LADs along chromosomes. Third, genes and a putative enhancer that occurred in LADs that were released from the periphery during T-cell activation tended to become associated particularly with A2 sub-compartments and were thus constrained to the relative proximity of the lamina. Thus, lamina-associations clearly influence internal nuclear organization while changes in LADs during T-cell activation may provide an important additional mode of gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the behavioral and psychological mechanisms underlying social behaviors is one of the major goals of social evolutionary theory. In particular, a persistent question about animal cooperation is to what extent it is supported by other-regarding preferences. In many situations, animals adjust their behaviors through learning by responding to the rewards they experience as a consequence of their actions. Therefore, we may ask whether learning in social situations can be driven by evolved prosocial rewards. Here we develop a mathematical model in order to ask whether the mere act of cooperating with a social partner will evolve to be inherently rewarding. Individuals interact repeatedly in pairs and adjust their behaviors through reinforcement learning. We assume that individuals associate to each game outcome an internal reward value. These perceived rewards are genetically evolving traits. We find that conditionally cooperative rewards that value mutual cooperation positively but the suckers outcome negatively tend to be evolutionarily stable. Purely other-regarding rewards can evolve only under special parameter combinations. On the other hand, selfish rewards that always learn pure defection are also evolutionary successful. These findings are consistent with empirical observations showing that humans tend to show conditionally cooperative behavior, and also exhibit diversity of preferences. Our model also demonstrates the need to further integrate multiple levels of biological causation of behavior.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has hinted at the linkage disequilibrium (LD) dependent architecture of human complex traits, where SNPs with low levels of LD (LLD) have larger per-SNP heritability after conditioning on their minor allele frequency (MAF). However, this has not been formally assessed, quantified or biologically interpreted. Here, we analyzed summary statistics from 56 complex diseases and traits (average N = 101,401) by extending stratified LD score regression to continuous annotations. We determined that SNPs with low LLD have significantly larger per-SNP heritability. Roughly half of the LLD signal can be explained by functional annotations that are negatively correlated with LLD, such as DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS). The remaining signal is largely driven by our finding that common variants that are more recent tend to have lower LLD and to explain more heritability (P = 2.38 x 10-104); the youngest 20% of common SNPs explain 3.9x more heritability than the oldest 20%, consistent with the action of negative selection. We also inferred jointly significant effects of other LD-related annotations and confirmed via forward simulations that these annotations jointly predict deleterious effects. Our results are consistent with the action of negative selection on deleterious variants that affect complex traits, complementing efforts to learn about negative selection by analyzing much smaller rare variant data sets.",

    "abstract": "Genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yet to be fully elucidated. Somatic mosaic mutations (SMMs) have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and overgrowth syndromes. Here, we systematically evaluate SMMs by leveraging whole-exome sequencing (WES) data on a large family-based ASD cohort, the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). We find evidence that ~10% of previously published de novo mutations are potentially SMMs. When using a custom somatic calling pipeline, we recalled all SSC WES data. We validated high and low confidence mutation predictions for a subset of families with single molecule molecular inversion probes. With these validation data, we iteratively developed a high confidence calling approach integrating logistic regression modeling and additional heuristics and applied it to the full cohort. Surprisingly, we found evidence of significant synonymous SMM burden in probands, with mutations more likely to be close to splicing sites. Overall, we observe no strong evidence of missense SMM burden. However, we do observe nominally significant signal for missense SMMs in those families without germline mutations, which strengthens specifically in genes intolerant to mutations. In contrast to missense germline mutations, missense SMMs show potential enrichment for chromatin modifiers. We observe 7-10% of parental mosaics are transmitted germline to a child as occult de novo mutations, which has important implications for recurrence risk for families and potential subclinical ASD features. Finally, we find SMMs in previously implicated high-confidence ASD risk genes, including CHD2, CTNNB1, KMT2C, SYNGAP1, and RELN, further suggesting that this class of mutations contribute to population risk.",

The mode of repression can be through target cleavage, RNA destabilization and/or decreased translational efficiency. Here, we provide a comprehensive global analysis of the evolutionarily distant unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to quantify the effects of miRNA on protein synthesis and RNA abundance. We show that, similar to metazoan systems, miRNAs in Chlamydomonas regulate gene-expression primarily by destabilizing mRNAs. However, unlike metazoan miRNA where target site utilization localizes mainly to 3UTRs, in Chlamydomonas utilized target sites lie predominantly within coding regions. These results demonstrate that destabilization of mRNA is the main evolutionarily conserved mode of action for miRNAs, but details of the mechanism diverge between plant and metazoan kingdoms.",

    "abstract": "We outline what we believe could be an improvement in future discussions of the brain acting as a Bayesian-Laplacian system. We do so by distinguishing between two broad classes of priors on which the brains inferential systems operate: in one category are biological priors ({beta} priors) and in the other artifactual ones ( priors). We argue that {beta} priors, of which colour categories and faces are good examples, are inherited or acquired very rapidly after birth, are highly or relatively resistant to change through experience, and are common to all humans. The consequence is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal assent and agreement is high. By contrast,  priors, of which man-made objects are examples, are acquired post-natally and modified at various stages throughout post-natal life; they are much more accommodating of, and hospitable to, new experiences. Consequently, posteriors generated from them are less likely to find universal assent. Taken together, in addition to the more limited capacity of experiment and experience to alter the {beta} priors compared to  priors, another cardinal distinction between the two is that the probability of posteriors generated from {beta} priors having universal agreement is greater than that for  priors. The two categories are not, however, always totally distinct and can merge into one another to varying extents, resulting in posteriors that draw upon both categories.",

    "abstract": "The formation of mammalian chromatin domains was investigated by analyzing the domain/isochore connection. This showed that LADs correspond to GC-poor isochores and are compositionally flat, flexible chromatin structures because of the local nucleosome depletions associated with the presence of oligo-As. In contrast, TADs correspond to GC-rich isochores that consist of single or (much more frequently) multiple, GC peaks that shape the single or multiple, loops of TADs. Indeed, the increasing nucleosome depletions linked to the GC gradients of isochore peaks lead to an increasing chromatin flexibility (accompanied by an increasing accessibility and decreasing supercoiling). In conclusion, isochores not only encode but also mold chromatin architecture; while architectural proteins play a role in closing and insulating TAD loops. An extension of this model concerns the encoding of open and closed chromosome compartments by alternating GC-rich and GC-poor isochores, the interactions among compartments defining the 3-D chromosome folding.",

    "abstract": "A gradual buildup of electrical potential over motor areas precedes self-initiated movements. Recently, such \\\"readiness potentials\\\" (RPs) were attributed to stochastic fluctuations in neural activity. We developed a new experimental paradigm that operationalised self-initiated actions as endogenous  skip responses while waiting for target stimuli in a perceptual decision task. We compared these to a block of trials where participants could not choose when to skip, but were instead instructed to skip. Frequency and timing of motor action were therefore balanced across blocks, so that conditions differed only in how the timing of skip decisions was generated. We reasoned that across-trial variability of EEG could carry as much information about the source of skip decisions as the mean RP. EEG variability decreased more markedly prior to self-initiated compared to externally-triggered skip actions. This convergence suggests a consistent preparatory process prior to self-initiated action. A leaky stochastic accumulator model could reproduce this convergence given the additional assumption of a systematic decrease in input noise prior to self-initiated actions. Our results may provide a novel neurophysiological perspective on the topical debate regarding whether self-initiated actions arise from a deterministic neurocognitive process, or from neural stochasticity. We suggest that the key precursor of self-initiated action may manifest as a reduction in neural noise.",

    "abstract": "How do large-scale brain networks reorganize during the waxing and waning of anxious anticipation? Here, threat was dynamically modulated during functional MRI as two circles slowly meandered on the screen; if they touched, an unpleasant shock was delivered. We employed intersubject network analysis, which allows the investigation of network-level properties \\\"across brains,\\\" and sought to determine how network properties changed during periods of approach (circles moving closer) and periods of retreat (circles moving apart). Dynamic threat altered network cohesion across the salience, executive, and task-negative networks, as well as subcortical regions. Functional connections between subcortical regions and the salience network also increased during approach vs. retreat, including the putative periaqueductal gray, habenula, and amygdala, showing that the latter is involved under conditions of relatively prolonged and uncertain threat (the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis was observed during both approach and retreat). Together, our findings unraveled dynamic properties of large-scale networks across participants while threat levels varied continuously, and demonstrate the potential of characterizing emotional processing at the level of distributed networks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the brain basis of anxious anticipation is important not only from a basic research perspective, but because aberrant responding to uncertain future negative events is believed to be central to anxiety disorders. Although previous studies have investigated how brain responses are sensitive to threat proximity, little is known about how patterns of response co-activation change during dynamic manipulations of threat. To address these important gaps in the literature, we studied the dynamics of emotional processing at the level of large-scale brain networks by devising a manipulation in which threat was dynamically modulated during functional MRI scanning.",

Genes that are intolerant to inactivating variants in the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC) were depleted for SVs in parents, specifically within fetal-brain promoters, UTRs and exons. Rare paternally-inherited SVs that disrupt promoters or UTRs were over-transmitted to probands (P = 0.0013) and not to their typically-developing siblings. Recurrent functional noncoding deletions implicate the gene LEO1 in ASD. Protein-coding SVs were also associated with ASD (P = 0.0025).

Here, we show that dynamics in genomic DNA methylation (gDNA) levels regulate dormancy-growth cycle in poplar. We proved that the reactivation of cell division in the apical shoot that lead bud break process in spring, is preceded by a progressive reduction of gDNA methylation in apex tissue. We also identified that the induction in apex tissue of a chilling-dependent poplar DEMETER-LIKE 10 (PtaDML10) DNA demethylase precedes shoot growth reactivation. Transgenic poplars showing down-regulation of PtaDML8/10 caused delayed bud break.

    "abstract": "For monoclonal antibodies, mathematical models of target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) are often fit to data in order to estimate key physiological parameters of the system. These parameter estimates can then be used to support drug development by assisting with the assessment of whether the target is druggable and what the first in human dose should be. The TMDD model is almost always over-parameterized given the available data, resulting in the practical unidentifiability of some of the model parameters, including the target receptor density. In particular, when only PK data is available, the receptor density is almost always practically unidentifiable. However, because practical identifiability is not regularly assessed, incorrect interpretation of model fits to the data can be made. This issue is illustrated using two case studies from the literature.",

We hypothesised that co-expression network will help predict functional orthologs amongst complex homologous gene families. To explore the use of transcriptomic data available in public domain to identify functionally equivalent ones from all predicted orthologs, we collected genome wide expression data in mouse and rat liver from over 1500 experiments with varied treatments. We used a hyper-graph clustering method to identify clusters of orthologous genes co-expressed in both mouse and rat. We validated these clusters by analysing expression profiles in each species separately, and demonstrating a high overlap. We then focused on genes in 18 homology groups with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships between two species, to discriminate between functionally equivalent and non-equivalent orthologs. Finally, we further applied our method by collecting heart transcriptomic data (over 1400 experiments) in rat and mouse to validate the method in an independent tissue.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix regulate central and peripheral neuronal functions. We thus investigated the CaV channels in hippocampal and trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons cultured on substrates with different stiffness. Patch-clamp current recordings showed that stiff substrate augmented the CaV channel currents in hippocampal and TG neurons and additionally induced a leftward shift in the voltage-dependent channel activation curve in small TG neurons. Combination with using selective channel blockers revealed that substrate stiffness preferentially regulated the N-type channel current in hippocampal and medium TG neurons but the T-type channel current in small TG neurons. Current-clamp recordings further demonstrated that stiff substrate enhanced the excitability of small TG neurons, which was ablated by blocking the T-type channel. Treatment of neurons on the stiff substrate with low-dose blebbistatin reduced both the N-type channel current in hippocampal and medium TG neurons and the T-type channel current in small TG neurons to the levels in neurons on the soft substrate, whereas treatment of neurons on the soft substrate with calcium A increased both the N-type channel current in hippocampal and medium TG neurons and the T-type channel current in small TG neurons to the levels in neurons on the stiff substrate, thus consistently supporting critical involvement of actomyosin in mechanical sensing. Taken together, our results reveal neuron type-specific mechanical regulation of the Cav channels and excitability in the nervous system.

    "abstract": "The thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), one of Australias most characteristic megafauna, was the largest marsupial carnivore until hunting, and potentially disease, drove them to extinction in 1936. Current knowledge suggests that thylacines became extinct on mainland Australia two millennia prior to their extirpation on Tasmania, but recent \\\"plausible\\\" sightings on the Cape York Peninsula have emerged, leading some to speculate the species may persist, undetected. Here we show that the continued survival of the thylacine is entirely implausible based on most current mathematical theories of extinction. We present a dataset including physical evidence, expert-validated sightings, and unconfirmed sightings leading up to the present day, and use a Bayesian framework that takes all three types of data into account by modelling them as independent processes, to evaluate the likelihood of the thylacines persistence. Although the last captive thylacine died in 1936, our model suggests the most likely extinction date would be 1940, or at the latest the 1950s. We validated this result by using other extinction estimator methods, all of which confirmed that the thylacines extinction likely fell between 1936 and 1943; even the most optimistic scenario suggests the species did not persist beyond 1956. The search for the thylacine, much like similar efforts to \\\"rediscover\\\" other recently extinct charismatic species, is likely to be fruitless, especially given that persistence on Tasmania would have been no guarantee the species could reappear in regions that had been unoccupied for millennia. The search for the thylacine may become a rallying point for conservation and wildlife biology, and could indirectly help fund and support critical research in understudied areas like Cape York. However, our results suggest that attempts to rediscover the thylacine will likely be unsuccessful.",

    "abstract": "Sequence alignment lies at the heart of many evolutionary and comparative genomics studies. However, the optimal alignment of multiple sequences is NP-hard, so that exact algorithms become impractical for more than a few sequences. Thus, state of the art alignment methods employ progressive heuristics, breaking the problem into a series of pairwise alignments guided by a phylogenetic tree. Changes between homologous characters are typically modelled by a continuous-time Markov substitution model. In contrast, the dynamics of insertions and deletions (indels) are not modelled explicitly, because the computation of the marginal likelihood under such models has exponential time complexity in the number of taxa. Recently, Bouchard-Cote and Jordan [PNAS (2012) 110(4):1160-1166] have introduced a modification to a classical indel model, describing indel evolution on a phylogenetic tree as a Poisson process. The model termed PIP allows to compute the joint marginal probability of a multiple sequence alignment and a tree in linear time. Here, we present an new dynamic programming algorithm to align two multiple sequence alignments by maximum likelihood in polynomial time under PIP, and apply it a in progressive algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first progressive alignment method using a rigorous mathematical formulation of an evolutionary indel process and with polynomial time complexity.",

    "abstract": "A statistical thermodynamics approach to the temporal development of biological regulation provides a phenomenological description of the dynamical behavior of genome expression in terms of autonomous self-organization with a critical transition (Self-Organized Criticality: SOC). In early mouse embryo development, the dynamical change in the self-organization of overall expression determines how and when reprogramming of the genome-expression state occurs. Reprogramming occurs via a transition state (climbing over an epigenetic landscape), where the critical-regulation pattern of the zygote state disappears. A critical transition is well captured in terms of the bimodality of expression ensembles, which reflects distinct thermodynamic states (critical states). These critical states exhibit a genome avalanche pattern: competition between order (scaling) and disorder (divergence) around a critical point. The genome avalanche in mouse embryo development, which is committed to erase a previous ordered state, reveals that the direction of early embryo single-cell development traverses the same steps as in differentiation, but in the opposite order of self-organization.",

T-cells can also recognize bacterial lipid antigens that bind the relatively non-polymorphic CD1 family of proteins. However, genetic variation in human CD1 genes and TCR diversity expressed by CD1-restricted T-cells have not been quantitatively determined. Here, we show that CD1B is nearly nucleotide-identical across all five continental ancestry groups, providing evidence for purifying selection during human evolution. We used CD1B tetramers loaded with a mycobacterial glycolipid antigen to isolate T-cells from four genetically unrelated South African adults and cataloged thousands of TCRs from in-vitro expanded T-cells using immunosequencing. We identified highly conserved motifs that were co-expressed as a functional heterodimer and significantly enriched among tetramer-positive T-cells sorted directly from peripheral blood. Finally, we show that frequencies of these TCR motifs are increased in the blood of patients with active tuberculosis compared to uninfected controls, a finding that is confirmed by ex-vivo frequencies of tetramer-positive T-cells determined by flow cytometry. These data provide a framework for unbiased definition of TCRs targeting lipid antigens, which can be tested for clinical associations independently of host genetic background.\\n\\nBrief SummaryWe used human genetics and immunosequencing to define a shared T-cell receptor motif that is specific for a mycobacterial lipid antigen and associated with tuberculosis independently of host genetic background.",

    "abstract": "Measuring functional connectivity between cortical regions of the human brain has become an important area of research. Modern theory suggests that brain networks exhibit non-stationarity, constantly forming and reforming depending on task demands. A robust means of determining effective connectivity in the short-lived neural responses that occur in event related paradigms would allow the investigation of event related cortico-cortical dynamics. We present such a mathematical model of wave propagation, motivated by current neuroscience literature, and demonstrate the utility of the method in a clinical sample of schizophrenia patients. MEG data were acquired in 10 patients with schizophrenia and 12 healthy controls during a relevance modulation task. Data were filtered into the theta band (4-8Hz) and source localised using a beamformer. The model was implemented using Fourier analysis methods which uncovered an event related travelling wave moving from the visual to frontal cortices. The model was validated using Monte Carlo phase randomisation and compared with another plausible model of wave propagation in the cortex. Results from the clinical sample revealed that wave speed was modulated by task condition and patients were found to have less difference between conditions (ANOVA revealing a significant interaction between group and condition, p<0.05). In conclusion, our method provides a simple and robust means to investigate event related cortico-cortical brain dynamics in individuals and groups in the task positive state.",

    "abstract": "Serotonergic transmission affects behaviours and neuro-physiological functions via the orchestrated recruitment of distributed neural systems. It is however unclear whether serotonins modulatory effect entails a global regulation of brainwide neural activity, or is relayed and encoded by a set of primary functional substrates. Here we combine DREADD-based chemogenetics and mouse fMRI, an approach we term \\\"chemo-fMRI\\\", to causally probe the brainwide substrates modulated by phasic serotonergic activity. We describe the generation of a conditional knock-in mouse line that, crossed with serotonin-specific Cre-recombinase mice, allowed us to remotely stimulate serotonergic neurons during fMRI scans. We show that chemogenetic stimulation of the serotonin system does not affect global brain activity, but results in region-specific activation of a set of primary target regions encompassing parieto-cortical, hippocampal, and midbrain structures, as well as ventro-striatal components of the mesolimbic reward systems. Many of the activated regions also exhibit increased c-Fos immunostaining upon chemogenetic stimulation in freely-behaving mice, corroborating a neural origin for the observed functional signals. These results identify a set of regional substrates that act as primary functional targets of endogenous serotonergic stimulation, and establish causation between phasic activation of serotonergic neurons and regional fMRI signals. They further highlight a functional cross-talk between serotonin and mesolimbic dopamine systems hence providing a novel framework for understanding serotonin dependent functions and interpreting data obtained from human fMRI studies of serotonin modulating agents.",

    "abstract": "Structured abstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSInitiation of re-entrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) involves complex interactions between activation (AT) and repolarization times (RT). The re-entry vulnerability index (RVI) is a recently proposed activation-repolarization metric designed to quantify tissue susceptibility to re-entry.\\n\\nObjectivesThe study aimed to test the feasibility of an RVI-based algorithm to predict the exit site of VT and occurrence of clinical events.\\n\\nMethodsPatients with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) (n=11), Brugada Syndrome (BrS) (n=13) and focal RV outflow tract VT (n=9) underwent programmed stimulation with unipolar electrograms recorded from a non-contact array. The distance between region of lowest RVI and site of VT breakout (Dmin), and global minimum RVI (RVIG) were computed to assess prediction of site of VT breakout and occurrence of clinical events, respectively.\\n\\nResultsLowest values of RVI, representing sites of highest susceptibility to re-entry, co-localised with site of VT breakout in ARVC/BrS but not in focal VT and Dmin values were lower in ARVC/BrS. ARVC/BrS patients with inducible VT had lower RVIG than those who were non-inducible or those with focal VT. Patients were followed up for 112 {+/-} 19 months; those with clinical VT events had lower RVIg than those without VT or those with focal VT.\\n\\nConclusionsThe proposed methodology based on RVI localises the origin of re-entrant but not focal ventricular arrhythmias and predicts clinical events. This index could be applied to target ablation for arrhythmias which are difficult to induce or are haemodynamically unstable and also risk stratify patients for ICD prophylaxis.\\n\\nAbbreviations list",

    "abstract": "During in vitro differentiation, pluripotent stem cells undergo extensive remodeling of their gene expression profile. While studied extensively at the transcriptome level, much less is known about protein dynamics. Here, we measured mRNA and protein levels of 7459 genes during differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This comprehensive data set revealed pervasive discordance between mRNA and protein. The high temporal resolution of the data made it possible to determine protein turnover rates genome-wide by fitting a kinetic model. This model further enabled us to systematically identify dynamic post-transcriptional regulation. Moreover, we linked different modes of regulation to the function of specific gene sets. Finally, we showed that the kinetic model can be applied to singlecell transcriptomics data to predict protein levels in differentiated cell types. In conclusion, our comprehensive data set, easily accessible through a web application, is a valuable resource for the discovery of post-transcriptional regulation in ESC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThere is controversy and sparse data on whether substrate based techniques in addition to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) confer benefit in the catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), especially if long standing. We performed an observational study to assess whether substrate based ablation improved freedom from atrial arrhythmia.\\n\\nMethods286 patients undergoing first ablation procedures for persistent AF with PVI only, PVI plus linear ablation, or PVI plus complex fractionated electrogram (CFAE) and linear ablation were followed. Primary end point was freedom from atrial arrhythmia at one year.\\n\\nResultsMean duration of pre-procedure time in AF was 28+/-27 months. Freedom from atrial arrhythmia was higher with a PVI+CFAE+lines strategy then for PVI alone (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.04-2.34, p=0.032) but was not higher with PVI+lines. Benefit of substrate modification was conferred for pre-procedure times in AF of over 30 months. The occurrence of atrial tachycardia was higher when lines were added to the ablation strategy (HR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.59, p=0.014). Freedom from atrial arrhythmia at 1 year was higher with lower patient age, use of general anaesthetic (GA), normal or mildly dilated left atrium and decreasing time in AF.\\n\\nConclusionsIn patients with long standing persistent AF of over 30 months duration, CFAE ablation resulted in improved freedom from atrial arrhythmia. Increased freedom from atrial arrhythmia occurs in patients who are younger and have smaller atria, and with GA procedures. Linear ablation did not improve outcome and resulted in a higher incidence of atrial tachycardia.",

    "abstract": "The cilium is an essential organelle at the surface of most mammalian cells whose dysfunction causes a wide range of genetic diseases collectively called ciliopathies. The current rate at which new ciliopathy genes are identified suggests that many ciliary components remain undiscovered. We generated and rigorously analyzed genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and evolutionary data and systematically integrated these using Bayesian statistics into a predictive score for ciliary function. This resulted in 285 candidate ciliary genes. We found experimental evidence of ciliary associations for 24 out of 36 analyzed candidate proteins. In addition, we show that OSCP1, which has previously been implicated in two distinct non-ciliary functions, causes a cilium dysfunction phenotype when depleted in zebrafish. The candidate list forms the basis of CiliaCarta, a comprehensive ciliary compendium covering 836 genes. The resource can be used to objectively prioritize candidate genes in whole exome or genome sequencing of ciliopathy patients and can be accessed at http://bioinformatics.bio.uu.nl/john/syscilia/ciliacarta/.",

    "abstract": "Sister chromatids are held together from their replication until mitosis. Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by the ring-shaped cohesin complex and it is thought that cohesin holds sister chromatids together by entrapping sister DNAs within the cohesin ring (Haering et al., 2008). However, how this occurs is not well understood. Because cohesin binds to DNA prior to replication it is possible that the replication fork passes through the lumen of the ring thereby placing replicated sisters inside cohesin rings. If this is the case, loading of cohesin in the G1 phase may be sufficient to build cohesion.\\n\\nWe show here that Scc2, a cohesin subunit required for loading cohesin onto chromosomes de novo, is necessary for establishment of cohesion even after Scc2-mediated loading has already taken place during late G1 or early S phase. Our results challenge a previous conclusion based on related experiments whereby Scc2 was found not to be required for cohesion establishment during S phase (Lengronne et al., 2006).",

    "abstract": "We recently identified a motif for dynamical compensation (DC) - a property where a system maintains the dynamics and steady-state of a regulated variable robust in the face of fluctuations in key parameters. Such parameters are therefore unidentifiable from measurements of the regulated variable at steady-state. On the other hand, since the models showing dynamical compensation are typically non-redundant, their parameters are identifiable from experimental data. We clarify this apparent discrepancy by requiring that the parameters of DC circuits be identifiable both away from steady-state and when measuring other system variables. We use this observation to provide a definition for DC in terms of parameter identifiability and discuss its relevance for the examples provided in Karin et al.",

    "abstract": "Predator nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) on prey activity are common in nature. Upon sensing predator cues, a common prey response is to reduce feeding to avoid being detected by predators. Using an aquatic system, this study investigated how prey density and predator cue type affect predator NCEs on prey feeding. Prey density was investigated because, as it increases, the individual risk of being preyed upon decreases, which may reduce NCEs if prey can detect conspecifics. Predator cue type was investigated because waterborne cues would trigger weaker NCEs than waterborne and tactile cues combined, as predation risk may be perceived by prey to be stronger in the second case. Specifically, a factorial experiment tested the hypotheses that (i) increasing dogwhelk (prey) density reduces the limitation that crab (predator) chemical cues can have on dogwhelk consumption of mussels and that (ii) chemical and tactile crab cues combined limit dogwhelk feeding more strongly than chemical crab cues alone. The results broadly supported these hypotheses. On the one hand, crab chemical cues limited the per-capita consumption of mussels by dogwhelks at a low dogwhelk density, but such NCEs disappeared at intermediate and high dogwhelk densities. On the other hand, the combination of chemical and tactile cues from crabs caused stronger NCEs, as dogwhelk consumption of mussels was negatively affected at all three dogwhelk densities. The structurally complex mussel beds may provide not only food for dogwhelks but a refuge from crab predation that allows dogwhelk density to limit crab NCEs when mediated by waterborne cues. Overall, this study suggests that prey evaluate conspecific density when assessing predation risk and that the type of cues prey are exposed to can affect their interpretation of risk.",

    "abstract": "The transition from carnivory to omnivory is poorly understood. The ability to feed at more than one trophic level theoretically increases an animals fitness in a novel environment. Because of the absence of light and photosynthesis, most subterranean ecosystems are characterized by very few trophic levels, such that food scarcity is a challenge in many subterranean habitats. One strategy against starvation is to expand diet breadth. Grotto salamanders (Eurycea spelaea) are known to ingest bat guano deliberately, challenging the general understanding that salamanders are strictly carnivorous. Here we tested the hypothesis that grotto salamanders have broadened their diet related to cave adaptation and found that, although coprophagous behavior is present, salamanders are unable to acquire sufficient nutrition from bat guano alone. Our results suggest that the coprophagic behavior has emerged prior to physiological or gut biome adaptations.",

Genome interaction matrices approximate the physical distance of pairs of regions on the genome to each other and can contain up to 3 million rows and columns with many sparse regions. Regions of interest (ROIs) can be defined, e.g., by sets of adjacent rows and columns, or by specific visual patterns in the matrix. However, traditional matrix aggregation or pan-and-zoom interfaces fail in supporting search, inspection, and comparison of ROIs in such large matrices. In HiPiler, ROIs are first-class objects, represented as thumbnail-like \\\"snippets\\\". Snippets can be interactively explored and grouped or laid out automatically in scatterplots, or through dimension reduction methods. Snippets are linked to the entire navigable genome interaction matrix through brushing and linking. The design of HiPiler is based on a series of semi-structured interviews with 10 domain experts involved in the analysis and interpretation of genome interaction matrices. We describe six exploration tasks that are crucial for analysis of interaction matrices and demonstrate how HiPiler supports these tasks. We report on a user study with a series of data exploration sessions with domain experts to assess the usability of HiPiler as well as to demonstrate respective findings in the data.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation to environmental insults is an evolutionary mechanism essential for survival. The hippocampus participates in controlling adaptive responses to stress and emotional state through the modulation of neuroplasticity events, which are dysregulated in stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has been proposed as a pivotal player in hippocampal neuroplasticity in both normal and neuropsychiatric conditions though its role remains still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of 5-HT deficiency on hippocampal activity combining RNA-seq, in vivo neuroimaging, neuroanatomical, biochemical and behavioral experiments on 5-HT depleted mice. We unveil that serotonin is required for appropriate activation of neuroplasticity adaptive mechanisms to environmental insults. Bidirectional deregulation of these programs in serotonin depleted mice is associated with opposite behavioral traits that model core symptoms of bipolar disorder. These findings delineate a previously unreported buffering role of 5-HT in instructing hippocampal activity and emotional responses to environmental demands.",

The TAPS assay is exemplified here using human kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), a challenging intracellular membrane protein target of significant current interest. TAPS confirmed target binding of known KMO inhibitors inside cells.

Notably, 22 Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases, but not glycan processing enzymes or the ER glycosylation machinery, are differentially expressed following giantin ablation. This includes near-complete loss-of-function of GALNT3 in both mammalian cell and zebrafish models. Giantin knockout zebrafish exhibit hyperostosis and ectopic calcium deposits, recapitulating phenotypes of hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis, a disease caused by mutations in GALNT3.

    "abstract": "Bees provide indispensable pollination services to both agricultural crops and wild plant populations, and several species of bees have become important models for the study of learning and memory, plant-insect interactions and social behavior. Orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) are especially important to the fields of pollination ecology, evolution, and species conservation. Here we report the nuclear and mitochondrial genome sequences of the orchid bee Euglossa dilemma Bembe & Eltz. Euglossa dilemma was selected because it is widely distributed, highly abundant, and it was recently naturalized in the southeastern United States. We provide a high-quality assembly of the 3.3 giga-base genome, and an official gene set of 15,904 gene annotations. We find high conservation of gene synteny with the honey bee throughout 80 million years of divergence time. This genomic resource represents the first draft genome of the orchid bee genus Euglossa, and the first draft orchid bee mitochondrial genome, thus representing a valuable resource to the research community.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory sensory input is detected by receptor neurons in the nose which then send information to the olfactory bulb, the first brain region for processing olfactory information. Within the olfactory bulb, many local circuit interneurons, including axonless granule cells, function to facilitate fine odor discrimination. How interneurons interact with principal cells to affect bulbar processing is not known though the mechanism is likely to be different than in sensory cortical regions since the olfactory bulb lacks an obvious topographical organization; neighboring glomerular columns, representing inputs from different receptor neuron subtypes, typically have different odor tuning. Determining the spatial scale over which interneurons such as granule cells can affect principal cells is a critical step towards understanding how the olfactory bulb operates. We addressed this question by assaying inhibitory synchrony using intracellular recordings from pairs of principal cells with different inter-somatic spacing. We find that in acute rat olfactory bulb slices, inhibitory synchrony is evident in the spontaneous synaptic input in mitral cells separated up to 300 m. At all inter-somatic spacing assayed, inhibitory synchrony was dependent on fast Na+ channels, suggesting that action potentials in granule cells function to coordinate GABA release at relatively distant dendrodendritic synapses formed throughout the the dendritic arbor. Our results suggest that individual granule cells are able to influence relatively large groups of mitral and tufted cells belonging to clusters of at least 15 glomerular modules, providing a potential mechanism to integrate signals reflecting a wide variety of odorants.",

    "abstract": "As regulators of gene expression in multicellular organisms, microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for growth and development. While a plethora of factors involved in their biogenesis and action in Arabidopsis thaliana have been described, these processes and their fine-tuning are not fully understood in plants. Here, we used plants expressing an artificial miRNA target mimic (MIM) to screen for negative regulators of miR156 activity. We identified a new mutant allele of the F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS; At3G61590), hws-5, as a suppressor of the MIM156-induced developmental and molecular phenotypes. In hws plants, levels of endogenous miRNAs are increased and their mRNA targets decreased. Plants constitutively expressing full-length HWS - but not a truncated version lacking the F-box domain - display morphological and molecular phenotypes resembling those of mutants defective in miRNA biogenesis and activity. In combination with such mutants, hws loses its delayed floral organ abscission ( skirt) phenotype, suggesting epistasis. Also, the overall hws transcriptome profile partially resembles well-known miRNA mutants hyl1-2 and se-3, indicating action in a common pathway. We thus propose HWS as a novel, F-box dependent regulator of miRNA biogenesis.\\n\\nSummary statementHAWAIIAN SKIRT is a regulator of Arabidopsis thaliana microRNA biogenesis and acts in an F-box-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "The uniformity of cell size in healthy tissues suggests that control mechanisms might coordinate cell growth and division. We derived a method to assay whether growth rates of individual cells depend on cell size, by combining time-lapse microscopy and immunofluorescence to monitor how variance in cell size changes as cells grow. This analysis revealed two periods in the cell cycle when cell size variance decreases in a manner incompatible with unregulated growth, suggesting that cells sense their own size and adjust their growth rate to correct aberrations. Monitoring nuclear growth in live cells confirmed that these decreases in variance reflect a process that selectively inhibits the growth of large cells while accelerating growth of small cells. We also detected cell-size-dependent adjustments of G1 length, which further reduce variability. Combining our assays with chemical and genetic perturbations confirmed that cells employ two strategies, adjusting both cell cycle length and growth rate, to maintain the appropriate size.",
