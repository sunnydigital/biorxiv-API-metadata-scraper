    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new hypothesis concerning the dissociated role of the basal ganglia in the selection and the evaluation of action that has been formulated using a theoretical model and confirmed experimentally in monkeys. To do so, prior to learning, we inactivated the internal part of the Globus Pallidus (GPi, the main output structure of the BG) with injections of muscimol and we tested monkeys on a variant of a two-armed bandit task where two stimuli are associated with two distinct reward probabilities (0.25 and 0.75 respectively). Unsurprisingly, performance in such condition are at the chance level because the output of basal ganglia is suppressed and they cannot influence behaviour. However, the theoretical model predicts that in the meantime, values of the stimuli are nonetheless covertly evaluated and learned. This has been tested and confirmed on the next day, when muscimol has been replaced by a saline solution: monkeys instantly showed significantly improved performances (above chance level), hence demonstrating they have covertly learned the relative value of the two stimuli. This tends to suggest a competition takes place in the Cortex-BG loop between two actors, one of whom being sensitive to criticism and the other not. Ultimately, the actual choice is valuated, independently of the origin of the decision.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIron is an essential element of most living organisms but is a dangerous substance when poorly liganded in solution. The hormone hepcidin regulates the export of iron from tissues to the plasma contributing to iron homeostasis and also restricting its availability to infectious agents. Disruption of iron regulation in mammals leads to disorders such as anemia and hemochromatosis, and contributes to the etiology of several other diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that hepcidin alone is able to regulate iron distribution in different dietary regimes in the mouse using a computational model of iron distribution calibrated with radioiron tracer data.\\n\\nResultsA model was developed and calibrated to the data from adequate iron diet, which was able to simulate the iron distribution under a low iron diet. However simulation of high iron diet shows considerable deviations from the experimental data. Namely the model predicts more iron in red blood cells and less iron in the liver than what was observed in experiments.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results suggest that hepcidin alone is not sufficient to regulate iron homeostasis in high iron conditions and that other factors are important. The model was able to simulate anemia when hepcidin was increased but was unable to simulate hemochromatosis when hepcidin was suppressed, suggesting that in high iron conditions additional regulatory interactions are important.",

They escaped from the repellents and went to the attractants. Five motile mutants that failed to do that were isolated. They did not respond to any external attractants tested or external repellents tested. In addition, they did not respond well to internal sensory stimuli like hunger, thirst, and sleep. The mutants, although motile, failed to respond to stimuli at both 34{degrees}C and at room temperature. Some of the mutants have been mapped.

    "abstract": "The functions of human brains highly depend on the precise temporal regulation of gene expression, and substantial transcriptome changes across lifespan have been observed. While cell type composition is known to be temporally variable in brains, it remains unclear whether it is the primary cause of age-related transcriptome changes. Here, taking advantage of published human brain single-cell RNA-seq data, we applied a two-step transcriptome deconvolution procedure to the public age series RNA-seq data to quantify the contribution of cell type composition in shaping the temporal transcriptome in human brains. We estimated that composition change contributed to around 25% of the total variance and was the primary factor of age-related transcriptome changes. On the other hand, genes with substantial composition-independent temporal expression changes were also observed, which had diverged expression properties, functions and regulators as genes with temporal expression changes related to composition. This indicates a second independent mechanism shaping the human brains temporal transcriptome properties, which is important for human brain functions.",

    "abstract": "The haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche provides essential micro-environmental cues for the production and maintenance of HSCs within the bone marrow. During inflammation, haematopoietic dynamics are perturbed, but it is not known whether changes to the HSC-niche interaction occur as a result. We visualise HSCs directly in vivo, enabling detailed analysis of the 3D niche dynamics and migration patterns in murine bone marrow following Trichinella spiralis infection. Spatial statistical analysis of these HSC trajectories reveals two distinct modes of HSC behaviour: (i) a pattern of revisiting previously explored space, and (ii) a pattern of exploring new space. Whereas HSCs from control donors predominantly follow pattern (i), those from infected mice adopt both strategies. Using detailed computational analyses of cell migration tracks and life-history theory, we show that the increased motility of HSCs following infection can, perhaps counterintuitively, enable mice to cope better in deteriorating HSC-niche micro-environments following infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHaematopoietic stem cells reside in the bone marrow where they are crucially maintained by an incompletely-determined set of niche factors. Recently it has been shown that chronic infection profoundly affects haematopoiesis by exhausting stem cell function, but these changes have not yet been resolved at the single cell level. Here we show that the stem cell-niche interactions triggered by infection are heterogeneous whereby cells exhibit different behavioural patterns: for some, movement is highly restricted, while others explore much larger regions of space over time. Overall, cells from infected mice display higher levels of persistence. This can be thought of as a search strategy: during infection the signals passed between stem cells and the niche may be blocked or inhibited. Resultantly, stem cells must choose to either  cling on, or to leave in search of a better environment. The heterogeneity that these cells display has immediate consequences for translational therapies involving bone marrow transplant, and the effects that infection might have on these procedures.",

However, the polygenic architectures of many diseases have not been well characterized due to lack of simple and fast methods for unbiased estimation of the underlying proportion of disease-associated variants and their effect-size distribution. Applying empirical Bayes estimation of semi-parametric hierarchical mixture models to GWAS summary statistics, we confirmed that schizophrenia was extremely polygenic ([~] 40% risk variants of independent genome-wide SNPs, most within odds ratio (OR)=1.03), whereas rheumatoid arthritis was less polygenic ([~] 4 to 8% risk variants, significant portion reaching OR=1.05 to 1.1). For rheumatoid arthritis, stratified estimations revealed that expression quantitative loci in blood explained large genetic variance, and low- and high-frequency derived alleles were prone to be risk and protective, respectively, suggesting a predominance of deleterious-risk and advantageous-protective mutation. Despite genetic correlation, effect-size distributions for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder differed across allele frequency. These analyses distinguished disease polygenic architectures and provided clues for etiological differences in complex diseases.",

This high fidelity results from the action of hundreds of genes involved in replication, proofreading, and damage repair. Evolutionary theory suggests that in such a system, selection has limited ability to remove genetic variants that change mutation rates by small amounts or in specific sequence contexts. Consistent with this, using SNV variation as a proxy for mutational input, we report here that mutational spectra differ substantially among species, human continental groups and even some closely-related populations. Close examination of one signal, an increased TCC[-&gt;]TTC mutation rate in Europeans, indicates a burst of mutations from about 15,000 to 2,000 years ago, perhaps due to the appearance, drift, and ultimate elimination of a genetic modifier of mutation rate. Our results suggest that mutation rates can evolve markedly over short evolutionary timescales and suggest the possibility of mapping mutational modifiers.",

    "abstract": "New genes, with novel protein functions, can evolve \\\"from scratch\\\" out of intergenic sequences. These de novo genes can integrate the cells genetic network and drive important phenotypic innovations. Therefore, identifying de novo genes and understanding how the transition from noncoding to coding occurs are key problems in evolutionary biology. However, identifying de novo genes is a difficult task, hampered by the presence of remote homologs, fast evolving sequences and erroneously annotated protein coding genes. To overcome these limitations, we developed a procedure that handles the usual pitfalls in de novo gene identification and predicted the emergence of 703 de novo genes in 15 yeast species from two genera whose phylogeny spans at least 100 million years of evolution. We established that de novo gene origination is a widespread phenomenon in yeasts, only a few being ultimately maintained by selection. We validated 82 candidates, by providing new translation evidence for 25 of them through mass spectrometry experiments. We also unambiguously identified the mutations that enabled the transition from non-coding to coding for 30 Saccharomyces de novo genes. We found that de novo genes preferentially emerge next to divergent promoters in GC-rich intergenic regions where the probability of finding a fortuitous and transcribed ORF is the highest. We found a more than 3-fold enrichment of de novo genes at recombination hot spots, which are GC-rich and nucleosome-free regions, suggesting that meiotic recombination would be a major driving force of de novo gene emergence in yeasts.",

However, while there is general agreement within ecology that the first author is the person who contributed the most to a particular project, there is less agreement regarding whether being last author is a position of significance and regarding what is indicated by someone being the corresponding author on a manuscript. Using an analysis of papers published in American Naturalist, Ecology, Evolution, and Oikos, I found that: 1) the number of authors on papers is increasing over time; 2) the proportion of first authors as corresponding author has increased over time, as has the proportion of last authors as corresponding author; 3) 84% of papers published in 2016 had the first author as corresponding author; and 4) geographic regions differed in the likelihood of having the first (or last) author as corresponding author. I also carried out an online survey to better understand views on last and corresponding authorship. This survey revealed that most ecologists view the last author as the \\\"senior\\\" author on a paper (that is, the person who runs the research group in which most of the work was carried out), and most ecologists view the corresponding author as the person taking full responsibility for a paper. However, there was substantial variation in views on authorship, especially corresponding authorship. Given these results, I suggest that discussions of authorship have as their starting point that the first author will be corresponding author and the senior author will be last author.

Most analyses have focused on identifying driver oncogenes mutated in patient tumors, but this approach is incapable of discovering genes essential for tumor growth yet not activated through mutation. We show that such genes can be systematically discovered by mining cancer sequencing data for evidence of purifying selection. We show that purifying selection reduces substitution rates in coding regions of cancer genomes, depleting up to 90% of mutations for some genes. Moreover, mutations resulting in non-conservative amino acid substitutions are under strong negative selection in tumors, whereas conservative substitutions are more tolerated. Genes under purifying selection include members of the EGFR and FGFR pathways in lung adenocarcinomas, and DNA repair pathways in melanomas. A systematic assessment of purifying selection in tumors would identify hundreds of tumor-specific enablers and thus novel targets for therapy.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine underlies important aspects of cognition, and has been suggested to boost cognitive performance. However, how dopamine modulates the large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance has remained elusive. Using functional MRI during a working memory task in healthy young human listeners (N=22), we investigated the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) on two aspects of cortical dynamics, blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability and the functional connectome of large-scale cortical networks. We here show that enhanced dopaminergic signaling modulates the two potentially interrelated aspects of large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance, and the degree of these modulations is able to explain inter-individual differences in L-dopa-induced behavioral benefits. Relative to placebo, L-dopa increased BOLD signal variability in task-relevant temporal, inferior frontal, parietal and cingulate regions. On the connectome level, however, L-dopa diminished functional integration across temporal and cingulo-opercular regions. This hypo-integration was expressed as a reduction in network efficiency and modularity in more than two thirds of the participants and to different degrees. Hypo-integration co-occurred with relative hyper-connectivity in paracentral lobule and precuneus, as well as posterior putamen. Both, L-dopa-induced BOLD signal variability modulation and functional connectome modulations proved predictive of an individuals L-dopa-induced gain in behavioral performance, namely response speed and perceptual sensitivity. Lastly, L-dopa-induced modulations of BOLD signal variability were correlated with L-dopa-induced modulation of nodal connectivity and network efficiency. Our findings underline the role of dopamine in maintaining the dynamic range of, and communication between, cortical systems, and their explanatory power for inter-individual differences in benefits from dopamine during cognitive performance.",

Neurotransmitter (NT) release from synaptic vesicles (SV) requires coordinated binding of the conserved core secretory machinery comprised of the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (vSNARE) synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2) on the SV and the cognate tSNAREs on the plasma membrane. Synaptophysin (SYP) is the most abundant SV protein3 and the major pre-fusion binding partner of VAMP24. A major challenge in understanding the etiology and prevention of AD is determining the proteins directly targeted by A{beta}42 and elucidating if these targets mediate disease phenotypes. Here we demonstrate that A{beta}42 binds to SYP with picomolar affinity and disrupts the SYP/VAMP2 complex resulting in inhibition of both neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. While functionally redundant paralogs of SYP have masked its critical activity in knockout studies5,6, we now demonstrate a profound seizure susceptibility phenotype in SYP knockout mice that is recapitulated in an AD model mouse. Our studies imply a subtle yet critical role for SYP in the synaptic vesicle cycle and the etiology of AD.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to trastuzumab remains a major obstacle in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer treatment. miR-200c is important for many functions in cancer stem cells (CSCs), including tumor recurrence, metastasis and resistance. We hypothesized that miR-200c contributes to trastuzumab resistance and stemness maintenance in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. In this study, we used HER2-positive SKBR3, HER2-negative MCF-7, and their CD44+CD24- phenotype mammospheres SKBR3-S and MCF-7-S to verify. Our results demonstrated that miR-200c was weakly expressed in breast cancer cell lines and cell line stem cells. Overexpression of miR-200c resulted in a significant reduction in the number of tumor spheres formed and the population of CD44+CD24- phenotype mammospheres in SKBR3-S. Combining miR-200c with trastuzumab can significantly reduce proliferation and increase apoptosis of SKBR3 and SKBR3-S. Overexpression of miR-200c also eliminated its downstream target genes. These genes were highly expressed and positively related in breast cancer patients. Overexpression of miR-200c also improved the malignant progression of SKBR3-S and SKBR3 in vivo. miR-200c plays an important role in the maintenance of the CSC-like phenotype and increases drug sensitivity to trastuzumab in HER2+ cells and stem cells.\\n\\nSummary statementmiRNAs are critical in stemness maintenance and drug resistance.

    "abstract": "The mammalian circadian clock is a critical regulator of metabolism and cell division. Although multiple lines of evidence indicate that systemic disruption of the circadian clock can promote cancer, whether the clock is disrupted in primary human tumors is unknown. Here we used transcriptome data from mice to define a signature of the mammalian circadian clock based on the co-expression of 12 genes that form the core clock or are directly controlled by the clock. Our approach can be applied to samples that are not labeled with time of day and were not acquired over the entire circadian (24-h) cycle. We validated the clock signature in transcriptome data from healthy human tissues, then developed a metric we call the delta clock correlation distance ({Delta}CCD) to describe the extent to which the signature is perturbed in samples from one condition relative to another. We calculated the {Delta}CCD comparing human tumor and non-tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas and eight independent datasets, discovering widespread dysregulation of clock gene co-expression in tumor samples. Subsequent analysis of data from clock gene knockouts in mice suggested that clock dysregulation in human cancer is not caused solely by loss of activity of clock genes. Furthermore, by analyzing a large set of genes previously inferred to be rhythmic in healthy human lung, we found that dysregulation of the clock in human lung cancer is accompanied by dysregulation of broader patterns of circadian co-expression. Our findings suggest that clock dysregulation is a common means by which human cancers achieve unrestrained growth and division, and that restoring clock function could be a viable therapeutic strategy in multiple cancer types. In addition, our approach opens the door to using publicly available transcriptome data to quantify clock disruption in a multitude of human phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Plasticity between adhesive and less-adhesive states is important for mammalian cell behaviour. To investigate adhesion plasticity, we have selected a stable isogenic subpopulation of MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cells which grows in suspension. These suspension cells are unable to re-adhere to various matrices or to contract three-dimensional collagen lattices. By transcriptome analysis, we identified the focal adhesion protein tensin3 (Tns3) as a determinant of adhesion plasticity. Tns3 is strongly reduced on mRNA and protein level in suspension cells. Furthermore, challenging breast cancer cells transiently with non-adherent conditions markedly reduces Tns3 expression, which is regained upon re-adhesion. Stable knockdown of Tns3 in parental cells results in defective adhesion, spreading and migration. Tns3 knockdown cells display impaired structure and dynamics of focal adhesion complexes as determined by immunostaining. Restoration of Tns3 expression in suspension cells partially rescues adhesion and focal contact composition. Our work identifies Tns3 as a critical focal adhesion component regulated by, and functionally contributing to, the switch between adhesive and non-adhesive states in MDA-MB-468 cancer cells.\\n\\nSummary statementWe identify the cell-matrix adapter protein tensin3 as a determinant of adhesion plasticity, using cancer cells selected for non-adherent growth.

Here we show that tissue-specific downregulation of EDTP in Drosophila non-muscle tissues, particularly glial cells, suppresses the expression of polyglutamine (polyQ) protein aggregates in the same cells and improves survival. Additionally, tissue-specific downregulation of EDTP in glial cells or motoneurons extends lifespan.

The method is sensitive to a single mismatched base pair in a DNA sequence of several thousand base pairs. We systematically compare DNA molecules with 0 to 16 adjacent mismatches at 1 M monovalent salt and 3.5 pN force and show that, under these conditions, a single plectoneme forms and is stably pinned at the defect. We use these measurements to estimate the energy and degree of end-loop kinking at defects. From this, we calculate the relative probability of plectoneme pinning at the mismatch under physiologically relevant conditions. Based on this estimate, we propose that DNA supercoiling could contribute to mismatch and damage sensing in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Altered Ca2+ handling is often present in diseased hearts undergoing structural remodeling and functional deterioration. The influences of Ca2+ signaling on cardiac function have been examined extensively, but whether Ca2+ directly regulates sarcomere structure has remained elusive. Using a mutant zebrafish model lacking NCX1 activity in the heart, we explored the impacts of impaired Ca2+ homeostasis on myofibril integrity. Gene expression profiling analysis revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 is upregulated in ncx1-deficient hearts. Intriguingly, knocking down MuRF1 activity or inhibiting proteasome activity preserved myofibril integrity in ncx1 deficient hearts, revealing a MuRF1-mediated proteasome degradation mechanism that is activated in response to abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis. Furthermore, we detected an accumulation of the MuRF1 regulator FoxO in the nuclei of ncx1-deficient cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of FoxO in wild type cardiomyocytes induced MuRF1 expression and caused myofibril disarray, whereas inhibiting Calcineurin activity attenuated FoxO-mediated MuRF1 expression and protected sarcomeres from degradation in ncx1-deficient hearts. Together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which Ca2+ overload disrupts the myofibril integrity in heart muscle cells by activating a Calcineurin-FoxO-MuRF1-proteosome signaling pathway.",

Most analyses, however, consider only the marginal eQTL signal, rather than dissecting this signal into multiple independent eQTL for each gene. Here we show that analyzing conditional eQTL signatures, which could be important under specific cellular or temporal contexts, leads to improved fine mapping of GWAS associations. Using genotypes and gene expression levels from post-mortem human brain samples (N=467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), we find that conditional eQTL are widespread; 63% of genes with primary eQTL also have conditional eQTL. In addition, genomic features associated with conditional eQTL are consistent with context specific (i.e. tissue, cell type, or developmental time point specific) regulation of gene expression. Integrating the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia (SCZ) GWAS and CMC conditional eQTL data reveals forty loci with strong evidence for co-localization (posterior probability >0.8), including six loci with co-localization of conditional eQTL. Our co-localization analyses support previously reported genes and identify novel genes for schizophrenia risk, and provide specific hypotheses for their functional follow-up.",

We identified 205 PenStrep-responsive genes, including transcription factors such as ATF3 that are likely to alter the regulation of other genes. Pathway analyses found a significant enrichment for \\\"xenobiotic metabolism signaling\\\" and \\\"PXR/RXR activation\\\" pathways. Our H3K27ac ChIP-seq identified 9,514 peaks that are PenStrep responsive. These peaks were enriched near genes that function in cell differentiation, tRNA modification, nuclease activity and protein dephosphorylation. Our results suggest that PenStrep treatment can significantly alter gene expression and regulation in a common liver cell type such as HepG2, advocating that antibiotic treatment should be taken into account when carrying out genetic, genomic or other biological assays in cultured cells.",

Patients infected with the malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, often carry multiple, genetically distinct parasites.

We have developed an improved single-cell genomics protocol to reconstruct individual haplotypes from infections, a necessary step in uncovering parasite ecology within the host. This approach captures singly-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) prior to whole genome amplification (WGA) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Here, we demonstrate that parasites in late cell cycle stages, which contain increased DNA content, are far superior templates for generating high quality genomic data. Targeting of these cells routinely generates near-complete capture of the 23Mb P. falciparum genome (mean breadth of coverage 90.7%) at high efficiency. We used this approach to analyze the genomes of 48 individual cells from a polyclonal malaria infection sampled in Chikhwawa, Malawi. This comprehensive dataset enabled high-resolution estimation of the clonality and the relatedness of parasite haplotypes within the infection, long-standing problems in malaria biology.",

    "abstract": "Early prediction of complex disorders (e.g., autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders) is one of the fundamental goals of precision medicine and personalized genomics. An early prediction of complex disorders can have a significant impact on increasing the effectiveness of interventions and treatments in improving the prognosis and, in many cases, enhancing the quality of life in the affected patients. Considering the genetic heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders, we are proposing a novel framework for utilizing rare coding variation for early prediction of these disorders in subset of affected samples. We provide a novel formulation for the Ultra-Accurate Disorder Prediction (UADP) problem and develop a combinatorial framework for solving this problem. The primary goal of this framework, denoted as Odin (Oracle for DIsorder predictioN), is to make prediction for a subset of affected cases while having very low false positive rate prediction for unaffected samples. Note that in the Odin framework we will take advantage of the available functional information (e.g., pairwise coexpression of genes during brain development) to increase the prediction power beyond genes with recurrent variants. Application of our method accurately recovers an additional 8% of autism cases without a sever variant in a known recurrent mutated genes with a less than 1% false positive rate. Furthermore, Odin predicted a set of 391 genes that severe variants in these genes can cause autism or other developmental delay disorders.

    "abstract": "In recent years, mathematical modeling approaches have played a central role to understand and to quantify mechanisms in different viral infectious diseases. In this approach, biological-based hypotheses are expressed via mathematical relations and then tested based on empirical data. The simulation results can be used to either identify underlying mechanisms, provide predictions on infection outcomes, or evaluate the efficacy of a treatment.\\n\\nConducting parameter estimation for mathematical models is not an easy task. Here we detail an approach to conduct parameter estimation and to evaluate the results using the free software R. The method is applicable to influenza virus dynamics at different complexity levels, widening experimentalists capabilities in understanding their data.

    "abstract": "MotivationPairwise alignment of nucleotide sequences has previously been carried out using the seed- and-extend strategy, where we enumerate seeds (shared patterns) between sequences and then extend the seeds by Smith-Waterman-like semi-global dynamic programming to obtain full pairwise alignments. With the advent of massively parallel short read sequencers, algorithms and data structures for efficiently finding seeds have been extensively explored. However, recent advances in single-molecule sequencing technologies have enabled us to obtain millions of reads, each of which is orders of magnitude longer than those output by the short-read sequencers, demanding a faster algorithm for the extension step that accounts for most of the computation time required for pairwise local alignment. Our goal is to design a faster extension algorithm suitable for single-molecule sequencers with high sequencing error rates (e.g., 10-15%) and with more frequent insertions and deletions than substitutions.\\n\\nResultsWe propose an adaptive banded dynamic programming algorithm for calculating pairwise semi-global alignment of nucleotide sequences that allows a relatively high insertion or deletion rate while keeping band width relatively low (e.g., 32 or 64 cells) regardless of sequence lengths. Our new algorithm eliminated mutual dependences between elements in a vector, allowing an efficient Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data parallelization. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm runs approximately 5x faster than the extension alignment algorithm in NCBI BLAST+ while retaining similar sensitivity (recall).\\n\\nWe also show that our extension algorithm is more sensitive than the extension alignment routine in DALIGNER, while the computation time is comparable.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe implementation of the algorithm and the benchmarking scripts are available at https://github.com/ocxtal/adaptivebandbench.\\n\\nContactmkasa@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp",

    "abstract": "Cell polarity has a fundamental role in shaping the morphology of cells and growing tissues. Polarity is commonly thought to be established in response to extracellular signals. Here we used a minimal in vitro assay that enabled us to monitor the determination of cell polarity in myogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in the absence of external signalling gradients. We demonstrate that the initiation of cell polarity is regulated by melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM). We found highly polarized localization of MCAM, Moesin (MSN), Scribble (SCRIB) and Van-Gogh-like 2 (VANGL2) at the distal end of elongating myotubes. Knockout of MCAM or elimination of its endocytosis motif does not impair the initiation of myogenesis or myoblast fusion, but prevents myotube elongation. MSN, SCRIB and VANGL2 remain uniformly distributed in MCAM knockout cells. We show that MCAM is also required at early stages of chondrogenic differentiation. In both myogenic and chondrogenic differentiation MCAM knockout leads to transcriptional downregulation of Scrib and enhanced MAP kinase activity. Our data demonstrates the importance of cell autonomous polarity in differentiation.",

Here, we provide genetic, biochemical, and pharmacologic evidence that MTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent translation is a prerequisite for HH signaling. The genetic loss of mTORC1 function inhibited HH signaling- driven growth of the cerebellum and medulloblastoma. Inhibiting translation or mTORC1 blocked HH signaling. Depleting 4EBP1, an mTORC1 target that inhibits translation, alleviated the dependence of HH signaling on mTORC1. Consistent with this, phosphorylated 4EBP1 levels were elevated in HH signaling-driven medulloblastomas in mice and humans. In mice, an mTORC1 inhibitor suppressed medulloblastoma driven by a mutant SMO that is resistant to an SMO inhibitor in the clinic, prolonging the survival of the mice. Our study reveals mTORC1-mediated translation to be a key component of HH signaling and an important target for treating medulloblastoma and other cancers driven by HH signaling.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence makes a strong case that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to complex traits, with implications across many fields of biology from dissecting developmental processes to understanding aspects of human health and disease. In ecology, recent studies have merged ecological experimental design with epigenetic analyses to elucidate the contribution of epigenetics to plant phenotypes, stress response, adaptation to habitat, or species range distributions. While there has been some progress in revealing the role of epigenetics in ecological processes, many studies with non-model species have so far been limited to describing broad patterns based on anonymous markers of DNA methylation. In contrast, studies with model species have benefited from powerful genomic resources, which allow for a more mechanistic understanding but have limited ecological realism. To understand the true significance of epigenetics for plant ecology and evolution, we must combine both approaches transferring knowledge and methods from model-species research to genomes of evolutionarily divergent species, and examining responses to complex natural environments at a more mechanistic level. This requires transforming genomics tools specifically for studying non-model species, which is challenging given the large and often polyploid genomes of plants. Collaboration between molecular epigeneticists, ecologists and bioinformaticians promises to enhance our understanding of the mutual links between genome function and ecological processes.",

We draw on a macroevolutionary theory of escalation to develop a set of criteria for coevolutionary systems to exhibit escalation of strategic complexity. By expanding on a previously developed model of the evolution of memory length for cooperative strategies by Kristian Lindgren, we resolve previously observed limitations to the escalation of memory length. We present long-term coevolutionary simulations showing that larger population sizes tend to support greater escalation of complexity than smaller population sizes. Additionally, escalation is sensitive to perturbation during transitions of complexity. In whole, a long-standing counter-argument to the ubiquitous nature of coevolution is resolved, suggesting that the escalation of coevolutionary arms races can be harnessed by computational simulations.",

Here we use the lethal amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis as a model to investigate the traits predicting broad-scale in vitro inhibitory capabilities of both individual bacteria and multiple-bacterial consortia. We show that inhibition of multiple pathogen isolates is rare, with no clear phylogenetic signal at the genus level. Bacterial consortia offer stronger protection against B. dendrobatidis compared to single isolates, but critically this was only true for consortia containing multiple genera, and this pattern was not uniform across all B. dendrobatidis isolates.

    "abstract": "Carotenoids have important roles in bird behavior, including pigmentation for sexual signaling and improving color vision via retinal oil droplets. Yellow carotenoids are diet-derived, but red carotenoids (ketocarotenoids) are typically synthesized from yellow precursors via a carotenoid ketolase. Recent research on passerines has provided evidence that a cytochrome p450 enzyme, CYP2J19, is responsible for this reaction, though it is unclear if this function is phylogenetically restricted. Here I provide evidence that CYP2J19 is the carotenoid ketolase common to Aves using the genomes of 65 birds and the retinal transcriptomes of 15 avian taxa. CYP2J19 is functionally intact and robustly transcribed in all taxa except for several species adapted to foraging in dim light conditions. Two penguins, an owl and a kiwi show evidence of genetic lesions and relaxed selection in their genomic copy of CYP2J19, and six owls show evidence of marked reduction in CYP2J19 retinal transcription compared to nine diurnal avian taxa. Notably, none of these taxa are known to use red carotenoids for sexual signaling and several species of owls and penguins represent the only birds known to completely lack red retinal oil droplets. The remaining avian taxa belong to groups known to possess red oil droplets, known or expected to deposit red carotenoids in skin and/or plumage, and/or frequently forage in bright light. The loss and reduced expression of CYP2J19 is likely an adaptation to maximize retinal sensitivity, given that oil droplets reduce the amount of light available to the retina.",

    "abstract": "The identification of functional non-coding mutations is a key challenge in the field of genomics, where whole-genome re-sequencing can swiftly generate a set of all genomic variants in a sample, such as a tumor biopsy. The size of the human regulatory landscape places a challenge on finding recurrent cis-regulatory mutations across samples of the same cancer type. Therefore, powerful computational approaches are required to sift through the tens of thousands of non-coding variants, to identify potentially functional variants that have an impact on the gene expression profile of the sample. Here we introduce an integrative analysis pipeline, called - cisTarget, to filter, annotate and prioritize non-coding variants based on their putative effect on the underlying 'personal' gene regulatory network. We first validate -cisTarget by re-analyzing three cases of oncogenic non-coding mutations, namely the TAL1 and LMO1 enhancer mutations in T-ALL, and the TERT promoter mutation in melanoma. Next, we re-sequenced the full genome of ten cancer cell lines of six different cancer types, and used matched transcriptome data and motif discovery to infer master regulators for each sample. We identified candidate functional non-coding mutations that generate de novo binding sites for these master regulators, and that result in the up-regulation of nearby oncogenic drivers. We finally validated the predictions using tertiary data including matched epigenome data. Our approach is generally applicable to re-sequenced cancer genomes, or other genomes, when a disease- or sample-specific gene signature is available for network inference. -cisTarget is available from http://mucistarget.aertslab.org.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing data is accompanied by quality scores that quantify sequencing error. Inaccuracies in these quality scores propagate through all subsequent analyses; thus base quality score recalibration is a standard step in many next-generation sequencing workflows, resulting in improved variant calls. Current base quality score recalibration algorithms rely on the assumption that sequencing errors are already known; for human resequencing data, relatively complete variant databases facilitate this. However, because existing databases are still incomplete, recalibration is still inaccurate; and most organisms do not have variant databases, exacerbating inaccuracy for non-human data. To overcome these logical and practical problems, we introduce Lacer, which recalibrates base quality scores without assuming knowledge of correct and incorrect bases and without requiring knowledge of common variants. Lacer is the first logically sound, fully general, and truly accurate base recalibrator. Lacer enhances variant identification accuracy for resequencing data of human as well as other organisms (which are not accessible to current recalibrators), simultaneously improving and extending the benefits of base quality score recalibration to nearly all ongoing sequencing projects.

    "abstract": "Whole-brain analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a common analytic approach in cognitive neuroscience. Researchers are often interested in exploring whether brain activity reflects to the interaction of two factors. Disordinal interactions -- where there is a reversal of the effect of one independent variable at a level of a second independent variable -- are common in the literature. It is well established in power-analyses of factorial ANOVAs that certain patterns of interactions, such as disordinal (e.g., cross-over interactions) require less power than others to detect. This fact, combined with the perils of mass univariate testing suggests that testing for interactions in whole-brain ANOVAs, may be biased towards the detection of disordinal interactions. Here, we report on a series of simulated analysis --including whole-brain fMRI data using realistic multi-source noise parameters-- that demonstrate a bias towards the detection of disordinal interactions in mass-univariate contexts. Moreover, results of these simulations indicated that spurious disordinal interactions are found at common thresholds and cluster sizes at the group level. Moreover, simulations based on implanting true ordinal interaction effects can nevertheless appear like crossover effects at realistic levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when performing mass univariate testing at the whole-brain level, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions when interpreted as is. Simulations of varying sample sizes and SNR levels show that this bias is driven primarily by SNR and larger sample sizes do little to ameliorate this issue. Together, the results of these simulations argue for caution when searching for ordinal interactions in whole-brain ANOVA.",

A classic example is the inverse base rate effect (IBRE), whereby participants classify ambiguous stimuli sharing features of both common and rare categories as members of the rare category. Computational models of the IBRE have either posited that it arises from associative similarity-based mechanisms or dissimilarity-based processes that may depend upon higher-level inference. Here we develop a hybrid model, which posits that similarity- and dissimilarity-based evidence both contribute to the IBRE, and test it using functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from human subjects completing an IBRE task. Consistent with our model, multivoxel pattern analysis reveals that activation patterns on ambiguous test trials contain information consistent with dissimilarity-based processing. Further, trial-by-trial activation in left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex tracks model-based predictions for dissimilarity-based processing, consistent with theories positing a role for higher-level symbolic processing in the IBRE.",

Similar to previous studies, activations time-locked to spindles were observed in thalamocortical circuitry and basal ganglia regions. Importantly, spindle-related activation in a subset of these regions were specifically related to inter-individual differences in Reasoning, but not STM or Verbal abilities. These results may help elucidate the physiological mechanisms which support the function of sleep for the capacity for reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental insults such as malformations of cortical development (MCD) are a common cause of psychiatric disorders, learning impairments and epilepsy. Animals with MCDs have impairments in spatial cognition that, remarkably, are improved by post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE). To establish the network-level mechanisms responsible for these impacts, hippocampal in vivo single unit recordings were performed in freely moving animals in an open arena. We took a generalized linear modeling approach to extract fine spike timing (FST) characteristics and related these to place cell fidelity used as a surrogate of spatial cognition. We find that MCDs disrupt FST and place-modulated rate coding in hippocampal CA1 and that EE restores both to normal. Moreover, FST parameters predict spatial coherence of neurons, suggesting that mechanisms determining FST are critical for cognition. This suggests that FST parameters could represent a therapeutic target to improve cognition even in the context of a structurally abnormal brain.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIEnvironmental enrichment (EE) in rats with cortical malformations improves cognition.\\nC_LIO_LIEE resolves impaired rate and timing coding of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.\\nC_LIO_LITaken together, circuit-level dynamics directly affect quality of the cognitive map.\\nC_LI\\n\\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTInsults during neurodevelopment, particularly those that result in physical malformations in the brain, lead to cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders and epilepsy. Environmental enrichment (EE) improves cognitive outcome in patients and animal models with brain malformations. Understanding how EE can improve cognition at the level of neural networks can lead to new treatment targets. Remarkably, using an approach that mathematically models neuron firing we show that firing is mistimed in animals with malformations and that EE improves this abnormality. Importantly, timing abnormalities predict abnormalities in cognition at the single neuron level, suggesting that restoring timing could improve learning and memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common arboviral infection globally, infecting an estimated 390 million people each year. We employed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify host dependency factors required for DENV propagation, and identified the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex as an essential host factor for DENV infection. Mammalian cells express two OSTs containing either STT3A or STT3B. We found that the canonical catalytic function of the OSTs as oligosaccharyltransferases is not necessary for DENV infection, as cells expressing catalytically inactive STT3A or STT3B are able to support DENV propagation. However, the OST subunit MAGT1, which associates with STT3B, is also required for DENV propagation. MAGT1 expression requires STT3B, and a catalytically inactive STT3B also rescues MAGT1 expression, supporting the hypothesis that STT3B serves to stabilize MAGT1 in the context of DENV infection. We found that the oxidoreductase CxxC active site motif of MAGT1 was necessary for DENV propagation as cells expressing an AxxA MAGT1 mutant were unable to support DENV infection.\\n\\nInterestingly, cells expressing single-cysteine CxxA or AxxC mutants of MAGT1 were able to support DENV propagation. Utilizing the engineered peroxidase APEX2, we demonstrate the close proximity between MAGT1 and NS1 or NS4B during DENV infection. These results reveal that the oxidoreductase activity of the STT3B-containing OST is necessary for DENV infection, which may guide the development of antivirals targeting DENV.",
