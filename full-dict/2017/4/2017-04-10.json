    "abstract": "This paper combines the catch allocation model for narwhals in East Canada and West Greenland with Bayesian population modelling of the eight summer aggregations of narwhals in the region. The catch allocation model allocates the catches in different hunting areas and seasons to the different summer aggregations, and the population models analyse the impact of these catches on the population dynamics of the eight narwhal aggregations.\\n\\nThe population models run from 1970, and the catch allocation model needs population trajectories from 1970 to the present in order to estimate the catches taken from the different summer aggregations during this period. In an initial run it uses linear transitions between the available abundance estimates; but more elaborate population trajectories are estimated by the fit of the population models to the abundance data. The two models are therefore run in an iterative manner until the catch histories that are estimated by the allocation model, and the abundance trajectories that are estimated by the population models, converge between runs.\\n\\nGiven a converged model and potential future catch options for the different hunts, the model estimates the probabilities of fulfilling management options for eight summer aggregations of narwhals.",

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that cultivating calm will increase altruism and decrease parochialism, where altruism is defined as self-sacrifice in support of others, regardless of group affiliation or identity, and parochialism is defined as prosocial self-sacrifice restricted to fellow members of a group. Such could be the case with a calming meditation practice. An alternate hypothesis, coming from the study of ritual, proposes that shared practices lead to bonding, increasing parochialism, but not altruism generally. These contradictory hypotheses of the potential effects of shared cultural practices of calming meditation were explored via a formal behavioral experiment using a simple treatment and control format with a short, facilitated breath awareness practice known to produce calm. Altruism and parochialism were measured through anonymous play in Public Goods games performed with both in-group and out-group individuals. The sum of contributions of the two plays gave a measure of altruism, while the difference between the two gave a measure of parochialism. The analysis of the results using Bayesian AICc model comparison methods supports the first hypothesis that calming practices reduces parochialism and increases altruism. The hypothesis of intentional shared practice as parochialism inducing was not supported by the results in this case of a shared calming practice.",

    "abstract": "Cross experiment comparisons in public data compendia are challenged by unmatched conditions and technical noise. The ADAGE method, which performs unsupervised integration with neural networks, can effectively identify biological patterns, but because ADAGE models, like many neural networks, are over-parameterized, different ADAGE models perform equally well. To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa compendium containing experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB. While we expected PhoB activity in limiting phosphate conditions, our analyses found PhoB activity in other media with moderate phosphate and predicted that a second stimulus provided by the sensor kinase, KinB, is required for PhoB activation in this setting. We validated this relationship using both targeted and unbiased genetic approaches. eADAGE, which captures stable biological patterns, enables cross-experiment comparisons that can highlight measured but undiscovered relationships.",

    "abstract": "Species barriers, expressed as hybrid inviability and sterility, are often due to epistatic interactions between divergent loci from two lineages. Theoretical models indicate that the strength, direction, and complexity of these genetic interactions can strongly affect the expression of interspecific reproductive isolation and the rates at which new species evolve. Nonetheless, empirical analyses have not quantified the frequency with which loci are involved in interactions affecting hybrid fitness, and whether these loci predominantly interact synergistically or antagonistically, or preferentially involve loci that have strong individual effects on hybrid fitness. We systematically examined the prevalence of interactions between pairs of short chromosomal regions from one species (Solanum habrochaites) co-introgressed into a heterospecific genetic background (Solanum lycopersicum). We used lines containing pairwise combinations of 15 chromosomal segments from S. habrochaites crossed into the background of S. lycopersicum (i.e., 95 double introgression lines). We compared the strength of hybrid incompatibility (either pollen sterility or seed sterility) expressed in each double introgression line to the expected additive effect of its two component single introgressions. We found that: epistasis was common among co-introgressed regions; epistastic effects for hybrid dysfunction were overwhelmingly antagonistic (i.e., double hybrids were less unfit than expected from additive single introgression effects); and, epistasis was substantially more prevalent in pollen fertility compared to seed fertility phenotypes. Together, these results indicate that higher-order interactions frequently contribute to postzygotic sterility barriers in these species. This pervasive epistasis leads to the decoupling of the patterns of accumulation of isolation loci and isolation phenotypes, and is expected to attenuate the rate of accumulation of hybrid infertility among lineages over time (i.e., giving diminishing returns as more reproductive isolation loci accumulate). This decoupling effect might also explain observed differences between pollen and seed fertility in their fit to theoretical predictions of the accumulation of isolation loci, including the  snowball effect.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYA characteristic feature of new species is their inability to produce fertile or viable hybrids with other lineages. This post-zygotic reproductive isolation is caused by dysfunctional interactions between genes that have newly evolved changes in the diverging lineages. Whether these interactions occur between pairs of divergent alleles, or involve more complex networks of genes, can have strong effects on how rapidly reproductive isolation--and therefore new species--evolve. The complexity of these interactions, however, is poorly understood in empirical systems. We examined the fertility of hybrids that carried one or two chromosomal regions from a close relative, finding that hybrids with two of these heterospecific regions were frequently less sterile than would be expected from the joint fitness of hybrids that have the same regions singly. This  less-than-additive effect on hybrid sterility was widespread (observed in 20% of pairwise combinations), and especially pronounced for male sterility. We infer that genes contributing to male sterility form a more tightly connected network than previously thought, implying that reproductive isolation is evolving by incremental dysfunction of complex interactions rather than by independent pairwise incompatibilities. We use simulations to illustrate these expected patterns of accumulation of reproductive isolation when it involves highly interconnected gene networks.",

    "abstract": "Bioinformatics methods typically use textual representations of genetic information, represented computationally as strings or sub-strings of the characters A, T, G and C. Image processing methods offer a rich source of alternative descriptors as they are designed to work in the presence of noisy data without the need for exact matching. We introduce a method, multi-resolution local binary patterns (MLBP) from image processing to extract local  texture changes from nucleotide sequence data. We apply this feature space to the alignment-free binning of metagenomic data. The effectiveness of MLBP is demonstrated using both simulated and real human gut microbial communities. The intuition behind our method is the MLBP feature vectors permit sequence comparisons without the need for explicit pairwise matching. Sequence reads or contigs can then be represented as vectors and their  texture compared efficiently using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to perform dimensionality reduction to capture eigengenome information and perform clustering (here using RSVD and BH-tSNE). We demonstrate this approach outperforms existing methods based on k-mer frequency. The image processing method, MLBP, thus offers a viable alternative feature space to textual representations of sequence data.

    "abstract": "Simultaneous analysis of genetic associations with multiple phenotypes may reveal shared genetic susceptibility across traits (pleiotropy). For a locus exhibiting overall pleiotropy, it is important to identify which specific traits underlie this association. We propose a Bayesian meta-analysis approach (termed CPBayes) that uses summary-level data across multiple phenotypes to simultaneously measure the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association and estimate an optimal subset of traits associated with the risk locus. This method uses a unified Bayesian statistical framework based on a spike and slab prior. CPBayes performs a fully Bayesian analysis by employing the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique Gibbs sampling. It takes into account heterogeneity in the size and direction of the genetic effects across traits. It can be applied to both cohort data and separate studies of multiple traits having overlapping or non-overlapping subjects. Simulations show that CPBayes produces a substantially better accuracy in the selection of associated traits underlying a pleiotropic signal than the subset-based meta-analysis ASSET. We used CPBayes to undertake a genome-wide pleiotropic association study of 22 traits in the large Kaiser GERA cohort and detected nine independent pleiotropic loci associated with at least two phenotypes. This includes a locus at chromosomal region 1q24.2 which exhibits an association simultaneously with the risk of five different diseases: Dermatophytosis, Hemorrhoids, Iron Deficiency, Osteoporosis, and Peripheral Vascular Disease. The GERA cohort analysis suggests that CPBayes is more powerful than ASSET with respect to detecting independent pleiotropic variants. We provide an R-package  CPBayes implementing the proposed method.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have highlighted shared genetic susceptibility to various human diseases (pleiotropy). We propose a Bayesian meta-analysis method CPBayes that simultaneously evaluates the evidence of aggregate-level pleiotropic association and selects an optimal subset of associated traits underlying a pleiotropic signal. CPBayes analyzes pleiotropy using summary-level data across a wide range of studies for two or more phenotypes - separate GWASs with or without shared subjects, cohort study for multiple traits. It performs a fully Bayesian analysis and offers various flexibilities in the inference. In addition to parameters of primary interest (e.g., the measures of overall pleiotropic association, the optimal subset of associated traits), it provides additional interesting insights into a pleiotropic signal (e.g., the trait-specific posterior probability of association, the credible interval of unknown true genetic effects). Using computer simulations and a real data application to the large Kaiser GERA cohort, we demonstrate that CPBayes offers substantially better accuracy while selecting the non-null traits compared to a well known subset-based meta analysis ASSET. In the GERA cohort analysis, CPBayes detected a larger number of independent pleiotropic variants than ASSET. We provide a user-friendly R-package  CPBayes for general use.",

    "abstract": "Humans tend to form social relationships with others who resemble them. Whether this sorting of like with like arises from historical patterns of migration, meso-level social structures in modern society, or individual-level selection of similar peers remains unsettled. Recent research has evaluated the possibility that unobserved genotypes may play an important role in the creation of homophilous relationships. We extend this work by using data from 9,500 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine genetic similarities among pairs of friends. While there is some evidence that friends have correlated genotypes, both at the whole-genome level as well as at trait-associated loci (via polygenic scores), further analysis suggests that meso-level forces, such as school assignment, are a principal source of genetic similarity between friends. We also observe apparent social-genetic effects in which polygenic scores of an individuals friends and schoolmates predict the individuals own educational attainment. In contrast, an individuals height is unassociated with the height genetics of peers.\\n\\nSignificanceOur study reported significant findings of a \\\"social genome\\\" that can be quantified and studied to understand human health and behavior. In a national sample of more than 9,000 American adolescents, we found evidence of social forces that act to make friends and schoolmates more genetically similar to one another as compared to random pairs of unrelated individuals. This subtle genetic similarity was observed across the entire genome and at sets of genomic locations linked with specific traits--educational attainment and body-mass index--a phenomenon we term \\\"social-genetic correlation.\\\" We also find evidence of a \\\"social-genetic effect\\\" such that the genetics of a persons friends and schoolmates influenced their own education, even after accounting for the persons own genetics.",

    "abstract": "We address the evolution of effective number of individuals under androdioecy and gynodioecy. We analyze dynamic models of autosomal modifiers of weak effect on sex expression. In our zygote control models, the sex expressed by a zygote depends on its own genotype, while in our maternal control models, it depends on the genotype of its maternal parent. Our analysis unifies full multi-dimensional local stability analysis with the Li-Price equation, which for all its heuristic appeal, describes evolutionary change over a single generation. We define a point in the neighborhood of a fixation state from which a single-generation step indicates the asymptotic behavior of the frequency of a modifier allele initiated at an arbitrary point near the fixation state. A concept of heritability appropriate for the evolutionary modification of sex emerges from the Li-Price framework. We incorporate our theoretical analysis into our previously-developed Bayesian inference framework to develop a new method for inferring the viability of gonochores (males or females) relative to hermaphrodites. Applying this approach to microsatellite data derived from natural populations of the gynodioecious plant Schiedea salicaria and the androdioecious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus, we find that while female and hermaphrodite S. salicaria appear to have similar viabilities, male K. marmoratus appear to survive to reproductive age at less than half the rate of hermaphrodites.",

    "abstract": "Export of parasite proteins into the host erythrocyte is essential for survival of Plasmodium falciparum during its asexual lifecycle. While several studies described key factors within the parasite that are involved in protein export, the mechanisms employed to traffic exported proteins within the host cell are currently unknown. Members of the Hsp70 family of chaperones, together with their Hsp40 co-chaperones, facilitate protein trafficking in other organisms, and are thus likely used by P. falciparum in the trafficking of its exported proteins. A large group of Hsp40 proteins is encoded by the parasite and exported to the host cell, but only one Hsp70, PfHsp70x, is exported with them.\\n\\nPfHsp70x is absent from most Plasmodium species and is found only in P. falciparum and closely-related species that infect Apes. Herein, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in P. falciparum to investigate the essentiality of PfHsp70x. We show that parasitic growth was unaffected by knockdown of PfHsp70x using both the DHFR-based Destabilization Domain and the glmS ribozyme system. Similarly, a complete gene knockout of PfHsp70x did not affect the ability of P. falciparum to proceed through its intraerythrocytic lifecycle. The effect of PfHsp70x knockdown/knockout on the export of proteins to the host RBC, including the critical virulence factor PfEMP1, was tested and we found that this process was unaffected. These data show that although PfHsp70x is the sole exported Hsp70, it is not essential for the asexual development of P. falciparum.\\n\\nImportanceHalf of the worlds population lives at risk for malaria. The intraerythrocytic lifecycle of Plasmodium spp. is responsible for clinical manifestations of malaria; therefore, knowledge of the parasites ability to survive within the erythrocyte is needed to combat the deadliest agent of malaria, P. falciparum. An outstanding question in the field is how P. falciparum undertakes the essential process of trafficking its proteins within the host cell. In most organisms, chaperones such as Hsp70 are employed in protein trafficking. Of the human-disease causing Plasmodium species, the chaperone PfHsp70x is unique to P. falciparum, and it is the only parasite protein of its kind exported to the host (1). This has placed PfHsp70x as an ideal target to inhibit protein trafficking and kill the parasite. However, we show that PfHsp70x is not required for export of parasite effectors nor is it essential for parasite survival inside of the RBC.",

    "abstract": "Background: Gene duplications are a major source of raw material for evolution and a likely contributor to the diversity of life on earth. Duplicate genes (i.e., homeologs, in the case of a whole genome duplication) may retain their ancestral function, sub- or neofunctionalize, or be lost entirely. A primary way that duplicate genes may evolve new functions is by altering their expression patterns. Comparing the expression patterns of duplicate genes may give clues as to whether any of these evolutionary processes have occurred.\\n\\nResults: We develop a likelihood ratio test for the analysis of the expression ratios of duplicate genes across two conditions (e.g., tissues). We demonstrate an application of this test by comparing homeolog expression patterns of 1,448 homeologous gene pairs using RNA-seq data generated from the leaves and petals of an allotetraploid monkeyflower (Mimulus luteus). We assess the sensitivity of this test to different levels of homeolog expression bias and compare the method to several alternatives.\\n\\nConclusions: The likelihood ratio test derived here is a direct, transparent, and easily implemented method for detecting changes in homeolog expression bias that outperforms three alternative approaches. While our method was derived with homeolog analysis in mind, this method can be used to analyze changes in the ratio of expression levels between any two genes in any two conditions.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) often work cooperatively, where the binding of one TF to DNA enhances the binding affinity of a second TF to a nearby location. Such cooperative binding is important for activating gene expression from promoters and enhancers in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Existing methods to detect cooperative binding of a TF pair rely on analyzing the sequence that is bound. We propose a method that uses, instead, only ChIP-seq peak intensities and an expectation maximization (CPI-EM) algorithm. We validate our method using ChIP-seq data from cells where one of a pair of TFs under consideration has been genetically knocked out. Our algorithm relies on our observation that cooperative TF-TF binding is correlated with weak binding of one of the TFs, which we demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus cells. We show that this method performs significantly better than a predictor based only on the ChIP-seq peak distance of the TFs under consideration. This suggests that peak intensities contain information that can help detect the cooperative binding of a TF pair. CPI-EM also outperforms an existing sequence-based algorithm in detecting cooperative binding. The CPI-EM algorithm is available at https://github.com/vishakad/cpi-em.",

    "abstract": "Progress in the development and use of methods for species delimitation employing phenotypic data lags behind conceptual and practical advances in molecular genetic approaches. The basic evolutionary model underlying the use of phenotypic data to delimit species assumes random mating and quantitative polygenic traits, so that phenotypic distributions within a species should be approximately normal for individuals of the same sex and age. Accordingly, two or more distinct normal distributions of phenotypic traits suggest the existence of multiple species. In light of this model, we show that analytical approaches employed in taxonomic studies using phenotypic data are often compromised by three issues: (1) reliance on graphical analyses of phenotypic space that do not consider the frequency of phenotypes; (2)exclusion of characters potentially important for species delimitation following reduction of data dimensionality; and (3) use of measures of central tendencies to evaluate phenotypic distinctiveness. We outline approaches to overcome these issues based on statistical developments related to normal mixture models and illustrate them empirically with a reanalysis of morphological data recently used to claim that there are no morphologically distinct species of Darwins ground-finches (Geospiza). We found negligible support for this claim relative to taxonomic hypotheses recognizing multiple species. Although species limits among ground-finches merit further assessments using additional sources of information, our results bear implications for other areas of inquiry including speciation research: because ground-finches have likely speciated and are not trapped in a process of \\\"Sisyphean\\\" evolution as recently argued, they remain useful models to understand the evolutionary forces involved in speciation. Our work underscores the importance of statistical approaches grounded on appropriate evolutionary models for species delimitation. Approaches allowing one to fit normal mixture models without a priori information about species limits offer new perspectives in the kind of inferences available to systematists, with significant repercusions on ideas about the structure of biological biodiversity.

    "abstract": "The ability to parse a complex auditory scene into perceptual objects is facilitated by a hierarchical auditory system. Successive stages in the hierarchy transform an auditory scene of multiple overlapping sources, from peripheral tonotopically-based representations in the auditory nerve, into perceptually distinct auditory-objects based representation in auditory cortex. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from human subjects, both men and women, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in distinct hierarchical stages of auditory cortex. Using systems-theoretic methods of stimulus reconstruction, we show that the primary-like areas in auditory cortex contain dominantly spectro-temporal based representations of the entire auditory scene. Here, both attended and ignored speech streams are represented with almost equal fidelity, and a global representation of the full auditory scene with all its streams is a better candidate neural representation than that of individual streams being represented separately. In contrast, we also show that higher order auditory cortical areas represent the attended stream separately, and with significantly higher fidelity, than unattended streams. Furthermore, the unattended background streams are more faithfully represented as a single unsegregated background object rather than as separated objects. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the progression of the representations and processing of a complex acoustic scene up through the hierarchy of human auditory cortex.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUsing magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from human listeners in a simulated cocktail party environment, we investigate how a complex acoustic scene consisting of multiple speech sources is represented in separate hierarchical stages of auditory cortex.

    "abstract": "Despite the growth of Open Access, illegally circumventing paywalls to access scholarly publications is becoming a more mainstream phenomenon. The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of {small tilde}28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons, and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing.",

    "abstract": "i.Summary/AbstractSequencing of transcribed RNA molecules (RNA-seq) has been used wildly for studying cell transcriptomes in bulk or at the single-cell level (1, 2, 3) and is becoming the de facto technology for investigating gene expression level changes in various biological conditions, on the time course, and under drug treatments. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data helped identify fusion genes that are related to certain cancers (4). Differential gene expression before and after drug treatments provides insights to mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics of the drugs, and safety concerns (5). Because each RNA-seq run generates tens to hundreds of millions of short reads with size ranging from 50bp-200bp, a tool that deciphers these short reads to an integrated and digestible analysis report is in high demand. QuickRNASeq (6) is an application for large-scale RNA-seq data analysis and real-time interactive visualization of complex data sets. This application automates the use of several of the best open-source tools to efficiently generate user friendly, easy to share, and ready to publish report. Figure 1 illustrates some of the interactive plots produced by QuickRNASeq. The visualization features of the application have been further improved since its first publication in early 2016. The original QuickRNASeq publication (6) provided details of background, software selection, and implementation.

    "abstract": "The ability of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) to transform resting cell B-cells into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) provides a continuous source of peripheral blood lymphocytes that are used to model conditions in which these lymphocytes play a key role. Here, the PacBio generated transcriptome of three LCLs from a parent-daughter trio (SRAid:SRP036136) provided by a previous study [1] were analyzed using a kmer-based version of YeATS (KEATS). The set of over-expressed genes in these cell lines were determined based on a comparison with the PacBio transcriptome of twenty tissues provided by another study (hOPTRS) [2]. MIR155 long non-coding RNA (MIR155HG), Fc fragment of IgE receptor II (FCER2), T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1A (TCL1A), and germinal center associated signaling and motility (GCSAM) were genes having the highest expression counts in the three LCLs with no expression in hOPTRS. Other over-expressed genes, having low expression in hOPTRS, were membrane spanning 4-domains A1 (MS4A1) and ribosomal protein S2 pseudogene 55 (RPS2P55). While some of these genes are known to be over-expressed in LCLs, this study provides a comprehensive cataloguing of such genes. A recent work involving a patient with EBV-positive large B-cell lymphoma was  unusually lacking various B-cell markers, but over-expressing CD30 [3] - a gene ranked 79 among uniquely expressed genes here. Hypomethylation of chromosome 1 observed in EBV immortalized LCLs [4, 5] is also corroborated here by mapping the genes to chromosomes. Extending previous work identifying un-annotated genes [6], 80 genes were identified which are expressed in the three LCLs, not in hOPTRS, and missing in the GENCODE, RefSeq and RefSeqGene databases. KEATS introduces a method of determining expression counts based on a partitioning of the known annotated genes, has runtimes of a few hours on a personal workstation and provides detailed reports enabling proper debugging.",

    "abstract": "The assembly and development of the gut microbiome in infants has important consequences for immediate and long-term health. Preterm infants represent an abnormal case for bacterial colonization because of early exposure to bacteria and frequent use of antibiotics. To better understand the assembly of the gut microbiota in preterm infants, fecal samples were collected from 32 very low birthweight preterm infants over the first six weeks of life. Infant health outcomes included healthy, late-onset sepsis, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We characterized the bacterial composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolome by untargeted gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Preterm infant fecal samples lacked beneficial Bifidobacterium and were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus due to the near uniform antibiotic administration. Most of the variance between the microbial community compositions could be attributed to which baby the sample came from (Permanova R2=0.48, p<0.001), while clinical status (healthy, NEC, or late-onset sepsis), and overlapping time in the NICU did not explain a significant amount of variation in bacterial composition. Fecal metabolomes were also found to be unique to the individual (Permanova R2=0.43, p<0.001) and weakly associated with bacterial composition (Mantel statistic r = 0.23 {+/-} 0.05 (p = 0.03 {+/-} 0.03). No measured metabolites were found to be associated with necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis or a healthy outcome. Overall, preterm infants gut microbial communities were personalized and reflected antibiotic usage.\\n\\nImportancePreterm infants face health problems likely related to microbial exposures including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. However, the role of the gut microbiome in preterm infant health is poorly understood. Microbial colonization differs from healthy term babies because it occurs in the NICU and is often perturbed by antibiotics. We measured bacterial compositions and metabolomic profiles of 77 fecal samples from thirty-two preterm infants to investigate the differences between microbiomes in health and disease. Rather than finding microbial signatures of disease, we found the preterm infant microbiome and metabolome were both personalized, and that the preterm infant gut microbiome is enriched in microbes that commonly dominate in the presence of antibiotics. These results contribute to the growing knowledge of the preterm infant microbiome and emphasize that a personalized view will be important to disentangling the health consequences of the preterm infant microbiome.",

We found a differential abundance in family members of Firmicutes with a 3-fold increased of Erysipelotrichaceae and a 5-fold decrease in family Leuconostocaceae in HCC when compared to wo-HCC controls. Genus Fusobacterium was found 5-fold decreased in HCC versus wo-HCC. The ratio bacteriodes/prevotella was increased in HCC due to the significant decrease in the genus prevotella. Genus Odoribacter and Butyricimonas were more differentialy abundant in HCC. This pattern has been previously associated with an inflammatory milieu with a putative increased activation of NOD-like receptor signalling pathways. A Random Forest model trained with differential abundant taxa correctly classifyed HCC individuals with an error of 22%.\\n\\nConclusionsA pattern of microbiome linked to inflammation was observed in cirrhotic patients with HCC.

    "abstract": "Epithelial folding is crucial to shape embryos and tissues during development. Here we investigate the coupling between epithelial folding and actomyosin-rich boundaries. The mechanistic relationship between the two is unclear, since actomyosin-rich boundaries can be either associated with folds or not, while epithelial folding has been found to be either dependent or independent of actomyosin contractility. Here we investigate the shallow folds that form at compartmental parasegment boundaries (PSBs) in the early Drosophila embryo. First, we demonstrate that formation of these folds is dependent on the contractility of supracellular actomyosin cables. When the Myosin II phosphatase Flawing is depleted at the PSBs, actomyosin contractility increases, resulting in deeper folds. Conversely, in wingless mutants, actomyosin enrichment and increased contractility at PSBs are lost and this correlates with an absence of folding. Furthermore, when we make ectopic PSBs by expressing Wingless ubiquitously, the ectopic boundaries become enriched in actomyosin and epithelial folds form. Ectopic PSB folds, however, are much deeper than endogenous ones, indicating that epithelial folding is normally under inhibitory control. We present evidence that depletion of Bazooka/Par-3 levels at PSB cell-cell contacts, which is under Wingless signaling control, is responsible for this inhibition. Bazooka is found depleted at endogenous but not ectopic PSBs. In embryos overexpressing Bazooka, endogenous PSB folds form earlier and are much deeper. To ask how local signaling at the boundaries control Bazooka levels at cell-cell contacts, we examined embryos that ectopically expressed Wingless in an hedgehog mutant background. In these embryos, inhibition of folding is rescued, with ectopic PSBs now forming shallow folds as endogenous PSBs. Bazooka is depleted at these ectopic PSBs in absence of Hedgehog, suggesting an opposite effect of Wingless and Hedgehog signaling on Bazooka levels at PSB cell-cell contacts. This uncovers a new role of Bazooka in controlling fold formation at actomyosin-rich compartmental boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) seeks to create the first 4-dimensional connectome of early life. Understanding this connectome in detail may provide insights into normal as well as abnormal patterns of brain development. Following established best practices adopted by the WU-MINN Human Connectome Project (HCP), and pioneered by FreeSurfer, the project utilises cortical surface-based processing pipelines. In this paper, we propose a fully automated processing pipeline for the structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the developing neonatal brain. This proposed pipeline consists of a refined framework for cortical and sub-cortical volume segmentation, cortical surface extraction, and cortical surface inflation, which has been specifically designed to address considerable differences between adult and neonatal brains, as imaged using MRI. Using the proposed pipeline our results demonstrate that images collected from 465 subjects ranging from 28 to 45 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) can be processed fully automatically; generating cortical surface models that are topologically correct, and correspond well with manual evaluations of tissue boundaries in 85% of cases. Results improve on state-of-the-art neonatal tissue segmentation models and significant errors were found in only 2% of cases, where these corresponded to subjects with high motion. Downstream, these surfaces will enhance comparisons of functional and diffusion MRI datasets, supporting the modelling of emerging patterns of brain connectivity.",

    "abstract": "In the sciences of cognition, an influential idea is that the brain makes predictions about incoming sensory information to reduce inherent ambiguity. In the visual hierarchy, this implies that information content originating in memory-the identity of a face-propagates down to disambiguate incoming stimulus information. However, understanding this powerful prediction-for-recognition mechanism will remain elusive until we uncover the content of the information propagating down from memory. Here, we address this foundational limitation with a task ubiquitous to humans-familiar face identification. We developed a unique computer graphics platform that combines a generative model of random face identity information with the subjectivity of perception. In 14 individual participants, we reverse engineered the predicted information contents propagating down from memory to identify 4 familiar faces. In a follow-up validation, we used the predicted face information to synthesize the identity of new faces and confirmed the causal role of the predictions in face identification. We show these predictions comprise both local 3D surface patches, such as a particularly thin and pointy nose combined with a square chin and a prominent brow, or more global surface characteristics, such as a longer or broader face. Further analyses reveal that the predicted contents are efficient because they represent objective features that maximally distinguish each identity from a model norm. Our results reveal the contents that propagate down the visual hierarchy from memory, showing this coding scheme is efficient and compatible with norm-based coding, with implications for mechanistic accounts of brain and machine intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The genetics and evolution of sex chromosomes are largely distinct from autosomes and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The Y chromosome offers unique genetic perspective on male-line inheritance. Here, we uncover novel evolutionary history of Sus scrofa based on 205 high-quality genomes from worldwide-distributed different wild boars and domestic pig breeds. We find that only two haplotypes exist in the distal and proximal blocks of at least 7.7 Mb on chromosome Y in pigs across European and Asian continents. And the times of most recent common ancestors (TMRCA) within both haplotypes, approximately 0.14 and 0.10 million years, are far smaller than their divergence time of around 1.07 million years. Whats more, the relationship between Sumatran and Eurasian continent Sus scrofa is much closer than that we knew before. And surprisingly, European pigs share the same haplotype with many Chinese pigs, which is not consistent with their deep splitting status on autosome and mtDNA. Further analyses show that the haplotype in Chinese pigs was likely introduced from European wild boars via ancient gene flow before pig domestication about 24k years ago. Low mutation rates and no recombination in the distal and proximal blocks on chromosome Y help us detect this male-driven ancient gene flow. Taken together, our results update the knowledge of pig demography and evolution, and might shed insight into the genetics and evolution studies on chromosome Y in other mammals.",

    "abstract": "In nature, microbes often need to \\\"decide\\\" which of several available nutrients to utilize, a choice that depends on a cells inherent preference and external nutrient levels. While natural environments can have mixtures of different nutrients, phenotypic variation in microbes decisions of which nutrient to utilize is poorly studied. Here, we quantified differences in the concentration of glucose and galactose required to induce galactose-responsive (GAL) genes across 36 wild S. cerevisiae strains. Using bulk segregant analysis, we found that a locus containing the galactose sensor GAL3 was associated with differences in GAL signaling in eight different crosses. Using allele replacements, we confirmed that GAL3 is the major driver of GAL induction variation, and that GAL3 allelic variation alone can explain as much as 90% of the variation in GAL induction in a cross. The GAL3 variants we found modulate the diauxic lag, a selectable trait. These results suggest that ecological constraints on the galactose pathway may have led to variation in a single protein, allowing cells to quantitatively tune their response to nutrient changes in the environment.\\n\\nAuthor summaryIn nature, microbes often need to decide which of many potential nutrients to consume. This decision making process is complex, involving both intracellular constraints and the organisms perception of the environment. To begin to mimic the complexity of natural environments, we grew cells in mixtures of two sugars, glucose and galactose. We find that in mixed environments, the sugar concentration at which cells decides to induce galactose-utilizing (GAL) genes is highly variable in natural isolates of yeast. By analyzing crosses of phenotypically different strains, we identified a locus containing the galactose sensor, a gene that in theory could allow cells to tune their perception of the environment. We confirmed that the galactose sensor can explain upwards of 90% of the variation in the decision to induce GAL genes. Finally, we show that the variation in the galactose sensor can modulate the time required for cells to switch from utilizing glucose to galactose. Our results suggest that signaling pathways can be highly variable across strains and thereby might allow for rapid adaption in fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "Burst-like synthesis of protein is a significant source of cell-to-cell variability in protein levels. Negative feedback is a common example of a regulatory mechanism by which such stochasticity can be controlled. Here we consider a specific kind of negative feedback, which makes bursts smaller in the excess of protein. Increasing the strength of the feedback may lead to dramatically different outcomes depending on a key parameter, the noise load, which is defined as the squared coefficient of variation the protein exhibits in the absence of feedback. Combining stochastic simulation with asymptotic analysis, we identify a critical value of noise load: for noise loads smaller than critical, the coefficient of variation remains bounded with increasing feedback strength; contrastingly, if the noise load is larger than critical, the coefficient of variation diverges to infinity in the limit of ever greater feedback strengths. Interestingly, high-cooperativity feedbacks have lower critical noise loads, implying that low-cooperativity feedbacks in burst size can be preferable for noisy proteins. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of previous results on the impact of negative feedback in burst size and burst frequency on gene-expression noise.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMendelian randomization (MR) studies of body mass index (BMI) and cardiovascular health in mid-to-late life suggest causal relationships, but the nature of these has not been explored systematically at younger ages. Using complementary MR and recall-by-genotype (RbG) methodologies, our objective was to estimate the causal effect of BMI on detailed measures of cardiovascular health in a population of young healthy adults.\\n\\nMethods and FindingsData from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were used. For MR analyses, a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising 97 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and constructed using external weighting was used as an instrument to test the causal effect of each unit increase in BMI (kg/m2) on selected cardiovascular phenotypes measured at age 17 (N=7909). An independent enriched sample from the same cohort participated in a RbG study at age 21, which enabled more detailed cardiovascular phenotyping (N=418; 191/227 from the lower/upper [~]30% of a genome-wide GRS distribution predicting variation in BMI). The causal effect of BMI on the additional cardiovascular phenotypes was assessed by comparing the two recalled groups. Difference in mean BMI between RbG groups was 3.85kg/m2 (95% CI: 2.53, 4.63; P=6.09x1011). In both MR and RbG analyses, results indicated that higher BMI causes higher blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular mass (indexed to height2.7, LVMI) in young adults (e.g. difference in LVMI per kg/m2 using MR: 1.07g/m2.7; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.52; P=3.87x10-06 and per 3.58kg/m2 using RbG: 1.65g/m2.7 95% CI: 0.83, 2.47; P=0.0001). Additionally, RbG results indicated a causal role of higher BMI on higher stroke volume (SV; difference per 3.58kg/m2: 1.49ml/m2.04; 95% CI: 0.62, 2.35; P=0.001) and cardiac output (CO; difference per 3.58kg/m2: 0.11l /min/m1.83; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.19; P=0.01). Neither analysis supported a causal role of higher BMI on heart rate.\\n\\nConclusionsComplementary MR and RbG causal methodologies, together with a range of appropriate sensitivity analyses, showed that higher BMI is likely to cause worse cardiovascular health, specifically higher BP and LVMI, even in youth. These consistent results support efforts to prevent or reverse obesity in the young.",

This requires to re-encode head kinematic signals into a reference frame anchored to earth-centered landmarks such as gravity, through computations whose neuronal substrate remains to be determined. Here, we studied the encoding of self-generated head movements in the caudal cerebellar vermis, an area essential for graviceptive functions. We found that, contrarily to peripheral vestibular inputs, most Purkinje cells exhibited a mixed sensitivity to head rotational and gravitational information and were differentially modulated by active and passive movements. In a subpopulation of cells, this mixed sensitivity underlay a tuning to rotations about an axis defined relative to gravity. Therefore, we show that the caudal vermis hosts a re-encoded, gravitationally-polarized representation of self-generated head kinematics.",

    "abstract": "The diploid nature of the genome is neglected in many analyses done today, where a genome is perceived as a set of unphased variants with respect to a reference genome. Many important biological phenomena such as compound heterozygosity and epistatic effects between enhancers and target genes, however, can only be studied when haplotype-resolved genomes are available. This lack of haplotype-level analyses can be explained by a dearth of methods to produce dense and accurate chromosome-length haplotypes at reasonable costs. Here we introduce an integrative phasing strategy that combines global, but sparse haplotypes obtained from strand-specific single cell sequencing (Strand-seq) with dense, yet local, haplotype information available through long-read or linked-read sequencing. Our experiments provide comprehensive guidance on favorable combinations of Strand-seq libraries and sequencing coverages to obtain complete and genome-wide haplotypes of a single individual genome (NA12878) at manageable costs. We were able to reliably assign > 95% of alleles to their parental haplotypes using as few as 10 Strand-seq libraries in combination with 10-fold coverage PacBio data or, alternatively, 10X Genomics linked-read sequencing data. We conclude that the combination of Strand-seq with different sequencing technologies represents an attractive solution to chart the unique genetic variation of diploid genomes.",

    "abstract": "Indirect evidence suggests that blastopore closure during gastrulation of anamniotes, including amphibians such as Xenopus laevis, depends on circumblastoporal convergence forces generated by the marginal zone (MZ), but direct evidence is lacking. We show that explanted MZs generate tensile convergence forces up to 1.5 N during gastrulation and over 4 N thereafter. These forces are generated by convergent thickening (CT) until the midgastrula and increasingly by convergent extension (CE) thereafter. Explants from ventralized embryos, which lack tissues expressing CE but close their blastopores, produce up to 2 N of tensile force, showing that CT alone generates forces sufficient to close the blastopore. Uniaxial tensile stress relaxation assays show stiffening of mesodermal and ectodermal tissues around the onset of neurulation, potentially enhancing long-range transmission of convergence forces. These results illuminate the mechanobiology of early vertebrate morphogenic mechanisms, aid interpretation of phenotypes, and give insight into the evolution of blastopore closure mechanisms.",

Although their main role is to protect the epithelial sheet from external mechanical strain, how HDs respond to mechanical stress remains poorly understood. Here we identify a pathway essential for HD remodeling, and outline its role with respect to 6{beta}4 integrin recycling. We find that 6{beta}4 integrin chains localize to the plasma membrane/caveolae and Arf6+ endocytic compartments. Based on FRAP and endocytosis assays, integrin recycling between both sites requires the small GTPase Arf6 and its co-regulators GIT1/{beta}PIX, but neither Caveolin1 (Cav1) nor Cavin1. Strikingly, when keratinocytes are stretched or hypo-osmotically shocked, 6{beta}4 integrin accumulates at cell edges, whereas Cav1 disappears from it. This process, which is isotropic relative to the orientation of stretch, depends on Arf6, Cav1 and Cavin1. We propose that mechanically-induced HD growth involves the isotropic flattening of caveolae (known for their mechanical buffering role) associated with integrin diffusion and turnover.",

    "abstract": "The stability analysis of dynamical neural network systems generally follows the route of finding a suitable Liapunov function after the fashion Hopfields famous paper on content addressable memory network or by finding conditions that make divergent solutions impossible. For the current work we focused on biological recurrent neural networks (bRNNs) that require transient external inputs (Cohen-Grossberg networks). In the current work we have proposed a general method to construct Liapunov functions for recurrent neural network with the help of a physically meaningful Hamiltonian function. This construct allows us to explore the emergent properties of the recurrent network (e.g., parameter configuration needed for winner-take-all competition in a leaky accumulator design) beyond that available in standard stability analysis, while also comparing well with standard stability analysis (ordinary differential equation approach) as a special case of the general stability constraint derived from the Hamiltonian formulation. We also show that the Cohen-Grossberg Liapunov function can be derived naturally from the Hamiltonian formalism. A strength of the construct comes from its usability as a predictor for behavior in psychophysical experiments involving numerosity and temporal duration judgements.",

Simulation of disease occurrence in a source population allows to estimate the statistical power of DAC and the influence of collider bias in CODGEI.

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is threatening to make gonorrhoea untreatable. Point-of-care (POC) tests that detect resistance promise individually tailored treatment, but might lead to more treatment and higher levels of resistance. We investigate the impact of POC tests on antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea. We used data about the prevalence and incidence of gonorrhoea in men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men and women (HMW) to calibrate a mathematical gonorrhoea transmission model. With this model, we simulated four clinical pathways for the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhoea: POC test with (POC + R) and without (POC - R) resistance detection, culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). We calculated the proportion of resistant infections, cases averted after 5 years, and compared how fast resistant infections spread in the populations. The proportion of resistant infections after 30 years is lowest for POC + R (median MSM: 0.18%, HMW: 0.12%), and increases for culture (MSM: 1.19%, HWM: 0.13%), NAAT (MSM: 100%, HMW: 99.27%), and POC - R (MSM: 100%, HMW: 99.73%). NAAT leads to 36 366 (median MSM) and 1 228 (median HMW) observed cases after 5 years. When compared with NAAT, POC + R results in most cases averted after 5 years (median MSM: 3 353, HMW: 118 per 100 000 persons). POC tests that detect resistance with intermediate sensitivity slow down resistance spread more than NAAT. POC tests with very high sensitivity for the detection of resistance are needed to slow down resistance spread more than using culture. POC with high sensitivity to detect antibiotic resistance can keep gonorrhoea treatable longer than culture or NAAT. POC tests without reliable resistance detection should not be introduced because they can accelerate the spread of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea.",

However, conventional observational studies are prone to bias such as reverse causation and residual confounding.\\n\\nMethodsIn this study, we used summary data to evaluate the association of genetically elevated C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and soluble interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) levels with schizophrenia in a two-sample Mendelian randomisation design.\\n\\nResultsThe pooled odds ratio estimate using 18 CRP genetic instruments was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84; 0.97) per two-fold increment in CRP levels; consistent results were obtained using different Mendelian randomisation methods and a more conservative set of instruments. The odds ratio for soluble IL-6R was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01; 1.12) per two-fold increment. Estimates for IL-1Ra were inconsistent among instruments and pooled estimates were imprecise and centred on the null.\\n\\nConclusionUnder Mendelian randomisation assumptions, our findings suggest a protective causal effect of CRP and a risk-increasing causal effect of soluble IL-6R (potentially mediated at least in part by CRP) on schizophrenia risk.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites are protists of the genus Plasmodium, whose transmission to mosquitoes is initiated by the production of gametes. Male gametogenesis is an extremely rapid process that is tightly controlled to produce eight flagellated microgametes from a single haploid gametocyte within 10 minutes after ingestion by a mosquito. Regulation of the cell cycle is poorly understood in divergent eukaryotes like Plasmodium, where the highly synchronous response of gametocytes to defined chemical and physical stimuli from the mosquito has proved to be a powerful model to identify specific phosphorylation events critical for cell-cycle progression. To reveal the wider network of phosphorylation signalling in a systematic and unbiased manner, we have measured a high-resolution time course of the phosphoproteome of P. berghei gametocytes during the first minute of gametogenesis. The data show an extremely broad response in which distinct cell-cycle events such as initiation of DNA replication and mitosis are rapidly induced and simultaneously regulated. We identify several protein kinases and phosphatases that are likely central in the gametogenesis signalling pathway and validate our analysis by investigating the phosphoproteomes of mutants in two of them, CDPK4 and SRPK1. We show these protein kinases to have distinct influences over the phosphorylation of similar downstream targets that are consistent with their distinct cellular functions, which is revealed by a detailed phenotypic analysis of an SRPK1 mutant. Together, the results show that key cell-cycle systems in Plasmodium undergo simultaneous and rapid phosphoregulation. We demonstrate how a highly resolved time-course of dynamic phosphorylation events can generate deep insights into the unusual cell biology of a divergent eukaryote, which serves as a model for an important group of human pathogens.",

    "abstract": "We frequently encounter the same item in different contexts, and when that happens, memories of earlier encounters can get reactivated in the brain. Here we examined how these existing memories are changed as a result of such reactivation. We hypothesized that when an items initial and subsequent neural representations overlap, this allows the initial item to become associated with novel contextual information, interfering with later retrieval of the initial context. That is, we predicted a negative relationship between representational similarity across repeated experiences of an item and subsequent source memory for the initial context. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study, in which objects were presented multiple times during different tasks. We measured the similarity of the neural patterns in lateral occipital cortex that were elicited by the first and second presentations of objects, and related this neural overlap score to source memory in a subsequent test. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater item-specific pattern similarity was linked to worse source memory for the initial task. Our findings suggest that the influence of novel experiences on an existing context memory depends on how reliably a shared component (i.e., same item) is represented across these episodes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pregnancy metabolic disruption is believed to be enhanced in obese women and lead to adverse outcomes in them and their offspring. The UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT), a randomised controlled trial of a lifestyle intervention in obese pregnant women, has already been shown to improve diet and physical activity. We used UPBEAT to determine (a) the magnitude of change in metabolic profiles in obese pregnant women and (b) the impact of a lifestyle intervention that successfully improved diet and physical activity on these profiles. Methods: Detailed targeted metabolic profiling, with quantification of 158 metabolic features (129 lipid measures, 9 glycerides and phospholipids, and 20 low-molecular weight metabolites) was completed on three occasions (~17-, 28- and 35-weeks of gestation) in the UPBEAT participants using NMR. Random intercept and random slope models were used to quantify metabolite changes in obese women using the control (usual care) group only (N = 577). The effect of the intervention was determined by comparing rates of metabolite change between those randomised to intervention and usual care, using intention to treat analyses (N = 1158). Results: There were adverse changes across pregnancy in most lipoprotein subclasses, lipids, glycerides, phospholipids, several fatty acids and glucose. All extremely large, very large, large, medium, small and very small VLDL particles increased by 2 to 3 standard deviation units (SD), with IDL, and large, medium and small LDL particles increasing by 1 to 2SD, between 16- and 36-weeks. Triglycerides increased by 3 to 4SD and glucose increased by 2SD, with more modest changes in other metabolites. The intervention reduced the rate of increase in extremely large, very large, large and medium VLDL, in particular those containing triglycerides. Triglyceride to phosphoglyceride ratio was reduced and there were improvements in fatty acid profiles (increases in the proportion of all fatty acids that were linoleic, omega-6 and polyunsaturated and decreases in the proportion of saturated). Conclusion: Systemic metabolism is markedly disrupted in obese pregnant women, but a lifestyle intervention that improved their diet and physical activity has beneficial effects on some of these profiles; these effects might have long-term benefit.

We test if these dynamics are associated with specific genetic lineages and evaluate gains and losses of resistance at the strain level.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted a 15 year retrospective observational study at two tertiary care institutions in Boston, MA of 31,589 adult inpatients with S. aureus infections. Surveillance swabs and duplicate specimens were excluded. We also sequenced a sample of contemporary isolates (n = 180) obtained between January 2016 and July 2016. We determined changes in the annual rates of infection per 1,000 inpatient admissions by S. aureus subtype and in the annual mean antibiotic resistance by subtype. We performed phylogenetic analysis to generate a population structure and infer gain and loss of the genetic determinants of resistance.\\n\\nResultsOf the 43,954 S. aureus infections over the study period, 21,779 were MRSA, 17,565 MSSA and 4,610 PSSA. After multivariate adjustment, annual rates of infection by S. aureus declined from 2003 to 2014 by 2.9% (95% CI, 1.6%-4.3%), attributable to an annual decline in MRSA of 9.1% (95% CI, 6.3%-11.9%) and in MSSA by 2.2% (95% CI, 0.4%-4.0%). PSSA increased over this time period by 4.6% (95% CI, 3.0%-6.3%) annually. Resistance in S. aureus decreased from 2000 to 2014 by 0.86 antibiotics (95% CI, 0.81-0.91). By phylogenetic inference, 5/35 MSSA and 2/20 PSSA isolates in the common MRSA lineages ST5/USA100 and ST8/USA300 arose from the loss of genes conferring resistance.\\n\\nConclusions and relevanceAt two large tertiary care centers in Boston, MA, S. aureus infections have decreased in rate and have become more susceptible to antibiotics, with a rise in PSSA making penicillin an increasingly viable and important treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsBehavioural and pharmacological support for smoking cessation improves the chances of success and represents a highly cost-effective way of preventing chronic disease and premature death. There are a large number of clinical stop-smoking services around the world. These could be connected into a global network to provide data to assess what treatment components are most effective, for what populations, in what settings. This requires data to be collected according to a minimum standard set of data items. This paper sets out a proposal for this global minimum data set.\\n\\nMethodsWe reviewed sets of data items used in clinical services that have already benefited from standardised approaches to using data. We identified client and treatment data items that may directly or indirectly influence outcome, and outcome variables that were practicable to obtain in clinical practice. We then consulted service providers in countries that may have an interest in taking part in a global network of smoking cessation services, and revised the sets of data items according to their feedback.\\n\\nResultsThree sets of data items are proposed. The first is a set of features characterising treatments offered by a service. The second is a core set of data items describing clients characteristics, engagement with the service, and outcomes. The third is an extended set of client data items to be captured in addition to the core data items wherever resources permit.\\n\\nConclusionsWe propose minimum standards for capturing data from clinical smoking cessation services globally. This could provide a basis for meaningful evaluations of different smoking cessation treatments in different populations in a variety of settings across many countries.",

Better identification of at-risk groups could benefit prevention and treatment programmes.

We used the 2007 and 2013-2014 DHS surveys conducted among 5,715 and 15,433 Zambian women, respectively (727 indicators in 2007; 688 in 2013-2014; 688 in both). We used false discovery rate criteria to identify indicators that are strongly associated with HIV-1 in univariate and multivariate models in the entire population, as well as in subgroups stratified by wealth, residence, age, and history of HIV-1 testing.\\n\\nFindingsIn the univariate analysis we identified 102 and 182 variables that are associated with HIV-1 in the 2007 and 2013-2014 surveys, respectively, among which 79 were associated in both. Variables that were associated with HIV-1 status in all full-sample models (unadjusted and adjusted) as well as in at least 17 out of 18 subgroups include being formerly in a union (adjusted OR 2007 2.8, p<10-16; 2013-2014 2.8, p<10-29), widowhood (adjusted OR 2007 3.7, p<10-12; 2013-2014 4.2, p<10-30), history of genital ulcers in the last 12 months (adjusted 2007 OR 2.4, p<10-5; 2013-2014 2.2, p<10-6), and having a woman for the head of the household (2007 OR 1.7, p<10-7; 2013-2014 OR 2.1, p<10-26), while owning a bicycle (adjusted 2007 OR 0.6, p<10-6; 2013-2014 0.6, p<10-8) and currently breastfeeding (adjusted 2007 OR 0.5, p<10-9; 2013-2014 0.4, p<10-26) were associated with decreased risk. Using the identified variables, area under the curve for HIV-1 positivity ranged from 0.76 to 0.82.\\n\\nInterpretationOur X-wide association study in Zambian women identifies multiple under-recognized factors correlated with HIV-1 infection in 2007 and 2013-2014, including widowhood, breastfeeding, and being the head of the household.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMendelian randomisation (MR) is being increasingly used to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. Availability of summary data of genetic associations for a variety of phenotypes from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) allows straightforward application of MR using summary data methods, typically in a two-sample design. In addition to the conventional inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, recently developed summary data MR methods, such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, allow a relaxation of the instrumental variable assumptions.\\n\\nMethodsHere, a new method -the mode-based estimate (MBE) - is proposed to obtain a single causal effect estimate from multiple genetic instruments. The MBE is consistent when the largest number of similar (identical in infinite samples) individual-instrument causal effect estimates comes from valid instruments, even if the majority of instruments are invalid. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulations designed to mimic the two-sample summary data setting, and demonstrate its use by investigating the causal effect of plasma lipid fractions and urate levels on coronary heart disease risk.\\n\\nResultsThe MBE presented less bias and type-I error rates than other methods under the null in many situations. Its power to detect a causal effect was smaller compared to the IVW and weighted median methods, but was larger than that of MR-Egger regression, with sample size requirements typically smaller than those available from GWAS consortia.\\n\\nConclusionsThe MBE relaxes the instrumental variable assumptions, and should be used in combination with other approaches in a sensitivity analysis.\\n\\nKey MessagesO_LISummary data Mendelian randomisation, typically in a two-sample setting, is being increasingly used due to the availability of summary association results from large genome- wide association studies.\\nC_LIO_LIMendelian randomisation analyses using multiple genetic instruments are prone to bias due to horizontal pleiotropy, especially when genetic instruments are selected based solely on statistical criteria.\\nC_LIO_LIA causal effect estimate robust to horizontal pleiotropy can be obtained using the mode- based estimate (MBE).\\nC_LIO_LIThe MBE requires that the most common causal effect estimate is a consistent estimate of the true causal effect, even if the majority of instruments are invalid (i.e., the ZEro Modal Pleiotropy Assumption, or ZEMPA).\\nC_LIO_LIPlotting the smoothed empirical density function is useful to explore the distribution of causal effect estimates, and to understand how the MBE is determined.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesCurrent guidelines for empirical antibiotic treatment poorly predict the presence of 3rd generation cephalosporin resistant Enterobacteriaceae (3GC-R EB) as a cause of infection, thereby increasing unnecessary carbapenem use. We aimed to develop diagnostic scoring systems to better predict the presence of 3GC-R EB as a cause of bacteraemia.\\n\\nMethodsA retrospective nested case-control study was performed that included patients [&ge;]18 years in whom blood cultures were obtained and intravenous antibiotics were initiated. Each patient with 3GC-R EB bacteraemia was matched to four control infection episodes within the same hospital, based on blood culture date and onset location (community or hospital). Starting from 32 described clinical risk factors at infection onset, selection strategies were used to derive scoring systems for the probability of community- and hospital-onset 3GC-R EB bacteraemia.\\n\\nResults3GC-R EB bacteraemia occurred in 90 of 22,506 (0.4%) community-onset and in 82 of 8,110 (1.0%) hospital-onset infections, and these cases were matched to 360 community-onset and 328 hospital-onset control episodes, respectively. The derived community-onset and hospital-onset scoring system consisted of 6 and 9 predictors, respectively, with c-statistics of 0.807 (95% confidence interval 0.756-0.855) and 0.842 (0.794-0.887). With selected score cutoffs, the models identified 3GC-R EB bacteraemia with equal sensitivity as existing guidelines, but reduced the proportion of patients classified as at risk for 3GC-R EB bacteraemia (i.e. eligible for empiric carbapenem therapy) with 40% in patients with community-onset and 49% in patients with hospital-onset infection.\\n\\nConclusionsThese prediction rules for 3GC-R EB bacteraemia may reduce unnecessary empiric carbapenem use.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCompleted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination by age 16 years among women in Switzerland ranges from 17 to 75% across 26 cantons. The consequences of regional heterogeneity in vaccination coverage on transmission and prevalence of HPV-16 are unclear.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a deterministic, population-based model that describes HPV-16 transmission among young adults within and between the 26 cantons of Switzerland. We parameterized the model using sexual behavior data from Switzerland and data from the Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey. First, we investigated the general consequences of heterogeneity in vaccination uptake between two sub-populations. We then compared the predicted prevalence of HPV-16 after the introduction of heterogeneous HPV vaccination uptake in all of Switzerland with homogeneous vaccination at an uptake that is identical to the national average (52%).\\n\\nResultsHPV-16 prevalence in women is 3.34% when vaccination is introduced and begins to diverge across cantons, ranging from 0.14 to 1.09% after 15 years of vaccination. After the same time period, overall prevalence of HPV-16 in Switzerland is only marginally higher (0.55 %) with heterogeneous vaccination uptake than with homogeneous uptake (0.49%). Assuming inter-cantonal sexual mixing, cantons with low vaccination uptake benefit from a reduction in prevalence at the expense of cantons with high vaccination uptake.\\n\\nConclusionsRegional variations in uptake diminish the overall effect of vaccination on HPV-16 prevalence in Switzerland, although the effect size is small. Cantonal efforts towards HPV-prevalence reduction by increasing vaccination uptake are impaired by cantons with low vaccination uptake. Harmonization of cantonal vaccination programs would reduce inter-cantonal differences in HPV-16 prevalence.",
