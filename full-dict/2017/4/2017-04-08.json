    "abstract": "Visual spatial information is paramount in guiding bimanual coordination, but anatomical factors, too, modulate performance in bimanual tasks. Vision conveys not only abstract spatial information, but also informs about body-related aspects such as posture. Here, we asked whether, accordingly, visual information induces body-related, or merely abstract, perceptual-spatial constraints in bimanual movement guidance. Human participants made rhythmic, symmetrical and parallel, bimanual index finger movements with the hands held in the same or different orientations. Performance was more accurate for symmetrical than parallel movements in all postures, but additionally when homologous muscles were concurrently active, such as when parallel movements were performed with differently rather than identically oriented hands. Thus, both perceptual and anatomical constraints were evident. We manipulated visual feedback with a mirror between the hands, replacing the image of the left with that of the right hand and creating the visual impression of bimanual symmetry independent of the right hands true movement. Symmetrical mirror feedback impaired parallel, but improved symmetrical bimanual performance compared with regular hand view. Critically, these modulations were independent of hand posture and muscle homology. Thus, vision appears to contribute exclusively to spatial, but not to body-related, anatomical movement coding in the guidance of bimanual coordination.",

    "abstract": "According to the competition account of lexical selection in word production, conceptually driven word retrieval involves the activation of a set of candidate words in left temporal cortex, and competitive selection of the intended word from this set, regulated by frontal cortical mechanisms. However, the relative contribution of these brain regions to competitive lexical selection is uncertain. In the present study, five patients with left prefrontal cortex lesions (overlapping in ventral and dorsal lateral cortex), eight patients with left lateral temporal cortex lesions (overlapping in middle temporal gyrus), and 13 matched controls performed a picture-word interference task. Distractor words were semantically related or unrelated to the picture, or the name of the picture (congruent condition). Semantic interference (related vs unrelated), tapping into competitive lexical selection, was examined. An overall semantic interference effect was observed for the control and left-temporal groups separately. The left-frontal patients did not show a reliable semantic interference effect as a group. The left-temporal patients had increased semantic interference in the error rates relative to controls. Error distribution analyses indicated that these patients had more hesitant responses for the related than for the unrelated condition. We propose that left middle temporal lesions affect the lexical activation component, making lexical selection more susceptible to errors.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome analyses have identified recurrent mutations in the cohesin complex in a wide range of human cancers. Here we demonstrate that the most frequently mutated subunit of the cohesin complex, STAG2, displays a strong synthetic lethal interaction with its paralog STAG1. Mechanistically, STAG1 loss abrogates sister chromatid cohesion in STAG2 mutated but not in wild-type cells leading to mitotic catastrophe, defective cell division and apoptosis. STAG1 inactivation inhibits the proliferation of STAG2 mutated but not wild-type bladder cancer and Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Restoration of STAG2 expression in a mutated bladder cancer model alleviates the dependency on STAG1. Thus, STAG1 and STAG2 act redundantly to support sister chromatid cohesion and cell survival. STAG1 represents a hardwired, context independent vulnerability of cancer cells carrying mutations in the major emerging tumor suppressor STAG2. Exploiting synthetic lethal interactions to target recurrent cohesin mutations in cancer, e.g. by inhibiting STAG1, holds the promise for the development of selective therapeutics.",

Thus, reads need not be stored locally, as they can be processed while downloading data and then discarded. We demonstrate this functionality by performing streaming graph assembly of publicly available data, and observe that the ratio of disk use to raw data size decreases as coverage is increased.\\n\\nResultsFaucet pairs the de Bruijn graph obtained from the reads with additional meta-data derived from them. We show these metadata - coverage counts collected at junction k-mers and connections bridging between junction pairs - contain most salient information needed for assembly, and demonstrate they enable cleaning of metagenome assembly graphs, greatly improving contiguity while maintaining accuracy. We compared Faucets resource use and assembly quality to state of the art metagenome assemblers, as well as leading resource-efficient genome assemblers. Faucet used orders of magnitude less time and disk space than the specialized metagenome assemblers MetaSPAdes and Megahit, while also improving on their memory use; this broadly matched performance of other assemblers optimizing resource efficiency - namely, Minia and LightAssembler. However, on metagenomes tested, Faucets outputs had 14-110% higher mean NGA50 lengths compared to Minia, and 2-11-fold higher mean NGA50 lengths compared to LightAssembler, the only other streaming assembler available.\\n\\nAvailabilityFaucet is available at https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/Faucet\\n\\nContactrshamir@tau.ac.il,eranhalperin@gmail.com\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Data quality is increasingly recognized as one of the most important confounding factors in brain imaging research. It is particularly important for studies of brain development, where age is systematically related to in-scanner motion and data quality. Prior work has demonstrated that in-scanner head motion biases estimates of structural neuroimaging measures. However, objective measures of data quality are not available for most structural brain images. Here we sought to identify quantitative measures of data quality for T1-weighted volumes, describe how such measures of quality relate to cortical thickness, and delineate how this in turn may bias inference regarding associations with age in youth. Three highly-trained raters provided manual ratings of 1,840 raw T1-weighted volumes. These images included a training set of 1,065 images from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a test set of 533 images from the PNC, as well as an external test set of 242 adults acquired on a different scanner. Manual ratings were compared to automated quality measures provided by the Preprocessed Connectomes Projects Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP), as well as FreeSurfers Euler number, which summarizes the topological complexity of the reconstructed cortical surface. Results revealed that the Euler number was consistently correlated with manual ratings across samples. Furthermore, the Euler number could be used to identify images scored \\\"unusable\\\" by human raters with a high degree of accuracy (AUC: 0.98-0.99), and outperformed proxy measures from functional timeseries acquired in the same scanning session. The Euler number also was significantly related to cortical thickness in a regionally heterogeneous pattern that was consistent across datasets and replicated prior results. Finally, data quality both inflated and obscured associations with age during adolescence. Taken together, these results indicate that reliable measures of data quality can be automatically derived from T1-weighted volumes, and that failing to control for data quality can systematically bias the results of studies of brain maturation.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing dispersal and movement patterns are vital to understanding the evolutionary ecology of species. For many reclusive species, such as reptiles, the observation of direct dispersal may be difficult or intractable. However, dispersal distances and patterns may be characterized through indirect genetic methods. We used genetic and capture data from the island night lizard (Xantusia riversiana) to estimate natal dispersal distances through indirect genetic methods, characterize movement and space use patterns, and compare these distances to previous estimates made from more traditional ecological approaches. We found that indirect estimates of natal dispersal were greater than previous field-based estimates of individual displacement of 3-5 m. Parent-offspring differences had a mean of approximately 14 m on Santa Barbara Island (SBI) and 41 m on San Clemente Island (SCI) whereas Wrights {sigma} was estimated at 16 m on SBI and 20 m for SCI. Spatial autocorrelation with correlograms of Morans I revealed large differences in the scale of autocorrelation between islands (SBI=375 m, SCI=1,813 m). Interpretation of these distances as average per generation distance of gene flow was incongruent with parentage analyses and {sigma}. We also used variograms to evaluate the range of spatial autocorrelation among two inter-individual genetic differences. The range of spatial autocorrelation again identified different scales on the two islands (102 - 169 m on SBI and 955 - 1,424 m on SCI). No evidence of sex-biased dispersal was found on either island. However, a permutation logistic regression revealed that related individuals >0.8 years old were more likely to be captured together on both islands. Overall, our findings suggest that field-based estimates of individual displacement within this species may underestimate genetic dispersal. We suggest indirect inferences of natal dispersal distances should focus on parentage analyses and Wrights {sigma} for parameter estimation of individual movement, whereas the ranges identified by spatial autocorrelation and variograms are likely to be relevant at the metapopulation or patch scales. Furthermore, characterization of capture patterns and relatedness revealed kin-affiliative behavior in X. riversiana, which may be indicative of delayed dispersal and cryptic sociality. These results highlight the power of parentage- and relatedness-based analyses for characterizing aspects of the movement ecology of reclusive species that may be difficult to observe directly. These data can then be leveraged to support future conservation and population modeling efforts and assess extinction risks and management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Optimal mating decisions depend on stable signaling systems because any independent changes in either the signal or its perception could carry a fitness cost. However, since the perception and production of specific mating signals are often mediated by different tissues and cell types, the genetic and cellular mechanisms that drive and maintain their coupling on the evolutionary and physiological timescales remain unknown for most animal species. Here, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster, sensory perception and synthesis of an inhibitory mating pheromone is regulated by the action of Gr8a, a member of the Gustatory receptor gene family. Particularly, Gr8a acts as a pheromone chemoreceptor in the sensory system of males and females, and, independently regulates pheromone synthesis in the male fat body and oenocytes. These data provide a relatively simple molecular explanation for how genetic coupling allows for the robust and stable flow of social information at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Polymers growing against a barrier generate force and push it forward. We study here force generation by a bundle of N rigid polymers growing in parallel against a diffusing, rigid, flat barrier, resembling a bundle of microtubules. To estimate the polymerization force, the barrier is subjected to a force f acting against the direction of growth of the polymers and the mean velocity VN (f) of the filament assembly is computed. The maximum polymerization force (alias stall force) [Formula] is deduced from the condition [Formula]. This problem has been studied in the literature earlier, but two important aspects have escaped attention: (a) free diffusion of monomers is hindered by the barrier, even when it is far from the growing tips and (b) parallel filaments could interact through the monomer density field (\\\"diffusive coupling\\\"), leading to negative interference between them. In our model, both these effects are investigated in detail. A mathematical treatment based on a set of continuum Fokker-Planck equations for combined filament-wall dynamics suggests that the barrier reduces the influx of monomers to the growing polymer tip, thereby reducing the growth velocity and also the stall force, but it doesnt affect the scaling of the stall force with number, i.e., [Formula]. However, Brownian dynamics simulations show that the linear scaling holds only when the filaments are far apart; when they are arranged close together, forming a bundle, sublinear scaling of force with number appears. We argue that the nonlinear scaling could be attributed to diffusive interaction between the growing tips which becomes significant when the tips are close together. These conclusions, initially established for simple flat-faced polymers, are also found to hold true for microtubules with their characteristic hollow cylindrical geometry and rugged tip structure. In particular, simulations show conclusively that the stall force of a single microtubule is a fraction of the combined stall force of the 13 protofilaments. This result is supported by a simple analytical estimate of the force using diffusive coupling theory, and is in agreement with earlier experimental observations.",

Here we characterise commitment by integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data from disaggregated primary human keratinocytes held in suspension for up to 12h to induce differentiation. We find that cell detachment induces a network of protein phosphatases. The pro-commitment phosphatases - including DUSP6, PPTC7, PTPN1, PTPN13 and PPP3CA - promote differentiation by negatively regulating ERK MAPK and positively regulating AP1 transcription factors. Their activity is antagonised by concomitant upregulation of DUSP10. Boolean network modelling of phosphatase interactions identifies commitment as an inherently unstable biological switch between the stem and differentiated cell states. Furthermore, phosphatase expression is spatially regulated both in vivo and in vitro. We conclude that an auto-regulatory phosphatase network maintains epidermal homeostasis by controlling the onset and duration of commitment.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the discovery of acetylcholine in 1913, its role as neuromodulator has been extensively studied in a variety of model systems. These previous studies revealed that acetylcholine is of critical importance for several cognitive functions including attention, learning and memory. In spite of these previous findings, it has proven difficult to determine the amount of acetylcholine that is released during cognitive tasks with sub-second temporal resolution. One method that might be used to measure acetylcholine release is the use of an enzyme-coupled amperometric sensor, which has been suggested to measure acetylcholine with high sensitivity, selectivity and relatively high temporal resolution (< 1 second). In the present study, we have tried to adapt the technique developed in the rodent model system by Parikh and colleagues1,2 for use in non-human primates. We aimed to measure in-vivo levels of acetylcholine in the macaque dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while the monkey performed an attention demanding curve-tracing task3,4. We report that our attempts to measure acetylcholine using amperometry in an awake behaving macaque monkey proved difficult and tedious and that our results are inconsistent and prone to noise. In the discussion, we will outline the challenges that will need to be addressed to use this technique in non-human primates and hope that our observations inspire solutions to help future research on the role of this important neurotransmitter.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ability of people to communicate with each other is a necessary component of social behavior and the normal development of individuals who live in a community. An apparent decline in sociability may be the result of a negative social environment or the development of affective and neurological disorders, including autistic spectrum disorders. The behavior of these humans may be characterized by the deterioration of socialization, low communication, and repetitive and restricted behaviors. This study aimed to analyze changes in the social behaviors of male mice induced by daily agonistic interactions and investigate the involvement of genes, related with autistic spectrum disorders in the process of the impairment of social behaviors.\\n\\nMethodsAbnormal social behavior is induced by repeated experiences of aggression accompanied by wins (winners) or chronic social defeats (losers) in daily agonistic interactions in male mice. The collected brain regions (the midbrain raphe nuclei, ventral tegmental area, striatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus) were sequenced at JSC Genoanalytica (http://genoanalytica.ru/, Moscow, Russia). The Cufflinks program was used to estimate the gene expression levels. Bioinformatic methods were used for the analysis of differentially expressed genes in male mice.\\n\\nResultsThe losers exhibited an avoidance of social contacts toward unfamiliar conspecific, immobility and low communication on neutral territory. The winners demonstrated aggression and hyperactivity in this condition. The exploratory activity (rearing) and approaching behavior time towards the partner were decreased, and the number of episodes of repetitive self-grooming behavior was increased in both social groups. These symptoms were similar to the symptoms observed in animal models of autistic spectrum disorders. In an analysis of the RNA-Seq database of the whole transcriptome in the brain regions of the winners and losers, we identified changes in the expression of the following genes, which are associated with autism in humans: Tph2, Maoa, Slc6a4, Htr7,Gabrb3, Nrxn1, Nrxn2, Nlgn1, Nlgn2, Nlgn3, Shank2, Shank3, Fmr1, Ube3a, Pten, Cntn3, Foxp2, Oxtr, Reln, Cadps2, Pcdh10, Ctnnd2, En2, Arx, Auts2, Mecp2, and Ptchd1.Common and specific changes in the expression of these genes in different brain regions were identified in the winners and losers.\\n\\nConclusionsThis research demonstrates for the first time that abnormalities in social behaviors that develop under a negative social environment in adults may be associated with alterations in expression of genes, related with autism in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growth of Open Access, illegally circumventing paywalls to access scholarly publications is becoming a more mainstream phenomenon. The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of {small tilde}28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons, and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing.",
