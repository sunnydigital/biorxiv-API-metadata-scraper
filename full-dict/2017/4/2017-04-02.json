    "abstract": "Fully Bayesian multispecies coalescent (MSC) methods like *BEAST estimate species trees from multiple sequence alignments. Today thousands of genes can be sequenced for a given study, but using that many genes with *BEAST is intractably slow. An alternative is to use heuristic methods which compromise accuracy or completeness in return for speed. A common heuristic is concatenation, which assumes that the evolutionary history of each gene tree is identical to the species tree. This is an inconsistent estimator of species tree topology, a worse estimator of divergence times, and induces spurious substitution rate variation when incomplete lineage sorting is present. Another class of heuristics directly motivated by the MSC avoids many of the pitfalls of concatenation but cannot be used to estimate divergence times. To enable fuller use of available data and more accurate inference of species tree topologies, divergence times, and substitution rates, we have developed a new version of *BEAST called StarBEAST2. To improve convergence rates we add analytical integration of population sizes, novel MCMC operators and other optimisations. Computational performance improved by 13.5x to 13.8x when analysing empirical data sets, and an average of 33.1 x across 30 simulated data sets. To enable accurate estimates of per-species substitution rates we introduce species tree relaxed clocks, and show that StarBEAST2 is a more powerful and robust estimator of rate variation than concatenation. StarBEAST2 is available through the BEAUTi package manager in BEAST 2.4 and above.",

    "abstract": "Representational models specify how activity patterns in populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context, representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the distribution of activity profiles across experimental conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA). Here we develop a common mathematical framework for understanding the relationship of these three methods, which share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be decoded from population activity with any readout mechanism capable of a linear transform. Using simulated data for three different experimental designs, we compare the power of the methods to adjudicate between competing representational models. PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the other two approaches - when conducted appropriately - can perform similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render different aspects of the information explicit (e.g. single-response tuning in encoding analysis and population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly construed as complementary components of a single data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.\\n\\nAuthor Summary\\n\\nModern neuroscience can measure activity of many neurons or the local blood oxygenation of many brain locations simultaneously. As the number of simultaneous measurements grows, we can better investigate how the brain represents and transforms information, to enable perception, cognition, and behavior. Recent studies go beyond showing that a brain region is involved in some function. They use representational models that specify how different perceptions, cognitions, and actions are encoded in brain-activity patterns. In this paper, we provide a general mathematical framework for such representational models, which clarifies the relationships between three different methods that are currently used in the neuroscience community. All three methods evaluate the same core feature of the data, but each has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Pattern component modelling (PCM) implements the most powerful test between models, and is analytically tractable and expandable. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) provides a highly useful summary statistic (the dissimilarity) and enables model comparison with weaker distributional assumptions. Finally, encoding models characterize individual responses and enable the study of their layout across cortex. We argue that these methods should be considered components of a larger toolkit for testing hypotheses about the way the brain represents information.",

    "abstract": "A detailed investigation of the surface-based methods for assessment of cortical volume and area from magnetic resonance images shows that volume mostly mirrors variability in surface area, while having little sensitivity to cortical thickness, and this remains the case even when volume is assessed using an improved analytic method. Using data from young adults born with very low birth weight and coetaneous controls, it is demonstrated that the permutation-based non-parametric combination (NPC) of thickness and area is more sensitive than volume for studying joint effects on these two quantities, giving equal weight to variation in both. NPC can replace current analyses of cortical volume altogether, allowing a better characterisation of processes that can concomitantly influence brain anatomy, even when their effects are in opposite directions. The method is remarkably general and can be extended to other indices of brain structure and function.",

They are integrated in a modular and versatile processing pipeline, adaptable to different needs.

    "abstract": "How do large-scale brain networks reorganize during the waxing and waning of anxious anticipation? Here, threat was dynamically modulated during functional MRI as two circles slowly meandered on the screen; if they touched, an unpleasant shock was delivered. We employed intersubject network analysis, which allows the investigation of network-level properties \\\"across brains,\\\" and sought to determine how network properties changed during periods of approach (circles moving closer) and periods of retreat (circles moving apart). Dynamic threat altered network cohesion across the salience, executive, and task-negative networks, as well as subcortical regions. Functional connections between subcortical regions and the salience network also increased during approach vs. retreat, including the putative periaqueductal gray, habenula, and amygdala, showing that the latter is involved under conditions of relatively prolonged and uncertain threat (the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis was observed during both approach and retreat). Together, our findings unraveled dynamic properties of large-scale networks across participants while threat levels varied continuously, and demonstrate the potential of characterizing emotional processing at the level of distributed networks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the brain basis of anxious anticipation is important not only from a basic research perspective, but because aberrant responding to uncertain future negative events is believed to be central to anxiety disorders. Although previous studies have investigated how brain responses are sensitive to threat proximity, little is known about how patterns of response co-activation change during dynamic manipulations of threat. To address these important gaps in the literature, we studied the dynamics of emotional processing at the level of large-scale brain networks by devising a manipulation in which threat was dynamically modulated during functional MRI scanning.",

However, neither high-quality reference genome nor large-scale full-length cDNA sequences for this outcrossing hexaploid are still lacking, which in turn impedes progress in research studies in sweetpotato functional genomics and molecular breeding. In this study, we apply a combination of second- and third-generation sequencing technologies to sequence full-length transcriptomes in sweetpotato and its putative ancestor I. trifida. In total, we obtained 53,861/51,184 high-quality transcripts, which includes 34,963/33,637 putative full-length cDNA sequences, from sweetpotato/I. trifida. Amongst, we identified 104,540/94,174 open reading frames, 1476/1475 transcription factors, 25,315/27,090 simple sequence repeats, 417/531 long non-coding RNAs out of the sweetpotato/I. trifida dataset. By utilizing public available genomic contigs, we analyzed the gene features (including exon number, exon size, intron number, intron size, exon-intron structure) of 33,119 and 32,793 full-length transcripts in sweetpotato and I. trifida, respectively. Furthermore, comparative analysis between our transcript datasets and other large-scale cDNA datasets from different plant species enables us assessing the quality of public datasets, estimating the genetic similarity across relative species, and surveyed the evolutionary pattern of genes. Overall, our study provided fundamental resources of large-scale full-length transcripts in sweetpotato and its putative ancestor, for the first time, and would facilitate structural, functional and comparative genomics studies in this important crop.",

    "abstract": "An outstanding challenge in the design of synthetic biocircuits is the development of a robust and efficient strategy for interconnecting functional modules. Recent work demonstrated that a phosphorylation-based insulator (PBI) implementing a dual strategy of high gain and strong negative feedback can be used as a device to attenuate retroactivity. This paper describes the implementation of such a biological circuit in a cell-free transcription-translation system and the structural identifiability of the PBI in the system. We first show that the retroactivity also exists in the cell-free system by testing a simple negative regulation circuit. Then we demonstrate that the PBI circuit helps attenuate the retroactivity significantly compared to the control. We consider a complex model that provides an intricate description of all chemical reactions and leveraging specific physiologically plausible assumptions. We derive a rigorous simplified model that captures the output dynamics of the PBI. We perform standard system identification analysis and determine that the model is globally identifiable with respect to three critical parameters. These three parameters are identifiable under specific experimental conditions and we perform these experiments to estimate the parameters. Our experimental results suggest that the functional form of our simplified model is sufficient to describe the reporter dynamics and enable parameter estimation. In general, this research illustrates the utility of the cell-free expression system as an alternate platform for biocircuit implementation and system identification and it can provide helpful insights into future biological circuit designs.",

    "abstract": "Mutations are the raw material for evolutionary change. While the mutation rate has been thought constant between individuals, recent research has shown that poor genetic condition can elevate the mutation rate. Mitonuclear genetic conflict is a potential source of poor genetic condition, and considering the high mutation rate of mitochondrial genomes, there should be ample scope for mitochondrial mutations to interfere with genetic condition, with concomitant effects on the nuclear mutation rate. Moreover, because theory suggests mitochondrial genetic effects will often be male-biased, such effects could be more strongly felt in males than females. Here, by mating irradiated male Drosophila melanogaster to isogenic females bearing six distinct mitochondrial haplotypes, we tested whether mitochondrial genetic variation affects DNA repair capacity, and whether effects of mutation load on reproductive function are shaped by interactions between sex and mitochondrial haplotype. We found mitochondrial genetic effects on DNA repair, and that the mutational variance of reproductive fitness was higher in males bearing haplotypes characterized by high female fitness. These results suggest that mitochondrial genome variation may affect the mutation rate, and that induced mutations interact more strongly with male than female reproductive function. The potential for haplotype-specific effects on the nuclear mutation rate has broad implications for evolutionary dynamics, such as the accumulation of genetic load, adaptive potential, and the evolution of sexual dimorphism.",

Population-level traits of hosts such as population size, host density and geographic range size have all been shown to be important determinants of host pathogen richness. However, empirically identifying the independent influences of these traits has proven difficult as many of these traits directly depend on each other. Here we develop a mechanistic, metapopulation, susceptible-infected-recovered model to identify the independent influences of these population-level traits on the ability of a newly evolved pathogen to invade and persist in host populations in the presence of an endemic pathogen. We use bats as a case study as they are highly social and an important source of zoonotic disease. We show that larger populations and group sizes had a greater influence on the chances of pathogen invasion and persistence than increased host density or the number of groups. As anthropogenic change affects these traits to different extents, this increased understanding of how traits independently determine pathogen richness will aid in predicting future zoonotic spill-over risk.",

After verifying the feasibility of the circuit design, we used a fast assembling method to build the constructs and used the linear DNAs directly in the cell-free system for prototyping. After additional tests and assemblies, we implemented the circuit in plasmid forms in cells and showed that the in vivo results were consistent with the simulations and the outcomes in the cell-free platform. This study showed the usefulness of modeling and prototyping in building synthetic biocircuits and that we can use these tools to help streamline the process of circuit optimizations in future studies.",

However, as the significance of the modern information economy expands in scope and permeates the healthcare domain, there is an increasing urgency for healthcare organisations to offer information systems that address the expectations of clinicians, researchers and the business intelligence community alike. Amongst other emergent requirements, the principal unmet need might be defined as the 3R principle (right data, right place, right time) to address deficiencies in organisational data flow while retaining the strict information governance policies that apply within the UK National Health Service (NHS). Here, we describe our work on creating and deploying a low cost structured and unstructured information retrieval and extraction architecture within Kings College Hospital, the management of governance concerns and the associated use cases and cost saving opportunities that such components present.\\n\\nResultsTo date, our CogStack architecture has processed over 300 million lines of clinical data, making it available for internal service improvement projects at Kings College London. On generated data designed to simulate real world clinical text, our de-identification algorithm achieved up to 94% precision and up to 96% recall.\\n\\nConclusionWe describe a toolkit which we feel is of huge value to the UK (and beyond) healthcare community.

Surprisingly, already before zygote pronuclear fusion we observed drastic changes in the transcriptome compared to the unfertilized egg: 1,804 gene transcripts and 32 repeat elements become more abundant, among these the double-homeobox gene DUX4. Several genes previously identified as DUX4 targets, such as CCNA1, KHDC1L and ZSCAN4, as well as several members of the RFPLs, TRIMS and PRAMEFs1 were accumulated in 4-cell stage blastomeres, suggesting DUX4 as an early regulator. In the 8-cell stage, we observed two distinct cell types - a transcript-poor cell type, and a transcript-rich cell type with many Alu repeats and accumulated markers for pluripotency and stemness, telomere elongation and growth. In summary, this unprecedented detailed view of the first three days of human embryonic development reveals more complex changes in the transcriptome than what was previously known.",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of cell fusion for mammalian development and physiology, the factors critical for this process remain to be fully defined1. This lack of knowledge has severely limited our ability to reconstitute cell fusion, which is necessary to decipher the biochemical mechanisms driving plasma membrane merger. Myomaker (Tmem8c) is a muscle-specific protein required for myoblast fusion2,3. Expression of myomaker in fibroblasts drives their fusion with myoblasts, but not with other myomaker-fibroblasts, highlighting the requirement of additional myoblast-derived factors for fusion. Here, we demonstrate that Gm7325, named myomerger, induces the fusion of myomaker-expressing fibroblasts. Cell mixing experiments reveal that while myomaker renders cells fusion-competent, myomerger induces fusogenicity. Thus, myomaker and myomerger confer fusogenic activity to normally non-fusogenic cells. Myomerger is skeletal muscle-specific and only expressed during developmental and regenerative myogenesis. Disruption of myomerger in myoblast cell lines through Cas9-mutagenesis generated non-fusogenic myocytes. Genetic deletion of myomerger in mice results in a paucity of muscle fibers demonstrating a requirement for myomerger in normal muscle formation. Myomerger deficient myocytes exhibit an ability to differentiate and harbor organized sarcomeres, however remain mono-nucleated. These data identify myomerger as a fundamental myoblast fusion protein and establishes a system that begins to reconstitute mammalian cell fusion.",

    "abstract": "The process of molecular evolution has been dominated by the Kimura paradigm for nearly 60 years; mutations arise at a certain rate in the population and they go to fixation with a probability given by Kimuras classic formula, which assumes there are no further mutations that interfere with the fixation process. An alternative view is that rare variants exist in the population in a mutation-drift-selection balance and rise to fixation through a combination of chance (genetic drift), selection and mutation. When mutations increase in strength, but still in the weak regime, we would expect the Kimura rate approximation to be an overestimate, as a rare variant which grows in frequency will suffer a greater backward flux of mutations, slowing progress to fixation. However, to date calculating important quantities for a general model of selection and mutation, like the rate of fixation of these rare variants has not been tractable in the conventional diffusion approximation of population genetics. Here, we use Fishers angular transformation to convert the frequency-dependent diffusion inherent in population genetics to simple diffusion in an effective potential, which describes the forces of selection, drift and mutation. Once this potential is defined it is simple to show that the mean first passage time is given by a double integral which relate to populations at the barrier. Exact numerical integration shows excellent agreement with discrete Wright-Fisher simulations, which do show a slowing down of the fixation of mutants at higher mutation rates and for strong positive selection, compared to the Kimura prediction. We then seek a closed-form analytical expression for the rate of fixation of mutants, by adapting Kramers approximation for the mean first passage time. This overall gives an accurate approximation, but however, does not improve on the Kimura rate.",

    "abstract": "Developmental system drift is a likely mechanism for the origin of hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species. We examine here the detailed mechanistic basis of hybrid incompatibilities for a genotype-phenotype map for developmental system drift under stabilising selection, where the organismal phenotype is conserved, but the underlying molecular phenotypes and genotype can drift. This leads to number of emergent phenomenon not obtainable by modelling genotype or phenotype alone. Our results show that: 1) speciation is more rapid at smaller population sizes with a characteristic, Orr-like, power law, but at large population sizes slow, characterised by a sub-diffusive growth law; 2) the molecular phenotypes under weakest selection contribute to the earliest incompatibilities; and 3) pairwise incompatibilities dominate over higher order, contrary to previous predictions that the latter should dominate. Our results indicate that biophysics and population size provide a much stronger constraint to speciation than suggested by previous models.",

    "abstract": "Most modern mammals, including strictly diurnal species, exhibit sensory adaptations to nocturnal activity, thought to be the result of a prolonged nocturnal phase or  bottleneck during early mammalian evolution. Nocturnality may have allowed mammals to avoid antagonistic interactions with diurnal dinosaurs during the Mesozoic. However, understanding the evolution of mammalian activity patterns is hindered by scant and ambiguous fossil evidence. While ancestral reconstructions of behavioural traits from extant species have the potential to elucidate these patterns, existing studies have been limited in taxonomic scope. Here, we use an extensive behavioural dataset for 2415 species from all extant orders to reconstruct ancestral activity patterns across Mammalia. We find strong support for the nocturnal origin of mammals and the Cenozoic appearance of diurnality, although cathemerality (mixed diel periodicity) may have appeared in the late Cretaceous. Simian primates are among the earliest mammals to exhibit strict diurnal activity, some 52-33Mya. Our study is consistent with the hypothesis that temporal partitioning between early mammals and dinosaurs during the Mesozoic led to a mammalian nocturnal bottleneck, but also demonstrates the need for improved phylogenetic estimates for Mammalia.",

    "abstract": "The reanalysis of publicly available GWAS data represents a powerful and cost-effective opportunity to gain insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of complex diseases. We demonstrate this by gathering and reanalyzing public type 2 diabetes (T2D) GWAS data for 70,127 subjects, using an innovative imputation and association strategy based on multiple reference panels (1000G and UK10K). This approach led us replicate and fine map 50 known T2D loci, and identify seven novel associated regions: five driven by common variants in or near LYPLAL1, NEUROG3, CAMKK2, ABO and GIP genes; one by a low frequency variant near EHMT2; and one driven by a rare variant in chromosome Xq23, associated with a 2.7-fold increased risk for T2D in males, and located within an active enhancer associated with the expression of Angiotensin II Receptor type 2 gene (AGTR2), a known modulator of insulin sensitivity. We further show that the risk T allele reduces binding of a nuclear protein, resulting in increased enhancer activity in muscle cells. Beyond providing novel insights into the genetics and pathophysiology of T2D, these results also underscore the value of reanalyzing publicly available data using novel analytical approaches.",

    "abstract": "For monoclonal antibodies, mathematical models of target mediated drug disposition (TMDD) are often fit to data in order to estimate key physiological parameters of the system. These parameter estimates can then be used to support drug development by assisting with the assessment of whether the target is druggable and what the first in human dose should be. The TMDD model is almost always over-parameterized given the available data, resulting in the practical unidentifiability of some of the model parameters, including the target receptor density. In particular, when only PK data is available, the receptor density is almost always practically unidentifiable. However, because practical identifiability is not regularly assessed, incorrect interpretation of model fits to the data can be made. This issue is illustrated using two case studies from the literature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreasing antibiotic resistance limits treatment options for gonorrhea. We examined the extent to which a hypothetical point-of-care (POC) test reporting antibiotic susceptibility profiles could slow the spread of resistance.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a deterministic compartmental model describing gonorrhea transmission in a single-sex population with three antibiotics available to treat infections. Probabilities of resistance emergence on treatment and fitness costs associated with resistance were based on characteristics of ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone. We evaluated time to 1% and 5% prevalence of resistant strains among all isolates with: (1) empiric treatment (azithromycin plus ceftriaxone), and treatment guided by POC tests determining susceptibility to (2) ciprofloxacin only and (3) all three antibiotics.\\n\\nFindingsBased on current gonococcal susceptibility patterns in the United States, the model indicated that continued empiric dual antibiotic treatment without POC testing resulted in >5% of isolates being resistant to both azithromycin and ceftriaxone within 15 years. When either POC test was used in 10% of identified cases, this was delayed by 5 years. The three antibiotic POC test delayed the time to reach 1% prevalence of triply-resistant strains by 6 years, while the ciprofloxacin-only test resulted in no delay. Results were less sensitive to assumptions about fitness costs and test characteristics with increasing test uptake. The main limitation of this study is that we made simplifying assumptions to describe gonorrhea transmission and the emergence and spread of resistance in the population.\\n\\nConclusionsRapid diagnostics that report antibiotic susceptibility have the potential to extend the usefulness of existing antibiotics for treatment of gonorrhea. Monitoring resistance patterns will be critical with the introduction of such tests.",
