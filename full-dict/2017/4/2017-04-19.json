    "abstract": "Diverse eukaryotic cells crawl through complex environments using distinct modes of migration. To understand the underlying mechanisms and their evolutionary relationships, we must define each mode, and identify its phenotypic and molecular markers. Here, we focus on a widely dispersed migration mode characterized by dynamic, actin-filled pseudopods that we call \\\"-motility.\\\" Mining genomic data reveals a clear trend: only organisms with both WASP and SCAR/WAVE--activators of branched actin assembly--make actin-filled pseudopods. While SCAR has been shown to drive pseudopod formation, WASPs role in this process is controversial. We hypothesize that these genes together represent a genetic signature of -motility, because both are used for pseudopod formation. WASP depletion from human neutrophils confirms that both proteins are involved in explosive actin polymerization, pseudopod formation, and cell migration, and colocalize to dynamic signaling structures. Moreover, retention of WASP together with SCAR correctly predicts -motility in disease-causing chytrid fungi, which we show crawl at >30 m/min with actin-filled pseudopods. By focusing on one migration mode in many eukaryotes, we identify a genetic marker of pseudopod formation, the morphological feature of -motility, providing evidence for a widely distributed mode of cell crawling with a single evolutionary origin.",

    "abstract": "The interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density, i.e. the selection coefficient per base pair, is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared to what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampus stores spatial representations, or maps, which are recalled each time a subject is placed in the corresponding environment. Across different environments of similar geometry, these representations show strong orthogonality in CA3 of hippocampus, whereas in the CA1 subfield a considerable overlap between the maps can be seen. The lower orthogonality decreases reliability of various decoders developed in an attempt to identify which of the stored maps is active at the mo-ment. Especially, the problem with decoding emerges with a need to analyze data at high temporal resolution. Here, we introduce a functional-connectivity-based de-coder, which accounts for the pairwise correlations between the spiking activities of neurons in each map and does not require any positional information, i.e. any knowledge about place fields. We first show, on recordings of hippocampal activity in constant environmental conditions, that our decoder outperforms existing decoding methods in CA1. Our decoder is then applied to data from teleportation experiments, in which an instantaneous switch between the environment identity triggers a recall of the corresponding spatial representation. We test the sensitivity of our approach on the transition dynamics between the respective memory states (maps). We find that the rate of spontaneous state shifts (flickering) after a teleportation event is increased not only within the first few seconds as already reported, but this instability is sustained across much longer (> 1 min.) periods.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing changes are frequently observed in cancer and are starting to be recognized as important signatures for tumor progression and therapy. However, their functional impact and relevance to tumorigenesis remains mostly unknown. We carried out a systematic analysis to characterize the potential functional consequences of alternative splicing changes in thousands of tumor samples. This analysis revealed that a subset of alternative splicing changes affect protein domain families that are frequently mutated in tumors and potentially disrupt protein protein interactions in cancer-related pathways. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between the number of these alternative splicing changes in a sample and the number of somatic mutations in drivers. We propose that a subset of the alternative splicing changes observed in tumors may represent independent oncogenic processes that could be relevant to explain the functional transformations in cancer and some of them could potentially be considered alternative splicing drivers (AS-drivers).",

    "abstract": "Language comprehension engages a cortical network of left frontal and temporal regions. Activity in this network is language-selective, showing virtually no modulation by non-linguistic tasks. In addition, language comprehension engages a second network consisting of bilateral frontal, parietal, cingulate, and insular regions. Activity in this \\\"Multiple Demand (MD)\\\" network scales with comprehension difficulty, but also with cognitive effort across a wide range of non-linguistic tasks in a domain-general fashion. Given the functional dissociation between the language and MD networks, their respective contributions to comprehension are likely distinct, yet such differences remain elusive. Critically, given that each network is sensitive to some linguistic features, prior research has assumed - implicitly or explicitly - that both networks track linguistic input closely, and in a manner consistent across individuals. Here, we used fMRI to directly test this assumption by comparing the BOLD signal time-courses in each network across different people listening to the same story. Language network activity showed fewer individual differences, indicative of closer input tracking, whereas MD network activity was more idiosyncratic and, moreover, showed lower reliability within an individual across repetitions of a story. These findings constrain cognitive models of language comprehension by suggesting a novel distinction between the processes implemented in the language and MD networks.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLanguage comprehension recruits both language-specific mechanisms and domain-general mechanisms that are engaged in many cognitive processes. In the human cortex, language-selective mechanisms are implemented in the left-lateralized \\\"core language network\\\", whereas domain-general mechanisms are implemented in the bilateral \\\"Multiple Demand (MD)\\\" network. Here, we report the first direct comparison of the respective contributions of these networks to naturalistic story comprehension. Using a novel combination of neuroimaging approaches we find that MD regions track stories less closely than language regions. This finding constrains the possible contributions of the MD network to comprehension, contrasts with accounts positing that this network has continuous access to linguistic input, and suggests a new typology of comprehension processes based on their extent of input tracking.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection that affected modern humans early in their evolution has likely shaped some of the traits that set present-day humans apart from their closest extinct and living relatives. The ability to detect ancient natural selection in the human genome could provide insights into the molecular basis for these human-specific traits. Here, we introduce a method for detecting ancient selective sweeps by scanning for extended genomic regions where our closest extinct relatives, Neandertals and Denisovans, fall outside of the present-day human variation. Regions that are unusually long indicate the presence of lineages that reached fixation in the human population faster than expected under neutral evolution. Using simulations we show that the method is able to detect ancient events of positive selection and that it can differentiate those from background selection. Applying our method to the 1000 Genomes dataset, we find evidence for ancient selective sweeps favoring regulatory changes and present a list of genomic regions that are predicted to underlie positively selected human specific traits.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium difficile is the largest single cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial community which protects from C. difficile colonization. Multiple antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility; many leading to distinct community structures stemming from variation in bacterial targets of action. These community structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difficile. Therefore we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments. Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated C. difficile highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difficile spore formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C. difficile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C. difficile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C. difficile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm integrating network architecture. This platform identified nutrients C. difficile used preferentially between pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the hypothesis that C. difficile inhabits alternative nutrient niches across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for nitrogen-containing carbon sources, particularly Stickland fermentation substrates and host-derived glycans.\\n\\nImportanceInfection by the bacterium Clostridium difficile causes an inflammatory diarrheal disease which can become life-threatening, and has grown to be the most prevalent nosocomial infection. Susceptibility to C. difficile infection is strongly associated with previous antibiotic treatment, which disrupts the gut microbiota and reduces its ability to prevent colonization. In this study we demonstrated that C. difficile altered pathogenesis between hosts pretreated with antibiotics from separate classes, and exploited different nutrient sources across these environments. Our metabolite score calculation also provides a platform to study nutrient requirements of pathogens during an infection. Our results suggest that C. difficile colonization resistance is mediated by multiple groups of bacteria competing for several subsets of nutrients and could explain why total reintroduction of competitors through fecal microbial transplant currently is the most effective treatment for recurrent CDI. This work could ultimately contribute to the identification of targeted, context-dependent measures that prevent or reduce C. difficile colonization including pre- and probiotic therapies.",

    "abstract": "Spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) and spotted dolphins (S. attenuata) show high intraspecific morphological diversity and endemic subspecies in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). Previous studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have found low genetic differentiation among most of these groups, possibly due to demographic factors, ongoing gene flow, and/or recent divergence. These species were heavily depleted due to bycatch in the ETP yellowfin tuna fishery. Because population structure is important for accurate management of the recovery of these species, we collected whole mitochondrial genome sequences from 104 spinner and 76 spotted dolphins to test structure hypotheses at multiple hierarchical levels. Our results showed significant differences between subspecies of spotted (FST: 0.0125; P = 0.0402) and spinner dolphins (FST: 0.0133; P = 0.034), but no support for the division of existing offshore stocks of spotted dolphins or Tres Marias spinner dolphins. We compare these results to previous results of genome-wide nuclear SNP data and suggest high haplotype diversity, female dispersal, male philopatry, or relative power of the two datasets explains the differences observed. Our results further support a genetic basis for biologically meaningful management units at the subspecies level, and provide a critical component to mitigating historical and continued fishery interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene duplication is a major factor contributing to evolutionary novelty, and the contraction or expansion of gene families has often been associated with morphological, physiological and environmental adaptations. The study of homologous genes helps us to understand the evolution of gene families. It plays a vital role in finding ancestral gene duplication events as well as identifying genes that have diverged from a common ancestor under positive selection. There are various tools available, such as MSOAR, OrthoMCL and HomoloGene, to identify gene families and visualise syntenic information between species, providing an overview of syntenic regions evolution at the family level. Unfortunately, none of them provide information about structural changes within genes, such as the conservation of ancestral exon boundaries amongst multiple genomes. The Ensembl GeneTrees computational pipeline generates gene trees based on coding sequences and provides details about exon conservation, and is used in the Ensembl Compara project to discover gene families.\\n\\nFindingsA certain amount of expertise is required to configure and run the Ensembl Compara GeneTrees pipeline via command line. Therefore, we have converted the command line Ensembl Compara GeneTrees pipeline into a Galaxy workflow, called GeneSeqToFamily, and provided additional functionality.

Using genetic labelling techniques in zebrafish we were able, for the first time, to dynamically track cell behaviours in intact moving joints. We identify that proliferation and migration, which contribute to joint morphogenesis, are mechanically controlled and are significantly reduced in immobilised larvae. By comparison to strain maps of the developing skeleton we identify canonical Wnt signalling as a candidate to transduce mechanical forces into joint cell behaviours. We show that in the jaw Wnt signalling is reduced specifically in regions of high strain in response to loss of muscle activity. By pharmacological manipulation of canonical Wnt signalling we demonstrate that Wnt acts downstream of mechanical activity and is required for joint patterning and chondrocyte maturation. Wntl6, independent of muscle activity, controls proliferation and migration, but plays no role in chondrocyte intercalation.",

    "abstract": "Malignant spreading involves the migration of cancer cells amongst other native cell types. For example, in vivo melanoma invasion involves individual melanoma cells migrating through native skin, which is composed of several distinct subpopulations of cells. Here, we aim to quantify how interactions between melanoma and fibroblast cells affect the collective spreading of a heterogeneous population of these cells in vitro. We perform a suite of circular barrier assays that includes: (i) monoculture assays with fibroblast cells; (ii) monoculture assays with SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells; and (iii) a series of co-culture assays initiated with three different ratios of SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells and fibroblast cells. Using immunostaining, detailed cell density histograms are constructed to illustrate how the two subpopulations of cells are spatially arranged within the spreading heterogeneous population. Calibrating the solution of a continuum partial differential equation to the experimental results from the monoculture assays allows us to estimate the cell diffusivity and the cell proliferation rate for the melanoma and the fibroblast cells, separately. Using the parameter estimates from the monoculture assays, we then make a prediction of the spatial spreading in the co-culture assays. Results show that the parameter estimates obtained from the monoculture assays lead to a reasonably accurate prediction of the spatial arrangement of the two subpopulations in the co-culture assays. Overall, the spatial pattern of spreading of the melanoma cells and the fibroblast cells is very similar in monoculture and co-culture conditions. Therefore, we find no clear evidence of any interactions other than cell-to-cell contact and crowding effects.",

This also suggested the potential conservation of a genome wide epigenetic regulation program in animal stem cells, so we assessed the regulatory effects of Mll3/4 loss of function by performing RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on the G2/M planarian stem cell population, part of which contributes to the formation of outgrowths. We find many oncogenes and tumour suppressors among the affected genes that are therefore likely candidates for mediating MLL3/4 tumour suppression function in mammals, where little is known about in vivo regulatory targets. Our work demonstrates conservation of an important epigenetic regulatory program in animals and highlights the utility of the planarian model system for studying epigenetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "Cheap sequencing has driven the proliferation of big human genome data aggregation consortiums, providing extensive reference datasets for genome research. These datasets, however, may come with restrictive terms of use, conditioned by the consent frameworks within which individuals donate their data. Having an aggregated genome dataset with unrestricted use, analogous to public domain licensing, is therefore unusually rare. Yet public domain data is tremendously useful because it allows freedom to perform research with it. This comes with the price of donors surrendering their privacy and accepting the associated risks derived from publishing personal data. Using the Repositive platform (https://repositive.io/?23andMe), an indexing service for human genome datasets, we aggregated all deposited files in public data sources under a CC0 license from 23andMe, a leading Direct-to-Consumer genetic testing service. After downloading 3,137 genotypes, we filtered out those that were incomplete, corrupt or duplicated, ending up with a dataset of 2,280 curated files, each one corresponding to a unique individual. Although the size of this dataset is modest compared to current major genome data aggregation projects, its full access and licensing terms, which allows free reuse without attribution, make it a useful reference pool for validation purposes and control experiments.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings suggest that relative investment of females and males into parental care depends on the populations adult sex-ratio. For example, all else being equal, males should be the more caring sex if the sex ratio is male biased. Whether such outcomes are evolutionary fixed (i.e. related to the species typical sex-ratio) or whether they arise through flexible responses of individuals to the current population sex-ratio remains unclear. Nevertheless, a flexible response might be limited by evolutionary history when one sex loses the ability to care or when a single parent cannot successfully care. Here, we demonstrate that after the disappearance of one parent, individuals from 8 out of 15 biparentally incubating shorebird species were able to incubate uniparentally for 1-19 days (median = 3, N = 69). Such uniparental phases often resembled the incubation rhythm of species with obligatory uniparental incubation. Although it has been suggested that females of some shorebirds desert their brood after hatching, our findings indicate that either sex may desert prior to hatching. Strikingly, in 27% of uniparentally incubated clutches - from 5 species - we document successful hatching. Our data thus reveal the potential for a flexible switch from biparental to uniparental care.",

However, short reads are most applicable when data can be aligned to a known reference. Two new methods for de novo assembly are linked-reads and restriction-site labeled optical maps. We combined commercial applications of these technologies for genome assembly of an endangered mammal, the Hawaiian Monk seal.\\n\\nWe show that the linked-reads produced with 10X Genomics Chromium chemistry and assembled with Supernova v1.1 software produced scaffolds with an N50 of 22.23 Mbp with the longest individual scaffold of 84.06 Mbp. When combined with Bionano Genomics optical maps using Bionano RefAligner, the scaffold N50 increased to 29.65 Mbp for a total of 170 hybrid scaffolds, the longest of which was 84.78 Mbp. These results were 161X and 215X, respectively, improved over DISCOVAR de novo assemblies. The quality of the scaffolds was assessed using conserved synteny analysis of both the DNA sequence and predicted seal proteins relative to the genomes of humans and other species. We found large blocks of conserved synteny suggesting that the hybrid scaffolds were high quality. An inversion in one scaffold complementary to human chromosome 6 was found and confirmed by optical maps.\\n\\nThe complementarity of linked-reads and optical maps is likely to make the production of high quality genomes more routine and economical and, by doing so, significantly improve our understanding of comparative genome biology.",

The developed blue color from the sensing design was further amplified through catalytic activity of Au NPs in presence of TMBZ-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) complex. The developed dual enhanced colorimetric immunosensor enables the detection of avian influenza virus A (H5N1) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.11 pg/mL. Our results further confirms that the developed assay has superior sensitivity than the conventional ELISA method, plasmonic-based bioassay and commercial flu diagnostic kits.",

    "abstract": "The term biosensors encompasses devices that have the potential to quantify physiological, immunological and behavioural responses of livestock and multiple animal species. Novel biosensing methodologies offer highly specialised monitoring devices for the specific measurement of individual and multiple parameters covering an animals physiology as well as monitoring of an animals environment. These devices are not only highly specific and sensitive for the parameters being analysed, but they are also reliable and easy to use, and can accelerate the monitoring process. Novel biosensors in livestock management provide significant benefits and applications in disease detection and isolation, health monitoring and detection of reproductive cycles, as well as monitoring physiological wellbeing of the animal via analysis of the animals environment. With the development of integrated systems and the Internet of Things, the continuously monitoring devices are expected to become affordable. The data generated from integrated livestock monitoring is anticipated to assist farmers and the agricultural industry to improve animal productivity in the future. The data is expected to reduce the impact of the livestock industry on the environment, while at the same time driving the new wave towards the improvements of viable farming techniques. This review focusses on the emerging technological advancements in monitoring of livestock health for detailed, precise information on productivity, as well as physiology and well-being.

To better utilize this capacity, multiple samples are independently tagged with a unique \\\"barcode\\\" sequence and are then pooled, or \\\"multiplexed\\\", and sequenced together. Classifying, or \\\"demultiplexing\\\", the reads involves decoding the barcode sequence. Although instruments estimate the probability of incorrectly calling each nucleobase, available demultiplexers do not consult those estimates or report classification error probabilities.\\n\\nResultsWe present Pheniqs, a fast and flexible sequence demultiplexer and quality analyzer. In addition to providing an efficient implementation of the widespread minimum distance decoder, Pheniqs introduces a novel Phred-adjusted maximum likelihood decoder that consults base calling quality scores and estimates the probability of a barcode decoding error. Setting an upper bound on the permissible error provides an intuitive way to control demultiplexing confidence and directly influence precision and recall. Pheniqs supports FASTQ and multiple Sequence Alignment/Map formats and uses auxiliary SAM tags to report both library classification and demultiplexing error probability. Evaluation on both real and semi-synthetic data indicates that Pheniqs is faster than existing demultiplexers, substantially when demultiplexing longer reads, and achieves greater accuracy by correctly reflecting quality measurements.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationImplemented in multithreaded C++ and available under the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license agreement at http://github.com/biosails/pheniqs.

In this paper we introduce Lineage, a novel visual analysis tool designed to support domain experts who study such multifactorial diseases in the context of genealogies. Incorporating familial relationships between cases with other data can provide insights into shared genomic variants and shared environmental exposures that may be implicated in such diseases. We introduce a data and task abstraction, and argue that the problem of analyzing such diseases based on genealogical, clinical, and genetic data can be mapped to a multivariate graph visualization problem. The main contribution of our design study is a novel visual representation for tree-like, multivariate graphs, which we apply to genealogies and clinical data about the individuals in these families. We introduce data-driven aggregation methods to scale to multiple families. By designing the genealogy graph layout to align with a tabular view, we are able to incorporate extensive, multivariate attributes in the analysis of the genealogy without cluttering the graph. We validate our designs by conducting case studies with our domain collaborators.",

First line therapy often targets the dominant clone, and drug resistance can emerges from preexisting clones that gain fitness through therapy-induced natural selection. Such mutations may be identified using targeted sequencing assays by analysis of noise in high-depth data. Here, we develop a comprehensive, unbiased model for sequencing error background. We find that noise in sufficiently deep DNA sequencing data can be approximated by aggregating negative binomial distributions. Mutations with frequencies above noise may have prognostic value. We evaluate our model with simulated exponentially expanded populations as well as data from cell line and patient sample dilution experiments, demonstrating its utility in prognosticating tumor progression.

These analyses provide both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the precision of the models and their representation of the density, respectively, while concurrently providing a platform for assessing both global and local EM map quality. We further use standardized datasets to provide an expected model-model agreement criterion for EM maps reported to be at 5 [A] resolution or better.

Orai1-dependent motility arrest occurs spontaneously during confined motility in vitro, even in the absence of extrinsic cell contacts or antigen recognition. Utilizing a novel ratiometric genetically encoded cytosolic Ca2+ indicator, Salsa6f, we show these spontaneous pauses during T cell motility in vitro coincide with episodes of spontaneous cytosolic Ca2+ signaling.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of risk loci for autoimmune disease, yet only a minority ([~]25%) share genetic effects with changes to gene expression (eQTLs) in immune cells. RNA-Seq based quantification at whole-gene resolution, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is likely to account for this observed lack of colocalisation as subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons can be concealed. We performed integrative cis-eQTL analysis using association statistics from twenty autoimmune diseases (560 independent loci) and RNA-Seq data from 373 individuals of the Geuvadis cohort profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level resolution in lymphoblastoid cell lines. After stringently testing for a shared causal variant using both the Joint Likelihood Mapping and Regulatory Trait Concordance frameworks, we found that gene-level quantification significantly underestimated the number of causal cis-eQTLs. Only 5.0-5.3% of loci were found to share a causal cis-eQTL at gene-level compared to 12.9-18.4% at exon-level and 9.6-10.5% at junction-level. More than a fifth of autoimmune loci shared an underlying causal variant in a single cell type by combining all five quantification types; a marked increase over current estimates of steady-state causal cis-eQTLs. As an example, we dissected in detail the genetic associations of systemic lupus erythematosus and functionally annotated the candidate genes. Many of the known and novel genes were concealed at gene-level (e.g. BANK1, UBE2L3, IKZF2, TYK2, LYST). By leveraging RNA-Seq, we were able to isolate the specific transcripts, exons, junctions, and introns modulated by the cis-eQTL - which supports the targeted design of follow-up functional studies involving alternative splicing. Causal cis-eQTLs detected at different quantification types were also found to localise to discrete epigenetic annotations. We provide our findings from all twenty autoimmune diseases as a web resource.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIt is well acknowledged that non-coding genetic variants contribute to disease susceptibility through alteration of gene expression levels (known as eQTLs). Identifying the variants that are causal to both disease risk and changes to expression levels has not been easy and we believe this is in part due to how expression is quantified using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq). Whole-gene expression, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is conventionally used in eQTL analysis. This low resolution may conceal subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons. Using isoform-, exon-, and junction-level quantification can not only point to the candidate genes involved, but also the specific transcripts implicated. We make use of existing RNA-Seq expression data profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level, and perform eQTL analysis using association data from twenty autoimmune diseases. We find exon-, and junction-level thoroughly outperform gene-level analysis, and by leveraging all five quantification types, we find >20% of autoimmune loci share a single genetic effect with gene expression. We highlight that existing and new eQTL cohorts using RNA-Seq should profile expression at multiple resolutions to maximise the ability to detect causal eQTLs and candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by mosquito vectors cause many important emerging or resurging infectious diseases in humans including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Understanding the co-evolutionary processes among viruses and vectors is essential for the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies. Arboviruses form episomal viral DNA fragments upon infection of mosquito cells and adults. Additionally, sequences from insect-specific viruses and arboviruses have been found integrated into mosquito genomes.\\n\\nResultsWe used a bioinformatic approach to analyze the presence, abundance, distribution, and transcriptional activity of integrations from 425 non-retroviral viruses, including 133 arboviruses, across the presently available 22 mosquito genome sequences. Large differences in abundance and types of viral integrations were observed in mosquito species from the same region. Viral integrations are unexpectedly abundant in the arboviral vector species Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, but are [~]10-fold less abundant in all other mosquitoes analysed. Additionally, viral integrations are enriched in piRNA clusters of both the Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus genomes and, accordingly, they express piRNAs, but not siRNAs.\\n\\nConclusionsDifferences in number of viral integrations in the genomes of mosquito species from the same geographic area support the conclusion that integrations of viral sequences is not dependent on viral exposure, but that lineage-specific interactions exits. Viral integrations are abundant in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, and represent a thus far unappreciated component of their genomes. Additionally, the genome locations of viral integrations and their production of piRNAs indicate a functional link between viral integrations and the piRNA pathway. These results greatly expand the breadth and complexity of small RNA-mediated regulation and suggest a role for viral integrations in antiviral defense in these two mosquito species.",

    "abstract": "Investigations aimed at defining the 3-D configuration of eukaryotic chromosomes have consistently encountered an endogenous population of chromosome-derived circular genomic DNA, referred to as extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). While the production, distribution, and activities of eccDNAs remain understudied, eccDNA formation from specific regions of the linear genome has profound consequences on the regulatory and coding capabilities for these regions. High-throughput sequencing has only recently made extensive genomic mapping of eccDNA sequences possible and had yet to be applied using a rigorous approach that distinguishes ascertainment bias from true enrichment. Here, we define eccDNA distribution, utilizing a set of unbiased topology-dependent approaches for enrichment and characterization. We use parallel biophysical, enzymatic, and informatic approaches to obtain a comprehensive profiling of eccDNA in C. elegans and in three human cell types, where eccDNAs were previously uncharacterized. We also provide quantitative analysis of the eccDNA loci at both unique and repetitive regions. Our studies converge on and support a consistent picture in which endogenous genomic DNA circles are present in normal physiological DNA metabolism, and in which the circles come from both coding and noncoding genomic regions. Prominent among the coding regions generating DNA circles are several genes known to produce a diversity of protein isoforms, with mucin proteins and titin as specific examples.",

    "abstract": "Whipworms are parasitic nematodes that live in the gut of more than 500 million people worldwide. Due to the difficulty in obtaining parasite material, the mouse whipworm Trichuris muris has been extensively used as a model to study human whipworm infections. These nematodes secrete a multitude of compounds that interact with host tissues where they orchestrate a parasitic existence. Herein we provide the first comprehensive characterisation of the excretory/secretory products of T. muris. We identify 148 proteins secreted by T. muris and show for the first time that the mouse whipworm secretes exosome-like extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can interact with host cells. We use an Optiprep(R) gradient to purify the EVs, highlighting the suitability of this method for purifying EVs secreted by a parasitic nematode. We also characterise the proteomic and genomic content of the EVs, identifying >350 proteins, 56 miRNAs (22 novel) and 475 full-length mRNA transcripts mapping to T. muris gene models. Many of the miRNAs putatively mapped to mouse genes involved in regulation of inflammation, implying a role in parasite-driven immunomodulation. In addition, for the first time to our knowledge, we use colonic organoids to demonstrate the internalisation of parasite EVs by host cells. Understanding how parasites interact with their host is crucial to develop new control measures. This first characterisation of the proteins and EVs secreted by T. muris provides important information on whipworm-host communication and forms the basis for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Urine is a good source of biomarkers for clinical proteomics studies. However, one challenge in the use of urine biomarkers is that outside factors can affect the urine proteome. Prednisone is a commonly prescribed glucocorticoid used to treat various diseases in the clinic. To evaluate the possible impact of glucocorticoid drugs on the urine proteome, specifically disease biomarkers, this study investigated the effects of prednisone on the rat urine proteome. Urine samples were collected from control rats and prednisone-treated rats after drug administration. The urinary proteome was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and proteins were identified using label-free proteome quantification. Differentially expressed proteins and their human orthologs were analyzed with bioinformatics methods. A total of 523 urinary proteins were identified in rat urine. Using label-free quantification, 27 urinary proteins showed expression changes after prednisone treatment. A total of 16 proteins and/or their human orthologs have been previously annotated as disease biomarkers. After functional analysis, we found that the pharmacological effects of prednisone were reflected in the urine proteome. Thus, urinary proteomics has the potential to be a powerful drug efficacy monitoring tool in the clinic. Meanwhile, alteration of the urine proteome due to prednisone treatment should be considered in future disease biomarker studies.",

    "abstract": "Recent neurodevelopmental research supports the contribution of pubertal stage to local and global grey and white matter remodelling. Little is known, however, about white matter microstructural alterations at pubertal onset. This study investigated differences in white matter properties between pre-pubertal and pubertal children using whole brain fixel-based analysis (FBA) of the microscopic density and macroscopic cross-section of fibre bundles. Diffusion-weighted imaging data were acquired for 74 typically developing children (M=10.4, SD=0.43 years, 31 female) at 3.0T (60 diffusion gradient directions, b-value=2800 s/mm2). Group comparisons of fibre density (FD) and fibre cross-section (FC) were made between age-matched pre-pubertal and pubertal groups, and post-hoc analyses were performed on regions of interest (ROIs) defined in the splenium, body and genu of the corpus callosum. Significant fixel-wise differences in FD were observed between the pubertal groups, where the pubertal group had significantly higher FD compared with age-matched pre-pubertal children, localised to the posterior corpus callosum. Post-hoc analyses on mean FD in the corpus callosum ROIs revealed group differences between the pubertal groups in the splenium, but not body or genu. The observed higher apparent fibre density in the splenium suggests that pubertal onset coincides with white matter differences explained by increasing axon diameter. This may be an important effect to account for over pubertal development, particularly for group studies where age-matched clinical and typical populations may be at various stages of puberty.",

    "abstract": "The generation of spiking resonances in neurons (preferred spiking responses to oscillatory inputs) requires the interplay of the intrinsic ionic currents that operate at the subthreshold voltage regime and the spiking mechanism. Combinations of the same types of ionic currents in different parameter regimes may give rise to different types of nonlinearities in the voltage equation (e.g., parabolic- and cubic-like), generating subthreshold oscillations patterns with different properties. We investigate the spiking resonant properties of conductance-based models that are biophysically equivalent at the subthreshold level (same ionic currents), but functionally different (parabolic- and cubic-like). As a case study we consider a model having a persistent sodium current and a hyperpolarization-activated (h-) current. We unfold the concept of spiking resonance into evoked and output spiking resonance. The former focuses on the input frequencies that are able to generate spikes, while the latter focuses on the output spiking frequencies regardless of the input frequency that generated these spikes. A cell can exhibit one or both types of resonance. We also measure spiking phasonance, which is an extension of subthreshold phasonance to the spiking regime. The subthreshold resonant properties of both types of models are communicated to the spiking regime for low enough input amplitudes as the voltage response for the subthreshold resonant frequency band raises above threshold. For higher input amplitudes evoked spiking resonance is no longer present, but output spiking resonance is present primarily in the parabolic-like model, while the cubic-like model shows a better 1:1 entrainment. We use dynamical systems tools to explain the underlying mechanisms and the mechanistic differences between the resonance types. Our results show that the effective time scales that operate at the subthreshold regime to generate intrinsic subthreshold oscillations, mixed-mode oscillations and subthreshold resonance do not necessarily determine the existence of a preferred spiking response to oscillatory inputs in the same frequency band. The results discussed in this paper highlight both the complexity of the suprathreshold responses to oscillatory inputs in neurons having resonant and amplifying currents with different time scales and the fact that the identity of the participating ionic currents is not enough to predict the resulting patterns, but additional dynamic information, captured by the geometric properties of the phase-space diagram, is needed.",

    "abstract": "Correlated fluctuations of single neuron discharges, on a mesoscopic scale, decrease as a function of lateral distance in early sensory cortices, reflecting a rapid spatial decay of lateral connection probability and excitation. However, spatial periodicities in horizontal connectivity and associational input as well as an enhanced probability of lateral excitatory connections in the association cortex could theoretically result in non-monotonic correlation structures. Here we show such a spatially non-monotonic correlation structure, characterized by significantly positive long-range correlations, in the inferior convexity of the macaque prefrontal cortex. This functional connectivity kernel was more pronounced during wakefulness than anesthesia and could be largely attributed to the spatial pattern of correlated variability between functionally similar neurons during structured visual stimulation. These results suggest that the spatial decay of lateral functional connectivity is not a common organizational principle of neocortical microcircuits. A non-monotonic correlation structure could reflect a critical topological feature of prefrontal microcircuits, facilitating their role in integrative processes.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe spatial structure of correlated activity of neurons in lower-order visual areas has been shown to linearly decrease as a measure of distance. The shape of correlated variability is a defining feature of cortical microcircuits as it constrains the computational power and diversity of a region. We show here for the first time a non-monotonic spatial structure of functional connectivity in the pre-frontal cortex where distal interactions are just as strong as proximal interactions during visual engagement of functionally similar PFC neurons. Such a nonmonotonic structure of functional connectivity could have far-reaching consequences in rethinking the nature and the role of prefrontal microcircuits in various cognitive states.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVery preterm birth (<32 weeks of gestation) is associated with long-lasting brain alterations and an increased risk of psychiatric disorders associated with dopaminergic abnormalities. Preclinical studies have shown perinatal brain injuries, including hippocampal lesions, cause lasting changes in dopamine function, but it is not known if this occurs in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine whether very preterm birth and perinatal brain injury were associated with altered dopamine synthesis and reduced hippocampal volume in humans in adulthood.\\n\\nMethodsWe compared adults who were born very preterm with associated perinatal brain injury to adults born very preterm without perinatal brain injury, and age-matched controls born at full term using [18F]-DOPA PET and structural MRI imaging.\\n\\nResultsDopamine synthesis capacity was significantly reduced in the perinatal brain injury group relative to both the group born very preterm without brain injury (Cohens d=1.36, p=0.02) and the control group (Cohens d=1.07, p=0.01). Hippocampal volume was reduced in the perinatal brain injury group relative to controls (Cohens d = 1.17, p = 0.01). There was a significant correlation between hippocampal volume and striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (r = 0.344, p= 0.03).\\n\\nConclusionsPerinatal brain injury, but not very preterm birth without macroscopic brain injury, is associated with persistent alterations in dopaminergic function and reductions in hippocampal volume. This is the first evidence in humans linking neonatal hippocampal injury to adult dopamine dysfunction, and has implications for understanding the mechanism underlying cognitive impairments and neuropsychiatric disorders following very preterm birth.",

    "abstract": "Concerns regarding reproducibility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) findings have been raised. Little is known about how to operationally define R-fMRI reproducibility and to what extent it is affected by multiple comparison correction strategies and sample size. We comprehensively assessed two aspects of reproducibility, test-retest reliability and replicability, on widely used R-fMRI metrics in both between-subject contrasts of sex differences and within-subject comparisons of eyes-open and eyes-closed (EOEC) conditions. We noted permutation test with Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), a strict multiple comparison correction strategy, reached the best balance between family-wise error rate (under 5%) and test-retest reliability / replicability (e.g., 0.68 for test-retest reliability and 0.25 for replicability of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) for between-subject sex differences, 0.49 for replicability of ALFF for within-subject EOEC differences). Although R-fMRI indices attained moderate reliabilities, they replicated poorly in distinct datasets (replicability < 0.3 for between-subject sex differences, < 0.5 for within-subject EOEC differences). By randomly drawing different sample sizes from a single site, we found reliability, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) rose as sample size increased. Small sample sizes (e.g., < 80 (40 per group)) not only minimized power (sensitivity < 2%), but also decreased the likelihood that significant results reflect \\\"true\\\" effects (PPV < 0.26) in sex differences. Our findings have implications for how to select multiple comparison correction strategies and highlight the importance of sufficiently large sample sizes in R-fMRI studies to enhance reproducibility.",

We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr for higly accurate causal inference between gene expression traits using cis-regulatory DNA variations as causal anchors, which improves current methods by taking into account hidden confounders and weak regulations. Findr outperformed existing methods on the DREAM5 Systems Genetics challenge and on the prediction of microRNA and transcription factor targets in human lymphoblastoid cells, while being nearly a million times faster. Findr is publicly available at https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding how genetic variation between individuals determines variation in observable traits or disease risk is one of the core aims of genetics. It is known that genetic variation often affects gene regulatory DNA elements and directly causes variation in expression of nearby genes. This effect in turn cascades down to other genes via the complex pathways and gene interaction networks that ultimately govern how cells operate in an ever changing environment. In theory, when genetic variation and gene expression levels are measured simultaneously in a large number of individuals, the causal effects of genes on each other can be inferred using statistical models similar to those used in randomized controlled trials. We developed a novel method and ultra-fast software Findr which, unlike existing methods, takes into account the complex but unknown network context when predicting causality between specific gene pairs. Findrs predictions have a significantly higher overlap with known gene networks compared to existing methods, using both simulated and real data. Findr is also nearly a million times faster, and hence the only software in its class that can handle modern datasets where the expression levels of ten-thousands of genes are simultaneously measured in hundreds to thousands of individuals.",

The Spindle and Kinetochore-Associated (Ska) Complex, a hexamer composed of two copies of Ska1, Ska2 and Ska3, participates in both roles. The mitotic kinases, Cdk1, Aurora B, Plk1, Mps1 and Bub1 play key, overlapping tasks in regulating chromosome movement and checkpoint signaling. However, roles for the phosphatases that oppose these kinases are more poorly defined. Recently, we showed that Ska1 is important for recruiting protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to kinetochores. Here we show that PP1 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) both promote accumulation of Ska at kinetochores. Depletion of PP1 or PP2A by siRNA reduces Ska binding at kinetochores, impairs alignment of chromosomes to the spindle midplane, and causes metaphase delay or arrest, phenotypes also seen after depletion of Ska. Tethering of PP1 to the kinetochore protein Nuf2 promotes Ska recruitment to kinetochores, and reduces mitotic defects seen after Ska depletion. We propose that kinetochore-associated phosphatases generate a positive feedback cycle to reinforce Ska complex accumulation and function at kinetochores.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTPhosphatases reinforce recruitment of the Ska complex at kinetochores to stabilize microtubule attachment and oppose spindle checkpoint signaling.",

Diversity parameters were rather low in Italian native pigs, with haplotype and nucleotide diversities ranging between 0.35-0.79 and 0.0013-0.0061, respectively. This result is consistent with the strong population bottlenecks that traditional Italian breeds have suffered due to competition with more productive foreign pig varieties. Moreover, median-joining network analysis showed that the majority of Italian pig sequences are distributed in two main clusters and that all of them belong to the E1 haplogroup. Conversely, Italian wild boars were more diverse than their domestic counterparts and they harboured the E1 and E2 haplogroups. The absence of the E2 haplogroup in Italian pigs and its moderate frequency in wild boars might suggest that this haplogroup was rare at the time that wild boars were domesticated in Italy.",

Although DOP-PCR has been regarded as one of the pioneering methods for WGA, it only provides low genome coverage and a high allele dropout rate when compared to more modern techniques. Here we describe an improved DOP-PCR (iDOP-PCR). We have modified the classic DOP-PCR by using a new thermostable DNA polymerase (SD polymerase) with a strong strand-displacement activity and by adjustments in primers design. We compared iDOP-PCR, classic DOP-PCR and the well-established PicoPlex technique for whole genome amplification of both high- and low-copy number human genomic DNA. The amplified DNA libraries were evaluated by analysis of short tandem repeat genotypes and NGS data. In summary, iDOP-PCR provided a better quality of the amplified DNA libraries compared to the other WGA methods tested, especially when low amounts of genomic DNA were used as an input material.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the unique contributions of frontoparietal networks (FPN) in cognition is challenging because different FPNs spatially overlap and are co-activated for diverse tasks. In order to characterize these networks involves studying how they activate across many different cognitive tasks, which previously has only been possible with meta-analyses. Here, building upon meta-analyses as a starting point, we use neuroadaptive Bayesian optimization, an approach combining real-time analysis of functional neuroimaging data with machine-learning, to discover cognitive tasks that dissociate ventral and dorsal FPN activity from a large pool of tasks. We identify and subsequently refine two cognitive tasks (Deductive Reasoning and Tower of London) that are optimal for dissociating the FPNs. The identified cognitive tasks are not those predicted by meta-analysis, highlighting a different mapping between cognitive tasks and FPNs than expected. The optimization approach converged on a similar neural dissociation independently for the two different tasks, suggesting a possible common underlying functional mechanism and the need for neurally-derived cognitive taxonomies.",

    "abstract": "Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this context, synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but stochastic ERK dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations are predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations predict MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, moving towards more rational cancer combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between animals and their gut flora is simultaneously one of the most common and most complex symbioses on Earth. Despite its ubiquity, our understanding of this invisible but often critical relationship is still in its infancy. We employed adult Neotropical butterflies as a study system to ask three questions: First, how does gut microbial community composition vary across host individuals, species and dietary guilds? Second, how do gut flora compare to food microbial communities? Finally, are gut flora functionally adapted to the chemical makeup of host foods? To answer these questions we captured nearly 300 Costa Rican butterflies representing over 50 species, six families and two feeding guilds: frugivores and nectivores. We characterized the bacteria and fungi in guts, wild fruits and wild nectars via amplicon sequencing and assessed the catabolic abilities of the gut flora via culture-based assays.\\n\\nGut communities were distinct from food communities, suggesting that the gut environment acts as a strong filter on potential colonists. Nevertheless, gut flora varied widely among individuals and species. On average, a pair of butterflies shared 21% of their bacterial species and 6% of their fungi. Host species explained 25-30% of total variation in microbial communities while host diet explained 4%. However, diet was still relevant at the individual microbe level--half of the most abundant microbial species differed in abundance between frugivores and nectivores. Diet was also related to the functional profile of gut flora: compared to frugivores, nectivores gut flora exhibited increased catabolism of sugars and sugar alcohols and decreased catabolism of amino acids, carboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids. Since fermented juice contains more amino acids and less sugar than nectar, it appears that host diet filters the gut flora by favoring microbes that digest compounds abundant in foods.\\n\\nBy quantifying the degree to which gut communities vary among host individuals, species and dietary guilds and evaluating how gut microbial composition and catabolic potential are related to host diet, this study deepens our understanding of the structure and function of one of the most complex and ubiquitous symbioses in the animal kingdom.",

    "abstract": "We present a new phylogenetic approach SelAC (Selection on Amino acids and Codons), whose substitution rates are based on a nested model linking protein expression to population genetics. Unlike simpler codon models which assume a single substitution matrix for all sites, our model more realistically represents the evolution of protein coding DNA under the assumption of consistent, stabilizing selection using cost-benefit approach. This cost-benefit approach allows us generate a set of 20 optimal amino acid specific matrix families using just a handful of parameters and naturally links the strength of stabilizing selection to protein synthesis levels, which we can estimate. Using a yeast dataset of 100 orthologs for 6 taxa, we find SelAC fits the data much better than popular models by 104-105 AICc units. Our results indicate there is great potential for more accurate inference of phylogenetic trees and branch lengths from already existing data through the use of nested, mechanistic models. Additional parameters estimated by SelAC indicate that a large amount of non-phylogenetic, but biologically meaningful, information can be inferred from exisiting data. For example, SelAC prediction of gene specific protein synthesis rates correlates well with both empirical (r=0.33-0.48) and other theoretical predictions (r=0.45-0.64) for multiple yeast species. SelAC also provides estimates of the optimal amino acid at each site. Finally, because SelAC is a nested approach based on clearly stated biological assumptions, future modifications, such as including shifts in the optimal amino acid sequence within or across lineages, are possible.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Parsis, one of the smallest religious community in the world, reside in South Asia. Previous genetic studies on them, although based on low resolution markers, reported both Iranian and Indian ancestries. To understand the population structure and demographic history of this group in more detail, we analyzed Indian and Pakistani Parsi populations using high-resolution autosomal and uniparental (Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA) markers. Additionally, we also assayed 108 mitochondrial DNA markers among 21 ancient Parsi DNA samples excavated from Sanjan, in present day Gujarat, the place of their original settlement in India.\\n\\nResultsOur extensive analyses indicated that among present-day populations, the Parsis are genetically closest to Middle Eastern (Iranian and the Caucasus) populations rather than their South Asian neighbors. They also share the highest number of haplotypes with present-day Iranians and we estimate that the admixture of the Parsis with Indian populations occurred [~]1,200 years ago. Enriched homozygosity in the Parsi reflects their recent isolation and inbreeding. We also observed 48% South-Asian-specific mitochondrial lineages among the ancient samples, which might have resulted from the assimilation of local females during the initial settlement.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show that the Parsis are genetically closest to the Neolithic Iranians, followed by present-day Middle Eastern populations rather than those in South Asia and provide evidence of sex-specific admixture from South Asians to the Parsis. Our results are consistent with the historically-recorded migration of the Parsi populations to South Asia in the 7thcentury and in agreement with their assimilation into the Indian sub-continents population and cultural milieu \\\"like sugar in milk\\\". Moreover, in a wider context our results suggest a major demographic transition in West Asia due to Islamic-conquest.",

    "abstract": "Syntrophy among Archaea and Bacteria facilitates the anaerobic degradation of organic compounds to CH4 and CO2. Particularly during aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mineralization, as in crude oil reservoirs and petroleum-contaminated sediments, metabolic interactions between obligate mutualistic microbial partners are of central importance1. Using micro-manipulation combined with shotgun metagenomic approaches, we disentangled the genomes of complex consortia inside a short chain alkane-degrading cultures operating under methanogenic conditions. Metabolic reconstruction revealed that only a small fraction of genes in the metagenome-assembled genomes of this study, encode the capacity for fermentation of alkanes facilitated by energy conservation linked to H2 metabolism. Instead, inferred lifestyles based on scavenging anabolic products and intermediate fermentation products derived from detrital biomass was a common feature in the consortia. Additionally, inferred auxotrophy for vitamins and amino acids suggests that the hydrocarbon-degrading microbial assemblages are structured and maintained by multiple interactions beyond the canonical H2-producing and syntrophic alkane degrader-methanogen partnership2. Our study uncovers the complexity of  interactomes within microbial consortia mediating hydrocarbon transformation under anaerobic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The genome of the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis encodes for three complete LuxI/LuxR-type quorum sensing (QS) systems: BtaI1/BtaR1 (QS-1), BtaI2/BtaR2 (QS-2), and BtaI3/BtaR3 (QS-3). The LuxR-type transcriptional regulators BtaR1, BtaR2, and BtaR3 modulate the expression of target genes in association with various N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) as signaling molecules produced by the LuxI-type synthases BtaI1, BtaI2, and BtaI3. We have systematically dissected the complex QS circuitry of B. thailandensis strain E264. Direct quantification of octanoyl-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), N-3-hydroxy-decanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OHC10-HSL), and N-3-hydroxy-octanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OHC8-HSL), the primary AHLs produced by this bacterium, was performed in the wild-type strain and in QS deletion mutants. This was compared to the expression of btaI1, btaI2, and btaI3 using chromosomal mini-CTX-lux transcriptional reporters. Furthermore, transcription of btaR1, btaR2, and btaR3 was monitored by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). We observed that C8-HSL, 3OHC10-HSL, and 3OHC8-HSL are differentially produced over time during bacterial growth and correlate with the btaI1, btaI2, and btaI3 genes expression profiles, revealing a sequential activation of the corresponding QS systems. Moreover, transcription of the btaR1, btaR2, and btaR3 genes is modulated by AHLs, showing that their regulation depend on themselves, and on other systems. We conclude that the three QS systems in B. thailandensis are interdependent, suggesting that they cooperate dynamically and function in a concerted manner in modulating the expression of QS target genes through a sequential regulatory network.\\n\\nImportanceQuorum sensing (QS) is a widespread bacterial communication system coordinating the expression of specific genes in a cell density-dependent manner and allowing bacteria to synchronize their activities and to function as multicellular communities. QS plays a crucial role in bacterial pathogenicity by regulating the expression of a wide spectrum of virulence/survival factors and is essential to environmental adaptation. The results presented here demonstrate that the multiple QS systems coexisting in the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis, considered as the avirulent version of the human pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei and thus commonly used as an alternative study model, are hierarchically and homeostatically organized. We found these QS systems finely integrated into a complex regulatory network, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional interactions, and further incorporating growth stages and temporal expression. These results provide a unique, comprehensive illustration of a sophisticated QS network and will contribute to a better comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms that can be involved in the expression of QS-controlled genes, in particular those associated with the establishment of host-pathogen interactions and acclimatization to the environment.",

The study used smokers trying to quit, objective and subjective measures, multiple measures during smoking and abstinence, and monetary rewards to increase the prevalence of abstinence. Current daily smokers (n = 211) who were trying to quit completed an operant measure of reward sensitivity and a survey of pleasure from various rewards as well as self-reports of anhedonia, delay discounting, positive affect and tobacco withdrawal twice each week.

    "abstract": "Molecular motors are thought to generate force and directional motion via nonequilibrium switching between energy surfaces. Because all enzymes can undergo such switching, we hypothesized that the ability to generate rotary motion and torque is not unique to highly adapted biological motor proteins, but is instead a common feature of enzymes. We used molecular dynamics simulations to compute energy surfaces for hundreds of torsions in three enzymes, adenosine kinase, protein kinase A, and HIV-1 protease, and used these energy surfaces within a kinetic model that accounts for intersurface switching and intrasurface probability flows. When substrate is out of equilibrium with product, we find computed torsion rotation rates up ~140 cycle s-1, with stall torques up to ~2 kcal mol-1 cycle-1, and power outputs up to ~50 kcal mol-1 s-1. We argue that these enzymes are instances of a general phenomenon of directional probability flows on asymmetric energy surfaces for systems out of equilibrium. Thus, we conjecture that cyclic probability fluxes, corresponding to rotations of torsions and higher-order collective variables, exist in any chiral molecule driven between states in a non-equilibrium manner; we call this the Asymmetry-Directionality conjecture. This is expected to apply as well to synthetic chiral molecules switched in a nonequilibrium manner between energy surfaces by light, redox chemistry, or catalysis.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative proteomics using high-resolution and accuracy mass spectrometry promises to transform our understanding of biological systems and disease. Recent development of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) using hybrid instruments substantially improved the specificity of targeted mass spectrometry. Combined with high-efficiency ion trapping, this approach also provided significant improvements in sensitivity. Here, we investigated the effects of ion isolation and accumulation on the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of targeted proteomics using the recently developed hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap-linear ion trap mass spectrometer. We leveraged ultra-high efficiency nano-electrospray ionization under optimized conditions to achieve yoctomolar sensitivity with more than seven orders of linear quantitative accuracy. To enable sensitive and specific targeted mass spectrometry, we implemented an automated, scalable two-dimensional (2D) ion exchange-reversed phase nano-scale chromatography system. We found that 2D chromatography improved the sensitivity and accuracy of both PRM and an intact precursor scanning mass spectrometry method, termed accumulated ion monitoring (AIM), by more than 100-fold. Combined with automated 2D nano-scale chromatography, AIM achieved sub-attomolar limits of detection of endogenous proteins in complex biological proteomes. This allowed quantitation of absolute abundance of the human transcription factor MEF2C at approximately 100 molecules/cell, and determination of its phosphorylation stoichiometry from as little as 1 g of extracts isolated from 10,000 human cells. The combination of automated multidimensional nano-scale chromatography and targeted mass spectrometry should enable ultra-sensitive high-accuracy quantitative proteomics of complex biological systems and diseases.",
