    "abstract": "Accumulating behavioural and neurophysiological evidence suggests that upper-limb control relies on contributions from both cortical and subcortical motor circuits, with cortical inputs providing fine-finger function and subcortical inputs providing the ability for gross movements, respectively. During recovery of function after stroke, the relative contributions from these pathways may shift. Here we propose that mirror movements that appear after stroke provide a non-invasive assay through which relative contributions from cortical and subcortical pathways towards hand recovery can be studied. We hypothesized that mirror movements, like hand function, are generated by summed contributions from cortical and subcortical pathways, and suggest that subcortical contributions should be characterized by a broad recruitment of fingers, while cortical contributions primarily recruit the homologous finger in the passive hand. In a longitudinal stroke recovery study (Xu et al., 2016), we quantified mirror movements and paretic hand function in 53 stroke patients in the year following unilateral stroke. Mirror movements in the non-paretic hand were exaggerated early after damage (week 2), with paretic finger presses broadly recruiting multiple fingers in the non-paretic hand. On average, however, mirroring in homologous fingers was 1.76 times larger than in non-homologous fingers. Over the year, mirroring in the non-paretic hand progressively normalized with a time-course that mimicked that for the fine-finger deficits in the paretic hand. In comparison, during non-paretic finger presses, the homologous component of mirroring in the paretic hand was reduced early after stroke (week 2) but progressively normalized. Altogether, we conclude that the pattern of mirror movements across homologous and non-homologous fingers reflect the summed contributions of both cortical and subcortical systems, and we discuss the implications of our results towards hand recovery after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Cortical responses to repeated stimuli are highly dynamic and rapidly adaptive. Such rapid changes are prominent in all sensory cortices, across which many aspects of circuitry are conserved. As an example, in the auditory cortex, preceding sounds can powerfully suppress responses to later, spectrally similar sounds - a phenomenon called forward suppression. Whether cortical inhibitory networks shape such suppression, or whether it is wholly regulated by common mechanisms such as synaptic depression or spike-frequency adaptation, is controversial. Here, we show that optogenetically suppressing somatostatin-positive interneurons reveals facilitation in neurons that are normally forward-suppressed. This is accompanied by a weakening of forward suppression, suggesting that these interneurons regulate the strength of forward interactions. In contrast, inactivating parvalbumin-positive interneurons does not change suppression strength, but does alter its frequency-dependence. These results establish a role of cortical inhibition in forward suppression and link specific aspects of rapid sensory adaptation to genetically distinct interneuron types.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology is derived from a microbial adaptive immune system, where bacteriophages are often the intended target. Natural inhibitors of CRISPR-Cas9 enable phages to evade immunity and show promise in controlling Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells. However, the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 inhibition is not known and the potential applications for Cas9 inhibitor proteins in mammalian cells has not fully been established. We show here that the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4 binds only to assembled Cas9-single guide RNA (sgRNA) complexes and not to Cas9 protein alone. A 3.9 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the Cas9-sgRNA-AcrIIA4 complex revealed that the surface of AcrIIA4 is highly acidic and binds with 1:1 stoichiometry to a region of Cas9 that normally engages the DNA protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Consistent with this binding mode, order-of-addition experiments showed that AcrIIA4 interferes with DNA recognition but has no effect on pre-formed Cas9-sgRNA-DNA complexes. Timed delivery of AcrIIA4 into human cells as either protein or expression plasmid allows on-target Cas9-mediated gene editing while reducing off-target edits. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of AcrIIA4 function and demonstrate that inhibitors can modulate the extent and outcomes of Cas9-mediated gene editing.",

    "abstract": "Both microbial and host genetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease1-4. Accumulating evidence suggests that microbial species that potentiate chronic inflammation, as in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), often also colonize healthy individuals. These microbes, including the Helicobacter species, have the propensity to induce autoreactive T cells and are collectively referred to as pathobionts4-8. However, an understanding of how such T cells are constrained in healthy individuals is lacking. Here we report that host tolerance to a potentially pathogenic bacterium, Helicobacter hepaticus (H. hepaticus), is mediated by induction of ROR{gamma}t+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (iTreg) that selectively restrain pro-inflammatory TH17 cells and whose function is dependent on the transcription factor c-Maf. Whereas H. hepaticus colonization of wild-type mice promoted differentiation of ROR{gamma}t-expressing microbe-specific iTreg in the large intestine, in disease-susceptible IL-10-deficient animals there was instead expansion of colitogenic TH17 cells. Inactivation of c-Maf in the Treg compartment likewise impaired differentiation of bacteria-specific iTreg, resulting in accumulation of H. hepaticus-specific inflammatory TH17 cells and spontaneous colitis. In contrast, ROR{gamma}t inactivation in Treg only had a minor effect on bacterial-specific Treg-TH17 balance, and did not result in inflammation. Our results suggest that pathobiont-dependent IBD is a consequence of microbiota-reactive T cells that have escaped this c-Maf-dependent mechanism of iTreg-TH17 homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology provides potential advantages in high-throughput functional genomics analysis in prokaryotes over previously established platforms based on recombineering or transposon mutagenesis. In this work, as a proof-of-concept to adopt CRISPR/Cas9 method as a pooled functional genomics analysis platform in prokaryotes, we developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library consisting of 3,148 single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the open reading frame (ORF) of 67 genes with known knockout phenotypes and performed pooled screens under two stressed conditions (minimal and acidic medium) in Escherichia coli. Our approach confirmed most of previously described gene-phenotype associations while maintaining < 5% false positive rate, suggesting that CRISPRi screen is both sensitive and specific. Our data also supported the ability of this method to narrow down the candidate gene pool when studying operons, a unique structure in prokaryotic genome. Meanwhile, assessment of multiple loci across treatments enables us to extract several guidelines for sgRNA design for such pooled functional genomics screen. For instance, sgRNAs locating at the first 5% upstream region within ORF exhibit enhanced activity and 10 sgRNAs per gene is suggested to be enough for robust identification of gene-phenotype associations. We also optimized the hit-gene calling algorithm to identify target genes more robustly with even fewer sgRNAs. This work showed that CRISPRi could be adopted as a powerful functional genomics analysis tool in prokaryotes and provided the first guideline for the construction of sgRNA libraries in such applications.\\n\\nImportanceTo fully exploit the valuable resource of explosive sequenced microbial genomes, high-throughput experimental platform is needed to associate genes and phenotypes at the genome level, giving microbiologists the insight about the genetic structure and physiology of a microorganism. In this work, we adopted CRISPR interference method as a pooled high-throughput functional genomics platform in prokaryotes with Escherichia coli as the model organism. Our data suggested that this method was highly sensitive and specific to map genes with previously known phenotypes, potent to act as a new strategy for high-throughput microbial genetics study with advantages over previously established methods. We also provided the first guideline for the sgRNA library design by comprehensive analysis of the screen data. The concept, gRNA library design rules and open-source scripts of this work should benefit prokaryotic genetics community to apply high-throughput mapping of defined gene set with phenotypes in a broad spectrum of microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "The spatial positions of blue cones (BC) and blue cone bipolars (BCBP) are positively correlated in macaque retina (Kouyama & Marshak, 1997): BCs, located in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and BCBPs, located in the inner nuclear layer (INL), tend to be located close to each other in the lateral dimension. They also form separate homotypic mosaics and, finally, most BCBPs contact only a single BC pedicle. We present a mechanistic model of the BC-BCBP interaction to account for the development of these two mosaics and their connections. It assumes that BCs are immobile and that BCBPs can migrate within the INL due to a compromise between a dendritic string force and an intrinsic INL friction force. Model parameters were selected to optimise the fit with observed fields (Kouyama & Marshak, 1997). Simulated density recovery profiles (DRPs) closely mimic the observed DRPs. In particular, for each of the five retinal fields studied, the simulated DRP for the interaction between BCs and BCBPs has a peak at distances less than around 20 m and a small dip at distances up to the maximal lateral dendritic length ([~] 44 m), matching the profiles of the real data. We conclude that our mechanistic model is a candidate for the unknown mechanism that drives the observed interaction between BCs and BCBPs in macaque retina.",

    "abstract": "Learning from reward feedback in a changing environment requires a high degree of adaptability, yet the precise estimation of reward information demands slow updates. We show that this tradeoff between adaptability and precision, which is present in standard reinforcement-learning models, can be substantially overcome via reward-dependent metaplasticity (reward-dependent synaptic changes that do not always alter synaptic efficacy). Metaplastic synapses achieve both adaptability and precision by forming two separate sets of meta-states: reservoirs and buffers. Synapses in reservoir meta-states do not change their efficacy upon reward feedback, whereas those in buffer meta-states can change their efficacy. Rapid changes in efficacy are limited to synapses occupying buffers, creating a bottleneck that reduces noise without significantly decreasing adaptability. In contrast, more-populated reservoirs can generate a strong signal without manifesting any observable plasticity. We suggest that ubiquitous unreliability of synaptic changes evinces metaplasticity that can provide a robust mechanism for adaptive learning.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and tractography have enabled identification of several long-range white matter tracts in the human brain. Yet, our understanding of shorter tracts, such as those within the parietal lobe, remains limited. Over a century ago, a tract connecting the superior and inferior parts of the parietal cortex was identified in a post-mortem study: Stratum proprium of interparietal sulcus (SPIS; Sachs, 1892). The tract has since been replicated in another fibre dissection study (Vergani et al. 2014), however, it has never been identified in the living human brain and its anatomical properties are yet to be described. We used dMRI and tractography to identify and characterise SPIS in vivo, and explored its spatial proximity to the cortical areas associated with optic-flow processing using fMRI. SPIS was identified bilaterally in all subjects, and its anatomical position and trajectory are consistent with previous post-mortem studies. Subsequent evaluation of the tractography results using linear fascicle evaluation and virtual lesion analysis yielded strong statistical evidence for SPIS. We also found that SPIS endpoints are adjacent to the optic-flow selective areas. In sum, we show that SPIS is a short-range tract connecting the superior and inferior parts of the parietal cortex, wrapping around the intraparietal sulcus, and that it may be a crucial anatomy underlying optic-flow processing. In vivo identification and characterisation of SPIS will facilitate further research on SPIS in relation to cortical functions, their development, and diseases that affect them.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs that recognize target sequences by base complementarity. They are processed from longer precursors that harbor a fold-back structure. Plant miRNA precursors are quite variable in size and shape, and are recognized by the processing machinery in different ways. However, ancient miRNAs and their binding sites in target genes are conserved during evolution. Here, we designed a strategy to systematically analyze MIRNAs from different species generating a graphical representation of the conservation of the primary sequence and secondary structure. We found that plant MIRNAs have evolutionary footprints that go beyond the small RNA sequence itself, yet, their location along the precursor depends on the specific MIRNA. We show that these conserved regions correspond to structural determinants recognized during the biogenesis of plant miRNAs. Furthermore, we found that the members of the miR166 family have unusual conservation patterns and demonstrated that the recognition of these precursors in vivo differs from other known miRNAs. Our results describe a link between the evolutionary conservation of plant MIRNAs and the mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of these small RNAs, and show that the MIRNA pattern of conservation can be used to infer the mode of miRNA biogenesis.",
