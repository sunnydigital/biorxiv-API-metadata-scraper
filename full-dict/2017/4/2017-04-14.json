    "abstract": "Population genomic datasets collected over the past decade have spurred interest in developing methods that can utilize massive numbers of loci for inference of demographic and selective histories of populations. The allele frequency spectrum (AFS) provides a convenient statistic for such analysis and accordingly much attention has been paid to predicting theoretical expectations of the AFS under a number of different models. However, to date, exact solutions for the joint AFS of two or more populations under models of migration and divergence have not been found. Here we present a novel Markov chain representation of the coalescent on the state space of the joint AFS that allows for rapid, exact calculation of the joint AFS under isolation with migration (IM) models. In turn, we show how our Markov chain method, in the context of composite likelihood estimation, can be used for accurate inference of parameters of the IM model using SNP data. Lastly, we apply our method to recent whole genome datasets from African Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Recent epidemics of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya have heightened the need to understand the seasonal and geographic range of transmission by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. We use mechanistic transmission models to derive predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we show that these predictions are well matched by human case data. Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show that transmission occurs between 18-34{degrees}C with maximal transmission occurring in a range from 26-29{degrees}C. Controlling for population size and two socioeconomic factors, temperature-dependent transmission based on our mechanistic model is an important predictor of human transmission occurrence and incidence. Risk maps indicate that tropical and subtropical regions are suitable for extended seasonal or year-round transmission, but transmission in temperate areas is limited to at most three months per year even if vectors are present. Such brief transmission windows limit the likelihood of major epidemics following disease introduction in temperate zones.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding the drivers of recent Zika, dengue, and chikungunya epidemics is a major public health priority. Temperature may play an important role because it affects mosquito transmission, affecting mosquito development, survival, reproduction, and biting rates as well as the rate at which they acquire and transmit viruses. Here, we measure the impact of temperature on transmission by two of the most common mosquito vector species for these viruses, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We integrate data from several laboratory experiments into a mathematical model of temperature-dependent transmission, and find that transmission peaks at 26-29{degrees}C and can occur between 18-34{degrees}C. Statistically comparing model predictions with recent observed human cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika across the Americas suggests an important role for temperature, and supports model predictions. Using the model, we predict that most of the tropics and subtropics are suitable for transmission in many or all months of the year, but that temperate areas like most of the United States are only suitable for transmission for a few months during the summer (even if the mosquito vector is present).",

    "abstract": "The mechanics of the actin cytoskeleton regulates cell morphogenesis during essential physiological processes. While cellular contractility is known to be largely RhoA-dependent, the process by which localized biochemical signals are translated into cell-level responses is not well understood. Here we combine optogenetic control of RhoA in space and time, live cell imaging and traction force microscopy to investigate the dynamics of actomyosin-based force generation in adherent fibroblasts. Local activation of RhoA not only stimulates local recruitment of actin and myosin, but also leads to increased traction forces outside the activation region that rapidly propagate across the cell via stress fibers and drive actin flow towards the region of heightened RhoA. Surprisingly, the flow reverses direction when local RhoA activation stops. We identify zyxin as a regulator of stress fiber mechanics, as stress fibers are fluid-like without flow reversal in its absence. These experimental data are used to constrain a physical model, which demonstrates that stress fibers are elastic-like, even at time scales exceeding turnover of constituent proteins. Such molecular control of actin mechanics likely plays critical roles in regulation of morphogenic events.",

We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2,750 female, 2,466 male participants; 44-77 years). Males had higher volumes, surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had thicker cortices and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume or height. There was generally greater male variance across structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.",

We quantify cell-to-cell variability of adaptation, ligand response, as well as steady-state output level, and analyze the role of network design in shaping this diversity from gene expression noise. In the absence of changes in gene expression, we find that single cells demonstrate strong temporal fluctuations. We provide evidence that such signaling noise can arise from at least two sources: (i) stochastic activities of adaptation enzymes, and (ii) receptor-kinase dynamics in the absence of adaptation. We demonstrate that under certain conditions, (ii) can generate giant fluctuations that drive signaling activity of the entire cell into a stochastic two-state switching regime. Our findings underscore the importance of molecular noise, arising not only in gene expression but also in protein networks.",

    "abstract": "Cheap sequencing has driven the proliferation of big human genome data aggregation consortiums, providing extensive reference datasets for genome research. These datasets, however, may come with restrictive terms of use, conditioned by the consent frameworks within which individuals donate their data. Having an aggregated genome dataset with unrestricted use, analogous to public domain licensing, is therefore unusually rare. Yet public domain data is tremendously useful because it allows freedom to perform research with it. This comes with the price of donors surrendering their privacy and accepting the associated risks derived from publishing personal data. Using the Repositive platform (https://repositive.io/?23andMe), an indexing service for human genome datasets, we aggregated all deposited files in public data sources under a CC0 license from 23andMe, a leading Direct-to-Consumer genetic testing service. After downloading 3,137 genotypes, we filtered out those that were incomplete, corrupt or duplicated, ending up with a dataset of 2,280 curated files, each one corresponding to a unique individual. Although the size of this dataset is modest compared to current major genome data aggregation projects, its full access and licensing terms, which allows free reuse without attribution, make it a useful reference pool for validation purposes and control experiments.",

    "abstract": "Human osteoblasts can be induced from somatic cells by introducing defined factors, however, the strategy limits cells therapeutic applications for its multi-factor and complicated genetic manipulations that may bring uncertainty into the genome. Another important cell type in bone metabolism, osteocytes, which play a central role in regulating the dynamic nature of bone in all its diverse functions, have not been obtained from transdifferetiation so far. Herein, we have established procedures to convert human fibroblast directly into osteocyte-like and osteoblast-like cells using a single transcription factor, Runx2 and chemical cocktails by activating Wnt and cAMP/PKA pathways. These induced osteoblast-like cells express osteogenic markers and generate mineralized nodule deposition. A good performance of bone formation from these cells was observed in subcutaneous site of mouse at 4 weeks post-transplantation. Moreover, further studies convert human fibroblasts into osteocyte-like cells by orchestrating timing of the aforementioned chemical cocktails exposure. These osteocyte-like cells express osteocyte-specific markers and display characteristic morphology features of osteocytes. In summary, this study provides a promising strategy for cell-based therapy in bone regenerative medicine by direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into osteocytes and osteoblasts.",

    "abstract": "Accurate molecular structure of the protein dimer representing the elementary building block of intermediate filaments (IFs) is essential towards the understanding of the filament assembly, rationalizing their mechanical properties and explaining the effect of disease-related IF mutations. The dimer contains a [~]300-residue long -helical coiled coil which is not assessable to either direct experimental structure determination or modelling using standard approaches. At the same time, coiled coils are well-represented in structural databases. Here we present CCFold, a generally applicable threading-based algorithm which produces coiled-coil models from protein sequence only. The algorithm is based on a statistical analysis of experimentally determined structures and can handle any hydrophobic repeat patterns in addition to the most common heptads. We demonstrate that CCFold outperforms general-purpose computational folding in terms of accuracy, while being faster by orders of magnitude. By combining the CCFold algorithm and Rosetta folding we generate representative dimer models for all IF protein classes. The source code is freely available at https://github.com/biocryst/IF",

    "abstract": "Libraries of structural prototypes that abstract protein local structures are known as structural alphabets and have proven to be very useful in various aspects of protein structure analyses and predictions. One such library, Protein Blocks (PBs), is composed of 16 standard 5-residues long structural prototypes. This form of analyzing proteins involves drafting its structure as a string of PBs. Thus, predicting the local structure of a protein in terms of protein blocks is a step towards the objective of predicting its 3-D structure. Here a new approach, kPred, is proposed towards this aim that is independent of the evolutionary information available. It involves (i) organizing the structural knowledge in the form of a database of pentapeptide fragments extracted from all protein structures in the PDB and (ii) apply a purely knowledge-based algorithm, not relying on secondary structure predictions or sequence alignment profiles, to scan this database and predict most probable backbone conformations for the protein local structures.\\n\\nBased on the strategy used for scanning the database, the method was able to achieve efficient mean Q16 accuracies between 40.8% and 66.3% for a non-redundant subset of the PDB filtered at 30% sequence identity cut-off. The impact of these scanning strategies on the prediction was evaluated and is discussed. A scoring function that gives a good estimate of the accuracy of prediction was further developed. This score estimates very well the accuracy of the algorithm (R2 of 0.82). An online version of the tool is provided freely for non-commercial usage at http://www.bo-protscience.fr/kpred/.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe past decade has witnessed a rapid development of data acquisition technologies that enable integrative genomic and proteomic analysis. One such technology is chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), developed for analyzing interactions between proteins and DNA via next-generation sequencing technologies. As ChIP-seq experiments are inexpensive and time-efficient, massive datasets from this domain have been acquired, introducing significant storage and maintenance challenges. To address the resulting Big Data problems, we propose a state-of-the-art lossless and lossy compression framework specifically designed for ChIP-seq Wig data, termed ChIPWig. Wig is a standard file format, which in this setting contains relevant read density information crucial for visualization and downstream processing. ChIPWig may be executed in two different modes: lossless and lossy. Lossless ChIPWig compression allows for random access and fast queries in the file through careful variable-length block-wise encoding. ChIPWig also stores the summary statistics of each block needed for guided access. Lossy ChIPWig, in contrast, performs quantization of the read density values before feeding them into the lossless ChIPWig compressor. Nonuniform lossy quantization leads to further reductions in the file size, while maintaining the same accuracy of the ChIP-seq peak calling and motif discovery pipeline based on the NarrowPeaks method tailor-made for Wig files. The compressors are designed using new statistical modeling approaches coupled with delta and arithmetic encoding.\\n\\nResultsWe tested the ChIPWig compressor on a number of ChIP-seq datasets generated by the ENCODE project. Lossless ChIPWig reduces the file sizes to merely 6% of the original, and offers an average 6-fold compression rate improvement compared to bigWig. The running times for compression and decompression are comparable to those of bigWig. The compression and decompression speed rates are of the order of 0.2 MB/sec using general purpose computers. ChIPWig with random access only slightly degrades the performance and running time when compared to the standard mode. In the lossy mode, the average file sizes reduce by 2-fold compared to the lossless mode. Most importantly, near-optimal nonuniform quantization with respect to mean-square distortion does not affect peak calling and motif discovery results on the data tested.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationSource code and binaries freely available for download at https://github.com/vidarmehr/ChIPWig\\n\\nContactmilenkov@illinois.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationIs available on bioRxiv.",

    "abstract": "Predation after release is one of the major concerns of hatchery fish conservation and propagation. However, the relationship among the size of hatchery fish, the predator species, and their behaviors in natural environments is largely unknown. To understand the relationship, we conducted predation experiments in outdoor tanks and a semi-natural stream with exposure to local predators. Two different ranges of fork lengths of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) were examined as prey sizes. Camera trap data showed that grey herons (Ardea cinerea) were the primary predator animal in the system, and that most herons utilized shallow areas in the morning or evening. Increasing the density of stocked salmon brought in more grey herons. More importantly, predation by grey herons resulted in the survival rate of larger salmon being significantly lower than that of the smaller salmon. Our results suggest that it is important to understand local predators, adjust the optimum body size of hatchery fish at release, and choose the appropriate stocking site and time of day for maximizing the effectiveness of fish stocking.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin comprising protein subunits LukS and LukF. Binding of LukS to human C5a receptor (hC5aR) on leukocytes induces secondary binding of LukF and assembly of lytic complexes. Previous analysis suggests that PVL consists of 4-plus-4 LukS/LukF subunits but the exact stoichiometry between LukS, LukF and hC5aR is not yet known. In this study we determine the stoichiometry and spatiotemporal dynamics of functional LukS/LukF-hC5aR complexes in living eukaryotic cells. By using rapid total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and single-molecule photobleaching analysis we found that tetrameric LukS-hC5aR complexes are formed within a cluster of receptors. Upon binding to hC5aR each LukS subunit binds LukF leading to lytic pore formation and simultaneous dissociation of receptors from the complex. Our findings corroborate a hetero-octamer model but provide a new view on the kinetics of crucial virulence factor assembly on integrated host cell membrane receptors.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfers between ancient species contain information about the relative timing of species diversification. Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers is detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result, often, no ranking of the species tree is compatible with the full set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers. Here we propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of (possibly inconsistent) time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum cumulated confidence score. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the potential of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency. MaxTiC is freely available, distributed along with a documentation and several examples: https://github.com/ssolo/ALE/tree/master/maxtic.",

    "abstract": "Structural variation in retinal blood vessels is associated with global vascular health in humans and may provide a readily accessible indicator of several diseases of vascular origin. Increasing evidence suggests variation in retinal vasculature is highly heritable. This study aimed to identify genetic determinants of retinal vascular traits. We reported a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for quantitative retinal vascular traits derived using semi-automatic image analysis of digital retinal photographs from the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside (GoDARTS) (n=1736) and the Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) (n=1358) cohorts. We identified a novel genome-wide significant locus at 19q13 (ACTN4/CAPN12) for retinal venular tortuosity (TortV), and one at 13q34 (COL4A2) for retinal arteriolar tortuosity (TortA); these two loci were subsequently confirmed in three independent cohorts (n=1413). In the combined analysis in ACTN4/CAPN12 the lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was rs1808382 (n=4507; Beta=-0.109; standard error (SE) =0.015; P=2.39x10-13) and in COL4A2 it was rs7991229 (n=4507; Beta=0.103; SE=0.015; P=4.66x10-12). Notably, the ACTN4/CAPN12 locus associated with retinal TortV is also associated with coronary artery disease and heart rate. Our findings demonstrate the contribution of genetics in retinal tortuosity traits, and provide new insights into cardiovascular diseases.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryRetinal vascular features are associated with wide range of diseases related to vascular health and provide an opportunity to understand early structural changes in vasculature which may help to predict disease risk. Emerging evidence indicates that retinal tortuosity traits are both associated with vascular health and highly heritable. However, the genetic architecture of retinal vascular tortuosity has not been investigated. We therefore performed a genome-wide association study on retinal arteriolar tortuosity (TortA) and retinal venular tortuosity trait (TortV) using data from two independent discovery cohorts of 3094 individuals of European-heritage. We found a novel associations at 19q13 (ACTN4/CAPN12) for TortV, and one at 13q34 (COL4A2) for TortA at discovery stage and validated in three independent cohorts. A significant association was subsequently found between lead SNPs at 19q13 and coronary artery disease, cardiovascular vascular risk factors and heart rate. We also performed genome-wide association studies for retinal vascular calibres and optic disc radius (ODradius) and replicated previously reported locus at 10q21.3 for ODradius. Our findings highlight genetic impacts on retinal venular tortuosity and it is association with cardiovascular disease. This may provide a molecular pathophysiological foundation for use of retinal vascular traits as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a major vector for arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. Combating the spread of these viruses requires a more complete understanding of the mosquito immune system. Recent studies have implicated genomic endogenous viral elements (EVEs) derived from non-retroviral RNA viruses in insect immunity. Because these elements are inserted into repetitive regions of the mosquito genome, their large-scale structure and organization with respect to other genomic elements has been difficult to resolve with short-read sequencing. To better define the origin, diversity and biological role of EVEs, we employed single-molecule, real-time sequencing technology to generate a high quality, long-read assembly of the Ae. aegypti-derived Aag2 cell line genome. We leverage the quality and contiguity of this assembly to characterize the diversity and genomic context of EVEs in the genome of this important model system. We find that EVEs in the Aag2 genome are acquired through recombination by LTR retrotransposons, and organize into larger loci (>50kbp) characterized by high LTR density. These EVE containing loci are associated with increased transcription factor binding sight density and increased production of anti-genomic piRNAs. We also detected piRNA processing corresponding to on-going viral infection. This global view of EVEs and piRNA responses demonstrates the ubiquity and diversity of these heritable elements that define small-RNA mediated antiviral immunity in mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "Ageing-relevant processes, like cellular senescence, are characterized by complex, often stochastic, events giving rise to heterogeneous cell populations. We hypothesized that entry into senescence of different primary human cells can be triggered by one early molecular event affecting the spatial organization of chromosomes. To test this, we combined whole-genome chromosome conformation capture, population and single-cell transcriptomics, super-resolution imaging, and functional analyses applied on proliferating and replicatively-senescent populations from three distinct human cell types. We found a number of genes involved in DNA conformation maintenance being suppressed upon senescence across cell types. Of these, the abundant high mobility group (HMG) B1 and B2 nuclear factors are quantitatively removed from cell nuclei before typical senescence markers appear, and mark a subset of topologically-associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Their loss coincides with obvious reorganization of chromatin interactions via the dramatic spatial clustering of CTCF foci. HMGB2 knock-down recapitulates this senescence-induced CTCF clustering, while also affecting insulation at TAD boundaries. We accordingly propose that HMGB-mediated deregulation of chromosome conformation constitutes a primer for the ensuing senescent program across cell types.",

Actual counts for various drugs have been sourced from www.vigiaccess.org. A feature found to be common to all drugs considered is that an exponential function adequately describes the pattern of cumulative counts. In the exponential model, the parameter in the exponent (rate constant) is robust and remains the same whether counts are corrected for exposure or not. We propose use of this rate constant as  adversity index of a drug. Drugs in use can be ranked by value of adversity index, lower value suggesting safer drug.\\n\\nKey pointsCumulative total of annual ADR report counts of opioid drugs follows an exponential pattern.

    "abstract": "Some ecologists suggest that trophy hunting (e.g. harvesting males with a desirable trait above a certain size) can lead to rapid phenotypic change, which has led to an ongoing discussion about evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting. Claims of rapid evolution come from the statistical analyses of data, with no examination of whether these results are theoretically plausible. We constructed simple quantitative genetic models to explore how a range of hunting scenarios affects the evolution of a trophy such as horn length. We show that trophy hunting does lead to trophy evolution defined as change in the mean breeding value of the trait. However, the fastest rates of phenotypic change attributable to trophy hunting via evolution that are theoretically possible under standard assumptions of quantitative genetics are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude slower than the fastest rates reported from statistical analyses. Our work suggests a re-evaluation of the likely evolutionary consequences of trophy hunting would be appropriate when setting policy. Our work does not consider the ethical or ecological consequences of trophy hunting.",

    "abstract": "Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) have significant regulatory influence on their neighbouring genes. Loss of synteny to CNEs through genomic rearrangements can, therefore, impact the transcriptional states of the cognate genes. Yet, the evolutionary implications of such chromosomal position effects have not been studied. Through genome-wide analysis of CNEs and the cognate genes of representative species from 5 different mammalian orders, we observed significant loss of synteny to CNEs in rat lineage. The CNEs and genes losing synteny had significant association with the fetal, but not the post-natal, brain development as assessed through ontology terms, developmental gene expression, chromatin marks and genetic mutations. The loss of synteny correlated with the independent evolutionary loss of fetus-specific upregulation of genes in rat brain. DNA-breakpoints implicated in brain abnormalities of germ-line origin had significant representation between CNE and the gene that exhibited loss of synteny, signifying the underlying developmental tolerance of genomic rearrangements that had allowed the evolutionary splits of CNEs and the cognate genes in rodent lineage. These observations highlighted the non-trivial impact of chromosomal position-effect in shaping the evolutionary dynamics of mammalian brain development and might explain loss of brain traits, like cerebral folding of cortex, in rodent lineage.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryExpression of genes is regulated by proximally located non-coding regulatory elements. Loss of linear proximity between gene and its regulatory element thus can alter the expression of gene. Such a phenomenon can be tested at whole genome scale using evolutionary methods. We compared the positions of genes and regulatory elements in 5 different mammals and identified the significant loss of proximities between gene and their regulatory elements in rat during evolution. Brain development related function was selectively enriched among the genes and regulatory elements that had lost the proximity in rat. The observed separation of genes and their regulatory elements was strongly associated with the evolutionary loss of developmental gene expression pattern in rat brain, which coincided with the loss of brain traits in rodents. The study highlighted the importance of relative chromosomal positioning of genes and their gene regulatory elements in the evolution of phenotypes.",

Here, we show that these two strategies rely on different neural systems. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation to inhibit the right frontopolar cortex, we were able to selectively inhibit directed exploration while leaving random exploration intact. This suggests a causal role for right frontopolar cortex in directed, but not random, exploration and that directed and random exploration rely on (at least partially) dissociable neural systems.",

We present methods to control for inherent holographic noise, thereby establishing a set of reliable quantitative features. Together, these contributions permit continuous digital holographic cytometry for three or more days. Applying our approach to human melanoma cells treated with a panel of cancer therapeutics, we can track the response of each cell, simultaneously classifying multiple behaviors such as cell cycle length, motility, apoptosis, senescence, and heterogeneity of response to each therapeutic.
