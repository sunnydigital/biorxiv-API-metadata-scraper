    "abstract": "Existing techniques to reconstruct tree models of progression for accumulative processes, such as cancer, seek to estimate causation by combining correlation and a frequentist notion of temporal priority. In this paper, we define a novel theoretical framework called CAPRESE (CAncer PRogression Extraction with Single Edges) to reconstruct such models based on the notion of probabilistic causation defined by Suppes. We consider a general reconstruction setting complicated by the presence of noise in the data due to biological variation, as well as experimental or measurement errors. To improve tolerance to noise we define and use a shrinkage-like estimator. We prove the correctness of our algorithm by showing asymptotic convergence to the correct tree under mild constraints on the level of noise. Moreover, on synthetic data, we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, that it is efficient even with a relatively small number of samples and that its performance quickly converges to its asymptote as the number of samples increases. For real cancer datasets obtained with different technologies, we highlight biologically significant differences in the progressions inferred with respect to other competing techniques and we also show how to validate conjectured biological relations with progression models.",

    "abstract": "The formation of the Primitive Streak is the first visible sign of gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers are formed from a single epithelium during early development. Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) provide a good system to understand the molecular and cellular events associated with these processes. Previous work, both in embryos and in culture, has shown how converging signals from both Nodal/TGF{beta}R and Wnt/{beta}-Catenin signalling pathways specify cells to adopt a Primitive Streak like fate and direct them to undertake an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, many of these approaches have relied on genetic analyses without taking into account the temporal progression of events within single cells. In addition, it is still unclear as to what extent events in the embryo are able to be reproduced in culture. Here, we combine flow-cytometry and a quantitative live single-cell imaging approach to demonstrate how the controlled differentiation of mouse ESCs (mESCs) towards a Primitive Streak fate in culture results in cells displaying many of the characteristics observed during early mouse development including transient Brachyury expression, EMT and increased motility. We also find that the EMT initiates the process, and this is both fuelled and terminated by the action of Bra, whose expression is dependent on the EMT and {beta}-Catenin activity. As a consequence of our analysis, we propose that a major output of Brachyury expression is in controlling the velocity of the cells that are transiting out of the Primitive Streak.",

    "abstract": "Systematic prediction of cellular response to perturbations is a central challenge in biology, both for mechanistic explanations and for the design of effective therapeutic interventions. We addressed this challenge using a computational/experimental method, termed perturbation biology, which combines high-throughput (phospho)proteomic and phenotypic response profiles to targeted perturbations, prior information from signaling databases and network inference algorithms from statistical physics. The resulting network models are computationally executed to predict the effects of tens of thousands of untested perturbations. We report cell type-specific network models of signaling in RAF-inhibitor resistant melanoma cells based on data from 89 combinatorial perturbation conditions and 143 readouts per condition. Quantitative simulations predicted c-Myc as an effective co-target with BRAF or MEK. Experiments showed that co-targeting c-Myc, using the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, and the RAF/MEK pathway, using kinase inhibitors is both effective and synergistic in this context. We propose these combinations as pre-clinical candidates to prevent or overcome RAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "SummaryHere we introduce a novel web-infrastructure for differential network analysis. The aim of the web-site is to provide a comprehensive collection of tools for network inference, network comparison and network reproducibility analysis. Four main processes are available through the web service: the network inference process which include 11 reconstruction algorithms, the network distance process with 3 available metrics, the network stability process which includes all the network reconstruction methods and network distances and the netwok statistic process which computes the most common measures for network characterization. We introduce here a novel infrastructure which allows the user-interface logic to be separated from computing services and the asynchronous task management. Task submission is implemented mimicking the high performance computing queue submission system which allows to run multiple jobs without affecting the front-end server.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe web-site is available at https://renette.fbk.eu, the implementation is based on the django framework and Apache, with all major browsers supported. Furthermore, the whole project is Open Source under GPLv2 and the code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MPBA/renette for local installation.\\n\\nContactjurman@fbk.eu;",

    "abstract": "In times of severe environmental changes and resulting shifts in the geographical distribution of animal and plant species it is crucial to unravel the mechanisms responsible for the dynamics of species ranges. Without such a mechanistic understanding reliable projections of future species distributions are difficult to derive. Species ranges may be highly dynamic and subject to  elastic behavior, i.e. a range contraction following a period of range expansion as a consequence of eco-evolutionary feedbacks due to (rapid) dispersal evolution. It has been proposed that this phenomenon occurs in habitat gradients, which are characterized by a negative cline in selection for dispersal from the range core towards the margin, as one may find with increasing patch isolation, for example. Using individual-based simulations we show in this study that the presence of Allee effects is a necessary condition for ranges to exhibit elastic behavior. A pronounced source/sink-structure at the range margin caused by Allee effects, leads to selection for decreased dispersal and subsequently to lowered colonization rates and increased local extinction risk. In addition, the nature of the gradient is crucial, as gradients which do not select for lower dispersal at the margin than in the core (patch size, growth rate, demographic stochasticity, extinction rate) did not lead to elastic range behavior.\\n\\nThus, we argue that range contractions are likely to occur after periods of expansion for species living in gradients of increasing patch isolation, which suffer from Allee effects.",
