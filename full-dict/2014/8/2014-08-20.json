    "abstract": "Several methods have been proposed to test for introgression across genomes. One method tests for a genome-wide excess of shared derived alleles between taxa using Pattersons D statistic, but does not establish which loci show such an excess or whether the excess is due to introgression or ancestral population structure. Several recent studies have extended the use of D by applying the statistic to small genomic regions, rather than genome-wide. Here, we use simulations and whole genome data from Heliconius butterflies to investigate the behavior of D in small genomic regions. We find that D is unreliable in this situation as it gives inflated values when effective population size is low, causing D outliers to cluster in genomic regions of reduced diversity. As an alternative, we propose a related statistic [Formula] a modified version of a statistic originally developed to estimate the genome-wide fraction of admixture. [Formula] is not subject to the same biases as D, and is better at identifying introgressed loci. Finally, we show that both D and [Formula] outliers tend to cluster in regions of low absolute divergence (dXY), which can confound a recently proposed test for differentiating introgression from shared ancestral variation at individual loci.",

    "abstract": "The Dobzhansky-Muller model posits that incompatibilities between alleles at different loci cause speciation. However, it is known that if the alleles involved in a Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility (DMI) between two loci are neutral, the resulting reproductive isolation cannot be maintained in the presence of either mutation or gene flow. Here we propose that speciation can emerge through the collective effects of multiple neutral DMIs that cannot, individually, cause speciation--a mechanism we call emergent speciation. We investigate emergent speciation using a haploid neutral network model with recombination. We find that certain combinations of multiple neutral DMIs can lead to speciation. Complex DMIs and high recombination rate between the DMI loci facilitate emergent speciation. These conditions are likely to occur in nature. We conclude that the interaction between DMIs may be a root cause of the origin of species.",

    "abstract": "Surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of the human influenza A virus evolve under selection pressure to escape the human adaptive immune response and antiviral drug treatments. In addition to these external selection pressures, some mutations in HA are known to affect the adaptive landscape of NA, and vice versa, because these two proteins are physiologically interlinked. However, the extent to which evolution of one protein affects the evolution of the other is unknown. Here we develop a novel phylogenetic method for detecting the signatures of such genetic interactions between mutations in different genes, that is, inter-gene epistasis. Using this method, we show that influenza surface proteins evolve in a coordinated way, with substitutions in HA affecting substitutions in NA and vice versa, at many sites. Of particular interest is our finding that the oseltamivir-resistance mutations in NA in subtype H1N1 were likely facilitated by prior mutations in HA. Our results illustrate that the adaptive landscape of a viral protein is remarkably sensitive to its genomic context and, more generally, imply that the evolution of any single protein must be understood within the context of the entire evolving genome.",

    "abstract": "Binding interactions between proteins and other molecules mediate numerous cellular processes, including metabolism, signaling, and regulation of gene expression. These interactions evolve in response to changes in the protein's chemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic), or when genes duplicate and diverge. Several recent studies have shown the importance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution. Here we investigate how structural coupling between protein folding and binding -- the fact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded -- gives rise to evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding strength. Using biophysical and evolutionary modeling, we show how these protein traits can emerge as evolutionary \"spandrels\" even if they do not confer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve strong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to stabilize the protein if misfolding is deleterious. Furthermore, such proteins may have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending on random mutation events. These observations may explain the abundance of apparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in high-throughput assays. In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding and deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of biophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra folding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is developed. These findings have important consequences for our understanding of fundamental evolutionary principles of both natural and engineered proteins.",

    "abstract": "Background Recently available whole genome sequences of three citrus species: one Citrus clementina and two Citrus sinensis genomes have made it possible to understand the features of candidate disease resistance genes with nucleotide-binding sites (NBS) domain in Citrus and how NBS genes differ between hybrid and original Citrus species. Result We identified and re-annotated NBS genes from three citrus genomes and found similar numbers of NBS genes in those citrus genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of all citrus NBS genes across three genomes showed that there are three approximately evenly numbered groups: one group contains the Toll-Interleukin receptor (TIR) domain and two different groups that contain the Coiled Coil (CC) domain. Motif analysis confirmed that the two groups of CC-containing NBS genes are from different evolutionary origins. We partitioned NBS genes into clades using NBS domain sequence distances and found most clades include NBS genes from all three citrus genomes. This suggests that NBS genes in three citrus genomes may come from shared ancestral origins. We also mapped the re-sequenced reads of three pomelo and three Mandarin orange genomes onto the Citrus sinensis genome. We found that most NBS genes of the hybrid C. sinensis genome have corresponding homologous genes in both pomelo and mandarin genome. The homologous NBS genes in pomelo and mandarin may explain why the NBS genes in their hybrid Citrus sinensis are similar to those in Citrus clementina in this study. Furthermore, sequence variation amongst citrus NBS genes were shaped by multiple independent and shared accelerated mutation accumulation events among different groups of NBS genes and in different citrus genomes. Conclusion Our comparative analyses yield valuable insight into the understanding of the structure, evolution and organization of NBS genes in Citrus genomes. There are significantly more NBS genes in Citrus genomes compared to other plant species. NBS genes in hybrid C. sinensis genomes are very similar to those in progenitor C. clementina genome and they may be derived from possible common ancestral gene copies. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis showed that there are three groups of plant NBS genes while CC-containing NBS genes can be divided into two groups.",
