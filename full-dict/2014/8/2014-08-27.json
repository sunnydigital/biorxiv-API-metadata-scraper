    "abstract": "The formation of the Primitive Streak is the first visible sign of gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers are formed from a single epithelium during early development. Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) provide a good system to understand the molecular and cellular events associated with these processes. Previous work, both in embryos and in culture, has shown how converging signals from both Nodal/TGF{beta}R and Wnt/{beta}-Catenin signalling pathways specify cells to adopt a Primitive Streak like fate and direct them to undertake an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, many of these approaches have relied on genetic analyses without taking into account the temporal progression of events within single cells. In addition, it is still unclear as to what extent events in the embryo are able to be reproduced in culture. Here, we combine flow-cytometry and a quantitative live single-cell imaging approach to demonstrate how the controlled differentiation of mouse ESCs (mESCs) towards a Primitive Streak fate in culture results in cells displaying many of the characteristics observed during early mouse development including transient Brachyury expression, EMT and increased motility. We also find that the EMT initiates the process, and this is both fuelled and terminated by the action of Bra, whose expression is dependent on the EMT and {beta}-Catenin activity. As a consequence of our analysis, we propose that a major output of Brachyury expression is in controlling the velocity of the cells that are transiting out of the Primitive Streak.",

    "abstract": "SummaryHere we introduce a novel web-infrastructure for differential network analysis. The aim of the web-site is to provide a comprehensive collection of tools for network inference, network comparison and network reproducibility analysis. Four main processes are available through the web service: the network inference process which include 11 reconstruction algorithms, the network distance process with 3 available metrics, the network stability process which includes all the network reconstruction methods and network distances and the netwok statistic process which computes the most common measures for network characterization. We introduce here a novel infrastructure which allows the user-interface logic to be separated from computing services and the asynchronous task management. Task submission is implemented mimicking the high performance computing queue submission system which allows to run multiple jobs without affecting the front-end server.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe web-site is available at https://renette.fbk.eu, the implementation is based on the django framework and Apache, with all major browsers supported. Furthermore, the whole project is Open Source under GPLv2 and the code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MPBA/renette for local installation.\\n\\nContactjurman@fbk.eu;",

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries of direct acting antivirals against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) have raised hopes of effective treatment via combination therapies. Yet rapid evolution and high diversity of HCV populations, combined with the reality of suboptimal treatment adherence, make drug resistance a clinical and public health concern. We develop a general model incorporating viral dynamics and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics to assess how suboptimal adherence affects resistance development and clinical outcomes. We derive design principles and adaptive treatment strategies, identifying a high-risk period when missing doses is particularly risky for de novo resistance, and quantifying the number of additional doses needed to compensate when doses are missed. Using data from large-scale resistance assays, we demonstrate that the risk of resistance can be reduced substantially by applying these principles to a combination therapy of daclatasvir and asunaprevir. By providing a mechanistic framework to link patient characteristics to the risk of resistance, these findings show the potential of rational treatment design.",

    "abstract": "Extreme fetal growth is associated with increased susceptibility to a range of adult diseases through an unknown mechanism of cellular memory. We tested whether heritable epigenetic processes in long-lived CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed evidence for re-programming associated with the extremes of fetal growth. Here we show that both fetal growth restriction and over-growth are associated with global shifts towards DNA hypermethylation, targeting cis-regulatory elements in proximity to genes involved in glucose homeostasis and stem cell function. A sexually dimorphic response was found, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) associated with substantially greater epigenetic dysregulation in males but large for gestational age (LGA) growth affecting females predominantly. The findings are consistent with extreme fetal growth interacting with variable fetal susceptibility to influence cellular aging and metabolic characteristics through epigenetic mechanisms, potentially generating biomarkers that could identify infants at higher risk for chronic disease later in life.",

    "abstract": "The gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the rapid replenishment of snake venom following expenditure are currently unknown. Using a comparative transcriptomic approach we find that venomous and non-venomous species produce similar numbers of secreted products in their venom or salivary glands and that only one transcription factor (Tbx3) is expressed in venom glands but not salivary glands. We also find evidence for temporal variation in venom production. We have generated a draft genome sequence for the painted saw-scaled viper, Echis coloratus, and identified conserved transcription factor binding sites in the upstream regions of venom genes. We find binding sites to be conserved across members of the same gene family, but not between gene families, indicating that multiple gene regulatory networks are involved in venom production. Finally, we suggest that negative regulation may be important for rapid activation of the venom replenishment cycle.",
