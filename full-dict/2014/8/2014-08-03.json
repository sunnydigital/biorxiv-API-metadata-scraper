Previous studies of bacterial evolutionary dynamics have shown that populations evolving on fitness landscapes follow predictable paths. In this article, we develop a general mathematical model of evolution and hypothesise that it can be used to understand, and avoid, the emergence of antibiotic resistance.\n\nMethods and FindingsWe develop a Markov Chain model of evolution in asexually reproducing populations which is an encoding of the Strong Selection Weak Mutation model of evolution on fitness landscapes. This model associates the global properties of the fitness landscape with the algebraic properties of the Markov Chain transition matrix and allows us to derive general results on the non-commutativity and irreversibility of natural selection as well as antibiotic cycling strategies. Utilizing this formalism, we analyse 15 empirical fitness landscapes of E. coli under selection by different {beta}-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate that the emergence of resistance to a given antibiotic can be both hindered and promoted by different sequences of drug application. We show that resistance to a given antibiotic is promoted in 61.4%, 68.6% and 70.3% of possible orderings of single, pair or triple prior drug administrations, respectively. Further, we derive optimal drug application sequences with which we can probabilistically  steer the population through genotype space to avoid the emergence of resistance.\n\nConclusionsOur model provides generalisable results of interest to theorists studying evolution as well as providing specific, testable predictions for experimentalists to validate our methods. Further, these results suggest a new strategy in the war against antibiotic-therapy-resistant organisms: drug sequencing to shepherd an evolving population through genotype space to states from which resistance cannot emerge and from which we can maximize the likelihood of successful therapy using existing drugs. While our results are derived using a specific class of antibiotics, the method is generalisable to other situations, including the emergence of resistance to targeted therapy in cancer and how species could change secondary to changing climate or geographical movement.",

    "abstract": "MotivationExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have discovered thousands of genetic variants that regulate gene expression, enabling a better understanding of the functional role of non-coding sequences. However, eQTL studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and genome-wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele specific expression (ASE) is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of RNA-seq reads matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In principle, when genotype information is not readily available it could be inferred from the RNA-seq reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls.\\n\\nResultsWe present QuASAR, Quantitative Allele Specific Analysis of Reads, a novel statistical learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE. The proposed ASE inference step takes into consideration the uncertainty in the genotype calls while including parameters that model base-call errors in sequencing and allelic over-dispersion. We validated our method with experimental data for which high quality genotypes are available. Results for an additional dataset with multiple replicates at different sequencing depths demonstrate that QuASAR is a powerful tool for ASE analysis when genotypes are not available.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://github.com/piquelab/QuASAR\\n\\nContactfluca@wayne.edu; rpique@wayne.edu",

    "abstract": "In order to compare stand structure and woody species diversity of subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests along a latitudinal thermal gradient of the Ryukyu Archipelago, tree censuses in a 750 m2 plot in Okinawa Island and a 400 m2 plot in Ishigaki Island were performed. The number of layers increased along a latitudinal thermal gradient from four in the forest of Okinawa Island to five in the forest of Ishigaki Island. The values of Shannons index H' and Pielous index J' tended to increase from the top layer downward in the forest of Okinawa Island, whereas in the forest of Ishigaki Island, these values tended to increase from the bottom layer upward. High woody species diversity depended on small-sized trees in the Okinawa forest, whereas it depended on large-sized trees in the Ishigaki forest. The woody species diversity is higher in the Okinawa forest (H' = 4.83 bit) than in the Ishigaki forest (H' = 4.36 bit). According to successively decreasing height of layers from the top downward, the value of H' increased continuously from the top layer downward in the Okinawa forest. This increasing trend was different from the Ishigaki forest, where the value of H' increased up to the second layer and then decreased downward. In the Okinawa forest, the expected number of species increased continuously from the top toward the bottom layer, i.e. the bottom layer contained the highest potential number of species (65). However, in the Ishigaki forest, it increased from the top to the fourth layer and then decreased to the bottom layer, i.e. the fourth layer contained the highest potential number of species (90). The floristic composition in the Okinawa forest was different from that in the Ishigaki forest in terms of similarity index, though approximately half of the species were common between them. The highest degree of similarity in floristic composition was between the second and third layers in the Okinawa forest, whereas it was between the third and bottom layers in the Ishigaki forest. The degree of similarity in floristic composition among layers was higher in the Okinawa forest than in the Ishigaki forest. Except the top and the bottom layer respectively in the forests of Okinawa Island and Ishigaki Island, the spatial distribution of trees was random in each layer. The degree of overlapping in the spatial distribution of trees among layers in these two forests suggested that trees in the upper two layers in the Ishigaki forest can catch sufficient light, while light can not penetrate easily to the lower three layers in both of the forests. As a result, almost species in the lower layers might be shade-tolerant in both of the forests. For both of the forests, mean tree weight of each layer decreased from the top downward, whereas the corresponding tree density increased from the top downward. This trend resembled the mean weight-density trajectory of self-thinning plant populations.",
