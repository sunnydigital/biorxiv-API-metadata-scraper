    "abstract": "The Turkic peoples represent a diverse collection of ethnic groups defined by the Turkic languages. These groups have dispersed across a vast area, including Siberia, Northwest China, Central Asia, East Europe, the Caucasus, Anatolia, the Middle East, and Afghanistan. The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia. Previous genetic studies have not identified a clear-cut unifying genetic signal for the Turkic peoples, which lends support for language replacement rather than demic diffusion as the model for the Turkic languages expansion. We addressed the genetic origin of 373 individuals from 22 Turkic-speaking populations, representing their current geographic range, by analyzing genome-wide high-density genotype data. Most of the Turkic peoples studied, except those in Central Asia, genetically resembled their geographic neighbors, in agreement with the elite dominance model of language expansion. However, western Turkic peoples sampled across West Eurasia shared an excess of long chromosomal tracts that are identical by descent (IBD) with populations from present-day South Siberia and Mongolia (SSM), an area where historians center a series of early Turkic and non-Turkic steppe polities. The observed excess of long chromosomal tracts IBD (> 1cM) between populations from SSM and Turkic peoples across West Eurasia was statistically significant. Finally, we used the ALDER method and inferred admixture dates ([~]9th-17th centuries) that overlap with the Turkic migrations of the 5th-16th centuries. Thus, our results indicate historical admixture among Turkic peoples, and the recent shared ancestry with modern populations in SSM supports one of the hypothesized homelands for their nomadic Turkic and related Mongolic ancestors.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCenturies of nomadic migrations have ultimately resulted in the distribution of Turkic languages over a large area ranging from Siberia, across Central Asia to Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Despite the profound cultural impact left by these nomadic peoples, little is known about their prehistoric origins. Moreover, because contemporary Turkic speakers tend to genetically resemble their geographic neighbors, it is not clear whether their nomadic ancestors left an identifiable genetic trace. In this study, we show that Turkic-speaking peoples sampled across the Middle East, Caucasus, East Europe, and Central Asia share varying proportions of Asian ancestry that originate in a single area, southern Siberia and Mongolia. Mongolic- and Turkic-speaking populations from this area bear an unusually high number of long chromosomal tracts that are identical by descent with Turkic peoples from across west Eurasia. Admixture induced linkage disequilibrium decay across chromosomes in these populations indicates that admixture occurred during the 9th-17th centuries, in agreement with the historically recorded Turkic nomadic migrations and later Mongol expansion. Thus, our findings reveal genetic traces of recent large-scale nomadic migrations and map their source to a previously hypothesized area of Mongolia and southern Siberia.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of animal colouration is importantly driven by sexual selection operating on traits used to transmit information to rivals and potential mates, which therefore, have major impacts on fitness. Reflectance spectrometry has become a standard colour-measuring tool, especially after the discovery of tetrachromacy in birds and their ability to detect UV. Birds plumage patterns may be invisible to humans, necessitating a reliable and objective way of assessing colouration not dependent on human vision. Plumage colouration measurements can be taken directly on live birds in the field or in the lab (e.g. on collected feathers). Therefore, it is essential to determine which sampling method yields more repeatable and reliable measures, and which of the available quantitative approaches best assess the repeatability of these measures. Using a spectrophotometer, we measured melanin-based colouration in barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) plumage. We assessed the repeatability of measures obtained with both traditional sampling methods separately to quantitatively determine their reliability. We used the ANOVA-based method for calculating the repeatability of measurements from two years separately, and the GLMM-based method to calculate overall adjusted repeatabilities for both years. We repeated the assessment for the whole reflectance spectrum range and only the human-visible part, to assess the influence of the UV component on the reliabilities of sampling methodologies. Our results reveal very high repeatability for lab measurements and a lower, still moderate to high repeatability, for field measurements. Both increased when limited to only the human-visible part, for all plumage patches except the throat, where we observed the opposite trend. Repeatability between sampling methods was quite low including the whole spectrum, but moderate including only the human-visible part. Our results suggest higher reliability for measurements in the lab and higher power and accuracy of the GLMM-based method. They also suggest UV reflectance differences amongst different plumage patches.",

    "abstract": "Hunchback (Hb) is a bifunctional transcription factor that activates and represses distinct enhancers. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that Hb can activate and repress the same enhancer. Computational models predicted that Hb bifunctionally regulates the even-skipped (eve) stripe 3+7 enhancer (eve3+7) in Drosophila blastoderm embryos. We measured and modeled eve expression at cellular resolution under multiple genetic perturbations and found that the eve3+7 enhancer could not explain endogenous eve stripe 7 behavior. Instead, we found that eve stripe 7 is controlled by two enhancers: the canonical eve3+7 and a sequence encompassing the minimal eve stripe 2 enhancer (eve2+7). Hb bifunctionally regulates eve stripe 7, but it executes these two activities on different pieces of regulatory DNA-it activates the eve2+7 enhancer and represses the eve3+7 enhancer. These two \\\"shadow enhancers\\\" use different regulatory logic to create the same pattern.\\n\\nSignificance statementEnhancers are regions of regulatory DNA that control gene expression and cell fate decisions during development. Enhancers compute the expression pattern of their target gene by reading the concentrations of input regulatory proteins. Many developmental genes contain multiple enhancers that control the same output pattern, but it is unclear if these enhancers all compute the pattern in the same way. We use measurements in single cells and computational models in Drosophila embryos to demonstrate that two enhancers that encode the same gene expression pattern compute differently: the same regulatory protein represses one enhancer and activates the other. Pairs of enhancers that output the same pattern by performing different computations may impart special properties to developmental systems.",
