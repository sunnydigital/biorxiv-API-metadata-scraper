    "abstract": "The Data Rate Theorem carries deep implications for theories of embodied cognition, extensions providing a spectrum of necessary conditions dynamic statistical models useful in empirical studies. A large deviations argument, however, implies that the regulation and stabilization of such systems is itself an interpenetrating phenomenon necessarily convoluted with embodied cognition. For humans, the central regulatory role of culture has long been known. Although a ground-state collapse analogous to generalized anxiety appears ubiquitous to such systems, lack of cultural modulation in real-time automatons or distributed cognition man-machine  cockpits makes them subject to a pathology under which  all possible targets are enemies.",

    "abstract": "The capacity for aerial maneuvering was likely a major influence on the evolution of flying animals. Here we evaluate consequences of paravian morphology for aerial performance by quantifying static stability and control effectiveness of physical models for numerous taxa sampled from within the lineage leading to birds (Paraves). Results of aerodynamic testing are mapped phylogenetically to examine how maneuvering characteristics correspond to tail shortening, forewing elaboration, and other morphological features. In the evolution of Paraves we observe shifts from static stability to inherently unstable aerial planforms; control effectiveness also migrated from tails to the forewings. These shifts suggest that some degree of aerodynamic control and and capacity for maneuvering preceded the evolution of strong power stroke. The timing of shifts also suggests features normally considered in light of development of a power stroke may play important roles in control.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear transport is an essential part of eukaryotic cell function. Several assays exist to measure the rate of this process, but not at the single-cell level. Here, we developed a fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)- based method to determine nuclear import and export rates independently in individual live cells. To overcome the inherent noise of single-cell measurements, we performed sequential FRAPs on the same cell. We found large cell-to-cell variation in transport rates within isogenic yeast populations. Our data suggest that a main determinant of this heterogeneity may be variability in the number of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). For passive transport, this component explained most of the variability. Actively transported proteins were influenced by variability in additional components, including general factors such as the Ran-GTP gradient as well as specific regulators of the export rate. By considering mother-daughter pairs, we showed that mitotic segregation of the transport machinery is too noisy to control cellular inheritance. Finally, we studied mother-daughter cell asymmetry in the localization of the transcription factor Ace2, which is specifically concentrated in daughter cell nuclei. We found that this asymmetry is the outcome of a higher ratio of import rate to export rate in daughters. Interestingly, rather than reduced export in the daughter cell, as previously hypothesized, rates of both import and export are faster in daughter cells than in mother cells, but the magnitude of increase is greater for import. These results shed light into cell-to-cell variation in cellular dynamics and its sources.",

    "abstract": "Epistasis can make adaptation highly unpredictable, rendering evolutionary trajectories contingent on the chance effects of initial mutations. We used experimental evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify this effect, finding dramatic differences in adaptability between 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 105 evolved clones showed no significant effect of initial genotype on future sequence-level evolution. Instead, reconstruction experiments revealed a consistent pattern of diminishing returns epistasis. Our results suggest that many beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled: they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. Sequence-level adaptation is thus highly stochastic. Nevertheless, fitness evolution is strikingly predictable because differences in adaptability are determined only by global fitness-mediated epistasis, not by the identity of individual mutations.",

Our results: confirm the controversial assertion that genetic differences between human populations on a global scale are bigger for the NRY than for mtDNA; suggest very small ancestral effective population sizes (<100) for the out-of-Africa migration as well as for many human populations; and indicate that the ratio of female effective population size to male effective population size (Nf/Nm) has been greater than one throughout the history of modern humans, and has recently increased due to faster growth in Nf. However, we also find substantial differences in patterns of mtDNA vs. NRY variation in different regional groups; thus, global patterns of variation are not necessarily representative of specific geographic regions.",
