    "abstract": "Proteasome inhibition elicits an evolutionarily conserved response wherein proteasome subunit mRNAs are upregulated, resulting in recovery of proteasome activity. We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf1 mediates this homeostatic response in mammalian cells. We show here that Nrf1 is initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but is rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on p97/VCP. Normally, retrotranslocated Nrf1 is degraded by the proteasome and active species do not accumulate. However, in cells with compromised proteasomes, retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved N-terminal to Leu-104 to yield a fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER-membrane. Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon proteasome inhibition. Our data uncover an unexpected role for p97 in activation of a transcription factor by relocalizing it from the ER lumen to the cytosol.",

    "abstract": "Presented here are the structures of three biologically important sweet sugars, based on the additivity of covalent atomic radii in bond lengths. The observed smaller carbon-oxygen distances involving the  anomeric carbons of the open chain hexoses are explained here, for the first time, as due to the smaller covalent double bond radii of carbon and oxygen than their single bond radii in the cyclic forms and in sucrose. The atomic structures of all the three carbohydrates, drawn to scale in colour, have been presented here also for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Incremental selection within a population, defined as a limited fitness change following a mutation, is an important aspect of many evolutionary processes and can significantly affect a large number of mutations through the genome. Strongly advantageous or deleterious mutations are detected through the fixation of mutations in the population, using the synonymous to non-synonymous mutations ratio in sequences. There are currently to precise methods to estimate incremental selection occurring over limited periods. We here provide for the first time such a detailed method and show its precision and its applicability to the genomic analysis of selection. A special case of evolution is rapid, short term micro-evolution, where organism are under constant adaptation, occurring for example in viruses infecting a new host, B cells mutating during a germinal center reactions or mitochondria evolving within a given host. The proposed method is a novel mixed lineage tree/sequence based method to detect within population selection as defined by the effect of mutations on the average number of offspring. Specifically, we pro-pose to measure the log of the ratio between the number of leaves in lineage trees branches following synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. This method does not suffer from the need of a baseline model and is practically not affected by sampling biases. In order to show the wide applicability of this method, we apply it to multiple cases of micro-evolution, and show that it can detect genes and inter-genic regions using the selection rate and detect selection pressures in viral proteins and in the immune response to pathogens.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of data suggests that the secondary structures adopted by G-rich polynucleotides may be more diverse than previously thought and that the definition of G-quadruplex-forming sequences should be broadened. We studied solution structures of a series of naturally occurring and model single-stranded DNA fragments defying the G3+NL1G3+NL2G3+NL3G3+ formula, which is used in most of the current GQ-search algorithms. The results confirm the GQ-forming potential of such sequences and suggest the existence of new types of GQs. We developed an improved (broadened) GQ-search algorithm (http://niifhm.ru/nauchnye-issledovanija/otdel-molekuljarnoj-biologii-i-genetiki/laboratorija-iskusstvennogo-antitelogeneza/497-2/) that accounts for the recently reported new types of GQs.",

    "abstract": "Copy number variation (CNV) is important and widespread in the genome, and is a major cause of disease and phenotypic diversity. Herein, we perform genome-wide CNV analysis in 12 diversified chicken genomes based on whole genome sequencing. A total of 9,025 CNV regions (CNVRs) covering 100.1 Mb and representing 9.6% of the chicken genome are identified, ranging in size from 1.1 to 268.8 kb with an average of 11.1 kb. Sequencing-based predictions are confirmed at high validation rate by two independent approaches, including array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The Pearson?s correlation values between sequencing and aCGH results range from 0.395 to 0.740, and qPCR experiments reveal a positive validation rate of 91.71% and a false negative rate of 22.43%. In total, 2,188 predicted CNVRs (24.2%) span 2,182 RefSeq genes (36.8%) associated with specific biological functions. Besides two previously accepted copy number variable genes EDN3 and PRLR, we also find some promising genes with potential in phenotypic variants. FZD6 and LIMS1, two genes related to diseases susceptibility and resistance are covered by CNVRs. Highly duplicated SOCS2 may lead to higher bone mineral density. Entire or partial duplication of some genes like POPDC3 and LBFABP may have great economic importance in poultry breeding. Our results based on extensive genetic diversity provide the first individualized chicken CNV map and genome-wide gene copy number estimates and warrant future CNV association studies for important traits of chickens.",
