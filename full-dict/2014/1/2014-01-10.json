    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing is increasingly being used to study samples composed of mixtures of organisms, such as in clinical applications where the presence of a pathogen at very low abundance may be highly important. We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species- and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.",

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory is required for motility, morphology of, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers en route to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1 and kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for SNX-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde-retrograde polarity of transport carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.",

    "abstract": "In a host-parasite system, the constitutive interaction among the species, regulated by the growth rates and functional response, may induce populations to approach equilibrium or sometimes to exhibit simple cycles or peculiar oscillations, such as chaos. A large carrying capacity coupled with appropriate parasitism effectiveness frequently drives long-term apparent oscillatory dynamics in population size. We name these oscillations due to the structure of the constitutive interaction among species as ecological.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are also exceptional cases when the evolving quantitative traits of the hosts and parasites induce oscillating population size, which we call as evolutionary. This oscillatory behavior is dependent on the speed of evolutionary adaptation and degree of evolutionary trade-off. A moderate level of negative trade-off is essential for the existence of oscillations. Evolutionary oscillations due to the host-parasite coevolution (known as the Red Queen) can be observed beyond the ecological oscillations, especially when there are more than two competing species involved.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryWe investigate several cases yielding to oscillating host-parasite populations, and we found that the Red Queen hypothesis can explain some of the exceptional cases.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract:\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=114 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/001735_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1280478org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3d6e28org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b2718org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@133a78d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
