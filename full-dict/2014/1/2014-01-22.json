    "abstract": "Annotations of gene structures and regulatory elements can inform genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, choosing the relevant annotations for interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. We describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic element that are enriched or depleted for loci that influence a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. We applied the model to GWAS of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, BMI, and Crohns disease. For each trait, we evaluated the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over a hundred tissues and cell lines. We show that the fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs that influence protein sequence ranges from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for LDL cholesterol); that repressed chromatin is significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits; and that cell type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites are enriched for SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, by re-weighting each GWAS using information from functional genomics, we increase the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5%.",

    "abstract": "The ability to locate and annotate mitochondrial genes is an important practical issue, given the rapidly increasing number of mitogenomes appearing in the public databases. Unfortunately, tRNA genes in Metazoan mitochondria have proved to be problematic because they often vary in number (genes missing or duplicated) and also in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs (T or D arms missing). I have performed a series of comparative analyses of the tRNA genes of a broad range of Metazoan mitogenomes in order to address this issue. I conclude that no single computer program is necessarily capable of finding all of the tRNA genes in any given mitogenome, and that use of both the ARWEN and DOGMA programs is sometimes necessary because they produce complementary false negatives. There are apparently a very large number of erroneous annotations in the databased mitogenome sequences, including missed genes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent criteria for assigning the 5' and 3' boundaries; and I have listed many of these. The extent of overlap between genes is often greatly exaggerated due to inconsistent annotations, although notable overlaps involving tRNAs are apparently real. Finally, three novel hypotheses were examined and found to have support from the comparative analyses: (1) some organisms have mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for multiple tRNAs; (2) some organisms have mitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for tRNAs and proteins (but not rRNAs); and (3) one group of nematodes has several genes that code for tRNAs lacking both the D and T arms.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional conformations of non-coding RNAs underpin their biochemical functions but have largely eluded experimental characterization. Here, we report that integrating a classic mutation/rescue strategy with high-throughput chemical mapping enables rapid RNA structure inference with unusually strong validation. We revisit a paradigmatic 16S rRNA domain for which SHAPE (selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation with primer extension) suggested a conformational change between apo-and holo-ribosome conformations. Computational support estimates, data from alternative chemical probes, and mutate-and-map (M2) experiments expose limitations of prior methodology and instead give a near-crystallographic secondary structure. Systematic interrogation of single base pairs via a high-throughput mutation/rescue approach then permits incisive validation and refinement of the M2-based secondary structure and further uncovers the functional conformation as an excited state (25{+/-}5% population) accessible via a single-nucleotide register shift. These results correct an erroneous SHAPE inference of a ribosomal conformational change and suggest a general mutate-map-rescue approach for dissecting RNA dynamic structure landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of whole-genome or exome sequencing data from trios and pedigrees has being successfully applied to the identification of disease-causing mutations. However, most methods used to identify and genotype genetic variants from next-generation sequencing data ignore the relationships between samples, resulting in significant Mendelian errors, false positives and negatives. Here we present a Bayesian network framework that jointly analyses data from all members of a pedigree simultaneously using Mendelian segregation priors, yet providing the ability to detect de novo mutations in offspring, and is scalable to large pedigrees. We evaluated our method by simulations and analysis of WGS data from a 17 individual, 3-generation CEPH pedigree sequenced to 50X average depth. Compared to singleton calling, our family caller produced more high quality variants and eliminated spurious calls as judged by common quality metrics such as Ti/Tv, Het/Hom ratios, and dbSNP/SNP array data concordance. We developed a ground truth dataset to further evaluate our calls by identifying recombination cross-overs in the pedigree and testing variants for consistency with the inferred phasing, and we show that our method significantly outperforms singleton and population variant calling in pedigrees. We identify all previously validated de novo mutations in NA12878, concurrent with a 7X precision improvement. Our results show that our method is scalable to large genomics and human disease studies and allows cost optimization by rational sequencing capacity distribution.",

    "abstract": "Large scale genetic screening is tedious and time-consuming. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-tiered screening system comprising an initial \\\"pooling\\\" screen that identifies miRNAs whose tissue-specific over-expression causes a phenotype of interest followed by a more focused secondary screen that uses gene-specific RNAi. As miRNAs inhibit translation or direct the destruction of their target mRNAs, any phenotype observed with miRNA over-expression can be attributed to the loss-of-function of one or more target mRNAs. Since miRNA-target pairing is sequence-specific, a list of predicted targets for miRNAs identified in the initial screen serves as a list of candidates for the secondary RNAi-based screen. These predicted miRNA targets can be prioritized by expression pattern, and if multiple miRNAs produce the same phenotype, overlapping target predictions can be given higher priority in the follow-up screen.\\n\\nSince miRNAs are short, miRNA misexpression will likely uncover artifactual miRNA-target relation-ships. Thus, we are using miRNAs as a tool to accelerate genetic screening rather than focus on the biology of miRNAs themselves. This two-tiered system allows us to rapidly identify individual target genes involved in a phenomenon of interest, often in less than 200 crosses. Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by identifying miRNAs that alter Drosophila odorant receptor expression. With subsequent miRNA target prediction and follow-up RNAi screening we identify and validate a novel role for the transcription factor Atf3 in the expression of the socially relevant receptor Or47b.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic and ecological basis of adaptation is of immense importance in evolutionary biology. In our study, we applied a panel of 58 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the economically and culturally important salmonid Oncorhynchus keta. Samples included 4164 individuals from 43 populations ranging from Coastal Western Alaska to southern British Colombia and northern Washington. Signatures of natural selection were detected by identifying seven outlier loci using two independent approaches: one based on outlier detection and another based on environmental correlations. Evidence of divergent selection at two candidate SNP loci, Oke_RFC2-168 and Oke_MARCKS-362, indicates significant environmental correlations, particularly with the number of frost-free days (NFFD). Important associations found between environmental variables and outlier loci indicate that those environmental variables could be the major driving forces of allele frequency divergence at the candidate loci. NFFD, in particular, may play an important adaptive role in shaping genetic variation in O. keta. Correlations between divergent selection and local environmental variables will help shed light on processes of natural selection and molecular adaptation to local environmental conditions.",
