    "abstract": "Parasites and hosts are intimately associated such that changes in the diversity of one partner are thought to lead to changes in the other. We investigated this linked diversity hypothesis in a specialized ant-Ophiocordyceps system in three forests across 750 km in Central Amazonia. All species belonging to the fungal genus Ophiocordyceps associated with ants have evolved some degree of behavioral control to increase their own transmission, but the leaf-biting behavior is the most complex form of host manipulation. Such a system requires control of the mandibular muscles and a distinct shift in behavior, from climbing vegetation to walking on leaves to rasping leaf veins in the seconds before death. The need to induce complex behavior may limit host availability and represent a constraint on parasite diversity. The consequence for community structure is that complex behavioral manipulation leads to a mismatch between ant hosts and the diversity of their fungal parasites.",

    "abstract": "O_LIDetecting aquatic macroorganisms with environmental DNA (eDNA) is a new survey method with broad applicability. However, the origin, state, and fate of aqueous macrobial eDNA - which collectively determine how well eDNA can serve as a proxy for directly observing organisms and how eDNA should be captured, purified, and assayed - are poorly understood.\\nC_LIO_LIThe size of aquatic particles provides clues about their origin, state, and fate. We used sequential filtration size fractionation to measure, for the first time, the particle size distribution (PSD) of macrobial eDNA, specifically Common Carp (hereafter referred to as Carp) eDNA. We compared it to the PSDs of total eDNA (from all organisms) and suspended particle matter (SPM). We quantified Carp mitochondrial eDNA using a custom qPCR assay, total eDNA with fluorometry, and SPM with gravimetric analysis.\\nC_LIO_LIIn a lake and a pond, we found Carp eDNA in particles from >180 to <0.2 m, but it was most abundant from 1-10 m. Total eDNA was most abundant below 0.2 m and SPM was most abundant above 100 m. SPM was [&le;]0.1% total eDNA, and total eDNA was [&le;]0.0004% Carp eDNA. 0.2 m filtration maximized Carp eDNA capture (85%{+/-}6%) while minimizing total (i.e., non-target) eDNA capture (48%{+/-}3%), but filter clogging limited this pore size to a volume <250 mL. To mitigate this limitation we estimated a continuous PSD model for Carp eDNA and derived an equation for calculating isoclines of pore size and water volume that yield equivalent amounts of Carp eDNA.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that aqueous macrobial eDNA predominantly exists inside mitochondria or cells, and that settling plays an important role in its fate. For optimal eDNA capture, we recommend 0.2 m filtration or a combination of larger pore size and water volume that exceeds the 0.2 m isocline. In situ filtration of large volumes could maximize detection probability when surveying large habitats for rare organisms. Our method for eDNA particle size analysis enables future research to compare the PSDs of eDNA from other organisms and environments, and to easily apply them for ecological monitoring.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Population genetics theory has laid the foundations for genomics analyses including the recent burst in genome scans for selection and statistical inference of past demographic events in many prokaryote, animal and plant species. Identifying SNPs under natural selection and underpinning species adaptation relies on disentangling the respective contribution of random processes (mutation, drift, migration) from that of selection on nucleotide variability. Most theory and statistical tests have been developed using the Kingmans coalescent theory based on the Wright-Fisher population model. However, these theoretical models rely on biological and life-history assumptions which may be violated in many prokaryote, fungal, animal or plant species. Recent theoretical developments of the so called multiple merger coalescent models are reviewed here ({Lambda}-coalescent, beta-coalescent, Bolthausen-Snitzman, {Xi}-coalescent). We explicit how these new models take into account various pervasive ecological and biological characteristics, life history traits or life cycles which were not accounted in previous theories such as 1) the skew in offspring production typical of marine species, 2) fast adapting microparasites (virus, bacteria and fungi) exhibiting large variation in population sizes during epidemics, 3) the peculiar life cycles of fungi and bacteria alternating sexual and asexual cycles, and 4) the high rates of extinction-recolonization in spatially structured populations. We finally discuss the relevance of multiple merger models for the detection of SNPs under selection in these species, for population genomics of very large sample size and advocate to potentially examine the conclusion of previous population genetics studies.",

    "abstract": "Most free-swimming bacteria move in approximately straight lines, interspersed with random reorientation phases. A key open question concerns varying mechanisms by which reorientation occurs. We combine mathematical modelling with analysis of a large tracking dataset to study the poorly-understood reorientation mechanism in the monoflagellate species Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The flagellum on this species rotates counterclockwise to propel the bacterium, periodically ceasing rotation to enable reorientation. When rotation restarts the cell body usually points in a new direction. It has been assumed that the new direction is simply the result of Brownian rotation. We consider three variants of a self-propelled particle model of bacterial motility. The first considers rotational diffusion only, corresponding to a non-chemotactic mutant strain. A further two models also include stochastic reorientations, describing  run-and-tumble motility. We derive expressions for key summary statistics and simulate each model using a stochastic computational algorithm. We also discuss the effect of cell geometry on rotational diffusion. Working with a previously published tracking dataset, we compare predictions of the models with data on individual stopping events in R. sphaeroides. This provides strong evidence that this species undergoes some form of active reorientation rather than simple reorientation by Brownian rotation.",
