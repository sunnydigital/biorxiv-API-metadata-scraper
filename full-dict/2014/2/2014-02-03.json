    "abstract": "BackgroundConstraint programming (CP) is usually seen as a rigid approach, focusing on crisp, precise, distinctions between what is allowed as a solution and what is not. At first sight, this makes it seem inadequate for bioinformatics applications that rely mostly on statistical parameters and optimization. The prediction of protein interactions, or protein docking, is one such application. And this apparent problem with CP is particularly evident when constraints are provided by noisy data, as it is the case when using the statistical analysis of Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) to extract coevolution information. The goal of this paper is to show that this first impression is misleading and that CP is a useful technique for improving protein docking even with data as vague and noisy as the coevolution indicators that can be inferred from MSA.\\n\\nResultsHere we focus on the study of two protein complexes. In one case we used a simplified estimator of interaction propensity to infer a set of five candidate residues for the interface and used that set to constrain the docking models. Even with this simplified approach and considering only the interface of one of the partners, there is a visible focusing of the models around the correct configuration. Considering a set of 400 models with the best geometric contacts, this constraint increases the number of models close to the target (RMSD {inverted exclamation}5[A]) from 2 to 5 and decreases the RMSD of all retained models from 26[A] to 17.5[A]. For the other example we used a more standard estimate of coevolving residues, from the Co-Evolution Analysis using Protein Sequences (CAPS) software. Using a group of three residues identified from the sequence alignment as potentially co-evolving to constrain the search, the number of complexes similar to the target among the 50 highest scoring docking models increased from 3 in the unconstrained docking to 30 in the constrained docking.\\n\\nConclusionsAlthough only a proof-of-concept application, our results show that, with suitably designed constraints, CP allows us to integrate coevolution data, which can be inferred from databases of protein sequences, even though the data is noisy and often \\\"fuzzy\\\", with no well-defined discontinuities. This also shows, more generally, that CP in bioinformatics needs not be limited to the more crisp cases of finite domains and explicit rules but can also be applied to a broader range of problems that depend on statistical measurements and continuous data.",

    "abstract": "Advances in high-throughput, single cell gene expression are allowing interrogation of cell heterogeneity. However, there is concern that the cell cycle phase of a cell might bias characterizations of gene expression at the single-cell level. We assess the effect of cell cycle phase on gene expression in single cells by measuring 333 genes in 930 cells across three phases and three cell lines. We determine each cells phase non-invasively without chemical arrest and use it as a covariate in tests of differential expression. We observe bi-modal gene expression, a previously-described phenomenon, wherein the expression of otherwise abundant genes is either strongly positive, or undetectable within individual cells. This bi-modality is likely both biologically and technically driven. Irrespective of its source, we show that it should be modeled to draw accurate inferences from single cell expression experiments. To this end, we propose a semi-continuous modeling framework based on the generalized linear model, and use it to characterize genes with consistent cell cycle effects across three cell lines. Our new computational framework improves the detection of previously characterized cell-cycle genes compared to approaches that do not account for the bi-modality of single-cell data. We use our semi-continuous modelling framework to estimate single cell gene co-expression networks. These networks suggest that in addition to having phase-dependent shifts in expression (when averaged over many cells), some, but not all, canonical cell cycle genes tend to be co-expressed in groups in single cells. We estimate the amount of single cell expression variability attributable to the cell cycle. We find that the cell cycle explains only 5%-17% of expression variability, suggesting that the cell cycle will not tend to be a large nuisance factor in analysis of the single cell transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "Accurately making a decision in the face of incongruent options increases the efficiency of making similar congruency decisions in the future. This adaptive process is modulated by reward, suggesting that ventral corticostriatal circuits may contribute to the process of conflict adaptation. To evaluate this possibility, a group of healthy adults (N = 30) were tested using functional MRI (fMRI) while they performed a color-word Stroop task. In a conflict-related region of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), stronger BOLD responses predicted faster response times (RTs) on the next trial. More importantly, the degree of behavioral conflict adaptation on RTs was correlated with the magnitude of mOFC-RT associations on the previous trial, but only after accounting for network-level interactions with prefrontal and striatal regions. This suggests that conflict adaptation may rely on interactions between distributed corticostriatal circuits. The convergence of white matter projections fro ...",
