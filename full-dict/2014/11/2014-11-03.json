    "abstract": "In Drosophila larvae, growth and developmental timing are regulated by nutrition in a tightly coordinated fashion. The networks that couple these processes are far from understood. Here, we show that the intestine responds to nutrient availability by regulating production of a circulating lipoprotein associated form of the signaling protein Hedgehog (Hh). Levels of circulating Hh tune the rates of growth and developmental timing in a coordinated fashion. Circulating Hh signals to the fat body to control larval growth. It regulates developmental timing by controlling ecdysteroid production in the prothoracic gland. Circulating Hh is especially important during starvation, when it is also required for mobilization of fat body triacylglycerol (TAG) stores. Thus, we demonstrate that Hh, previously known only for its local morphogenetic functions, also acts as a lipoprotein-associated endocrine hormone, coordinating the response of multiple tissues to nutrient availability.",

    "abstract": "Genetically identical cells in microbial populations often exhibit a remarkable degree of phenotypic heterogeneity even in homogenous environments. While such heterogeneity is often thought to be a bet-hedging strategy against unpredictable environments, evolutionary game theory also predicts phenotypic heterogeneity as a stable response to evolutionary \\\"hawk-dove\\\" games, in which rare strategies are favored over common ones. Here we provide experimental evidence for this game theoretic explanation in the context of the well-studied yeast GAL network. In an environment containing the two sugars glucose and galactose, the yeast GAL network displays stochastic bimodal activation. We show that genetic mutants playing the \\\"pure\\\" strategies of GAL-ON or GAL-OFF can each invade the opposite strategy when rare, indicating a hawk-dove game between the two. Consistent with the Nash equilibrium of an evolutionary game, the stable mix of pure strategists does not necessarily maximize the growth of the overall population. We also find that the wild type GAL network can invade populations of both pure strategists while remaining uninvasible by either. Taken together, our results provide experimental evidence that evolutionary hawk-dove games between identical cells can explain the phenotypic heterogeneity found in clonal microbial populations.",

    "abstract": "Omics technologies enable unbiased investigation of biological systems through massively parallel sequence acquisition or molecular measurements, bringing the life sciences into the era of Big Data. A central challenge posed by such omics datasets is how to transform this data into biological knowledge. For example, how to use this data to answer questions such as: which functional pathways are involved in cell differentiation? Which genes should we target to stop cancer? Network analysis is a powerful and general approach to solve this problem consisting of two fundamental stages, network reconstruction and network interrogation. Herein, we provide an overview of network analysis including a step by step guide on how to perform and use this approach to investigate a biological question. In this guide, we also include the software packages that we and others employ for each of the steps of a network analysis workflow.",
