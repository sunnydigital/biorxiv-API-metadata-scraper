    "abstract": "We consider a stochastic evolutionary model for a phenotype developing amongst n related species with unknown phylogeny. The unknown tree is modelled by a Yule process conditioned on n contemporary nodes. The trait value is assumed to evolve along lineages as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. As a result, the trait values of the n species form a sample with dependent observations. We establish three limit theorems for the sample mean corresponding to three domains for the adaptation rate. In the case of fast adaptation, we show that for large n the normalized sample mean is approximately normally distributed. Using these limit theorems, we develop novel confidence interval formulae for the optimal trait value.",

    "abstract": "An ongoing debate in evolutionary biology is whether phenotypic change occurs predominantly around the time of speciation or whether it instead accumulates gradually over time. In this work I propose a general framework incorporating both types of change, quantify the effects of speciational change via the correlation between species and attribute the proportion of change to each type. I discuss results of parameter estimation of Hominoid body size in this light. I derive mathematical formulae related to this problem, the probability generating functions of the number of speciation events along a randomly drawn lineage and from the most recent common ancestor of two randomly chosen tip species for a conditioned Yule tree. Additionally I obtain in closed form the variance of the distance from the root to the most recent common ancestor of two randomly chosen tip species.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection maintains advantageous genetic and phenotypic diversity in populations. When selection acts for long evolutionary periods selected polymorphisms may survive species splits and segregate in present-day populations of different species. Here, we investigated the role of long-term balancing selection in the evolution of protein-coding sequences in the Pan-Homo clade. We sequenced the exome of 20 humans, 20 chimpanzees and 20 bonobos and detected eight coding trans-species polymorphisms (trSNPs) that are shared among the three species and have segregated for approximately 14 million years of independent evolution. While the majority of these trSNPs were found in three genes of the MHC cluster, we also uncovered one coding trSNP (rs12088790) in the gene LAD1. All these trSNPs show clustering of sequences by allele rather than by species and also exhibit other signatures of long-term balancing selection, such as segregating at intermediate frequency and lying in a locus with high genetic diversity. Here we focus on the trSNP in LAD1, a gene that encodes for Ladinin-1, a collagenous anchoring filament protein of basement membrane that is responsible for maintaining cohesion at the dermal-epidermal junction; the gene is also an autoantigen responsible for linear IgA disease. This trSNP results in a missense change (Leucine257Proline) and, besides altering the protein sequence, is associated with changes in gene expression of LAD1.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia are severe brain disorders. No biological hallmark has been identified for any of these disorders. Here, we report that abnormal X chromosome inactivation (XCI) often presents in lymphoblastoid cells of female patients with different major psychiatric disorders in the general population. X chromosome inactivation is well preserved in human lymphoblastoid cells. XIST, KDM5C, and other X-linked genes are over-expressed in the lymphoblastoid cells of female patients, suggesting an abnormal XCI. Trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) is significantly increased at both XIST and KDM5C gene loci. We found that XIST and KDM5C expression can be used as a potential diagnostic hallmark for major psychiatric disorders in a large sub-population of female patients. Preliminary studies also suggest an increased XIST expression in postmortem brains from female patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. An increased gene dosage from some X-linked genes may contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders, as functional disomy of partial X chromosome have been suggested to cause mental retardation and other developmental abnormalities. Additionally, patients with Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) or Triple X syndrome (XXX) frequently display psychiatric disorders due to an extra X chromosome. Mutation of the KDM5C gene was reported to cause X-linked syndromic mental retardation. Our studies suggest that abnormal X chromosome inactivation could play a causal role in development of major psychiatric disorders in females. Correction of abnormal X chromosome inactivation may prevent and/or cure major psychiatric disorders in a sub-population of female patients in the future.",

Mathematical advantage of viscous deforming is a possibility to present the ventricular filling as the function of two independent variables (stress and time); two-dimensional argument frames a table which permits to calculate end-diastolic ventricular volume due to information about measured venous pressure and duration of ventricular diastole. The equation was deduced which balances the system while varying of such parameters as arterial resistance, the value of normal rhythm and the volume flow rate. The model pays attention on the phenomenon of asymmetrical position of normal rhythm (the steady rhythm in conditions of rest) and explains why the operating range of brady-rhythms is much narrower than the operating range of tachy-rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is a dysregulation of apoptosis process a programmed cell death through which the cell number is tightly regulated. Many factors affect apoptosis including tumor genes (TGs). Moreover, several researchers identified TGs and demonstrated their functions in various types of tumors or normal samples. Surprisingly, it has also been indicated that the expression of tumor markers in the development of cancer type is also one of the important target sites for clinical applications. Therefore, integrating tumor genes and tumor markers with experimental evidences might definitely provide valuable information for further investigation of TGs and their crosstalk in cancer. To achieve this objective, we developed a database known as Cancer Gene Marker Database (CGMD) which integrates cancer genes and markers based on experimental background. The major goal of CGMD is to provide: 1) systemic treatment approaches and advancements of different cancer treatments in present scenario; 2) Pooling of different genes and markers with their molecular characterization and involvements in different pathways; 3) Free availability of CGMD at www.cgmd.in. The database consists of 309 genes plus 206 markers and also includes sequences of a list of 40 different human cancers and moreover, all the characterized markers have detailed descriptions in appropriate manner. CGMD extraction is collective and informative by using web resources like National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), UniProtKB, KEGG and EMBOSS. CGMD provides updated literature regarding different cancer annotations and their detail molecular descriptions such as CpG islands, promoters, exons of cancer genes and their active sites, physico-chemical properties and also systematically represented the domains of characterized proteins.",

    "abstract": "Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), a malignant soft tissue sarcoma, is one of the most common paediatric cancers. Certain ERMS tumours are associated with the DICER1 syndrome, a distinctive tumour predisposition syndrome caused by germ-line mutations in the microRNA-maturation pathway gene, DICER1. In addition to germ-line DICER1 mutations, highly characteristic somatic mutations have been identified in several DICER1-associated tumour types. These so-called \\\"hotspot\\\" mutations affect highly conserved amino acid residues central to the catalytic activity of the DICER1 ribonuclease IIIb domain.\\n\\nPrimary ovarian ERMS (oERMS) is extremely rare. We present a case of a 6-year-old girl with an oERMS found to harbour two mutations in DICER1. In addition to the oERMS, the girl also exhibited other DICER1 phenotypes, including cystic nephroma (CN) and multinodular goitre. Somatic investigations of the CN revealed the presence of a hotspot DICER1 mutation different from that in the oERMS. Of particular interest is the CN presented at the age of 12 years, which is much older than previously reported age range of susceptibility (birth to four years of age).\\n\\nThis report documents both germ-line and highly characteristic somatic DICER1 mutations in a case of oERMS, adding to the expanding spectrum of rare childhood tumours in the DICER1 syndrome.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTrial-to-trial variability and spontaneous activity of cortical recordings have been suggested to reflect intrinsic noise. This view is currently challenged by mounting evidence for structure in these phenomena: Trial-to-trial variability decreases following stimulus onset and can be predicted by previous spontaneous activity. This spontaneous activity is similar in magnitude and structure to evoked activity and can predict decisions. Allof the observed neuronal properties described above can be accounted for, at an abstract computational level, by the sampling-hypothesis, according to which response variability reflects stimulus uncertainty. However, a mechanistic explanation at the level of neural circuit dynamics is still missing.\\n\\nIn this study, we demonstrate that all of these phenomena can be accounted for by a noise-free self-organizing recurrent neural network model (SORN). It combines spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic mechanisms in a deterministic network of excitatory and inhibitory McCulloch-Pitts neurons. The network self-organizes to spatio-temporally varying input sequences.\\n\\nWe find that the key properties of neural variability mentioned above develop in this model as the network learns to perform sampling-like inference. Importantly, the model shows high trial-to-trial variability although it is fully deterministic. This suggests that the trial-to-trial variability in neural recordings may not reflect intrinsic noise. Rather, it may reflect a deterministic approximation of sampling-like learning and inference. The simplicity of the model suggests that these correlates of the sampling theory are canonical properties of recurrent networks that learn with a combination of STDP and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeural recordings seem very noisy. If the exact same stimulus is shown to an animal multiple times, the neural response will vary. In fact, the activity of a single neuron shows many features of a stochastic process. Furthermore, in the absence of a sensory stimulus, cortical spontaneous activity has a magnitude comparable to the activity observed during stimulus presentation. These findings have led to a widespread belief that neural activity is indeed very noisy. However, recent evidence indicates that individual neurons can operate very reliably and that the spontaneous activity in the brain is highly structured, suggesting that much of the noise may in fact be signal. One hypothesis regarding this putative signal is that it reflects a form of probabilistic inference through sampling. Here we show that the key features of neural variability can be accounted for in a completely deterministic network model through self-organization. As the network learns a model of its sensory inputs, the deterministic dynamics give rise to sampling-like inference. Our findings show that the notorious variability in neural recordings does not need to be seen as evidence for a noisy brain. Instead it may reflect sampling-like inference emerging from a self-organized learning process.",

Several high-throughput technologies have been used to map out which proteins are expressed in which tissues; however, the data have not previously been systematically compared and integrated. We present a comprehensive evaluation of tissue expression data from a variety of experimental techniques and show that these agree surprisingly well with each other and with results from literature curation and text mining. We further found that most datasets support the assumed but not demonstrated distinction between tissue-specific and ubiquitous expression. By developing comparable confidence scores for all types of evidence, we show that it is possible to improve both quality and coverage by combining the datasets.

    "abstract": "We find that the topologies of real world networks, such as those formed within human societies, by the Internet, or among cellular proteins, are dominated by the mode of the interactions considered among the individuals. Consequently, a major dichotomy in previously studied networks arises from modeling networks in terms of pairwise versus group tasks. The former often intrinsically give rise to scale-free, disassortative, hierarchical networks, whereas the latter often give rise to broad-scale, assortative, nonhierarchical networks. These dependencies explain contrasting observations among previous topological analyses of real world complex systems. We also observe this trend in systems with natural hierarchies, in which alternate representations of the same networks, but which capture different levels of the hierarchy, manifest these signature topological differences. For example, in both the Internet and cellular proteomes, networks of lower-level system components (routers within domains or proteins within biological processes) are assortative and nonhierarchical, whereas networks of upper-level system components (internet domains or biological processes) are disassortative and hierarchical. Our results demonstrate that network topologies of complex systems must be interpreted in light of their hierarchical natures and interaction types.",
