    "abstract": "Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of interspecific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.",

    "abstract": "Several recent works have shown that protein structure can predict site-specific evolutionary sequence variation. In particular, sites that are buried and/or have many contacts with other sites in a structure have been shown to evolve more slowly, on average, than surface sites with few contacts. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the extent to which numerous structural properties can predict sequence variation. The quantities we considered include buriedness (as measured by relative solvent accessibility), packing density (as measured by contact number), structural flexibility (as measured by B factors, root-mean-square fluctuations, and variation in dihedral angles), and variability in designed structures. We obtained structural flexibility measures both from molecular dynamics simulations performed on 9 non-homologous viral protein structures and from variation in homologous variants of those proteins, where available. We obtained measures of variability in designed structures from flexible-backbone design in the Rosetta software. We found that most of the structural properties correlate with site variation in the majority of structures, though the correlations are generally weak (correlation coefficients of 0.1 to 0.4). Moreover, we found that buriedness and packing density were better predictors of evolutionary variation than was structural flexibility. Finally, variability in designed structures was a weaker predictor of evolutionary variability than was buriedness or packing density, but it was comparable in its predictive power to the best structural flexibility measures. We conclude that simple measures of buriedness and packing density are better predictors of evolutionary variation than are more complicated predictors obtained from dynamic simulations, ensembles of homologous structures, or computational protein design.",

    "abstract": "Because mutations are mostly deleterious, mutation rates should be reduced by natural selection. However, mutations also provide the raw material for adaptation. Therefore, evolutionary theory suggests that the mutation rate must balance between adaptability - the ability to adapt - and adaptedness - the ability to remain adapted. We model an asexual population crossing a fitness valley and analyze the rate of complex adaptation with and without stress-induced mutagenesis - the increase of mutation rates in response to stress or maladaptation. We show that stress-induced mutagenesis increases the rate of complex adaptation without reducing the population mean fitness, thus breaking the evolutionary trade-off between adaptability and adaptedness. Our theoretical results support the hypothesis that stress-induced mutagenesis promotes adaptation and provide quantitative predictions of the rate of complex adaptation with different mutational strategies.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION METHODS RESULTS DISCUSSION LITERATURE CITED The evolution of male mate choice in sex-role reversed species can easily be understood according to the general principles of sexual selection. That is, when females are mate-limited they are expected to compete for access to males and those males, in turn, are expected to be choosy. This phenomenon is well described in some sex-role reversed species of pipefish (Berglund et al. 1989; Vincent et al. 1992) and shorebirds (Szekely & Reynolds 1995). In contrast, when the sex roles are conventional, choosy males will be at a competitive disadvantage and, therefore, male mate choice should be selected against. Of course, exceptions to this prediction have been demonstrated, most notably in those cases where fe ...",

    "abstract": "While screening a large collection of wild and laboratory yeast isolates for their ability to attract Drosophila melanogaster adults, we noticed a large difference in fly preference for two nearly isogenic strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BY4741 and BY4742. Using standard genetic analyses, we tracked the preference difference to the lack of functional mitochondria the stock of BY4742 used in the initial experiment. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy to examine the volatile compounds produced by BY4741 and the mitochondria-deficient BY4742, and found they differed significantly. We found that several ethyl esters are present at much higher levels in strains with functional mitochondria, even in fermentative conditions. We confirmed the role of these ethyl esters in attraction by examining an EEB1{Delta} strain which reduces ethyl ester production. We found that nitrogen levels in the substrate affect the production of these compounds, and that they are produced at high levels by strains with functional mitochondria in the fermentation of natural substrates. Collectively these observations demonstrate the effect core metabolic processes have in mediating the interaction between yeasts and insect vectors, and highlight the importance of non-respirative mitochondrial functions in yeast ecology.",

Nevertheless, whenever ART is stopped, HIV levels rebound and the disease returns.

We developed quantitative gene assembly and DNA library insertion into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome by optimizing an efficient single-step and marker-free genome editing system using CRISPR-Cas9. With this Multiplex CRISPR (CRISPRm) system, we selected an improved cellobiose utilization pathway in diploid yeast in a single round of mutagenesis and selection, which increased cellobiose fermentation rates by over ten-fold. Mutations recovered in the best cellodextrin transporters reveal synergy between substrate binding and transporter dynamics, and demonstrate the power of CRISPRm to accelerate selection experiments and discoveries of the molecular determinants that enhance biomolecule function.",

To date, these strategies do not provide a simple, rapid and inexpensive means to introduce and isolate arbitrary point mutants. Here, we report a strategy with all three of these desirable properties. It utilizes oligonucleotides as donor templates for homology-dependent repair and visible markers that are edited in parallel that markedly reduce the number of animals that must be molecularly screened in order to isolate mutants that lack visible phenotypes.",
