    "abstract": "In Drosophila larvae, growth and developmental timing are regulated by nutrition in a tightly coordinated fashion. The networks that couple these processes are far from understood. Here, we show that the intestine responds to nutrient availability by regulating production of a circulating lipoprotein associated form of the signaling protein Hedgehog (Hh). Levels of circulating Hh tune the rates of growth and developmental timing in a coordinated fashion. Circulating Hh signals to the fat body to control larval growth. It regulates developmental timing by controlling ecdysteroid production in the prothoracic gland. Circulating Hh is especially important during starvation, when it is also required for mobilization of fat body triacylglycerol (TAG) stores. Thus, we demonstrate that Hh, previously known only for its local morphogenetic functions, also acts as a lipoprotein-associated endocrine hormone, coordinating the response of multiple tissues to nutrient availability.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in resolving the tree of life continues to expose relationships that resist resolution, which drives the search for novel sources of information to solve these difficult phylogenetic problems. A recent example, the presence and absence of microRNA families, has been vigorously promoted as an ideal source of phylogenetic data and has been applied to several perennial phylogenetic problems. The utility of such data for phylogenetic inference hinges critically both on developing stochastic models that provide a reasonable description of the process that give rise to these data, and also on the careful validation of those models in real inference scenarios. Remarkably, however, the statistical behavior and phylogenetic utility of microRNA data have not yet been rigorously characterized. Here we explore the behavior and performance of microRNA presence/absence data under a variety of evolutionary models and reexamine datasets from several previous studies. We find that highly heterogeneous rates of microRNA gain and loss, pervasive secondary loss, and sampling error collectively render microRNA-based inference of phylogeny difficult. Moreover, our reanalyses fundamentally alter the conclusions for four of the five studies that we reexamined. Our results indicate that the capacity of miRNA data to resolve the tree of life has been overstated, and we urge caution in their application and interpretation.",

Here, we develop a Markov Chain model of evolution in asexually reproducing populations which is an encoding of the Strong Selection Weak Mutation model of evolution on fitness landscapes.

Previous studies of bacterial evolutionary dynamics have shown that populations evolving on fitness landscapes follow predictable paths. In this article, we develop a general mathematical model of evolution and hypothesise that it can be used to understand, and avoid, the emergence of antibiotic resistance.\n\nMethods and FindingsWe develop a Markov Chain model of evolution in asexually reproducing populations which is an encoding of the Strong Selection Weak Mutation model of evolution on fitness landscapes. This model associates the global properties of the fitness landscape with the algebraic properties of the Markov Chain transition matrix and allows us to derive general results on the non-commutativity and irreversibility of natural selection as well as antibiotic cycling strategies. Utilizing this formalism, we analyse 15 empirical fitness landscapes of E. coli under selection by different {beta}-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate that the emergence of resistance to a given antibiotic can be both hindered and promoted by different sequences of drug application. We show that resistance to a given antibiotic is promoted in 61.4%, 68.6% and 70.3% of possible orderings of single, pair or triple prior drug administrations, respectively. Further, we derive optimal drug application sequences with which we can probabilistically  steer the population through genotype space to avoid the emergence of resistance.\n\nConclusionsOur model provides generalisable results of interest to theorists studying evolution as well as providing specific, testable predictions for experimentalists to validate our methods. Further, these results suggest a new strategy in the war against antibiotic-therapy-resistant organisms: drug sequencing to shepherd an evolving population through genotype space to states from which resistance cannot emerge and from which we can maximize the likelihood of successful therapy using existing drugs. While our results are derived using a specific class of antibiotics, the method is generalisable to other situations, including the emergence of resistance to targeted therapy in cancer and how species could change secondary to changing climate or geographical movement.",

    "abstract": "MotivationExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have discovered thousands of genetic variants that regulate gene expression, enabling a better understanding of the functional role of non-coding sequences. However, eQTL studies are costly, requiring large sample sizes and genome-wide genotyping of each sample. In contrast, analysis of allele specific expression (ASE) is becoming a popular approach to detect the effect of genetic variation on gene expression, even within a single individual. This is typically achieved by counting the number of RNA-seq reads matching each allele at heterozygous sites and testing the null hypothesis of a 1:1 allelic ratio. In principle, when genotype information is not readily available it could be inferred from the RNA-seq reads directly. However, there are currently no existing methods that jointly infer genotypes and conduct ASE inference, while considering uncertainty in the genotype calls.\\n\\nResultsWe present QuASAR, Quantitative Allele Specific Analysis of Reads, a novel statistical learning method for jointly detecting heterozygous genotypes and inferring ASE. The proposed ASE inference step takes into consideration the uncertainty in the genotype calls while including parameters that model base-call errors in sequencing and allelic over-dispersion. We validated our method with experimental data for which high quality genotypes are available. Results for an additional dataset with multiple replicates at different sequencing depths demonstrate that QuASAR is a powerful tool for ASE analysis when genotypes are not available.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://github.com/piquelab/QuASAR\\n\\nContactfluca@wayne.edu; rpique@wayne.edu",

    "abstract": "Ongoing large experimental characterization is crucial to determine all regulatory sequences, yet we do not know which genetic variants in those regions are non-silent. Here, we present a novel analysis integrating sequence and DNase I footprinting data for 653 samples to predict the impact of a sequence change on transcription factor binding for a panel of 1,372 motifs. Most genetic variants in footprints (5,810,227) do not show evidence of allele-specific binding (ASB). In contrast, functional genetic variants predicted by our computational models are highly enriched for ASB (3,217 SNPs at 20% FDR). Comparing silent to functional non-coding genetic variants, the latter are 1.22-fold enriched for GWAS traits, have lower allele frequencies, and affect footprints more distal to promoters or active in fewer tissues. Finally, integration of the annotations into 18 GWAS meta-studies improves identification of likely causal SNPs and transcription factors relevant for complex traits.",
