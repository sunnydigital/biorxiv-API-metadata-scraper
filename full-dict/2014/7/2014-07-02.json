    "abstract": "Behavior is a unifying organismal process through which genes, neural function, anatomy and environment converge and interrelate. Here we review the current state and sketch the future impact of accelerating advances in technology for behavioral studies, focusing on rodents as an exemplar. We frame our analysis in three dimensions: (1) degree of experimental constraint, (2) dimensionality of data, and (3) level of description. We argue that ethomics, fueled by \\\"big behavioral data\\\", presents challenges proportionate to its promise and describe how these challenges might be met through opportunities afforded by the two rival conceptual legacies of 20th century behavioral science, ethology and psychology. We conclude that although \\\"ethomes\\\" are not the goal, big behavioral data has the potential to transform and unify these two disciplines and to solidify the foundations of others, including neuroscience, particularly if the data is as open as it is copious and quantitative.",

    "abstract": "The paradox of biological diversity is the key problem of theoretical ecology. The paradox consists in the contradiction between the competitive exclusion principle and the observed biodiversity. This principle was formulated incorrectly because of limitations of the traditional black-box models of interspecific competition. The principle is very important as the basis for understanding evolutionary processes. Our white-box multiscale models are based on logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata. This approach allows to provide an automatic deductive inference on the basis of a system of axioms and to get a direct holistic insight into the studied system. It is one of the most promising methods of artificial intelligence. Here on simplest models we show a mechanism of competitive coexistence which violates the known formulations of the competitive exclusion principle. We reformulate and generalize the competitive exclusion principle and explain why our formulations provide a solution of the biodiversity paradox. In addition, we propose a principle of competitive coexistence.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/006817_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1000\\\">\\nView larger version (21K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17f69c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f91196org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f1ce70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12829e8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed, yielding a complex transcriptome with high variability in composition and cellular abundance. While recent efforts have identified thousands of new long non-coding (lnc) RNAs and demonstrated a complex transcriptional repertoire produced by protein-coding (pc) genes, limited progress has been made in distinguishing functional RNA from spurious transcription events. This is partly due to present RNA classification, which is typically based on technical rather than biochemical criteria. Here we devise a strategy to systematically categorize human RNAs by their sensitivity to the ribonucleolytic RNA exosome complex and by the nature of their transcription initiation. These measures are surprisingly effective at correctly classifying annotated transcripts, including lncRNAs of known function. The approach also identifies uncharacterized stable lncRNAs, hidden among a vast majority of unstable transcripts. The predictive power of the approach promises to streamline the functional analysis of known and novel RNAs.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel computational method for estimating the probability that a point mutation at each position in a genome will influence fitness. These fitness consequence (fit-Cons) scores serve as evolution-based measures of potential genomic function. Our approach is to cluster genomic positions into groups exhibiting distinct \\\"fingerprints\\\" based on high-throughput functional genomic data, then to estimate a probability of fitness consequences for each group from associated patterns of genetic polymorphism and divergence. We have generated fitCons scores for three human cell types based on public data from EN-CODE. Compared with conventional conservation scores, fitCons scores show considerably improved prediction power for cis-regulatory elements. In addition, fitCons scores indicate that 4.2-7.5% of nucleotides in the human genome have influenced fitness since the human-chimpanzee divergence, and, in contrast to several recent studies, they suggest that recent evolutionary turnover has had limited impact on the functional content of the genome.",

    "abstract": "The design of modern scientific experiments requires the control and monitoring of many parallel data streams. However, the serial execution of programming instructions in a computer makes it a challenge to develop software that can deal with the asynchronous, parallel nature of scientific data. Here we present Bonsai, a modular, high-performance, open-source visual programming framework for the acquisition and online processing of data streams. We describe Bonsais core principles and architecture and demonstrate how it allows for flexible and rapid prototyping of integrated experimental designs in neuroscience. We specifically highlight different possible applications which require the combination of many different hardware and software components, i0ncluding behaviour video tracking, electrophysiology and closed-loop control of stimulation parameters.",

    "abstract": "How does the regulatory machinery of an animal cell ensure its survival during large-scale biochemical and phenotypic transitions? When a cell is strongly perturbed by an environmental stimulus, it can either die or persist with compensatory changes. But what do the dynamics of individual genes look like during this process of adaptation? In a previous technical paper, two approaches (drug treatments and polysome isolation) were used in tandem to demonstrate the effects of perturbation on cellular phenotype. In this paper, we can use these data in tandem with a discrete, first-order feedback model that incorporates leaky components to better characterize adaptive responses of mRNA regulation related to information processing in the cell. By evaluating the dynamic relationship between mRNA associated with transcription (translatome) and mRNA associated with the polysome (transcriptome) at multiple timepoints, hypothetical conditions for decay and aggregation are found and discussed. Our feedback model allows for the approximation of fluctuations and other aspects of cellular information processing, in addition to the derivation of three information processing principles. These results will lead us to a better understanding of how mRNA provides variable information over time to the complex intracellular environment, particularly in the context of large-scale phenotypic change.",
