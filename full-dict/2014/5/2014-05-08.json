    "abstract": "Gene Ontology (GO) classification of statistically significant over/under expressed genes is a commonly used to interpret transcriptomics data in functional genomic analysis. In this approach, all significant genes contribute equally to the final GO classification regardless of their actual expression levels. However, the original level of gene expression can significantly affect protein production and consequently GO term enrichment, and genes with low expression levels can participate in the final GO enrichment through cumulative effects. In addition, GO terms have regulatory relationships that allow the construction of a regulatory network that incorporates gene expression levels to better study biological mechanisms. In this report, we have used gene expression levels in bacteria to determine GO term enrichments. This approach provided the opportunity to enrich GO terms across the entire transcriptome (instead of a subset of differentially expressed genes). In the second part, we show a dynamically developed enriched interaction network between Biological Process GO terms for any gene samples. This type of network presents regulatory relationships between GO terms and their genes. We then demonstrate the efficiency of these methods using public data from two important bacterial pathogens as models. We also explain how these methods help us understand potential pathogenesis mechanisms employed by these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of environmental change affecting wildlife populations across multiple levels of biological diversity. Much of the recent research in landscape genetics has focused on quantifying the influence of fragmentation on genetic variation among populations, but questions remain as to how habitat loss and configuration influences within-population genetic diversity. Habitat loss and fragmentation might lead to decreases in genetic diversity within populations, which might have implications for population persistence over multiple generations. We used genetic data collected from populations of three species occupying forested landscapes across a broad geographic region: Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli; 22 populations), White-breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis; 13 populations) and Pygmy Nuthatch (Sitta pygmaea; 19 populations) to quantify patterns of haplotype and nucleotide diversity across a range of forest fragmentation. We predicted that fragmentation effects on genetic diversity would vary depending on dispersal capabilities and habitat specificity of the species. Forest aggregation and the variability in forest patch area were the two strongest landscape predictors of genetic diversity. We found higher haplotype diversity in populations of P. gambeli and S. carolinensis inhabiting landscapes characterized by lower levels of forest fragmentation. Conversely, S. pygmaea demonstrated the opposite pattern of higher genetic diversity in fragmented landscapes. For two of the three species, we found support for the prediction that highly fragmented landscapes sustain genetically less diverse populations. We suggest, however, that future studies should focus on species of varying life-history traits inhabiting independent landscapes to better understand how habitat fragmentation influences within-population genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line OCI-AML3, carrying both NPM1 mutation A and the heterozygous DNMT3A R882C mutation, represents the model for in vitro studies on AML with mutated NPM11. AML with mutated NPM1 harbours a hypo-methylated profile distinct from those of the other AML subtypes2. This characteristic is probably related to the inhibitory effect of the mutant DNMT3A on the wild type protein3. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a universal methyl donor acting as a coenzyme of DNMT3A. There are growing evidences of the antineoplastic effect of SAM in vitro and in murine models of gastric cancer, colon cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where SAM induces the downregulation of several oncogenes4-10. Moreover SAM upregulates the expression of DNMT enzymes in lung cancer cells11. In our knowledge there are no published data exploring the effect of SAM on the growth of OCI-AML3 cells and its ability to modulate DNMT3A activity in this cell line.\n\nStudy design and methodsThe present data have been generated between August 2013 and April 2014 at the VITROSCREEN facilities in Milan-ITALY. We used a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dephenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to assess the cytotoxic effect of SAM iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) on OCI-AML3 cells (DSMZ Leibniz Institut). We analyzed then the ability of SAM to induce apoptosis by Tali Image-Based Cytometer (green Annexin V - Alexa Fluor 488 for apoptotic cells, red propidium and green Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 for necrotic cells).\n\nResultsThe MTT assays were performed after having treated the OCI-AML3 cells with various concentrations of the indicated drug for 24 hours. We observed no significant effects on cells viability using 0.5M, 10 M and 100 M of SAM (data not shown). In contrast, a dose dependent cytotoxic effect of SAM on OCI-AML3 cells was evident for concentrations equal or superior to 500 M, with an IC50 of 500 M (Figure 1). Since a Cmax of 211(SD 94)M after single intravenous infusion of SAM was previously reported in healthy voluntarees12, we decided to investigate the cytotoxic effect of SAM for concentrations close to 211 M using the MTT test. A significant dose dependent reduction of the cells viability was observed with SAM 200M (62,74% viable cells) and SAM 300M (53.32% viable cells), (Figure 2). The Apoptosis assay after 24 hours of treatment with SAM showed no differences in the percentages of apoptotic cells between the OCI-AML3 cells treated with SAM 300-500-2500 M and the untreated cells (data not shown). After 72 hours, only a minimal effect on the amount of apoptotic cells was obtained, while a clear dose dependent increase in the proportion of dead cells was noted (Figure 3), confirming the results of the aforementioned MTT tests.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/004978v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5e4195org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@23bd30org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@59a9c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@98e377_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO MTT assay after 24 h exposure of OCI-AML3 cells to SAM at 0.5 mM, 2.5 mM and 10 mM.

SAM is not able to induce apoptosis of OCI-AML3 cells in vitro after 72 hours of treatment. However, the increase in the amount of dead cells after SAM treatment may be due to mechanisms other than apoptosis. In order to verify if the observed cytotoxicity was mediated by the enzymatic activity of DNMT3A, we planned to repeat the cytotoxicity assays after DNMT3A silencing. The in vivo antineoplastic effect of SAM could be assessed in NOD/SCID mice engrafted with OCI-AML3 cells.\n\nAuthors contributionKAvH wrote the study rationale, designed the study, interpreted the data and wrote the article; IP revised the article, MM and BDS planned and interpreted the experiments and BDS performed the experiments.",
