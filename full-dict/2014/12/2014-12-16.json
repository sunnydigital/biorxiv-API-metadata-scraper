    "abstract": "The ability of the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) to reflect the particularities of gene genealogies exhibiting multiple mergers of ancestral lines as opposed to those obtained in the presence of population growth is our focus. An excess of singletons is a well-known characteristic of both population growth and multiple mergers. Other aspects of the SFS, in particular the weight of the right tail, are, however, affected in specific ways by the two model classes. Using an approximate likelihood method and minimum-distance statistics, our estimates of statistical power indicate that exponential and algebraic growth can indeed be distinguished from multiple merger coalescents, even for moderate sample size, if the number of segregating sites is high enough. A normalized version of the SFS is also used as a summary statistic in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach. The results give further positive evidence as to the general eligibility of the SFS to distinguish between the different histories.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of sequencing experiments in genomics has led to an increased use of methods for count data in analyzing high-throughput genomic data to perform analyses. The importance of shrinkage methods in improving the performance of statistical methods remains. A common example is that of gene expression data, where the counts per gene are often modeled as some form of an over-dispersed Poisson. In this case, shrinkage estimates of the per-gene dispersion parameter have led to improved estimation of dispersion in the case of a small number of samples.\\n\\nWe address a different count setting introduced by the use of sequencing data: comparing differential proportional usage via an over-dispersed binomial model. This is motivated by our interest in testing for differential exon skipping in mRNA-Seq experiments. We introduce a novel method that is developed by modeling the dispersion based on the double binomial distribution proposed by Efron (1986). Our method (WEB-Seq) is an empirical bayes strategy for producing a shrunken estimate of dispersion and effectively detects differential proportional usage, and has close ties to the weighted-likelihood strategy of edgeR developed for gene expression data (Robinson and Smyth, 2007; Robinson et al., 2010). We analyze its behavior on simulated data sets as well as real data and show that our method is fast, powerful and gives accurate control of the FDR compared to alternative approaches. We provide implementation of our methods in the R package DoubleExpSeq available on CRAN.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCharacterizations of the dynamics of hybrid zones in space and time can give insights about traits and processes important in population divergence and speciation. We characterized a hybrid zone between tanagers in the genus Ramphocelus (Aves, Thraupidae) located in southwestern Colombia. We tested whether this hybrid zone originated as a result of secondary contact or of primary differentiation, and described its dynamics across time using spatial analyses of molecular, morphological, and coloration data in combination with paleodistribution modeling.\\n\\nResultsModels of potential historical distributions based on climatic data and genetic signatures of demographic expansion suggested that the hybrid zone likely originated following secondary contact between populations that expanded their ranges out of isolated areas in the Quaternary. Concordant patterns of variation in phenotypic characters across the hybrid zone and its narrow extent are suggestive of a tension zone, maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. Estimates of phenotypic cline parameters obtained using specimens collected over nearly a century revealed that, in recent decades, the zone appears to have moved to the east and to higher elevations, and has apparently become narrower. Genetic variation was not clearly structured along the hybrid zone, but comparisons between historical and contemporary specimens suggested that temporal changes in its genetic makeup may also have occurred.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data suggest that the hybrid zone likey resulted from secondary contact between populations. The observed changes in the hybrid zone may be a result of sexual selection, asymmetric gene flow, or environmental change.",

    "abstract": "In animals, before the zygotic genome is expressed, the egg already contains gene products deposited by the mother. These maternal products are crucial during the initial steps of development. In Drosophila melanogaster a large number of maternal products are found in the oocyte, some of which are indispensable. Many of these products are RNA molecules, such as gene transcripts and ribosomal RNAs. Recently, microRNAs - small RNA gene regulators - have been detected early during development and are important in these initial steps. The presence of some microRNAs in unfertilized eggs has been reported, but whether they have a functional impact in the egg or early embryo has not being explored. I have extracted and sequenced small RNAs from Drosophila unfertilized eggs. The unfertilized egg is rich in small RNAs and contains multiple microRNA products. Maternal microRNAs are often encoded within the intron of maternal genes, suggesting that many maternal microRNAs are the product of transcriptional hitch-hiking. Comparative genomics and population data suggest that maternal transcripts tend to avoid target sites for maternal microRNAs. A potential role of the maternal microRNA mir-9c in maternal-to-zygotic transition is also discussed. In conclusion, maternal microRNAs in Drosophila have a functional impact in maternal protein-coding transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Coexistence of multiple populations by frequency-dependent selection is common in nature, and it often arises even in well-mixed experiments with microbes. If ecology is to be incorporated into models of population genetics, then it is important to represent accurately the functional form of frequency-dependent interactions. However, measuring this functional form is problematic for traditional fitness assays, which assume a constant fitness difference between competitors over the course of an assay. Here, we present a theoretical framework for measuring the functional form of frequency-dependent fitness by accounting for changes in abundance and relative fitness during a competition assay. Using two examples of ecological coexistence that arose in a long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli, we illustrate accurate quantification of the functional form of frequency-dependent relative fitness. Using a Monod-type model of growth dynamics, we show that two ecotypes in a typical cross-feeding interaction--such as when one bacterial population uses a byproduct generated by another--yields relative fitness that is linear with relative frequency.",

    "abstract": "The clustering of individuals that results from limited dispersal is a double-edged sword: while it allows for local interactions to be mostly among related individuals, it also results in increased local competition. Here I show that, because they mitigate local competition, fitness costs such as reduced fecundity or reduced survival are less costly in spatially structured environments than in non spatial settings. I first present a simple demographic example to illustrate how spatial structure weakens selection against fitness costs. Then, I illustrate the importance of disentangling the evolution of a trait from the evolution of potential associated costs, using an example taken from a recent study investigating the effect of spatial structure on the evolution of host defense. In this example indeed, the differences between spatial and non-spatial selection gradients are due to differences in the fitness costs, thereby undermining interpretations of the results made in terms of the trait only. This illustrates the need to consider fitness costs as proper traits in both theoretical and empirical studies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is ubiquitous across many eukaryotes, with variable patterns and functions across taxa. The roles of DNA methylation during invertebrate development remain enigmatic, especially regarding the inheritance and ontogenetic dynamics of methylation. In order to better understand to what degree DNA methylation patterns are heritable, variable between individuals, and changing during Crassostrea gigas development, we characterized the genome-wide methylome of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae from two full-sib families nested within a maternal half-sib family across developmental stages.\\n\\nResultsBisulfite treated DNA sequencing of Crassostrea gigas sperm and larvae at 72 hours post fertilization and 120 hours post fertilization revealed DNA methylation ranges from 15-18%. Our data suggest that DNA methylation patterns are inherited, as methylation patterns were more similar between the two sires and their offspring compared to methylations pattern differences among developmental stages. Loci differing between the two paternal full-sib families (189) were found throughout the genome but were concentrated in transposable elements. The proportion of differentially methylated loci among developmental stages was not significantly greater in any genomic region.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides the first single-base pair resolution DNA methylomes for both oyster sperm and larval samples from multiple crosses. Assuming DNA methylation is introduced randomly, the predominance of differentially methylated loci between families within transposable elements could be associated with selection against altering methylation in gene bodies. For instance, differentially methylated loci in gene bodies could be lethal or deleterious, as they would alter gene expression. Another possibility is that differentially methylated loci may provide advantageous phenotypic variation by increasing transposable element mobility. Future research should focus on the relationship between epigenetic and genetic variation, and explore the possible relationship of DNA methylation and transposable element activity.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTA-to-I editing substitutes inosines for adenosines at specific positions in mRNAs and can substantially alter a cells transcriptome. Currently, little is known about how RNA editing operates in cancer. Transcriptome analysis of 68 normal and cancerous breast tissues revealed that the editing enzyme ADAR acts uniformly, on the same loci, across tissues. Controlled ADAR expression experiments demonstrated that the editing frequency at all loci is proportional to both ADAR expression levels and the individual locus editability--a propensity to be edited determined by the surrounding nucleotide sequence. Comparison of tumor transcriptomes to those of normal breast and breast organoids, i.e. pure normal breast epithelial cells, demonstrated that the editing frequency is increased in tumor cells. This was consistent with ADAR immunohistochemistry. We also demonstrated that type I interferon response and ADAR DNA copy number explain together 53% of ADAR expression in breast cancers, an observation also valid in nearly all of 20 other cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Interferon exposure increased ADAR mRNA, protein expression and editing in four breast cell lines. Finally, ADAR silencing using shRNA lentivirus transduction in breast cancer cell lines led to more cell proliferation and less apoptosis. Our results reveal that A-to-I editing is a pervasive, yet reproducible, source of variation that is controlled by two factors, 1q amplification and inflammation, both highly prevalent among human cancers. This suggests the potential for a new class of therapeutic targets and an unexpected role for inflammation in cancers.",
