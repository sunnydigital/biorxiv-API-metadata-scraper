    "abstract": "Existing techniques to reconstruct tree models of progression for accumulative processes, such as cancer, seek to estimate causation by combining correlation and a frequentist notion of temporal priority. In this paper, we define a novel theoretical framework called CAPRESE (CAncer PRogression Extraction with Single Edges) to reconstruct such models based on the notion of probabilistic causation defined by Suppes. We consider a general reconstruction setting complicated by the presence of noise in the data due to biological variation, as well as experimental or measurement errors. To improve tolerance to noise we define and use a shrinkage-like estimator. We prove the correctness of our algorithm by showing asymptotic convergence to the correct tree under mild constraints on the level of noise. Moreover, on synthetic data, we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, that it is efficient even with a relatively small number of samples and that its performance quickly converges to its asymptote as the number of samples increases. For real cancer datasets obtained with different technologies, we highlight biologically significant differences in the progressions inferred with respect to other competing techniques and we also show how to validate conjectured biological relations with progression models.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary dynamics of transposable element (TE) insertions have been of continued interest since TE activity has important implications for genome evolution and adaptation. Here, we infer the transposition dynamics of TEs by comparing their abundance in natural D. melanogaster and D. simulans populations. Sequencing pools of more than 550 South African flies to at least 320-fold coverage, we determined the genome wide TE insertion frequencies in both species. We show that 46 (49%) TE families in D. melanogaster and 44 (47%) in D. simulans experienced a recent burst of activity. The bursts of activity affected different TE families in the two species. While in D. melanogaster retrotransposons predominated, DNA transposons showed higher activity levels in D. simulans. We propose that the observed TE dynamics are the outcome of the demographic history of the two species, with habitat expansion triggering a period of rapid evolution.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variation in natural populations results from a combination of genetic effects, environmental effects, and gene-by-environment interactions. Despite the vast amount of genomic data becoming available, many pressing questions remain about the nature of genetic mutations that underlie functional variation. We present the results of combining genome-wide association analysis of 41 different phenotypes in [~]5,000 inbred maize lines to analyze patterns of high-resolution genetic association among of 28.9 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and [~]800,000 copy-number variants (CNVs). We show that genie and intergenic regions have opposite patterns of enrichment, minor allele frequencies, and effect sizes, implying tradeoffs among the probability that a given polymorphism will have an effect, the detectable size of that effect, and its frequency in the population. We also find that genes tagged by GWAS are enriched for regulatory functions and are [~]50% more likely to have a paralog than expected by chance, indicating that gene regulation and neofunctionalization are strong drivers of phenotypic variation. These results will likely apply to many other organisms, especially ones with large and complex genomes like maize.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe performed genome-wide association mapping analysis in maize for over 40 different phenotypes in order to identify which types of variants are more likely to be important for controlling traits. We took advantage of a large mapping population (roughly 5000 recombinant inbred lines) and nearly 30 million segregating variants to identify [~]4800 variants that were significantly associated with at least one phenotype. While these variants are enriched in genes, most of them occur outside of genes, often in regions where regulatory variants likely lie. We also found a significant enrichment for paralogous (duplicated) genes, implying that functional divergence after gene duplication plays an important role in trait variation. Overall these analyses provide important insight into the unifying patterns of variation in traits across maize, and the results will likely also apply to other organisms with similarly large, complex genomes.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic force can serve as an ideal way to control the spatial behavior of microorganisms, because of its flexibility and penetrability. By incubation with the biocompatible compound, ammonium ferric citrate, as an iron source, we magnetized Escherichia coli, the most programmable chassis in synthetic biology. To enhance the magnetization efficiency, the ferritin protein, FtnA, from E. coli was cloned and overexpressed in strain BL21(DE3). The magnetization effect was observed within 30 min after harvest of bacteria, and the concentration of ammonium ferric acid used could be as low as 0.5 mM. Using different shapes of magnetic fields, different patterns could be generated easily. Our method may set up the foundation for a rational design of spatial structure of cell communities, which is important for their actual application.",
