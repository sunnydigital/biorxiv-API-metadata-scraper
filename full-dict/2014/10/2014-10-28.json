    "abstract": "The numerical model of one-loop circulation exploits viscous deformation as mechanism of ventricular filling. Mathematical advantage of viscous deforming is a possibility to present the ventricular filling as the function of two independent variables (stress and time); two-dimensional argument frames a table which permits to calculate end-diastolic ventricular volume due to information about measured venous pressure and duration of ventricular diastole. The equation was deduced which balances the system while varying of such parameters as arterial resistance, the value of normal rhythm and the volume flow rate. The model pays attention on the phenomenon of asymmetrical position of normal rhythm (the steady rhythm in conditions of rest) and explains why the operating range of brady-rhythms is much narrower than the operating range of tachy-rhythms.",

    "abstract": "One of the major goals in metagenomics is to identify organisms present in the microbial community from a huge set of unknown DNA sequences. This profiling has valuable applications in multiple important areas of medical research such as disease diagnostics. Nevertheless, it is not a simple task, and many approaches that have been developed are slow and depend on the read length of the DNA sequences. Here we introduce an innovative and agile approach which k-mer and Monte Carlo simulation to profile and report abundant organisms present in metagenomic samples and their relative abundance without sequence length dependencies. The program was tested with a simulated metagenomes, and the results show that our approach predicts the organisms in microbial communities and their relative abundance.",

    "abstract": "Animal tissue development relies on precise generation and deployment of specific cell types into tissue sub-structures. Understanding how this process is regulated remains a major challenge of biology. In many tissues, development progresses through a sequence of dividing progenitor cells, each with decreasing potency, that balance their growth and differentiation. Dividing progenitor cells thus face a decision on whether their offspring shall differentiate or self-renew. This results in three possible modes of division (symmetric self-renewing, symmetric differentiating, and asymmetric) all of which have been observed in developing animal tissues. In some instances, the frequencies of occurrence of these division modes are incompatible with the possibility that sibling cells take the decision to differentiate independently of each other. Rather, an excess of symmetric divisions, both proliferating and differentiating, is usually observed in so far no general mechanism by which this fate entanglement takes place has been put forward. Here we propose a simple model of progenitor priming that provides a rationale on how the fate of sibling cells might be linked. Analysis of the model suggests that commitment to the cycle completion of cells primed for differentiation might be the cause of the observed excess of symmetric divisions. The model presented is applicable to a broad range of developmental systems and provides a testing framework to explain the dynamics of cell division and differentiation are related.",

    "abstract": "Restoration of the native eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) has been severely hindered by the dwindling supply and rising costs of fossil and new oyster shell for use in reef restoration. Consequently, emphasis has shifted to the use of alternative oyster reef materials, which need to be tested for their effectiveness as settlement substrate. Furthermore, low recruitment of wild larvae has also impeded restoration, indicating a need to assess the potential of field setting of cultured larvae. We experimentally examined oyster settlement, growth and survival on unconsolidated oyster shell, oyster shell embedded vertically in concrete, and concrete Oyster Castles(R) in field and mesocosm experiments. In addition, we examined settlement success of cultured larvae in the mesocosm experiment. In the field experiment, juvenile recruitment was 3x higher on castles and unconsolidated shell than on embedded shell. Castles retained 4x the number of oysters and hosted 5x the biomass than embedded shell, and retained 1.5x the oysters and hosted 3x the biomass than unconsolidated shell. The proportion of live oyster recruits on castles was 1.5x that on both embedded and unconsolidated shell. In the mesocosm experiment (90-d post-larval deployment), the castles recruited, retained, and hosted an oyster biomass 4x higher than that of unconsolidated and embedded shell. This study confirms that artificial reef materials such as Oyster Castles(R) are suitable alternative substrates for oyster restoration, and remote setting of larvae onto conditioned substrate can be effective under controlled environmental conditions. Future restoration efforts should consider use of alternative reef substrates and field setting of larvae to maximize oyster recruitment, while simultaneously minimizing the cost of reef restoration.",

    "abstract": "Plant genomes are large, intron-rich and present a wide range of variation in coding region G + C content. Concerning coding regions, a sort of syndrome can be described in plants: the increase in G + C content is associated with both the increase in heterogeneity among genes within a genome and the increase in variation across genes. Taking advantage of the large number of genes composing plant genomes and the wide range of variation in gene intron number, we performed a comprehensive survey of the patterns of variation in G + C content at different scales from the nucleotide level to the genome scale in two species Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, comparing the patterns in genes with different intron numbers. In both species, we observed a pervasive effect of gene intron number and location along genes on G + C content, codon and amino acid frequencies suggesting that in both species, introns have a barrier effect structuring G + C content along genes. In external gene regions (located upstream first or downstream last intron), species-specific factors are shaping G + C content while in internal gene regions (surrounded by introns), G + C content is constrained to remain within a range common to both species. In rice, introns appear as a major determinant of gene G + C content while in A. thaliana introns have a weaker but significant effect. The structuring effect of introns in both species is susceptible to explain the G + C content syndrome observed in plants.",

    "abstract": "Humans are unique both in their cognitive abilities and in the extent of cooperation in large groups of unrelated individuals. How our species evolved high intelligence in spite of various costs of having a large brain is perplexing. Equally puzzling is how our ancestors managed to overcome the collective action problem and evolve strong innate preferences for cooperative behavior. Here I theoretically study the evolution of social-cognitive competencies as driven by selection emerging from the need to produce public goods in games against nature or in direct competition with other groups. I use collaborative ability in collective actions as a proxy for social-cognitive competencies. My results suggest that collaborative ability is more likely to evolve first by between-group conflicts and then later be utilized and improved in games against nature. If collaborative abilities remain low, the species is predicted to become genetically dimorphic with a small proportion of individuals contributing to public goods and the rest free-riding. Evolution of collaborative ability creates conditions for the subsequent evolution of collaborative communication and cultural learning.",

We have applied high throughput metabolite analyses to over 12,000 diverse field grown samples from the maize nested association mapping population. This allowed us to identify natural variation controlling the levels of twelve key C and N metabolites, often with single gene resolution. In addition to expected genes like invertases, critical natural variation was identified in key C4 metabolism genes like carbonic anhydrases and a malate transporter. Unlike prior maize studies, extensive pleiotropy was found for C and N metabolites. This integration of field-derived metabolite data with powerful mapping and genomics resources allows dissection of key metabolic pathways, providing avenues for future genetic improvement.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in calcium imaging has been to infer spike rates of neurons from the measured noisy calcium fluorescence traces. We systematically evaluate a range of spike inference algorithms on a large benchmark dataset (>100.000 spikes) recorded from varying neural tissue (V1 and retina) using different calcium indicators (OGB-1 and GCaMP6). We introduce a new algorithm based on supervised learning in flexible probabilistic models and show that it outperforms all previously published techniques. Importantly, it even performs better than other algorithms when applied to entirely new datasets for which no simultaneously recorded data is available. Future data acquired in new experimental conditions can easily be used to further improve its spike prediction accuracy and generalization performance. Finally, we show that comparing algorithms on artificial data is not informative about performance on real data, suggesting that benchmark datasets such as the one we provide may greatly facilitate future algorithmic developments.",
