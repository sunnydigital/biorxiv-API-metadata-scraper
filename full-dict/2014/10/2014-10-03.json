    "abstract": "The capacity for aerial maneuvering was likely a major influence on the evolution of flying animals. Here we evaluate consequences of paravian morphology for aerial performance by quantifying static stability and control effectiveness of physical models for numerous taxa sampled from within the lineage leading to birds (Paraves). Results of aerodynamic testing are mapped phylogenetically to examine how maneuvering characteristics correspond to tail shortening, forewing elaboration, and other morphological features. In the evolution of Paraves we observe shifts from static stability to inherently unstable aerial planforms; control effectiveness also migrated from tails to the forewings. These shifts suggest that some degree of aerodynamic control and and capacity for maneuvering preceded the evolution of strong power stroke. The timing of shifts also suggests features normally considered in light of development of a power stroke may play important roles in control.",

Arabidopsis thaliana has colonized a wide range of habitats across the world and it is therefore an attractive model for studying the genetic mechanisms underlying environmental adaptation. Here, we study two collections of A. thaliana accessions from across Eurasia to identify loci associated with differences in climates at the sampling sites. A new genome-wide association analysis method was developed to detect adaptive loci where the alleles tolerate different climate ranges. Sixteen novel such loci were found including a strong association between Chromomethylase 2 (CMT2) and temperature seasonality. The reference allele dominated in areas with less seasonal variability in temperature, and the alternative allele existed in both stable and variable regions. Our results thus link natural variation in CMT2 and epigenetic changes to temperature adaptation. We showed experimentally that plants with a defective CMT2 gene tolerate heat-stress better than plants with a functional gene. Together this strongly suggests a role for genetic regulation of epigenetic modifications in natural adaptation to temperature and illustrates the importance of re-analyses of existing data using new analytical methods to obtain deeper insights into the underlying biology from available data.",

    "abstract": "Development is a complex process that, under normal circumstances, proceeds in a stable and patterned fashion. Developmental morphogenesis (called embryogenesis) can tell us a great deal about the function and structure of an adult organism. One of the most important aspects of development to understand is the progression of cell division and differentiation in what will become an adult worm. This is where the DevoWorm project can both address multiple outstanding theoretical issues and provide graphical clarity to the embryogenetic process. As a representative of mosaic development, C. elegans embryogenesis is both tractable in terms of cell number and relatively well-characterized. In this paper, we will lay out a theoretical re-interpretation of embryogenesis in addition to developing an RDF-based computational framework for visualizing the results of this theoretical effort. Our theoretical efforts will ultimately involve the construction of a differentiation tree and data analyses that support the concept of differentiation waves acting to coordinate cellular differentiation and embryonic form. The differentiation tree will also feature a means to perturb development in a manner that mimics phenotypic mutagenesis. This will allow us to understand the selective variability that is inherent in biological development, but that remains so poorly understood. In tandem, these developments will allow us to construct a conceptual and computational framework which can be applied to both mosaic and regulative development.",

    "abstract": "Because natural selection is likely to act on multiple genes underlying a given phenotypic trait, we study here the potential effect of ongoing and past selection on the genetic diversity of human biological pathways. We first show that genes included in gene sets are generally under stronger selective constraints than other genes and that their evolutionary response is correlated. We then introduce a new procedure to detect selection at the pathway level based on a decomposition of the classical McDonald-Kreitman test extended to multiple genes. This new test, called 2DNS, detects outlier gene sets and takes into account past demographic effects as well as evolutionary constraints specific to gene sets. Selective forces acting on gene sets can be easily identified by a mere visual inspection of the position of the gene sets relative to their 2D null distribution. We thus find several outlier gene sets that show signals of positive, balancing, or purifying selection, but also others showing an ancient relaxation of selective constraints. The principle of the 2DNS test can also be applied to other genomic contrasts. For instance, the comparison of patterns of polymorphisms private to African and non-African populations reveals that most pathways show a higher proportion of non-synonymous mutations in non-Africans than in Africans, potentially due to different demographic histories and selective pressures.",

A number of researchers have taken advantage of this opportunity to validate some forensic genetic approaches, particularly to ensure that estimated rates of genotype matching between unrelated individuals are indeed slight overestimates of those observed. However, these studies have also revealed systematic error trends in genotype probability estimates. In this analysis, we investigate these error trends and show how the specific implementation of the Balding-Nichols model must be considered when applied to database-wide matching. Specifically, we show that in addition to accounting for increased allelic matching between individuals with recent shared ancestry, studies must account for relatively decreased allelic matching between individuals with more ancient shared ancestry.",

    "abstract": "As adult female mosquitos salivary gland facilitate blood meal uptake and pathogen transmission e.g. Plasmodium, virus etc., a plethora of research has been focused to understand the mosquito-vertebrate-pathogen interactions. Despite the fact that mosquito spends longer time over nectar sugar source, the fundamental question  how adult female salivary gland manages molecular and functional relationship during sugar vs. blood meal uptake remains unanswered. Currently, we are trying to understand these molecular relationships under dual feeding conditions in the salivary glands of the mosquito Anopheles culicifacies. During functional annotation of salivary transcriptome database, unexpectedly we discovered a cluster of salivary transcripts encoding plant like proteins. Our multiple experimental validations confirmed that Plant like transcripts (PLTs) are of mosquito origin and may encode functional proteins. A comprehensive molecular analysis of the PLTs and ongoing metagenomic analysis of salivary microbiome provide first evidence that how mosquito may have been benefited from its association with plant host and microbes. Future understanding of the underlying mechanism of the feeding associated molecular responses may provide new opportunity to control vector borne diseases.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the primate visual system have begun to test a wide range of complex computational object-vision models. Realistic models have many parameters, which in practice cannot be fitted using the limited amounts of brain-activity data typically available. Task performance optimization (e.g. using backpropagation to train neural networks) provides major constraints for fitting parameters and discovering nonlinear representational features appropriate for the task (e.g. object classification). Model representations can be compared to brain representations in terms of the representational dissimilarities they predict for an image set. This method, called representational similarity analysis (RSA), enables us to test the representational feature space as is (fixed RSA) or to fit a linear transformation that mixes the nonlinear model features so as to best explain a cortical areas representational space (mixed RSA). Like voxel/population-receptive-field modelling, mixed RSA uses a training set (different stimuli) to fit one weight per model feature and response channel (voxels here), so as to best predict the response profile across images for each response channel. We analysed response patterns elicited by natural images, which were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that early visual areas were best accounted for by shallow models, such as a Gabor wavelet pyramid (GWP). The GWP model performed similarly with and without mixing, suggesting that the original features already approximated the representational space, obviating the need for mixing. However, a higher ventral-stream visual representation (lateral occipital region) was best explained by the higher layers of a deep convolutional network, and mixing of its feature set was essential for this model to explain the representation. We suspect that mixing was essential because the convolutional network had been trained to discriminate a set of 1000 categories, whose frequencies in the training set did not match their frequencies in natural experience or their behavioural importance. The latter factors might determine the representational prominence of semantic dimensions in higher-level ventral-stream areas. Our results demonstrate the benefits of testing both the specific representational hypothesis expressed by a models original feature space and the hypothesis space generated by linear transformations of that feature space.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIWe tested computational models of representations in ventral-stream visual areas.\\nC_LIO_LIWe compared representational dissimilarities with/without linear remixing of model features.\\nC_LIO_LIEarly visual areas were best explained by shallow - and higher by deep - models.\\nC_LIO_LIUnsupervised shallow models performed better without linear remixing of their features.\\nC_LIO_LIA supervised deep convolutional net performed best with linear feature remixing.\\nC_LI",

Although theoretical studies indicate that restricted conditions may be necessary to achieve co-occurrence of specialists and generalists, analyses of larger empirical (and species-rich) communities reveal the pervasiveness of coexistence. In this paper, we analyze 175 ecological bipartite networks of three interaction types (animal hosts-parasite, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator), and measure the extent to which these communities are composed of species with different levels of specificity in their biotic interactions. We find a continuum from specialism to generalism. Furthermore, we demonstrate that diversity tends to be greatest in networks with intermediate connectance, and argue this is because of physical constraints in the filling of networks.",
