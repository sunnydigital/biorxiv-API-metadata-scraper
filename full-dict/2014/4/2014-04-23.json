    "abstract": "The living state is cognitive at every scale and level of organization. Since it is possible to associate a broad class of cognitive processes with  dual information sources, many pathologies can be addressed using statistical models based on the Shannon Coding, the Shannon-McMillan Source Coding, the Rate Distortion, and the Data Rate Theorems, as these impose powerful necessary condition constraints on information generation and exchange, and on system control. Deterministic-but-for-error biological codes do not directly invoke cognition, although they may be essential subcomponents within larger cognitive processes. A formal argument, however, places such codes within a similar framework, with metabolic free energy serving as a  control signal stabilizing biochemical code-and-translator dynamics in the presence of noise. Demand beyond available energy supply then expresses itself in punctuated destabilization of the coding channel, affecting a spectrum of essential biological functions. Aging, normal or prematurely driven by psychosocial or environmental stressors, must eventually interfere with the routine operation of such mechanisms, triggering chronic diseases associated with senescence. Amyloid fibril formation, intrinsically disordered protein logic gates, and cell surface glycan/lectin  kelp bed logic gates are reviewed from this perspective. The results, however, generalize beyond coding systems having easily recognizable symmetry modes.",

    "abstract": "Inbred C57BL/6J mice have been used to study diet-induced obesity and the detrimental physiological effects associated with it. Little is understood about predictive factors that predispose an animal to weight gain. To address this, mice were fed a high fat diet, control diet or normal chow diet. Several measurements including pre-diet serum hormone levels and pre-diet body weight were analyzed, but these had limited predictive value regarding weight gain. However, baseline measurements of weight loss in response to food deprivation showed a strong negative correlation with high fat diet-induced weight gain. These data suggest that fasting-induced weight loss in adolescent mice is a useful predictor of diet-induced weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Various bacteria such as the canonical gram negative Escherichia coli or the well-studied gram positive Bacillus subtilis divide symmetrically after they approximately double their volume. Their size at division is not constant, but is typically distributed over a narrow range. Here, we propose an analytically tractable model for cell size control, and calculate the cell size and inter-division time distributions, and the correlations between these variables. We suggest ways of extracting the model parameters from experimental data, and show that existing data for E. coli supports partial size control, and a particular explanation: a cell attempts to add a constant volume from the time of initiation of DNA replication to the next initiation event. This hypothesis accounts for the experimentally observed correlations between mother and daughter cells as well as the exponential dependence of size on growth rate.\\n\\nPACS numbers: 87.17.Ee, 87.17.Aa, 87.10.Mn, 87.81Tt",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that adaptation from de novo mutation often produces so-called soft selective sweeps, where adaptive mutations of independent mutational origin sweep through the population at the same time. Population genetic theory predicts that soft sweeps should be likely if the product of the population size and the mutation rate towards the adaptive allele is sufficiently large, such that multiple adaptive mutations can establish before one has reached fixation; however, it remains unclear how demographic processes affect the probability of observing soft sweeps. Here we extend the theory of soft selective sweeps to realistic demographic scenarios that allow for changes in population size over time. We first show that population bottlenecks can lead to the removal of all but one adaptive lineage from an initially soft selective sweep. The parameter regime under which such 'hardening' of soft selective sweeps is likely is determined by a simple heuristic condition. We further develop a generalized analytical framework, based on an extension of the coalescent process, for calculating the probability of soft sweeps under arbitrary demographic scenarios. Two important limits emerge within this analytical framework: In the limit where population size fluctuations are fast compared to the duration of the sweep, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by the harmonic mean of the variance effective population size estimated over the duration of the sweep; in the opposing slow fluctuation limit, the likelihood of soft sweeps is determined by the instantaneous variance effective population size at the onset of the sweep. We show that as a consequence of this finding the probability of observing soft sweeps becomes a function of the strength of selection. Specifically, in species with sharply fluctuating population size, strong selection is more likely to produce soft sweeps than weak selection. Our results highlight the importance of accurate demographic estimates over short evolutionary timescales for understanding the population genetics of adaptation from de novo mutation.",

    "abstract": "The production and maintenance of genetic and phenotypic diversity under temporally fluctuating selection and the signatures of environmental and selective volatility in the patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation have been important areas of focus in population genetics. On one hand, stretches of constant selection pull the genetic makeup of populations towards local fitness optima. On the other, in order to cope with changes in the selection regime, populations may evolve mechanisms that create a diversity of genotypes. By tuning the rates at which variability is produced, such as the rates of recombination, mutation or migration, populations may increase their long-term adaptability. Here we use theoretical models to gain insight into how the rates of these three evolutionary forces are shaped by fluctuating selection. We compare and contrast the evolution of recombination, mutation and migration under similar patterns of environmental change and show that these three sources of phenotypic variation are surprisingly similar in their response to changing selection. We show that knowing the shape, size, variance and asymmetry of environmental runs is essential for accurate prediction of genetic evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of macroevolutionary patterns of adaptive evolution has greatly increased with the advent of large-scale phylogenetic comparative methods. Widely used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) models can describe an adaptive process of divergence and selection. However, inference of the dynamics of adaptive landscapes from comparative data is complicated by interpretational difficulties, lack of identifiability among parameter values and the common requirement that adaptive hypotheses must be assigned a priori. Here we develop a reversible-jump Bayesian method of fitting multi-optima OU models to phylogenetic comparative data that estimates the placement and magnitude of adaptive shifts directly from the data. We show how biologically informed hypotheses can be tested against this inferred posterior of shift locations using Bayes Factors to establish whether our a priori models adequately describe the dynamics of adaptive peak shifts. Furthermore, we show how the inclusion of informative priors can be used to restrict models to biologically realistic parameter space and test particular biological interpretations of evolutionary models. We argue that Bayesian model-fitting of OU models to comparative data provides a framework for integrating of multiple sources of biological data--such as microevolutionary estimates of selection parameters and paleontological timeseries--allowing inference of adaptive landscape dynamics with explicit, process-based biological interpretations.",

    "abstract": "RNA-based regulation, such as RNA interference, and CRISPR/Cas transcription factors (CRISPR-TFs), can enable scalable synthetic gene circuits and the modulation of endogenous networks but have yet to be integrated together. Here, we combined multiple mammalian RNA regulatory strategies, including RNA triple helix structures, introns, microRNAs, and ribozymes, with Cas9-based CRISPR-TFs and Cas6/Csy4-based RNA processing in human cells. We describe three complementary strategies for expressing functional gRNAs from transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) promoters while allowing the harboring gene to be translated. These architectures enable the multiplexed expression of proteins and multiple gRNAs from a single compact transcript for efficient modulation of synthetic constructs and endogenous human promoters. We used these regulatory tools to implement tunable synthetic gene circuits, including multi-stage transcriptional cascades. Finally, we show that Csy4 can rewire regulatory connections in RNA-dependent gene circuits with multiple outputs and feedback loops to achieve complex functional behaviors. This multiplexable toolkit will be valuable for the construction of scalable gene circuits and the perturbation of natural regulatory networks in human cells for basic biology, therapeutic, and synthetic-biology applications.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput measurement techniques, scientists and engineers are starting to grapple with massive data sets and encountering challenges with how to organize, process and extract information into meaningful structures. Multidimensional spatio-temporal biological data sets such as time series gene expression with various perturbations over different cell lines, or neural spike trains across many experimental trials, have the potential to acquire insight across multiple dimensions. For this potential to be realized, we need a suitable representation to understand the data. Since a wide range of experiments and the unknown complexity of the underlying system contribute to the heterogeneity of biological data, we propose a method based on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), which is well suited for extracting principal components when there are corrupted observations. The proposed method provides us a new representation of these data sets in terms of a common and aberrant response. This representation might help users to acquire a new insight from data.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryOne of the most exciting trends and important themes in science and engineering involves the use of high-throughput measurement data. With different dimensions, for example, various perturbations, different doses of drug or cell lines characteristics, such multidimensional data sets enable us to understand commonalities and differences across multiple dimensions. A general question is how to organize the observed data into meaningful structures and how to find an appropriate similarity measure. A natural way of viewing these complex high dimensional data sets is to examine and analyze the large-scale features and then to focus on the interesting details. With this notion, we propose an RPCA-based method which models common variations as approximately the low-rank component and anomalies as the sparse component. We show that the proposed method is able to find distinct subtypes and classify data sets in a robust way without any prior knowledge by separating these common responses and abnormal responses.",
