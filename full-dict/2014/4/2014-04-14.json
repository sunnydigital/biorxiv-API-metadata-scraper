    "abstract": "Genome-wide profiling of open chromatin regions using DNase I and high-throughput sequencing (DNase-seq) is an increasingly popular approach for finding and studying regulatory elements. A variety of algorithms have been developed to identify regions of open chromatin from raw sequence-tag data, which has motivated us to assess and compare their performance.\\n\\nIn this study, four published, publicly available peak calling algorithms used for DNase-seq data analysis (F-seq, Hotspot, MACS and ZINBA) are assessed at a range of signal thresholds on two published DNase-seq datasets for three cell types. The results were benchmarked against an independent dataset of regulatory regions derived from ENCODE in vivo transcription factor binding data for each particular cell type. The level of overlap between peak regions reported by each algorithm and this ENCODE-derived reference set was used to assess sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms.\\n\\nOur study suggests that F-seq has a slightly higher sensitivity than the next best algorithms. Hotspot and the ChIP-seq oriented method, MACS, both perform competitively when used with their default parameters. However the generic peak finder ZINBA appears to be less sensitive than the other three.\\n\\nWe also assess accuracy of each algorithm over a range of signal thresholds. In particular, we show that the accuracy of F-Seq can be considerably improved by using a threshold setting that is different from the default value.",

    "abstract": "Individuals can manipulate the behavior of social partners. However, manipulation may conflict with the fitness interests of the manipulated individuals. Manipulated individuals can then be favored to resist manipulation, possibly reducing or eliminating the manipulated behavior in the long run. I use a mathematical model to show that conflicts where manipulation and resistance coevolve can disappear as a result of the coevolutionary process. I find that while manipulated individuals are selected to resist, they can simultaneously be favored to express the manipulated behavior at higher efficiency (i.e., providing increasing fitness effects to recipients of the manipulated behavior). Efficiency can increase to a point at which selection for resistance disappears. This process yields an efficient social behavior that is induced by social partners, and over which the inducing and induced individuals are no longer in conflict. A necessary factor is costly inefficiency. I develop the model to address the evolution of advanced eusociality via maternal manipulation (AEMM). The model predicts AEMM to be particularly likely in taxa with ancestrally imperfect resistance to maternal manipulation. Costly inefficiency occurs if the cost of delayed dispersal is larger than the benefit of exploiting the maternal patch. I discuss broader implications of the process.",

    "abstract": "The entomopathogenic Fungi comprise a wide range of ecologically diverse species. This group of parasites can be found distributed among all fungal phyla and as well as among the ecologically similar but phylogenetically distinct Oomycetes or water molds, that belong to a different kingdom (Stramenopila). As a group, the entomopathogenic fungi and water molds parasitize a wide range of insect hosts from aquatic larvae in streams to adult insects of high canopy tropical forests. Their hosts are spread among 18 orders of insects, in all developmental stages such as: eggs, larvae, pupae, nymphs and adults exhibiting completely different ecologies. Such assortment of niches has resulted in these parasites evolving a considerable morphological diversity, resulting in enormous biodiversity, much of which remains unknown. Here we gather together a huge amount of records of these entomopathogens to comparing and describe both their morphologies and ecological traits. These findings highlight a wide range of adaptations that evolved following the evolutionary transition to infecting the most diverse and widespread animals on Earth, the insects.",

    "abstract": "The degree of oxidation of carbon atoms in organic molecules depends on the covalent structure. In proteins, the average oxidation state of carbon (ZC) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from the chemical formula. To investigate oxidation-reduction (redox) patterns, groups of proteins from different subcellular locations and phylogenetic divisions were selected for comparison. Extracellular proteins of yeast have a relatively high oxidation state of carbon, corresponding with oxidizing conditions outside of the cell. However, an inverse relationship between ZC and redox potential occurs between the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm; this trend is interpreted as resulting from overall coupling of protein turnover to the formation of a lower glutathione redox potential in the cytoplasm. In Rubisco homologues, lower ZC tends to occur in organisms with higher optimal growth temperature, and there are broad changes in ZC in whole-genome protein compositions in microbes from different environments. Energetic costs calculated from thermodynamic models suggest that thermophilic organisms exhibit molecular adaptation to not only high temperature but also the reducing nature of many hydrothermal fluids. A view of protein metabolism that depends on the chemical conditions of cells and environments raises new questions linking biochemical processes to changes on evolutionary timescales.",

    "abstract": "Zebra finches are a highly social, gregarious, species and eagerly engage in vocal communication. We have developed a training apparatus that allows training zebra finches to discriminate socially reinforced and aversive vocal stimuli. In our experiments, juvenile male zebra finches were trained to discriminate a song that was followed by a brief air puff (aversive) and a song that allowed them to stay in visual contact with another bird,  audience (social song). During training, the birds learned quickly to avoid air puffs by escaping the aversive song within 2 sec. They escaped significantly more aversive songs than socially reinforced ones, and this effect grew stronger with the number of training sessions. Therefore, we propose this training procedure as an effective method to teach zebra finches to discriminate between different auditory stimuli, which may also be used as a broader paradigm for addressing social reinforcement learning. The apparatus can be built from commercially available parts, and we are sharing the controlling software on our website.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mapping of genotypes into phenotypes is a central challenge of current biological research. Such mapping, conceptually represents a developmental mechanism through which phenotypic variation can be generated. Given the nongenetic character of developmental dynamics, phenotypic variation to a great extent has been neglected in the study of evolution. What is the relevance of considering this generative process in the study of evolution? How can we study its evolutionary consequences? Despite an historical systematic bias towards linear causation schemes in biology; in the post-genomic era, a systems-view to biology based on nonlinear (network) thinking is increasingly being adopted. Within this view, evolutionary dynamics can be studied using simple dynamical models of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Through the study of GRN dynamics, genotypes and phenotypes can be unambiguously defined. The orchestrating role of GRNs constitutes an operational non-linear genotype-phenotype map. Further extension of these GRN models in order to explore and characterize an associated Epigenetic Landscape enables the study of the evolutionary consequences of both genetic and non-genetic sources of phenotypic variation within the same coherent theoretical framework. The merging of conceptually clear theories, computational/mathematical tools, and molecular/genomic data into coherent frameworks could be the basis for a transformation of biological research from mainly a descriptive exercise into a truly mechanistic, explanatory endeavor.",

    "abstract": "Complex networks of regulatory interactions orchestrate developmental processes in multicellular organisms. Such a complex internal structure intrinsically constrains cellular behavior allowing only a reduced set of attainable and observable cellular states or cell types. Thus, a multicellular system undergoes cell fate decisions in a robust manner in the course of its normal development. The epigenetic landscape (EL) model originally proposed by C.H. Waddington was an early attempt to integrate these processes in a universal conceptual model of development. Since then, a wealth of experimental data has accumulated, the general mechanisms of gene regulation have been uncovered, and the placement of specific molecular components within modular gene regulatory networks (GRN) has become a common practice. This has motivated the development of mathematical and computational models inspired by the EL aiming to integrate molecular data and gain a better understanding of development, and hopefully predict cell differentiation and reprogramming events. Both deterministic and stochastic dynamical models have been used to described cell state transitions. In this review, we describe recent EL models, emphasising that the construction of an explicit landscape from a GRN is not the only way to implement theoretical models consistent with the conceptual basis of the EL. Moreover, models based on the EL have been shown to be useful in the study of morphogenic processes and not just cell differentiation. Here we describe the distinct approaches, comparing their strengths and weaknesses and the kind of biological questions that they have been able to address. We also point to challenges ahead.",
