    "abstract": "The rapid development in quantitatively measuring DNA, RNA, and protein has generated a great interest in the development of reverse-engineering methods, that is, data-driven approaches to infer the network structure or dynamical model of the system. Many reverse-engineering methods require discrete quantitative data as input, while many experimental data are continuous. Some studies have started to reveal the impact that the choice of data discretization has on the performance of reverse-engineering methods. However, more comprehensive studies are still greatly needed to systematically and quantitatively understand the impact that discretization methods have on inference methods. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for systematic comparative methods that can help select between discretization methods. In this work, we consider 4 published intracellular networks inferred with their respective time-series datasets. We discretized the data using different discretization methods. Across all datasets, changing the data discretization to a more appropriate one improved the reverse-engineering methods performance. We observed no universal best discretization method across different time-series datasets. Thus, we propose DiscreeTest, a two-step evaluation metric for ranking discretization methods for time-series data. The underlying assumption of DiscreeTest is that an optimal discretization method should preserve the dynamic patterns observed in the original data across all variables. We used the same datasets and networks to show that DiscreeTest is able to identify an appropriate discretization among several candidate methods. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a method for benchmarking and selecting an appropriate discretization method for time-series data has been proposed.\\n\\nAvailabilityAll the datasets, reverse-engineering methods and source code used in this paper are available in Vera-Liconas lab Github repository: https://github.com/VeraLiconaResearchGroup/Benchmarking_TSDiscretizations",

    "abstract": "Flagellar motility plays a central role in the bacterial foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, as flagellar motility is required for reaching the intestinal epithelium and subsequent colonisation or disease. Flagellar proteins also contribute strongly to biofilm formation during transmission. Chemotaxis is the process directing flagellar motility in response to attractant and repellent stimuli, but its role in biofilm formation of C. jejuni is not well understood. Here we show that inactivation of the core chemotaxis genes cheVAWY in C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168 affects both chemotactic motility and biofilm formation. Inactivation of any of the core chemotaxis genes (cheA, cheY, cheV or cheW) impaired chemotactic motility but did not affect flagellar assembly or growth. The {Delta}cheY mutant swam in clockwise loops, while complementation restored normal motility. Inactivation of the core chemotaxis genes interfered with the ability to form a discrete biofilm at the air-media interface, and the {Delta}cheY mutant displayed reduced dispersal/shedding of bacteria into the planktonic fraction. This suggests that while the chemotaxis system is not required for biofilm formation per se, it is necessary for organized biofilm formation. Hence interference with the Campylobacter chemotaxis system at any level disrupts optimal chemotactic motility and transmission modes such as biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "As DNA methylation is one of the key epigenetic mechanisms involved in embryonic development, elucidating its relationship with non-coding RNA and genes is essential for understanding early development. In this study, we performed single-base-resolution bisulfite sequencing together with RNA-seq to explore the genetic basis of embryonic muscle development in chicken. Comparison of methylome profiles between broilers and laying hens revealed that lower methylation in broilers might contribute to muscle development. Differential methylated region (DMR) analysis between two chicken lines showed that the majority of DMRs were hypo-DMRs for broilers. Differential methylated genes were significantly enriched in muscle development-related terms at E13 and E19. Furthermore, by constructing the network of the lncRNAs, we identified a lncRNA, which we named MYH1-AS, that potentially regulated muscle development. These findings reveal an integrative landscape of late period of embryonic myogenesis in chicken and give rise to a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, in skeletal muscle development. Our study provides a reliable data resource for further muscle studies.",

    "abstract": "In social insects, non-nestmates interactions are typically agonistic and many factors may influence the degree of exhibited aggression. Two of these factors are the physical proximity between nests and the chemical dissimilarity between colonies chemical signatures. We studied a population sample of 43 colonies of Cataglyphis niger ants distributed along a transect of [~]4KM. This geographic distribution allowed us to examine correlations of aggression levels with physical and chemical distances. Ants were collected before mating season, when sexuals (unmated gynes and drones) could be found in nests. In our sample, colonies had either gynes or drones but never both. The presence of sexuals, therefore, was another factor we took into account in our behavioral analyses. Workers from nests with sexuals were more aggressive towards conspecifics than workers from nests where sexuals were absent. We also found those workers to be more vigorously active towards colonies with greater chemical distances, while workers from nests without sexuals were indifferent to chemical distances. We therefore concluded that ants are able to detect differences in chemical dissimilarity, but their aggression levels are mainly determined by other mechanisms. A possible additional mechanism is associative learning and long term memory of the chemical signatures of neighboring colonies. Such learning is supported by our finding that aggression is higher towards neighboring nests, which is in line with the previously reported  nasty neighbour effect in Cataglyphis ants. These results suggest that previous experience and learning of neural templates representing neighbors chemical cues is a stronger component than chemical dissimilarity in the mechanisms which determine aggression towards conspecifics in this species. We discuss possible explanations for the observed effect of the presence of sexuals on agonistic behavior and responsiveness to chemical distances.",

    "abstract": "Social insect colonies exhibit colony-level phenotypes such as social immunity and task coordination, which are the sum of individual phenotypes. Mapping the genetic basis of such phenotypes requires associating the colony-level phenotype with the genotypes in the colony. In this paper, we examine alternative approaches to DNA extraction, library construction and sequencing for genome wide association (GWAS) studies of colony-level traits. We evaluate the accuracy of allele frequency estimation in sequencing a pool of individuals (pool-seq) from each colony in either whole-genome sequencing or reduced representation genomic sequencing. Based on empirical measurement of the experimental noise in sequencing DNA pools, we show that whole-genome pool-seq is more accurate than reduced representation pool-seq. We evaluate the power of the alternative approaches for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) of colony-level traits by using simulations that account for an environmental effect on the phenotype. Our results can inform experimental designs and enable optimizing the power of GWAS depending on budget, availability of samples and research goals. We conclude that for a given budget, sequencing un-normalized pools of individuals from each colony achieves greater QTL detection power.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecently, there has been increasing concern about the replicability, or lack thereof, of published research. An especially high rate of false discoveries has been reported in some areas motivating the creation of resource-intensive collaborations to estimate the replication rate of published research by repeating a large number of studies. The substantial amount of resources required by these replication projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings.\\n\\nMethods and findingsIn 2013, Jager and Leek developed a method to estimate the empirical false discovery rate from journal abstracts and applied their method to five high profile journals. Here, we use the relative efficiency of Jager and Leeks method to gather p-values from over 30,000 abstracts and to subsequently estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a five-year time span. We model the empirical false discovery rate by journal subject area (cancer or general medicine), impact factor, and Open Access status. We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer vs. general medicine journals (p = 5.14E-6). Within cancer journals, we find that this relationship is further modified by journal impact factor where a lower journal impact factor is associated with a higher empirical false discovery rates (p = 0.012, 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). We find no significant differences, on average, in the false discovery rate for Open Access vs closed access journals (p = 0.256, 95% CI: -0.014, 0.051).\\n\\nConclusionsWe find evidence of a higher false discovery rate in cancer journals compared to general medicine journals, especially those with a lower journal impact factor. For cancer journals, a lower journal impact factor of one point is associated with a 0.006 increase in the empirical false discovery rate, on average. For a false discovery rate of 0.05, this would result in over a 10% increase to 0.056. Conversely, we find no significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access vs. closed access journals from InCites. Our results provide identify areas of research that may need of additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research.",

The functional traits of vectors affect not just pathogen transmission rates, but also the fitness and population dynamics of these animals themselves. Increasing empirical evidence suggests that vector traits vary significantly at time scales relevant to transmission dynamics. Currently, an understanding of how this variation in key traits impacts transmission is hindered by a lack of both empirical data and theoretical methods for mechanistically incorporating traits into transmission models. Here, we present a framework for incorporating both intrinsic and environment-driven variation in vector traits into empirical and theoretical vector-borne disease research. This framework mechanistically captures the effect of trait variation on vector fitness, the correlation between vector traits, and how these together determine transmission dynamics. We illustrate how trait-based vector-borne disease modelling can make novel predictions, and identify key steps and challenges in the construction, empirical parameterisation and validation of such models, as well as the organization and prioritization of data collection efforts.",

Improving the biological accuracy of annotation is a complex and iterative process requiring researchers to review and incorporate multiple sources of information such as transcriptome alignments, predictive models based on sequence profiles, and comparisons to features found in related organisms. Because rapidly decreasing costs are enabling an ever-growing number of scientists to incorporate sequencing as a routine laboratory technique, there is widespread demand for tools that can assist in the deliberative analytical review of genomic information. To this end, Apollo is an open source software package that enables researchers to efficiently inspect and refine the precise structure and role of genomic features in a graphical browser-based platform.\\n\\nIn this paper we first outline some of Apollos newer user interface features, which were driven by the needs of this expanding genomics community. These include support for real-time collaboration, allowing distributed users to simultaneously edit the same encoded features while also instantly seeing the updates made by other researchers on the same region in a manner similar to Google Docs. Its technical architecture enables Apollo to be integrated into multiple existing genomic analysis pipelines and heterogeneous laboratory workflow platforms.

    "abstract": "SummaryGenome-level evolutionary inference (i.e., phylogenomics) is becoming an increasingly essential step in many biologists work - such as in the characterization of newly recovered genomes, or in leveraging available reference genomes to guide evolutionary questions. Accordingly, there are several tools available for the major steps in a phylogenomics workflow. But for the biologist whose main focus is not bioinformatics, much of the computational work required - such as accessing genomic data on large scales, integrating genomes from different file formats, performing required filtering, stitching different tools together, etc. - can be prohibitive. Here I introduce GToTree, a command-line tool that can take any combination of fasta files, GenBank files, and/or NCBI assembly accessions as input and outputs an alignment file, estimates of genome completeness and redundancy, and a phylogenomic tree based on the specified singlecopy gene (SCG) set. While GToTree can work with any custom hidden Markov Models (HMMs), also included are 13 newly generated SCG-set HMMs for different lineages and levels of resolution, built based on searches of ~12,000 bacterial and archaeal high-quality genomes. GToTree aims to give more researchers the capability to make phylogenomic trees.\\n\\nAvailabilityGToTree is open-source and freely available for download from: github.com/AstrobioMike/GToTree\\n\\nDocumentationgithub.com/AstrobioMike/GToTree/wiki\\n\\nImplementationGToTree is implemented primarily in bash, with helper scripts written in Python.\\n\\nContactMike.Lee@nasa.gov",

    "abstract": "Cytoskeletal filaments assemble into dense parallel, antiparallel or disordered networks, providing a complex environment for active cargo transport and positioning by molecular motors. The interplay between the network architecture and intrinsic motor properties clearly affects transport properties but remains poorly understood. Here, by using surface micro-patterns of actin polymerization, we investigate stochastic transport properties of colloidal beads in antiparallel networks of overlapping actin filaments. We found that 200-nm beads coated with myosin-Va motors displayed directed movements towards positions where the net polarity of the actin network vanished, accumulating there. The bead distribution was dictated by the spatial profiles of local bead velocity and diffusion coefficient, indicating that a diffusion-drift process was at work. Remarkably, beads coated with heavy mero-myosin-II motors showed a similar behavior. However, although velocity gradients were steeper with myosin II, the much larger bead diffusion observed with this motor resulted in less precise positioning. Our observations are well described by a three-state model, in which active beads locally sense the net polarity of the network by frequently detaching from and reattaching to the filaments. A stochastic sequence of processive runs and diffusive searches results in a biased random walk. The precision of bead positioning is set by the gradient of net actin polarity in the network and by the run length of the cargo in an attached state. Our results unveiled physical rules for cargo transport and positioning in networks of mixed polarity.\\n\\nSignificance statementCellular functions rely on small groups of molecular motors to transport their cargoes throughout the cell along polar filaments of the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal filaments self-assemble into dense networks comprising intersections and filaments of mixed polarity, challenging directed motor-based transport. Using micro-patterns of actin polymerization in-vitro, we investigated stochastic transport of colloidal beads in antiparallel networks of overlapping actin filaments. We found that beads coated with myosin motors sensed the net polarity of the actin network, resulting in active bead positioning to regions of neutral polarity with a precision depending on the motor type. A theoretical description of our experimental results provides the key physical rules for cargo transport and positioning in filament networks of mixed polarity.",

    "abstract": "The performance of ultrasensitive LC-MS/MS methods, such as Single-Cell Proteomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), depends on multiple interdependent parameters. This interdependence makes it challenging to specifically pinpoint bottlenecks in the LC-MS/MS methods and approaches for resolving them. For example, low signal at MS2 level can be due to poor LC separation, ionization, apex targeting, ion transfer, or ion detection. We sought to specifically diagnose such bottlenecks by interactively visualizing data from all levels of bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis. Many search engines, such as MaxQuant, already provide such data, and we developed an open source platform for their interactive visualization and analysis: Data-driven Optimization of MS (DO-MS). We found that in many cases DO-MS not only specifically diagnosed bottlenecks but also enabled us to rationally optimize them. For example, we used DO-MS to diagnose poor sampling of the elution peak apex and to optimize it, which increased the efficiency of delivering ions for MS2 analysis by 370%. DO-MS is easy to install and use, and its GUI allows for interactive data subsetting and high-quality figure generation. The modular design of DO-MS facilitates customization and expansion.

Here, we report the natural loss of foot muscles in the bipedal jerboa, Jaculus jaculus. Although adults have no muscles in their feet, newborn animals have muscles that rapidly disappear soon after birth. We were surprised to find no evidence of apoptotic or necrotic cell death during stages of peak myofiber loss, countering well-supported assumptions of developmental tissue remodeling. We instead see hallmarks of muscle atrophy, including an ordered disassembly of the sarcomere associated with upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and Atrogin-1. We propose that the natural loss of muscle, which remodeled foot anatomy during evolution and development, involves cellular mechanisms that are typically associated with disease or injury.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish pectoral fin is an in vivo model for vertebrate limb formation, well suited to investigate the integration of molecular and cellular dynamics, the results of which translate into shaping the limb bud. We used the ratio between the lengths of the anterior-posterior (AP) and dorso-ventral (DV) axes as the descriptor of how fin shape changes over time. We showed that fin shape transitions from close to hemi-spherical (ratio 1. 36 {+/-} 0.11) to semi-ellipsoid (ratio 1.64 {+/-} 0.04) between 33 and 46 hours post fertilization (hpf). This shape transition coincided with the formation of a contractile \\\"actin belt\\\" at the distal rim of the fin bud along its AP axis. The actin belt emerged from a central position and expanded on both sides along the distal rim of the fin, thus marking the DV boundary between two rows of ectodermal cells. Formation of the actin belt depended on Rac protein activity, as suggested by FRET measurements using a Rac biosensor. 3D+time imaging of the developing fin in Rac-deficient embryos showed that anisotropic growth of the fin depends on the actin belt. Indeed, actin belt formation was dramatically reduced or even absent in the embryos without proper Rac activity. This correlated with isotropic growth of the fin bud from normal shape at 33 hpf to quasi hemispherical shape with AP/DV ratio ~1 13 hours later, without affecting cell number and overall bud volume. We propose that the formation of a contractile acto-myosin belt is essential to drive the pectoral fins early anisotropic growth.",

Although, it is known that hypoxia can alter chromatin, whether this is a direct effect on histone demethylases or due to hypoxia induced HIF-dependent transcriptional changes is not known. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and HIF-independent alteration to a variety of histone methylation marks. Genomic locations of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 following short hypoxia predict the hypoxia gene signature observed several hours later in cells.

The preprint considered the two possible methods in ITC:\n\n1/ the Multiple Injection Method (MIM) making use of short-time injections separated by sufficient time to allow the reaction to reach equilibrium before a new injection.\n\n2/ the Single Injection Method (SIM) making use of a slow continuous injection.\n\nThe first result mentioned is about a new equation linking the rate of heat evolution with the injected volume (equations 9 and 10). With this equation and with the hypothesis that there is always perfect mixing of the cell content it was concluded that an ideal titration curve (i.e. not affected by any external influence) for a simple reaction like A + B {rightleftarrows} C cannot change sign (section 3.2). This conclusion turns out to be incorrect when taking in consideration real conditions with imperfect mixing, particularly with MIM using injections often of very short duration, which prevents from reaching perfect mixing. The major problem is that this erroneous conclusion was accompanied with comparisons of the results from well-established programs, which led to the conclusion that these were in error on this point (section 3.6).\n\nI therefore felt necessary to withdraw this preprint to avoid casting doubts unduly on these programs used extensively.\n\nNote that many other aspects in this preprint remain correct (section 3.8). A new version of this work, limited to SIM and considering imperfect mixing, will be submitted for publication under the title: \"Isothermal titration calorimetry in the single-injection mode with imperfect mixing\".\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at dumasp@igbmc.fr or at p.dumas@unistra.fr\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n\nPhilippe Dumas\n\nNovember 6, 2021",

Tregs in human tumors span diverse transcriptional states distinct from those of peripheral Tregs, but their contribution to tumor development remains unknown. Here, we used single cell RNA-Seq to longitudinally profile conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconv) and Tregs in a genetic mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Tissue-infiltrating and peripheral CD4+ T cells differed, highlighting divergent pathways of activation during tumorigenesis. Longitudinal shifts in Treg heterogeneity suggested increased terminal differentiation and stabilization of an effector phenotype over time. In particular, effector Tregs had enhanced expression of the interleukin 33 receptor ST2. Treg-specific deletion of ST2 reduced effector Tregs, increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumors, and decreased tumor burden. Our study shows that ST2 plays a critical role in Treg-mediated immunosuppression in cancer, highlighting new potential paths for therapeutic intervention.",

However, how these proteins come together and interact during morphogenesis is not well understood. Here we show that in Drosophila cells, Cdc42 is active at the apical membrane and cell-cell contacts, and couples apical recruitment of Par6-aPKC and Crb to promote apical identify. This coupling depends on Cdc42 and aPKC binding to Par6, and is mediated by Par6 binding to Crb. Conversely, Crb promotes the apical retention of Par6-aPKC, and thus Cdc42-Par6-aPKC and Crb promote each others apical accumulation to specify the apical membrane and Zonula Adherens (ZA). Altogether, our work shows that epithelial morphogenesis relies on a two tiered-mechanism whereby Cdc42 coordinates Par-complex assembly and apical recruitment of Crb through Par6-aPKC.",

    "abstract": "As a first line of defence against the environment, the epidermis protect animals from infection and physical damage. In C. elegans, wounding the epidermal epithelium triggers both an immune reaction and a repair response. Exactly how these are controlled, and the degree to which they are inter-connected remains unclear. To address these questions, we established a simple system for simultaneously inflicting precise laser wounds and imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution. We show that in C. elegans, wounding provokes a rapid sealing of the plasma membrane, involving reorganisation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate domains. This is followed by a radial recruitment at the wound site of EBP-2/EB1, a protein that binds the plus ends of microtubules. EB1 recruitment is accompanied by a reorganisation of microtubules, required for the subsequent recruitment of actin and wound closure. It is also required for the directed trafficking towards the site of injury of the key signalling protein SNF-12. In the absence of SNF-12 recruitment, there is an abrogation of the immune response. Our results suggest that microtubule dynamics coordinate the cytoskeletal changes required for wound repair and the concomitant activation of the innate immune response.",

The egg midplane is demarcated by Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) localized on microtubule bundles between asters. Using an extract system and intact eggs we found that local kinase activity of the AURKB subunit of the CPC caused disassembly of F-actin and keratin between asters, and local softening of the cytoplasm as assayed by flow patterns. Beads coated with active CPC mimicked aster boundaries and caused AURKB-dependent disassembly of F-actin and keratin that propagated ~40 m without microtubules, and much farther with microtubules present, due to CPC auto-activation. We propose that active CPC at aster boundaries locally reduces cytoplasmic stiffness by disassembling actin and keratin networks. This may help sister centrosomes move apart after mitosis, prepare a soft path for furrow ingression and/or release G-actin to build the furrow cortex.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium (Clostridioides) difficile, a Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium is the leading single cause of nosocomial infections in the United States. A major risk factor for C. difficile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics as they increase susceptibility to CDI by altering the membership of the microbial community enabling colonization. The importance of the gut microbiota in providing protection from CDI is underscored by the reported 80-90% success rate of fecal microbial transplants in treating recurrent infection. Adaptive immunity, specifically humoral immunity, is also sufficient to protect from both acute and recurrent CDI. However, the role of the adaptive immune system in mediating clearance of C. difficile has yet to be resolved. Using murine models of CDI, we found that adaptive immunity is dispensable for clearance of C. difficile. However, Random Forest analysis using only 2 members of the resident bacterial community correctly identified animals that would go on to clear the infection with 66.7% accuracy. These findings indicate that the indigenous gut microbiota independent of adaptive immunity facilitates clearance of C. difficile from the murine gastrointestinal tract.\\n\\nImportanceC. difficile infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients in the United States. Currently the role of the adaptive immune response in modulating levels of C. difficile colonization is unresolved. This work suggests that the indigenous gut microbiota is a main factor that promotes clearance of C. difficile from the GI tract. Our results show that clearance of C. difficile can occur without contributions from the adaptive immune response. This study also has implications for the design of preclinical studies testing the efficacy of vaccines on clearance of bacterial pathogens as inherent differences in the baseline community structure of animals may bias findings.",

    "abstract": "The activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) experiences periodically changing nutrient and oxygen availability. Tetrasphaera is the most abundant genus in Danish WWTP and represent up to 20-30% of the activated sludge community based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, although it is in low abundance in the influent wastewater. Here we investigate how Tetrasphaera can successfully out-compete most other microorganisms in such highly dynamic ecosystems. To achive this, we analyze the physiological adaptations of the WWTP isolate T. elongata str. LP2 during an aerobic to anoxic shift by label-free quantitative proteomics and NMR-metabolomics. Escherichia coli was used as reference organism as it shares several metabolic capabilities and is regularly introduced to wastewater treatment plants, but without succeeding there. When compared to E. coli, only minor changes in the proteome of T. elongata were observed after the switch to anoxic conditions. This indicates that metabolic pathways for anaerobic energy harvest were already expressed during the aerobic growth. This allows continuous growth of Tetrasphaera immediately after the switch to anoxic conditions. Metabolomics furthermore revealed that the substrates provided were exploited far more efficiently by Tetrasphaera than by E. coli. These results suggest that T. elongata prosper in the dynamic WWTP environment due to adaptation to the changing environmental conditions.\n\nSignificance of the studyMembers of the genus Tetrasphaera are widely distributed and highly abundant in most well-operating WWTPs with EBPR configuration. However, despite their high abundance in situ, little is known about their physiology and ecological role. Although the importance of Tetrasphaera in engineered wastewater treatment systems is slowly being recognized, additional information is needed to understand the full extent of functions the microorganisms have in many of the essential biological processes in the WWTP. Such information may improve available process models and ultimately lead to better wastewater treatment as well as resource recovery. This study supplies proteomic and metabolomic data on the aerobic/anoxic adaptation of Tetrasphaera and provides a hypothesis on how Tetrasphaera might compete in dynamic engineered systems.",

    "abstract": "When producing a duration, for instance by pressing a key for one second, the brain relies on self-generated neuronal dynamics to monitor the \\\"flow of time\\\". Converging evidence has suggested that the brain can also monitor itself monitoring time. Here, we investigated which brain mechanisms support metacognitive inferences when self-generating timing behavior. Although studies have shown that participants can reliably detect temporal errors when generating a duration (Akdogan & Balci, 2017; Kononowicz et al., 2017), the neural bases underlying the evaluation and the monitoring of this self-generated temporal behavior are unknown. Theories of psychological time have also remained silent about such self-evaluation abilities. How are temporal errors inferred on the basis of purely internally driven brain dynamics without external reference for time? We contrasted the error-detection hypothesis, in which error-detection would result from the comparison of competing motor plans with the read-out hypothesis, in which errors would result from inferring the state of an internal code for motor timing. Human participants generated a time interval, and evaluated the magnitude of their timing (first and second order behavioral judgments, respectively) while being recorded with time-resolved neuroimaging. Focusing on the neural signatures following the termination of self-generated duration, we found several regions involved in performance monitoring, which displayed a linear association between the power of  (8-14 Hz) oscillations, and the duration of the produced interval. Altogether, our results support the read-out hypothesis and indicate that first-order signals may be integrated for the evaluation of self-generated behavior.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen typing on a keyboard, the brain estimates where the finger should land, but also when. The endogenous generation of the when in time is naturally accompanied by timing errors which, quite remarkably, participants can accurately rate as being too short or too long, and also by how much. Here, we explored the brain mechanisms supporting such temporal metacognitive inferences. For this, we contrasted two working hypotheses (error-detection vs. read-out), and showed that the pattern of evoked and oscillatory brain activity parsimoniously accounted best for a read-out mechanism. Our results suggest the existence of meta-representations of time estimates.",

We verified the latitudinal pattern in species richness of ascidians, finding that higher colonial-to-solitary species ratios occur in the tropics and subtropics. At the latitudinal region with the highest ratio, in south-eastern Brazil, we confirmed that colonial species dominate the space on artificial plates in two independent studies of five fouling communities. We manipulated settlement plates to measure effects of predation and competition on growth and survivorship of colonial vs. solitary ascidians. Eight ascidian species were subjected to a predation treatment, i.e. caged vs. exposed to predators, and a competition treatment, i.e. leaving vs. removing competitors, to assess main and interactive effects. Predation had a greater effect on growth and survivorship of colonial compared to solitary species, whereas competition did not show consistent patterns between the two life histories. We hypothesize that colonial ascidians dominate at this subtropical site despite being highly preyed upon because they regrow when partially consumed and can adjust in shape and space to grow into refuges. We contend that these means of avoiding mortality from predation can have large influences on the diversification patterns of colonial species at low latitudes, where predation intensity is greater.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic centromeric DNA is famously variable in evolution but currently, this cannot be reconciled with the conservation of eukaryotic centromere function. It seems likely that centromeric DNA from different organisms contains conserved functionally important features but the identity of these features is unknown. The point centromeres of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the regional centromeres of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are separated by 350 million years of evolution and are canonical examples of the paradoxical relationship1 between centromeric DNA sequence and function. We have established a centromere-replacement strategy in Schizosaccharomyces pombe in order to resolve this paradox experimentally. Centromere-replacement shows that an A+T rich bacterial DNA sequence has weak centromere function and that elements of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae centromere embedded in short sequences from the non-centromeric S. pombe wee1 gene function almost as well as native S. pombe centromeric DNA. These observations demonstrate that determinants of centromere function are held in common by the budding and fission yeasts and that A+T rich DNA is both necessary and sufficient for function in S. pombe. Given the evolutionary distance between these yeasts, it is likely that A+T rich DNA has centromere function in a wide variety of eukaryotes. Centromere-replacement uses unidirectional serine recombinases that work well in many organisms2 3 and our experimental strategy should allow this idea to be tested in other eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "TFIIIC is a multisubunit complex that recognizes promoter elements and recruits TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III. Human TFIIIC complex possess lysine acetyltransferase activity which is critical in relieving chromatin mediated repression for RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription; two subunits of the TFIIIC complex, TFIIIC110 and TFIIIC90, were shown to acetylate H3 in vitro. Here we show that the largest and DNA binding subunit of TFIIIC complex, TFIIIC220, possesses intrinsic lysine acetyltransferase activity and acetylates histone H3K18 residue. By employing homology search we have identified the potential catalytic domain of TFIIIC220 which efficiently acetylate core histones in vitro. Point mutations at the critical residues of the identified acetyltransferase domain drastically reduces the acetyltransferase activity. Significantly, knockdown of TFIIIC220 in HepG2 cell line dramatically reduces global H3K18 acetylation level suggesting that TFIIIC220 is a crucial KAT to maintain acetylation homeostasis in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is a complex and energy-demanding process requiring tight coordination of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal protein (RP) production. Alteration of any step in this process may impact growth by leading to proteotoxic stress. Although the transcription factor Hsf1 has emerged as a central regulator of proteostasis, how its activity is coordinated with ribosome biogenesis is unknown. Here we show that arrest of ribosome biogenesis in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae triggers rapid activation of a highly specific stress pathway that coordinately up-regulates Hsf1 target genes and down-regulates RP genes. Activation of Hsf1 target genes requires neo-synthesis of RPs, which accumulate in an insoluble fraction, leading to sequestration of the RP transcriptional activator Ifh1. Our data suggest that levels of newly-synthetized RPs, imported into the nucleus but not yet assembled into ribosomes, work to continuously balance Hsf1 and Ifh1 activity, thus guarding against proteotoxic stress during ribosome assembly.",

    "abstract": "Direction selective (DS) ganglion cells (GC) in the retina maintain their tuning across a broad range of light levels. Yet very different circuits can shape their responses from bright to dim light, and their respective contributions are difficult to tease apart. In particular, the contribution of the rod bipolar cell (RBC) primary pathway, a key player in dim light, is unclear. To understand its contribution to DSGC response, we designed an all-optical approach allowing precise manipulation of single retinal neurons. Our system activates single cells in the bipolar cell (BC) layer by two-photon (2P) temporally focused holographic illumination, while recording the activity in the ganglion cell layer by 2P Ca2 imaging. By doing so, we demonstrate that RBCs provide an asymmetric input to DSGCs, suggesting they contribute to their direction selectivity. Our results suggest that every circuit providing an input to direction selective cells can generate direction selectivity by itself. This hints at a general principle to achieve robust selectivity in sensory areas.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in regulating activities such as sleep, appetite, mood and substance abuse disorders; serotonin receptors 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR are active within pathways associated with substance abuse. It has been suggested that 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR may form a dimer that affects behavioral processes. Here we study the coevolution of residues in 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR to identify potential interactions between residues in both proteins. Coevolution studies can detect protein interactions, and since the thus uncovered interactions are subject to evolutionary pressure, they are likely functional. We assessed the significance of the 5-HT2AR/5-HT2CR interactions using randomized phylogenetic trees and found the interaction significant (p-value = 0.01). We also discuss how co-expression of the receptors suggests the predicted interaction is functional. Finally, we analyze how several single nucleotide polymorphisms for the 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR genes affect their interaction. Our findings are the first to characterize the binding interface of 5-HT2AR/5-HT2CR and indicate a correlation between this interface and location of SNPs in both proteins.",

    "abstract": "The success of cancer immunotherapy relies on the induction of an immunoprotective response targeting tumor antigens (TAs) presented by tumor cells on MHC class I molecules. Alternative translation events emerged as a rich source of TAs and generate the so-called Pioneer Translation Products (PTPs), which are peptides generated from unspliced mRNA. We demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that the splicing inhibitor isoginkgetin and a derived water-soluble and less toxic molecule, IP2, act at the production stage of the PTPs. We showed that IP2 increases PTP-derived antigen presentation in cancer cells in vitro and decreases tumor growth in vivo in an immune-dependent manner. Furthermore, IP2 treatment induces a long-lasting antitumor response. Finally, we observed that the epitope repertoire displayed on MHC-I molecules is altered upon treatment with IP2 with the modulation of pre-existing peptides and the emergence of novel antigens derived from both coding and allegedly non-coding sequences.\\n\\nSignificanceIP2 is a new efficient \\\"first in class\\\" immunomodulator of the MHC I presentation pathway. IP2 reduces the growth of sarcoma MCA205 and melanoma B16F10 tumors bearing the PTP-derived SL8 epitope and significantly extends mice survival. IP2 treatment reshape the cancer cell MHC-I immunopeptidome. These findings add to the understanding of the role of the splicing machinery in antigen production and presentation and identify the spliceosome as a druggable target to enhance cancer immunosurveillance.",

    "abstract": "The ability of lymphocytes to recirculate between blood and secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen is well established. Sheep have been used as an experimental system to study lymphocyte recirculation for decades and multiple studies exist documenting accumulation and loss of intravenously (i.v.) transferred lymphocytes in efferent lymph of various ovine LNs. Yet, surprisingly little work has been done to accurately quantify the dynamics of lymphocyte exit from the LNs and to estimate the average residence times of lymphocytes in ovine LNs. In this work we developed a series of mathematical models based on fundamental principles of lymphocyte recirculation in the body and specifically, on how lymphocytes enter and exit lymph nodes in non-inflammatory (resting) conditions. We fitted these models to data from several independent experiments. Our analysis suggested that in sheep, recirculating lymphocytes spend on average 3 hours in the spleen and 20 hours in skin or gut-draining LNs with a distribution of residence times in LNs following a skewed gamma (lognormal-like) distribution. The latter result is in contrast which recent suggestions that the distribution of residence times of naive T cells in murine LNs is exponential and that lymphocyte residence times depend on the LN type (e.g., gut- vs. skin-draining). Our mathematical models also suggested an explanation for a puzzling observation of the long-term persistence of i.v. transferred lymphocytes in the efferent lymph of the prescapular LN (pLN); the model predicted that this is a natural consequence of long-term persistence of the transferred lymphocytes in circulation. We also found that lymphocytes isolated from the skin-draining pLN have a two-fold increased entry rate into the pLN as opposed to the mesenteric (gut-draining) LN (mLN). Likewise, lymphocytes from mLN had a three-fold increased entry rate into the mLN as opposed to entry rate into pLN. Importantly, these cannulation data could not be explained by preferential retention of cells in LNs of origin. Taken together, our work illustrates the power of mathematical modeling in describing the kinetics of lymphocyte migration in sheep and provides quantitative estimates of lymphocyte residence times in ovine LNs.",

    "abstract": "The genus Shewanella comprises a group of marine-dwelling species with worldwide distribution. Several species are regarded as causative agents of food spoilage and opportunistic pathogens of human diseases. In this study, a standard multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on six protein-coding genes (gyrA, gyrB, infB, recN, rpoA and topA) was established as a rapid and accurate identification tool in fifty-nine type Shewanella strains. This method yielded sufficient resolving power in regard to enough informative sites, adequate sequence divergences and distinct interspecies branches. The stability of phylogenetic topology was supported by high bootstrap values and concordance with different methods. The reliability of the MLSA scheme was further validated by identical phylogenies and high correlations of genomes. The MLSA approach provided a robust system to exhibit evolutionary relationships in the Shewanella genus. The split network tree proposed twelve distinct monophyletic clades with identical G+C contents and high genetic similarities. Eighty-six tested strains were investigated to explore the population biology of the Shewanella genus in China. The most prevalent Shewanella species were Shewanella algae, Shewanella xiamenensis, Shewanella chilikensis, Shewanella indica, Shewanella seohaensis and Shewanella carassii. The strains frequently isolated from clinical and food samples highlighted the importance of increasing the surveillance of Shewanella species. Combined with the genetic, genomic and phenotypic analyses, Shewanella upenei should be considered a synonym of S. algae, and Shewanella pacifica should be reclassified as a synonym of Shewanella japonica.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe MLSA scheme based on six HKGs (gyrA, gyrB, infB, recN, rpoA and topA) is well established as a reliable tool for taxonomic, evolutionary and epidemiological analyses of the genus Shewanella in this study. The standard MLSA method allows researchers to make rapid, economical and precise identification of Shewanella strains. The robust phylogenetic network of MLSA provides profound insight into the evolutionary structure of the genus Shewanella. The population genetics of Shewanella species determined by the MLSA approach plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis and routine monitoring. Further studies on remaining species and genomic analysis will enhance a more comprehensive understanding of the microbial systematics, phylogenetic relationships and ecological status of the genus Shewanella.",
