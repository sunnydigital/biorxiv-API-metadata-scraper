    "abstract": "1.1.1 BackgroundMost healthcare data sources store information within their own unique schemas, making reliable and reproducible research challenging. Consequently, researchers have adopted various data models to improve the efficiency of research. Transforming and loading data into these models is a labor-intensive process that can alter the semantics of the original data. Therefore, we created a data model with a hierarchical structure that simplifies the transformation process and minimizes data alteration.\\n\\n1.2 MethodsThere were two design goals in constructing the tables and table relationships for the Generalized Data Model (GDM). The first was to focus on clinical codes in their original vocabularies to retain the original semantic representation of the data. The second was to retain hierarchical information present in the original data while retaining provenance. The model was tested by transforming synthetic Medicare data; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims; and electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We also tested a subsequent transformation from the GDM into the Sentinel data model.\\n\\n1.3 ResultsThe resulting data model contains 19 tables, with the Clinical Codes, Contexts, and Collections tables serving as the core of the model, and containing most of the clinical, provenance, and hierarchical information. In addition, a Mapping table allows users to apply an arbitrarily complex set of relationships among vocabulary elements to facilitate automated analyses.\\n\\n1.4 ConclusionsThe GDM offers researchers a simpler process for transforming data, clear data provenance, and a path for users to transform their data into other data models. The GDM is designed to retain hierarchical relationships among data elements as well as the original semantic representation of the data, ensuring consistency in protocol implementation as part of a complete data pipeline for researchers.",

    "abstract": "Biophysical aspects of in vivo tissue microenvironments include microscale mechanical properties, fibrillar alignment, and architecture or topography of the extracellular matrix (ECM). These aspects act in concert with chemical signals from a myriad of diverse ECM proteins to provide cues that drive cellular responses. Here, we used a bottom-up approach to build fibrillar architecture into 3D amorphous hydrogels using magnetic-field driven assembly of paramagnetic colloidal particles functionalized with three types of human ECM proteins found in vivo. We investigated if cells cultured in matrices comprised of fibrils of the same size and arranged in similar geometries will show similar behavior for each of the ECM proteins tested. We were able to resolve spatial heterogeneities in microscale mechanical properties near aligned fibers that were not observed in bulk tissue mechanics. We then used this platform to examine factors contributing to cell alignment in response to topographical cues in 3D laminin-rich matrices. Multiple human cell lines extended protrusions preferentially in directions parallel or perpendicular to aligned fibers independently of the ECM coating. Focal adhesion proteins, as measured by paxillin localization, were mainly diffuse in the cytoplasm, with few puncta localized at the protrusions. Integrin {beta}1 and fascin regulated protrusion extension but not protrusion alignment. Myosin II inhibition did not reduce observed protrusion length. Instead, cells with reduced myosin II activity generated protrusions in random orientations when cultured in hydrogels with aligned fibers. Similarly, myosin II dependence was observed in vivo, where cells no longer aligned along the abluminal surfaces of blood vessels upon treatment with blebbistatin. These data suggest that myosin II can regulate sensing of topography in 3D engineered matrices for both normal and transformed cells.",

    "abstract": "The nature of cortical plasticity in the course of learning is one of the most intriguing questions of the modern cognitive neuroscience. Aversive conditioning is a type of associative learning produced by continuous pairing of neutral and aversive stimuli. Aversive conditioning and electroencephalography together provide a good framework for expanding our knowledge about fast learning-related cortical changes. In our experiment we tested a novel paradigm to study associative learning where aversive conditioning was combined with passive oddball. We employed conditioned auditory neutral stimuli and unconditioned aversive electrical shocks and used time-frequency, connectivity and event-related potentials (ERP) analyses to explore their interaction. First, we observed changes in the cortical activity in the form of conditioning-induced multisensory integration. The integration manifested itself in (1) desynchronization of lower beta activity in the contralateral to expected electrical shocks hemisphere and (2) enhanced functional connectivity between auditory and somatosensory cortex in the gamma frequency band. Second, we found a larger amplitude of P3a and the late posterior positivity (LPP) components of ERP to conditioned stimuli, which may be related to increased attentional and emotional significance of these stimuli. Our results reproduced and extended previous findings about multisensory integration in classical conditioning and demonstrated the improved discriminability of ERP responses through incorporation of the oddball paradigm in associative learning.",

    "abstract": "Sorting spikes from extracellular recording into clusters associated with distinct single units (putative neurons) is a fundamental step in analyzing neuronal populations. Such spike sorting is intrinsically unsupervised, as the number of neurons are not known a priori. Therefor, any spike sorting is an unsupervised learning problem that requires either of the two approaches: specification of a fixed value c for the number of clusters to seek, or generation of candidate partitions for several possible values of c, followed by selection of a best candidate based on various post-clustering validation criteria. In this paper, we investigate the first approach and evaluate the utility of several methods for providing lower dimensional visualization of the cluster structure and on subsequent spike clustering. We also introduce a visualization technique called improved visual assessment of cluster tendency (iVAT) to estimate possible cluster structures in data without the need for dimensionality reduction. Experimental results are conducted on two datasets with ground truth labels. In data with a relatively small number of clusters, iVAT is beneficial in estimating the number of clusters to inform the initialization of clustering algorithms. With larger numbers of clusters, iVAT gives a useful estimate of the coarse cluster structure but sometimes fails to indicate the presumptive number of clusters. We show that noise associated with recording extracellular neuronal potentials can disrupt computational clustering schemes, highlighting the benefit of probabilistic clustering models. Our results show that t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) provides representations of the data that yield more accurate visualization of potential cluster structure to inform the clustering stage. Moreover, The clusters obtained using t-SNE features were more reliable than the clusters obtained using the other methods, which indicates that t-SNE can potentially be used for both visualization and to extract features to be used by any clustering algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium chelonae is a rapidly growing mycobacterium present in the environment. It is associated with skin and soft tissue infections including abscess, cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Other infections by this bacterium are post-operative/transplant-associated, catheter, prostheses and even concomitant to haemodialytic procedures. In this study, we employ a subtractive genomics approach to predict the potential therapeutic candidates, intended for experimental research against this bacterium. A computational workflow was devised and executed to procure core proteome targets essential to the pathogen but with no similarity to the human host. Initially, essential Mycobacterium chelonae proteins were predicted through homology searching of core proteome content from 19 different bacteria. Druggable proteins were then identified and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) was chosen as a case study from identified therapeutic targets, based on its important bifunctional role. Structure modeling was followed by virtual screening of phytochemicals (N > 10,000) against it. 4,4-[(1E)-5-hydroxy-4-(methoxymethyl)-1-pentene-1,5-diyl]diphenol, apigenin-7-O-beta-gluconopyranoside and methyl rosmarinate were screened as compounds having best potential for binding GlmU. Phytotherapy helps curb the menace of antibiotic resistance so treatment of Mycobacterium chelonae infection through this method is recommended.",

Herein, we develop and use microfluidic chips containing post arrays to induce microfluidic vortex shedding, or VS, for cell membrane poration that permits delivery of mRNA into primary human T lymphocytes. We demonstrate transfection with VS by delivery of a 996-nucleotide mRNA construct encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and assessed transfection efficiencies by quantifying levels of EGFP protein expression. We achieved high transfection efficiency (63.6 {+/-} 3.44% EGFP+ viable cells) with high cell viability (77.3 {+/-} 0.58%) and recovery (88.7 {+/-} 3.21%) in CD3+ T cells 19 hrs after VS processing. Importantly, we show that processing cells via VS does not negatively affect cell growth rates or alter cell states. We also demonstrate processing speeds of greater than 2.0 x 106 cells s-1 at volumes ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 milliliters. Altogether, these results highlight the use of VS as a rapid and gentle delivery method with promising potential to engineer primary human cells for research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "As a child matures, some brain circuits stabilize while others remain plastic. However, the literature on maturational changes in the brains capacity for experience-dependent plasticity is primarily based on experiments in animals that mature over dramatically different time-scales than humans. Moreover, while principles of plasticity for sensory and motor systems might be conserved across species, the myriad of late-developing and uniquely human cognitive functions such as literacy cannot be studied with animal models. Here we use an intensive reading intervention program, in combination with longitudinal diffusion MRI measurements in school-aged children with dyslexia, to investigate the sensitive period for white matter plasticity and literacy learning. We find that the intervention induces large-scale changes in white matter diffusion properties, and improvements in reading scores, but that the magnitude and time-course of plasticity does not depend on the subjects age. Thus, we conclude that, for the intensive, one-on-one reading intervention program employed here, if a sensitive period exists, it does not end before middle school.",

    "abstract": "Extrasynaptic actions of glutamate are limited by high-affinity transporters on perisynaptic astroglial processes (PAPs), which helps to maintain point-to-point transmission in excitatory circuits. Memory formation in the brain is associated with synaptic remodelling, but how this remodelling affects PAPs and therefore extrasynaptic glutamate actions is poorly understood. Here we used advanced imaging methods, in situ and in vivo, to find that a classical synaptic memory mechanism, long-term potentiation (LTP), triggers withdrawal of PAPs from potentiated synapses. Optical glutamate sensors combined with patch-clamp and 3D molecular localisation reveal that LTP induction thus prompts a spatial retreat of glial glutamate transporters, boosting glutamate spillover and NMDA receptor-mediated inter-synaptic cross-talk. The LTP-triggered PAP withdrawal involves NKCC1 transporters and the actin-controlling protein cofilin but does not depend on major Ca2+-dependent cascades in astrocytes. We have therefore uncovered a mechanism by which synaptic potentiation could alter signal handling by multiple nearby connections.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum and its relatives in the grass tribe Andropogoneae bear their flowers in pairs of spikelets, in which one spikelet (seed-bearing, or SS) of the pair produces a seed and the other is sterile or male (staminate). This division of function does not occur in other major cereals such as wheat or rice. Additionally, one bract of the seed-bearing spikelet often produces a long extension, the awn, which is in the same position as but independently derived from that of wheat and rice. The function of the sterile spikelet is unknown and that of the awn has not been tested in Andropogoneae. We used radioactive and stable isotopes of carbon, as well as RNA-seq of metabolically important enzymes to show that the sterile spikelet assimilates carbon, which is translocated to the largely heterotrophic SS, thereby functioning as a nurse tissue. The awn shows no evidence of photosynthesis. These results apply to distantly related species of Andropogoneae. Thus, the sterile spikelet, but not the awn, could affect yield in the cultivated species and fitness in the wild ones.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing is increasingly adopted in clinical settings to identify pathogen transmissions. Currently, such studies are performed largely retrospectively, but to be actionable they need to be carried out prospectively, in which samples are continuously added and compared to previous samples. To enable prospective pathogen comparison, genomic relatedness metrics based on single nucleotide differences must be consistent across time, efficient to compute and reliable for a large variety of samples. The choice of genomic regions to compare, i.e., the core genome, is critical to obtain a good metric.\\n\\nWe propose a novel core genome method that selects conserved sequences in the reference genome by comparing its k-mer content to that of publicly available genome assemblies. The conserved-sequence genome is sample set-independent, which enables prospective pathogen monitoring. Based on clinical data sets of 3436 S. aureus, 1362 K. pneumoniae and 348 E. faecium samples, we show that the conserved-sequence genome disambiguates same-patient samples better than a core genome consisting of conserved genes. The conserved-sequence genome confirms outbreak samples with high accuracy: in a set of 2335 S. aureus samples, it correctly identifies 44 out of 45 outbreak samples, whereas the conserved gene method confirms 38 out of 45 outbreak samples.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) mu suppression has commonly been studied as an index of MNN activity during execution and observation of hand and finger movements. However, in order to establish its role in higher order processes, such as recognising and sharing emotions, more research using social emotional stimuli is needed. The current study aims to contribute to our understanding of the sensitivity of mu suppression to facial expressions. Modulation of the mu and occipital alpha (8 - 13 Hz) rhythms was calculated in 22 participants while they observed dynamic video stimuli, including emotional (happy and sad) and neutral (mouth opening) facial expressions, and non-biological stimulus (kaleidoscope pattern). Across the four types of stimuli, only the neutral face was associated with a significantly stronger mu suppression than the non-biological stimulus. Occipital alpha suppression was significantly greater in the non-biological stimulus than all the face conditions. Source estimation (sLORETA) analysis comparing the neural sources of mu/alpha modulation between neutral face and non-biological stimulus showed more suppression in the central regions, including the supplementary motor and somatosensory areas, than the more posterior regions. EEG and source estimation results may indicate that reduced availability of emotional information in the neutral face condition requires more sensorimotor engagement in deciphering emotion-related information than the full-blown happy or sad expressions that are more readily recognised.",

We find the P74-26 capsid exhibits an overall architecture that is very similar to those of other tailed bacteriophages, allowing us to directly compare structures to derive the structural basis for enhanced stability. Our structure reveals  lasso-like interactions that appear to function like catch bonds. This architecture allows the capsid to expand during genome packaging, yet maintain structural stability. The P74-26 capsid has T=7 geometry despite being twice as large as mesophilic homologs. Capsid capacity is increased through a novel mechanism with a larger, flatter major capsid protein. Our results suggest that decreased icosahedral complexity (i.e. lower T number) leads to a more stable capsid assembly.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSuper-resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI) offers a simple and affordable alternative to other super-resolution (SR) imaging techniques. The theoretical resolution enhancement of SOFI scales linearly with the cumulants order, while imaging conditions are less phototoxic to living samples as compared to other SR methods. High order SOFI could, therefore, be a method of choice for dynamic live cell imaging. However, due to cusp-artifacts and to dynamic range expansion of pixel intensities, this promise has not been materialized as of yet. Here we investigated and compared high order moments vs. high order cumulants SOFI reconstructions. We demonstrate that even-order moments reconstructions are intrinsically free of cusp artifacts, allowing for a subsequent deconvolution operation to be performed, hence enhancing the resolution even further. High order moments reconstructions performance was examined for various (simulated) conditions and applied to (experimental) imaging of QD labeled microtubules in fixed cells, and actin stress fiber dynamics in live cells.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe introduce a novel animal model of somatosensory stimulation-induced reflex seizures which generates focal seizures without causing damage to the brain.\\n\\nMethodsSpecifically, we electrically stimulated digits or forepaws of adult rats sedated with dexmedetomidine while imaging cerebral blood volume and recording neurophysiological activity in cortical area S1FL. For the recordings, we either inserted a linear probe into the D3 digit representation or we performed surface electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings.\\n\\nResultsPeripheral stimulation of a digit or the forepaw elicited seizures that were followed by a refractory period with decreased neuronal activity, or another seizure or a normal response. LFP amplitudes in response to electrical pulses during the seizures (0.28 {+/-} 0.03 mV) were higher than during normal evoked responses (0.25 {+/-} 0.05 mV) and refractory periods (0.2 {+/-} 0.08 mV). Seizures generated during the stimulation period showed prolonged after-discharges that were sustained for 20.9{+/-}1.9 s following the cessation of the stimulus. High-frequency oscillations were observed prior to and during the seizures, with amplitudes higher than those associated with normal evoked responses. The seizures were initially focal. Optical imaging of the cerebral blood volume response showed that they propagated from the onset zone to adjacent cortical areas, beyond the S1FL representation of the stimulated digit or forepaw. The spatial extent during seizures was on average 1.74 times larger during the stimulation and 4.1 times following its cessation relative to normal evoked responses. Seizures were recorded not only by probes inserted into cortex but also with ECoG arrays (24.1{+/-}5.8 seizures per rat) placed over the dura matter, indicating that the seizures were not induced by damage caused by inserting the probes to cortex. Stimulation of the forepaw elicited more seizures (18.8{+/-}8.5 seizures per rat) than stimulation of a digit (1.7{+/-}0.7). Unlike rats sedated with dexmedetomidine, rats anesthetized with urethane showed no seizures, indicating that the seizures may depend on the use of the mild sedative dexmedetomidine.\\n\\nSignificanceOur proposed animal model generates seizures induced by electrical sensory stimulation free of artifacts and brain damage. It can be used for studying the mechanisms underlying the generation and propagation of reflex seizures and for evaluating antiepileptic drugs.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIPeripheral stimulation of the rat forepaw or digits induces seizures\\nC_LIO_LISeizures are evoked with no direct application of convulsants, electro-stimulation or damage to the brain\\nC_LIO_LISeizures are focal at onset, then spread beyond the spatial representation of the digit or forepaw\\nC_LIO_LISeizures persist following the cessation of the stimulus\\nC_LIO_LIProposed animal model may support the study of reflex seizures and improving therapeutic interventions\\nC_LI",

The TFIIH core complex is sufficient for its repair functions and harbors the XPB and XPD DNA-dependent ATPase/helicase subunits, which are affected by human disease mutations. Transcription initiation additionally requires the CdK activating kinase subcomplex. Previous structural work has provided only partial insight into the architecture of TFIIH and its interactions within transcription pre-initiation complexes. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, determined by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy at 3.7 [A] resolution. The structure uncovers the molecular basis of TFIIH assembly, revealing how the recruitment of XPB by p52 depends on a pseudo-symmetric dimer of homologous domains in these two proteins. The structure also suggests a function for p62 in the regulation of XPD, and allows the mapping of previously unresolved human disease mutations.",

    "abstract": "Somatosensory thalamocortical (TC) neurons from the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus are central components in the flow of sensory information between the periphery and the cerebral cortex, and participate in the dynamic regulation of thalamocortical states including wakefulness and sleep. This property is reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct firing modes, called tonic firing and low-threshold bursting. Although the general properties of TC neurons are known, we still lack a detailed characterization of their morphological and electrical properties in the VB thalamus. The aim of this study was to build biophysically-detailed models of VB TC neurons explicitly constrained with experimental data from rats. We recorded the electrical activity of VB neurons (N = 49) and reconstructed morphologies in 3D (N = 50) by applying standardized protocols. After identifying distinct electrical types, we used a multi-objective optimization to fit single neuron electrical models (e-models), which yielded multiple solutions consistent with the experimental data. The models were tested for generalization using electrical stimuli and neuron morphologies not used during fitting. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the e-models are robust to small parameter changes and that all the parameters were constrained by one or more features. The e-models, when tested in combination with different morphologies, showed that the electrical behavior is substantially preserved when changing dendritic structure and that the e-models were not overfit to a specific morphology. The models and their analysis show that automatic parameter search can be applied to capture complex firing behavior, such as co-existence of tonic firing and low-threshold bursting over a wide range of parameter sets and in combination with different neuron morphologies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThalamocortical neurons are one of the main components of the thalamocortical system, which are implicated in key functions including sensory transmission and the transition between brain states. These functions are reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct modes, called burst and tonic firing. Biophysically-detailed computational modeling of these cells can provide a tool to understand the role of these neurons within thalamocortical circuitry. We started by collecting single cell experimental data by applying standardized experimental procedures in brain slices of the rat. Prior work has demonstrated that biological constraints can be integrated using multi-objective optimization to build biologically realistic models of neuron. Here, we employ similar techniques as those previously employed, but extend them to capture the multiple firing modes of thalamic neurons. We compared the model results with additional experimental data test their generalization and quantitatively reject those that deviated significantly from the experimental variability. These models can be readily integrated in a data-driven pipeline to reconstruct and simulate circuit activity in the thalamocortical system.",

    "abstract": "Two-photon laser scanning microscopy, originally developed since 1990s1, has been widely applied for biomedical research in recent decades, particularly popular among neuroscientists for studying neural functions in vivo2. However, it is typically restricted to one imaging area that is orthogonal to the optical axis. Here, we demonstrate a novel multi-axis optical conjugation method that enables two-photon imaging at single-cell resolution simultaneously in multiple areas at different depths, each of which could have a view diameter of ~200 m and could be largely freely targeted within a zone up to 12-mm diameter. For example, we show simultaneous imaging of neuronal activities in the primary visual cortex (V1), the primary motor cortex (M1) and the hippocampal CA1 region of awake mice. This method can be readily implemented on a single conventional two-photon microscope to enable multi-area exploration of neuronal activities in vivo.",

In the phenome-wide association study, polygenic scores for MDD and loneliness were significantly associated with psychiatric and cardiac phenotypes. Targeted analyses of CAD in 3,893 cases and 4,197 controls in BioVU found odds ratios of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04-1.18; P=8.43x10-4) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.07-1.20; P=4.51x10-6) per 1-SD increase in the polygenic scores for MDD and loneliness, respectively. Comparable hazard ratios in ARIC were 1.07 (95% CI, 0.99-1.14; P=0.07) and 1.07 (1.01-1.15; P=0.03). Across both studies, the increased risk persisted in women after adjusting for multiple conventional risk factors, a polygenic score for CAD, and psychiatric symptoms (available in BioVU). Controlling for genetic risk factors shared between MDD and loneliness, the polygenic score for loneliness conditioned on MDD remained associated with CAD risk, but the polygenic score for MDD conditioned on loneliness did not.\\n\\nConclusions and RelevanceGenetic risk factors for MDD and loneliness act pleiotropically to increase CAD risk in women.

    "abstract": "Defecation in the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is a stereotyped sequence of effector responses that occur with a regular ultradian rhythm. Time intervals between repeated defecations of individual animals depend on body size, ranging from ~10 min in small larvae to ~1 hr in large adults. New features and corrections of previous reports of the gastrovascular system during and between defecations are described in detail by video microscopy. Contrary to the scientific literature, the defecating organ of the excretory complex is just one of the two anal canals which possesses the animals only anal pore. The anal pore is not visible as a permanent structure as depicted in textbooks, but appears at defecation and disappears afterward. DIC microscopy reveals that opening and closing of the anal pore resemble a reversible ring of tissue fusion between apposed endodermal and ectodermal layers at the aboral end. Mnemiopsis thus appears to have an intermittent anus and therefore an intermittent through-gut that reoccur at regular intervals. The temporality of a visible anal pore in Mnemiopsis is novel, and may shed light on the evolution of a permanent anus and through-gut in animals. In addition, mirror image dimorphism of the diagonal anal complex occurs in larval ctenophores but not in adults, indicating developmental flexibility in diagonal symmetry of the anal complex.",
