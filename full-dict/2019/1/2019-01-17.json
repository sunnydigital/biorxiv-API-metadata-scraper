    "abstract": "Sensitivity to temporal regularity (e.g., amplitude modulation) is crucial for speech perception. Degradation of the auditory periphery due to aging and hearing loss may lead to an increased response gain in auditory cortex, with potential consequences for the processing of temporal regularities. We used electroencephalography recorded from younger (18-33 years) and older (55-80 years) adults to investigate how aging affects neural gain and the neural sensitivity to amplitude modulation in sounds. Aging was associated with reduced adaptation in auditory cortex, suggesting an age-related gain increase. Consistently, neural synchronization in auditory cortex to a 4-Hz amplitude modulation of a narrow-band noise was enhanced in ~30% of older individuals. Despite enhanced responsivity in auditory cortex, sustained neural activity (likely involving auditory and higher-order brain regions) in response to amplitude modulation was absent in older people. Hence, aging may lead to an over-responsivity to amplitude modulation in auditory cortex, but to a diminished regularity representation in higher-order areas.",

    "abstract": "Plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria secret transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) into host cells, where they act as transcriptional activators on plant target genes to support bacterial virulence. TALEs have a unique modular DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats. Two amino acids within each tandem repeat, termed repeat-variable diresidues, bind to contiguous nucleotides on the DNA sequence and determine target specificity.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach for TALE target prediction to identify potential virulence targets. Our approach accounts for recent findings concerning TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths, and the flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. The computational model can account for dependencies between adjacent RVD positions. Model parameters are learned from the wealth of quantitative data that have been generated over the last years.\\n\\nWe benchmark the novel approach, termed PrediTALE, using RNA-seq data after Xanthomonas infection in rice, and find an overall improvement of prediction performance compared with previous approaches. Using PrediTALE, we are able to predict several novel putative virulence targets. However, we also observe that no target genes are predicted by any prediction tool for several TALEs, which we term orphan TALEs for this reason. We postulate that one explanation for orphan TALEs are incomplete gene annotations and, hence, propose to replace promoterome-wide by genome-wide scans for target boxes. We demonstrate that known targets from promoterome-wide scans may be recovered by genome-wide scans, whereas the latter, combined with RNA-seq data, are able to detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDiseases caused by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria are a serious threat for many important crop plants including rice. Efficiently protecting plants from these pathogens requires a deeper understanding of infection strategies. For many Xanthomonas strains, such infection strategies depend on a special class of effector proteins, termed transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs). TALEs may specifically activate genes of the host plant and, by this means, re-program the plant cell for the benefit of the pathogen. Target sequences and, consequently, target genes of a specific TALE may be predicted computationally from its amino acids. Here, we propose a novel approach for TALE target prediction that makes use of several insights into TALE biology but also of broad experimental data gained over the last years. We demonstrate that this approach yields a higher prediction accuracy than previous approaches. We further postulate that a strategy change from a restricted search only considering promoters of annotated genes to a broad genome-wide search is feasible and yields novel targets including previously neglected protein-coding genes but also non-coding RNAs of possibly regulatory function.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin undergoes drastic structural organization and epigenetic reprogramming during embryonic development. We present here a consistent view of the chromatin structural change, epigenetic reprogramming and the corresponding sequence dependence in both mouse and human embryo development. The two types of domains, identified earlier as forests and prairies, become spatially segregated during embryonic development, with the exception of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and implantation, at which notable domain mixing occurs. Structural segregation largely coincides with DNA methylation and gene expression changes. Genes located in mixed prairie domains show proliferation and ectoderm differentiation-related function in ZGA and implantation, respectively. Chromatin of ectoderm shows the weakest and endoderm the strongest domain segregation in germ layers. This chromatin structure difference between different germ layers generally enlarges in further differentiation. The systematic chromatin structure establishment and its sequence-based segregation strongly suggest DNA sequence as a possible driving force for the establishment of chromatin 3D structures which affect profoundly the expression profile. Other possible factors correlated with/influencing chromatin structures, including temperature, germ layers, and cell cycle, were discussed for an understanding of concerted chromatin structure and epigenetic changes in development.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are rapidly recruited to inflammatory sites where they coordinate their migration to form clusters, a process termed neutrophil swarming. The factors which modulate neutrophil swarming during its early stages are not fully understood, requiring the development of new in vivo models. Using transgenic zebrafish larvae to study endogenous neutrophil migration in a tissue damage model, we demonstrate that neutrophil swarming is a conserved process in zebrafish immunity, sharing essential features with mammalian systems. We show that neutrophil swarms initially develop around a pioneer neutrophil, in a three-phase sequence of events. By adopting a high-resolution confocal microscopy approach, we observed the release of cell fragments by early swarming neutrophils. We developed a neutrophil specific histone H2A transgenic reporter line TgBAC(mpx:GFP)i114;Tg(lyz:H2A-mCherry)sh530 to study neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and found that endogenous neutrophils recruited to sites of tissue damage released NETs at the start of the swarming process. The optical transparency achieved using the zebrafish model has provided some of the highest resolution imaging of NET release in vivo to date. Using a combination of transgenic reporter lines and DNA intercalating agents, we demonstrate that pioneer neutrophils release extracellular traps during the swarming response, suggesting that cell death signalling via NETosis might be important in driving the swarming response.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus and surrounding medial-temporal-lobe (MTL) structures are critical for both memory and spatial navigation, but we do not fully understand the neuronal representations used to support these behaviors. Much research has examined how the MTL neurally represents spatial information, such as with \\\"place cells\\\" that represent the current location or \\\"head-direction cells\\\" that code for the current heading. In addition to behaviors that require an animal to attend to the current spatial location, navigating to remote destinations is a common part of daily life. To examine the neural basis of these behaviors we recorded single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients playing Treasure Hunt, a virtual-reality spatial-memory task. By analyzing how the activity of these neurons related to behavior in Treasure Hunt, we found that the firing rates of many MTL neurons during navigation significantly changed depending on the position of the current spatial target. In addition, we observed neurons whose firing rates during navigation were tuned to specific heading directions in the environment, and others whose activity changed depending on the timing within the trial. By showing that neurons in our task represent remote locations rather than the subjects own position, our results suggest that the human MTL can represent remote spatial information according to task demands.",

    "abstract": "Many (re)emerging infectious diseases in humans arise from pathogen spillover from wildlife or livestock, and accurately predicting pathogen spillover is an important public health goal. In the Americas, yellow fever in humans primarily occurs following spillover from non-human primates via mosquitoes. Predicting yellow fever spillover can improve public health responses through vector control and mass vaccination. Here, we develop and test a mechanistic model of pathogen spillover to predict human risk for yellow fever in Brazil. Our environmental risk model, based on the ecology of mosquito vectors and non-human primate hosts, distinguished municipality-months with yellow fever spillover from 2001 to 2016 with high accuracy (AUC = 0.71). Incorporating hypothesized cyclical dynamics of infected primates improved accuracy (AUC = 0.79). Using boosted regression trees to identify gaps in the mechanistic model, we found that important predictors include current and lagged (mechanistic) environmental risk, vaccine coverage, population density, temperature, and precipitation. More broadly, we show that for a widespread human viral pathogen, the ecological interactions between environment, vectors, reservoir hosts, and humans can predict spillover with surprising accuracy, suggesting the potential to improve preventative action to reduce yellow fever spillover and prevent onward epidemics in humans.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements are abundant genetic components of eukaryotic genomes with important regulatory features affecting transcription, splicing, and recombination, among others. Here we demonstrate that the Murine Endogenous Retroviral Element (MuERV-L/MERVL) family of transposable elements drives the 3D reorganisation of the genome in the early mouse embryo. By generating Hi-C data in 2-cell-like cells, we show that MERLV elements promote the formation of insulating domain boundaries through-out the genome in vivo and in vitro. The formation of these boundaries is coupled to the upregulation of directional transcription from MERVL, which results in the activation of a subset of the gene expression programme of the 2-cell stage embryo. Domain boundaries in the 2-cell stage embryo are transient and can be remodelled without undergoing cell division. Remarkably, we find extensive inter-strain MERVL variation, suggesting multiple non-overlapping rounds of recent genome invasion and a high regulatory plasticity of genome organisation. Our results demonstrate that MERVL drive chromatin organisation during early embryonic development shedding light into how nuclear organisation emerges during zygotic genome activation in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Staphylococcus aureus is increasingly used as part of infection prevention practices, but most applications are focused on conserved core genomic regions due to limitations of short-read technologies. In this study we established a long-read technology-based WGS screening program of all first-episode MRSA blood infections at a major urban hospital. A survey of 132 MRSA genomes assembled from long reads revealed widespread gain/loss of accessory mobile genetic elements among established hospital- and community-associated lineages impacting >10% of each genome, and frequent megabase-scale inversions between endogenous prophages. We also characterized an outbreak of a CC5/ST105/USA100 clone among 3 adults and 18 infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) lasting 7 months. The pattern of changes among complete outbreak genomes provided full spatiotemporal resolution of its origins and progression, which was characterized by multiple sub-transmissions and likely precipitated by equipment sharing. Compared to other hospital strains, the outbreak strain carried distinct mutations and accessory genetic elements that impacted genes with roles in metabolism, resistance and persistence. This included a DNA-recognition domain recombination in the hsdS gene of a Type-I restriction-modification system that altered DNA methylation. RNA-Seq profiling showed that the (epi)genetic changes in the outbreak clone attenuated agr gene expression and upregulated genes involved in stress response and biofilm formation. Overall our findings demonstrate that long-read sequencing substantially improves our ability to characterize accessory genomic elements that impact MRSA virulence and persistence, and provides valuable information for infection control efforts.",

    "abstract": "Populations may genetically adapt to severe stress that would otherwise cause their extirpation. Recent theoretical work, combining stochastic demography with Fishers geometric model of adaptation, has shown how evolutionary rescue becomes unlikely beyond some critical intensity of stress. Increasing mutation rates may however allow adaptation to more intense stress, raising concerns about the effectiveness of treatments against pathogens. This previous work assumes that populations are rescued by the rise of a single resistance mutation. However, even in asexual organisms, rescue can also stem from the accumulation of multiple mutations in a single genome. Here, we extend previous work to study the rescue process in an asexual population where the mutation rate is sufficiently high so that such events may be common. We predict both the ultimate extinction probability of the population and the distribution of extinction times. We compare the accuracy of different approximations covering a large range of mutation rates. Moderate increase in mutation rates favors evolutionary rescue. However, larger increase leads to extinction by the accumulation of a large mutation load, a process called lethal mutagenesis. We discuss how these results could help design \\\"evolution-proof\\\" anti-pathogen treatments that even highly mutable strains could not overcome.",

Conversely, patients with bipolar disorder might smoke more (often) as a result of the psychiatric disorder. Research that investigates causality and the direction of the relationship between smoking and bipolar disorder has been lacking.\\n\\nObjectiveTo investigate the direction and causal nature of the relationship between smoking and bipolar disorder we conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study.\\n\\nData sourcesPublicly available summary statistics from genome-wide association studies on bipolar disorder, smoking initiation, smoking heaviness, smoking cessation and lifetime smoking (i.e., a compound measure of heaviness, duration and cessation). We applied multiple analytical methods with different, orthogonal assumptions to triangulate results, including inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger or Egger SIMEX, weighted median, weighted mode, and Steiger filtered analyses.\\n\\nResultsAcross different methods of MR, consistent evidence was found for a positive effect of smoking on the odds of bipolar disorder (smoking initiation ORIVW=1.46, 95% CI=1.28-1.66, P=1.44x10-8, lifetime smoking ORIVW=1.72, 95% CI=1.29-2.28, P=1.8x10-4). The MR analyses of the liability of bipolar disorder on smoking provided no clear evidence of a strong causal effect (smoking initiation betaIVW= -0.008, 95% CI= -0.026-0.009, P=0.35; P=0.94; smoking heaviness betaIVW=0.028, 95% CI= 0.003-0.053, P=2.9x10-2; smoking cessation ORIVW= 0.997, 95% CI= 0.981-1.014, P=0.74; lifetime smoking betaIVW= -0.001, 95%CI=-0.022-0.020, P=0.95).\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that smoking initiation and lifetime smoking are likely to be a causal risk factor for developing bipolar disorder.

    "abstract": "Running span can be performed by either passively listening to to-be-remembered items or actively updating the target set during presentation. This choice of strategy is influenced by the rate of presentation in the task. Previous research suggests that the active updating process is demanding and time-consuming. It is favored at relatively slow rates of presentation, while the passive strategy is more successful when applied at fast rates. In two experiments the time course of resource demand during task performance and its sensitivity to presentation rate was examined. We hypothesized that running span imposes a high cognitive load only when active updating is employed. Participants performed running span simultaneously with a spatial reaction time (RT) task, and RTs on the concurrent task were used to index the resource demands of the memory task. A slow-paced running span exhibited a large overall resource demand in comparison with the serial recall tasks (Experiment 1) and fast-paced running span (Experiment 2). This demand was observed from the position in the list from which participants are presumed to start updating, suggesting a cognitive shift to a demanding mode of updating. In addition, a demand burst was found approximately 1000ms following item onset at these later positions. These data establish that the process of active updating in running span task is slow and cognitively demanding and indicate that this limits its application during fast presentation rates.",

    "abstract": "Spores are the major infectious particle of the Gram-positive nosocomial pathogen, Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile, but the molecular details of how this organism forms these metabolically dormant cells remain poorly characterized. The composition of the spore coat in C. difficile differs markedly from that defined in the well-studied organism, Bacillus subtilis, with only 25% of the ~70 spore coat proteins being conserved between the two organisms, and only 2 of 9 coat assembly (morphogenetic) proteins defined in B. subtilis having homologs in C. difficile. We previously identified SipL as a clostridia-specific coat protein essential for functional spore formation. Heterologous expression analyses in E. coli revealed that SipL directly interacts with C. difficile SpoIVA, a coat morphogenetic protein conserved in all spore-forming organisms, through SipLs C-terminal LysM domain. In this study, we show that SpoIVA-SipL binding is essential for C. difficile spore formation and identify specific residues within the LysM domain that stabilize this interaction. Fluorescence microscopy analyses indicate that binding of SipLs LysM domain to SpoIVA is required for SipL to localize to the forespore, while SpoIVA requires SipL to promote encasement of SpoIVA around the forespore. Since we also show that clostridial LysM domains are functionally interchangeable at least in C. difficile, the basic mechanism for SipL-dependent assembly of clostridial spore coats may be conserved.\\n\\nImportanceThe metabolically dormant spore-form of the major nosocomial pathogen, Clostridioides difficile, is its major infectious particle. However, the mechanisms controlling the formation of these resistant cell types are not well understood, particularly with respect to its outermost layer, the spore coat. We previously identified two spore morphogenetic proteins in C. difficile: SpoIVA, which is conserved in all spore-forming organisms, and SipL, which is conserved only in the Clostridia. Both SpoIVA and SipL are essential for heat-resistant spore formation and directly interact through SipLs C-terminal LysM domain. In this study, we demonstrate that the LysM domain is critical for SipL and SpoIVA function, likely by helping recruit SipL to the forespore during spore morphogenesis. We further identified residues within the LysM domain that are important for binding SpoIVA and thus functional spore formation. These findings provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the assembly of infectious C. difficile spores.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant repair of DNA double-strand breaks can recombine distant pairs of chromosomal breakpoints. Such chromosomal rearrangements are a hallmark of ageing and compromise the structure and function of genomes. Rearrangements are challenging to detect in non-dividing cell populations, because they reflect individually rare, heterogeneous events. The genomic distribution of de novo rearrangements in non-dividing cells, and their dynamics during ageing, remain therefore poorly characterized. Studies of genomic instability during ageing have focussed on mitochondrial DNA, small genetic variants, or proliferating cells. To gain a better understanding of genome rearrangements during cellular ageing, we focused on a single diagnostic measure - DNA breakpoint junctions - allowing us to interrogate the changing genomic landscape in non-dividing cells of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Aberrant DNA junctions that accumulated with age were associated with microhomology sequences and R-loops. Global hotspots for age-associated breakpoint formation were evident near telomeric genes and linked to remote breakpoints on the same or different chromosomes, including the mitochondrial chromosome. An unexpected mechanism of genomic instability caused more local hotspots: age-associated reduction in an RNA-binding protein could trigger R-loop formation at target loci. This finding suggests that biological processes other than transcription or replication can drive genome rearrangements. Notably, we detected similar signatures of genome rearrangements that accumulated in old brain cells of humans. These findings provide insights into the unique patterns and potential mechanisms of genome rearrangements in non-dividing cells, which can be triggered by ageing-related changes in gene-regulatory proteins.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe pain threshold is traditionally conceptualised as a boundary that lies between painful and non-painful events, suggesting a reasonably stable relationship between stimulus and response. In two previous experiments, participants received laser stimuli of various intensities and rated each stimulus on the Sensation and Pain Rating Scale (SPARS), which includes ranges for rating painful and non-painful events and clearly defines the presumed boundary between them. In the second experiment, participants also provided ratings on the conventional 0-100 Numerical Rating Scale for pain (NRS) and a new rating scale for non-painful events. Those data showed the SPARS to have a curvilinear stimulus-response relationship, reflecting that several different intensities may be rated as painful and non-painful in different trials. This suggests that participants were uncertain about painfulness over a range of intensities and calls into question the idea of a boundary between non-painful and painful events. The current study aimed to determine the number of different stimulus intensities across which each participant provided  painful and  non-painful reports in different trials.\\n\\nMethodsWe undertook novel exploratory analyses on data from the aforementioned two experiments (n = 19, 11 female, 18-31 years old; n = 7, 5 female, 21-30 years old). We used the binomial test to formally determine the width of this  zone of uncertainty about painfulness, using ratings on the SPARS and the comparator scales, and data visualisation to assess whether trial-to-trial change in stimulus intensity influences ratings.\\n\\nResultsWe found that the width of the zone of uncertainty varied notably between individuals and that the zone was non-continuous for most participants. Plots of group-level data concealed the inter-individual variability apparent in the individual plots, but still showed a wide zone of uncertainty on both the SPARS and the NRS, but a narrow zone on the scale for non-painful events. There was no evidence that trial-to-trial change in stimulus intensity influenced ratings.\\n\\nConclusionsThe variability revealed by this study has important design implications for experiments that include initial calibration of repeatedly delivered stimuli. The variability also stands to inflate the size of sample that is required for adequate statistical powering of experiments, and provides rationale for the use of statistical approaches that account for individual variability in studies of pain. Finally, the high variability implies that, if experimental stimuli are to be used in clinical phenotyping, many trials may be required to obtain results that represent a single patients actual response profile.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) reveals pathological changes in widespread diseases such as Parkinsons disease, Multiple Sclerosis, or hepatic iron overload. QSM requires multiple processing steps after the acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phase measurements such as unwrapping, background field removal and the solution of an ill-posed field-to-source-inversion. Current techniques utilize iterative optimization procedures to solve the inversion and background field correction, which are computationally expensive and lead to suboptimal or over-regularized solutions requiring a careful choice of parameters that make a clinical application of QSM challenging. We have previously demonstrated that a deep convolutional neural network can invert the magnetic dipole kernel with a very efficient feed forward multiplication not requiring iterative optimization or the choice of regularization parameters. In this work, we extended this approach to remove background fields in QSM. The prototype method, called SHARQnet, was trained on simulated background fields and tested on 3T and 7T brain datasets. We show that SHARQnet outperforms current background field removal procedures and generalizes to a wide range of input data without requiring any parameter adjustments. In summary, we demonstrate that the solution of ill-posed problems in QSM can be achieved by learning the underlying physics causing the artifacts and removing them in an efficient and reliable manner and thereby will help to bring QSM towards clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Perivascular spaces (PVSs) are annular channels that surround arteries and carry cerebrospinal fluid into the brain, sweeping away metabolic waste. In vivo observations reveal that they are not concentric, circular annuli, however: the outer boundaries are often oblate, and the arteries that form the inner boundaries are often offset from the central axis. Here we show that the observed shapes of PVSs have lower hydraulic resistance than concentric, circular annuli of the same size, and therefore allow faster, more efficient flow of cerebrospinal fluid. To calculate hydraulic resistance, we parameterize PVS cross-sections as circles surrounded by ellipses, varying the radii of the circles, major and minor axes of the ellipses, and two-dimensional eccentricities of the circles with respect to the ellipses. For each shape, we solve the governing Navier-Stokes equation to determine the velocity profile for steady laminar flow and the corresponding hydraulic resistance. We find that the minimum hydraulic resistance (and therefore maximum flow rate) for a given PVS cross-sectional area occurs when the ellipse is elongated and intersects the circle, dividing the PVS into two lobes, as is common around pial arteries. We also find that if both the inner and outer boundaries are circular, the minimum hydraulic resistance occurs when the eccentricity is large, as is common around penetrating arteries. The circular, concentric annuli assumed in recent studies maximize hydraulic resistance and therefore minimize flow. Our parameterization can incorporate more realistic resistances into hydraulic network models of flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent experiments show that there is bulk flow of cerebrospinal fluid in brain perivascular spaces (PVSs) in the direction of the blood flow, driven by pulsations of arterial walls due to the heartbeat. Published hydraulic network models have argued against such a flow due to the purported high hydraulic resistance of the system. Here we show that these high resistances are due to misrepresentations of the size and shape of PVSs. We present an adjustable model PVS that can match closely the actual shapes observed in vivo and show that these shapes are often nearly optimal, in the sense of offering the least hydraulic resistance. This optimization may well represent an evolutionary adaptation that maximizes clearance of metabolic waste from the brain.",

We employed mutational analysis to demonstrate the two proteases, termed \\\"thetapain\\\" and \\\"iotapain\\\", undergo in trans self-maturation after lysine and/or arginine residues, as observed for other C11 proteases. We determined the structures of the active forms of thetapain and iotapain in complex with irreversible peptide inhibitors, Ac-VLTK-AOMK and biotin-VLTK-AOMK, respectively. Structural comparisons revealed key active-site interactions important for peptide recognition are more extensive for thetapain; however, both proteases employ a glutamate residue to preferentially bind small polar residues at the P2 position.

    "abstract": "Environmental factors interact with internal rules of population regulation, sometimes perturbing systems to alternate dynamics though changes in parameter values. Yet, pinpointing when such changes occur in naturally fluctuating populations is difficult. An algorithmic approach that can identify the timing and magnitude of parameter shifts would facilitate understanding of abrupt ecological transitions with potential to inform conservation and management of species.\\n\\nThe \\\"Dynamic Shift Detector\\\" is an algorithm to identify changes in parameter values governing temporal fluctuations in populations with nonlinear dynamics. The algorithm examines population time series data for the presence, location, and magnitude of parameter shifts. It uses an iterative approach to fitting subsets of time series data, then ranks the fit of break point combinations using model selection, assigning a relative weight to each break. We examined the performance of the Dynamic Shift Detector with simulations and two case studies. Under low environmental/sampling noise, the break point sets selected by the Dynamic Shift Detector contained the true simulated breaks with 70-100% accuracy. The weighting tool generally assigned breaks intentionally placed in simulated data (i.e., true breaks) with weights averaging >0.8 and those due to sampling error (i.e., erroneous breaks) with weights averaging <0.2. In our case study examining an invasion process, the algorithm identified shifts in population cycling associated with variations in resource availability. The shifts identified for the conservation case study highlight a decline process that generally coincided with changing management practices affecting the availability of hostplant resources.\\n\\nWhen interpreted in the context of species biology, the Dynamic Shift Detector algorithm can aid management decisions and identify critical time periods related to species dynamics. In an era of rapid global change, such tools can provide key insights into the conditions under which population parameters, and their corresponding dynamics, can shift.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPopulations naturally fluctuate in abundance, and the rules governing these fluctuations are a result of both internal (density dependent) and external (environmental) processes. For these reasons, pinpointing when changes in populations occur is difficult. In this study, we develop a novel break-point analysis tool for population time series data. Using a density dependent model to describe a populations underlying dynamic process, our tool iterates through all possible break point combinations (i.e., abrupt changes in parameter values) and applies information-theoretic decision tools (i.e. Akaikes Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes) to determine best fits. Here, we develop the approach, simulate data under a variety of conditions to demonstrate its utility, and apply the tool to two case studies: an invasion of multicolored Asian ladybeetle and declining monarch butterflies. The Dynamic Shift Detector algorithm identified parameter changes that correspond to known environmental change events in both case studies.",

At a larger scale, within ecological communities, there is diversity in species.

Here we study a three-species ecological module called apparent competition, in which the predator is evolving in a trait that determines its interaction with two prey species. Unlike previous studies on apparent competition, which employed evolutionary frameworks with greatly simplified genetics, we study a multilocus eco-evolutionary model in which the predators evolving trait is determined by two diallelic loci. We ask how eco-evolutionary feedbacks with these two loci affect the coexistence of the prey species and the maintenance of polymorphisms within the predator species. In doing so, we uncover a novel eco-evolutionary feedback between the prey species and the linkage disequilibrium of the two loci of the predator. Through a stability analysis, we demonstrate how these feedbacks affect polymorphisms at both loci and, among others, may generate stable cycling.",

However, the molecular mechanism in kenaf is poorly known. In present work, we described the mitochondrial genome in isonuclear CMS line UG93A and its maintainer line UG93B. Findings of the current study revealed that a total of 398 SNPs and 230 InDels were identified in UG93A mtDNA. Total of 26 SNPs variations and three InDels were identified in the coding region of atp6, indicating its active role in mitochondrial genome re-arrangement. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcripts of atp1, atp4, atp6, cox3 and sdh4 in F1 were consistent with UG93A but different for UG93B. The transcript of atp9 was found similar between UG93B and F1 while different for UG93A, which depict that atp9 may be regulated by nuclear genes in F1 hybrid. The expression of atp9 in UG93A was substantially lower compared with UG93B, suggesting its key role for energy supplying in microspore development of kenaf. Circularized RNA (CR)-RT-PCR revealed that mitochondrial RNAs with heterogeneous 5-ends but uniform 3 - ends are common feature in kenaf mitochondrial genes, and the promoter architecture analysis showed that the promoter sequences in kenaf mitochondrial genome are highly diverged in comparison to those in other plants. Our data highlight that the translation of mitochondrial genes in kenaf is closely associated with heterogeneity of the 5-end of plant mRNA. The present result provides the basic information in understanding the transcription of kenaf mitochondrial genome and can be used as reference in other plants.",

    "abstract": "Thermal reaction norms pervade organismal traits as stereotyped responses to temperature, a fundamental environmental input into sensory and physiological systems. Locomotory behavior represents an especially plastic read-out of animal response, with its dynamic dependence on environmental stimuli presenting a challenge for analysis and for understanding the genomic architecture of heritable variation. Here we characterize behavioral reaction norms as thermal performance curves for the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae, using a collection of 23 wild isolate genotypes and 153 recombinant inbred lines to quantify the extent of genetic and plastic variation in locomotory behavior to temperature changes. By reducing the dimensionality of the multivariate phenotypic response with a function-valued trait framework, we identified genetically distinct behavioral modules that contribute to the heritable variation in the emergent overall behavioral thermal performance curve. Quantitative trait locus mapping isolated regions on Chromosome II associated with locomotory activity at benign temperatures and Chromosome V loci related to distinct aspects of sensitivity to high temperatures, with each quantitative trait locus explaining up to 28% of trait variation. These findings highlight how behavioral responses to environmental inputs as thermal reaction norms can evolve through independent changes to genetically distinct modular components of such complex phenotypes.\\n\\nArticle SummaryPlastic responses to environmental inputs, reaction norm phenotypes that can be summarized with parameters of fits to a mathematical function, are pervasive across diverse organismal traits and crucial to organismal fitness. We quantified the nematode Caenorhabditis briggsaes behavioral thermal performance curves as function-valued traits for 23 wild isolate genotypes and 153 recombinant inbred lines. We identified quantitative trait loci on multiple chromosomes that define genetically distinct behavioral modules contributing to the emergent overall behavioral thermal performance curve.

    "abstract": "Findings of neuroimaging and brain stimulation research suggest that the motor system takes part in phonological processing at least to some extent in healthy speakers. Phonological processing involves a core network of brain regions, the dorsal pathway, where motoric aspects of speech sounds are analysed by the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and auditory aspects by the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG). The extent to which each node of the dorsal pathway takes part in phonological processing has been shown to depend on the nature of the task and on the functional integrity of the network. Tasks of speech production rely more on the LIFG, and tasks of speech perception rely more on the LSTG. Persons with dyslexia (PWD) are known to present a deficit in phonological processing. Neuroimaging research has shown that dyslexia typically affects the LSTG, with hypoactivation, and the LIFG, with hyperactivation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely used for cognitive research in humans. It has been recently suggested in the literature that perturbations induced by brain stimulation can cause the weights of nodes in cognitive networks to transiently rearrange. In this study we used tDCS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the functioning of the dorsal pathway for phonological processing in PWD with tasks of speech production and speech perception. We targeted the LIFG with anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS. For healthy speakers, cathodal tDCS should downregulate performance when the target had high relevance for the task, such as the LIFG for speech production. For targets of smaller relevance, improved performance should be observed due to compensation by the most relevant node(s). Anodal tDCS should improve performance as a function of the relevance of the target for the task. PWD were expected to deviate from this pattern to some extent, especially when compensation by the LSTG was needed during cathodal tDCS of the LIFG for a task of speech perception. Results corroborated the theoretical claim that codes for articulation take part in the processing of speech sounds. However, our findings showed that the PWD pattern of response to tDCS for phonological processing in tasks of speech production and speech perception differed from that expected for healthy speakers. Anodal tDCS of the LIFG induced larger facilitation for the speech perception than for the speech production task, as well as larger compensation for the latter under cathodal tDCS.

Here, we combined exercise in humans and mice with fluorescent dyes, genetically-encoded biosensors, and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) loss-of-function models to demonstrate that NOX2 is the main source of cytosolic ROS during moderate-intensity exercise in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, two NOX2 loss-of-function mouse models lacking either p47phox or Rac1 presented striking phenotypic similarities, including greatly reduced exercise-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation.

    "abstract": "The design of increasingly complex gene regulatory networks relies upon mathematical modelling to link the gap that goes from conceptualisation to implementation. An overarching challenge is to update modelling abstractions and assumptions as new mechanistic information arises. Although models of bacterial gene regulation are often based on the assumption that the role played by intracellular physical distances between genetic elements is negligible, it has been shown that bacteria are highly ordered organisms, compartmentalizing their vital functions in both time and space. Here, we analysed the dynamical properties of regulatory interactions by explicitly modelling spatial constraints. Key to the model is the combined search by a regulator for its target promoter via 1D sliding along the chromosome and 3D diffusion through the cytoplasm. Moreover, this search was coupled to gene expression dynamics, with special attention to transcription factor-promoter interplay. As a result, promoter activity within the model depends on its physical separation from the regulator source. Simulations showed that by modulating the distance between DNA components in the chromosome, output levels changed accordingly. Finally, previous experimental results with engineered bacteria in which this distance was minimized or enlarged were successfully reproduced by the model. This suggests that the spatial specification of the circuit alone can be exploited as a design parameter to select programmable output levels.",

Despite its importance, only a few studies have successfully isolated the environmental factors driving local adaptation in nature. In this study, we evaluated the agents of selection responsible local adaptation of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus to coastal and inland habitats in California. We implemented a manipulative field reciprocal transplant experiment at coastal and inland sites, where we excluded aboveground stressors in an effort to elucidate their role in the evolution of local adaptation. We found that excluding these stressors, most likely a combination of salt spray and herbivory, completely rescued inland plant fitness when transplanted to coastal habitat. In contrast, the exclosures in inland habitat provided limited fitness benefit for either coastal or inland plants. We have previously established that low soil water availability belowground is the most important agent of selection in inland habitat. Therefore, our study demonstrates that a distinct set of selective agents are responsible for local adaptation at opposite ends of an environmental gradient.",

By integrating de novo transcriptome assembly and Ribo-Seq, we confidently annotate thousands of novel translated smORFs in three human cell lines. We find that smORF translation prediction is noisier than for annotated coding sequences, underscoring the importance of analyzing multiple experiments and footprinting conditions. These smORFs are located within non-coding and antisense transcripts, the UTRs of mRNAs, and unannotated transcripts. Analysis of RNA levels and translation efficiency during cellular stress identifies regulated smORFs, providing an approach to select smORFs for further investigation. Sequence conservation and signatures of positive selection indicate that encoded microproteins are likely functional. Additionally, proteomics data from enriched human leukocyte antigen complexes validates the translation of hundreds of smORFs and positions them as a source of novel antigens.

    "abstract": "Courtship is pivotal for successful mating. However, courtship is challenging for the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex, comprised of opportunistic fungal pathogens, as the majority of isolates are  mating type. In the absence of mating partners of the opposite mating type, C. deneoformans can undergo unisexual reproduction, during which a yeast-to-hyphal morphological transition occurs. Hyphal growth during unisexual reproduction is a quantitative trait, which reflects a strains ability to undergo unisexual reproduction. In this study, we determined whether unisexual reproduction confers an ecological benefit by promoting foraging for mating partners. Through competitive mating assays using strains with different abilities to produce hyphae, we showed that unisexual reproduction potential did not enhance competition for mating partners of the same mating type, but when cells of the opposite mating type were present, cells with enhanced hyphal growth were more competitive for mating partners of either the same or opposite mating type. Enhanced mating competition was also observed in a strain with increased hyphal production that lacks the mating repressor gene GPA3, which contributes to the pheromone response. Hyphal growth in unisexual strains also enables contact between adjacent colonies and enhances mating efficiency during mating confrontation assays. The pheromone response pathway activation positively correlated with unisexual reproduction hyphal growth during bisexual mating and exogenous pheromone promoted bisexual cell fusion. Despite the benefit in competing for mating partners, unisexual reproduction conferred a fitness cost. Taken together, these findings suggest C. deneoformans employs hyphal growth to facilitate contact between colonies at long distances and utilizes pheromone sensing to enhance mating competition.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySexual reproduction plays a pivotal role in shaping fungal population structure and diversity in nature. The global human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans species complex evolved distinct sexual cycles: bisexual reproduction between mating partners of the opposite mating types, and unisexual reproduction with only one mating type. During both sexual cycles, cells undergo a yeast-to-hyphal morphological transition and nuclei diploidize through either cell-cell fusion followed by nuclear fusion during bisexual reproduction or endoreplication during unisexual reproduction. Despite the complex sexual life cycle, the majority of Cryptococcal isolates are  mating type. Albeit the scarcity of MATa cells in the environment, meiotic recombination is prevalent. To decipher this conundrum, we ask whether there is an underlying mechanism in which Cryptococcus species increase their mating opportunities. In this study, we showed that the undirected hyphal growth during unisexual reproduction enables MAT cells to forage for mating partners over a larger surface area, and when MAT hyphae come into close proximity of rare MATa cells, pheromone response pathway activation in both MAT and MATa cells can further enhance mating. This mating enhancement could promote outcrossing and facilitate genome reshuffling via meiotic recombination.",

We characterized the translatome of resistant murine \\\"4T1\\\" breast cancer cells infected with three of the most clinically advanced oncolytic viruses: Herpes Simplex virus 1, Reovirus and Vaccinia virus. Common among all three infections were translationally de-repressed mRNAs involved in ciliary homeostasis including Inpp5e, encoding an inositol 5-phosphatase that modifies lipid second messenger signalling. Translationally repressed in the uninfected condition, viral infection induced expression of an Inpp5e mRNA variant that lacks repressive upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within its 5 leader and is consequently efficiently translated. Furthermore, we show that INPP5E contributes to antiviral immunity by altering virus attachment. These findings uncover a role for translational control through alternative 5 leader expression and assign ciliary proteins such as INPP5E to the cellular antiviral response.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that causes invasive pulmonary infections in patients with structural lung disease. Mab is intrinsically resistant to several classes of antibiotics and an increasing number of strains isolated from patients exhibit resistance to most antibiotics considered for treatment of Mab infections. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new regimens with improved efficacy to treat this disease. Synthesis of the essential cell wall peptidoglycan in Mab is achieved via two enzyme classes, L,D- and D-D-transpeptidases, with each class preferentially inhibited by different subclasses of {beta}-lactam antibiotics. We hypothesized that a combination of two {beta}-lactams that comprehensively inhibit the two enzyme classes will exhibit synergy in killing Mab. Paired combinations of antibiotics tested for in vitro synergy against Mab included dual {beta}-lactams, a {beta}-lactam and a {beta}-lactamase inhibitor, and a {beta}-lactam and a rifamycin. Of the initial 206 combinations screened, 24 pairs exhibited synergy. 13/24 pairs were combinations of two {beta}-lactams. 12/24 pairs brought the minimum inhibitory concentrations of both drugs to within the therapeutic range. Additionally, synergistic drug pairs significantly reduced the frequency of selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. These novel combinations of currently-available antibiotics may offer viable immediate treatment options against highly-resistant Mab infections.",

    "abstract": "Many neurons receive synchronous input from heterogeneous presynaptic neurons with distinct properties. An instructive example is the crustacean stomatogastric pyloric circuit pacemaker group, consisting of the anterior burster (AB) and pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, which are active synchronously and exert a combined synaptic action on most pyloric follower neurons. Although the stomatogastric system of the crab Cancer borealis has become a preferred model system for exploration of cellular and synaptic basis of circuit dynamics, in this species, the identity of the PD neuron neurotransmitter and its contribution to the total pacemaker group synaptic output remain unexplored. We examined the synaptic properties of the crab PD neuron using a combination of single cell mRNA analysis, electrophysiology and pharmacology. The crab PD neuron expresses high levels of choline acetyltransferase and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter mRNAs, hallmarks of cholinergic neurons. Conversely, the AB neuron does not express either of these cholinergic markers, and expresses high levels of vesicular glutamate transporter mRNA, consistent with a glutamatergic phenotype. Notably, in the combined synapses to the LP and PY neurons, the major contribution is from the glutamatergic AB neuron and only between 25-30% of the synaptic strength is due to the PD neuron. However, there was no difference between the short-term synaptic plasticity in the total pacemaker synapse compared to that of the PD neuron alone. These findings provide a guide for similar explorations of heterogeneous synaptic connections in other systems and a baseline in this system for the exploration of the differential influence of neuromodulators.",

    "abstract": "Mature plants can detect and respond to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) by priming or directly activating defenses against future herbivores. Whether other plant life stages can respond to HIPVs in similar manners is poorly understood. For example, seeds are known to respond to a variety of environment cues that are essential for proper germination timing and survival. Seeds may also be exposed to HIPVs prior to germination, and such exposure may affect the growth, development, and defense profiles when the seeds grow into mature plants. Here, we investigated the effect of seed exposure to common HIPVs on growth, reproduction and defense characteristics in the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula. Of all the HIPVs tested, indole specifically reduced both beet armyworm growth on A. thaliana and pea 33 aphid fecundity on M. truncatula. Induction of defense genes was not affected by seed exposure to indole in either plant species, suggesting that seed priming operates independently of induced resistance. Moreover, neither species showed any negative effect of seed exposure to HIPVs on vegetative and reproductive growth. Rather, M. truncatula plants derived from seeds exposed to z-3-hexanol and z-3-hexenyl acetate grew faster and produced larger leaves compared to controls. Our results indicate that seeds are sensitive to specific HIPVs, which represents a novel ecological mechanism of plant-to-plant communication.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing enables the construction of trajectories describing the dynamic changes in gene expression underlying biological processes such as cell differentiation and development. The comparison of single-cell trajectories under two distinct conditions can illuminate the differences and similarities between the two and can thus be a powerful tool. Recently developed methods for the comparison of trajectories rely on the concept of dynamic time warping (dtw), which was originally proposed for the comparison of two time series. Consequently, these methods are restricted to simple, linear trajectories. Here, we adopt and theoretically link arboreal matchings to dtw and propose an algorithm to compare complex trajectories that more realistically contain branching points that divert cells into different fates. We implement a suite of exact and heuristic algorithms suitable for the comparison of trajectories of different characteristics in our tool Trajan. Trajan automatically pairs similar biological processes between conditions and aligns them in a globally consistent manner. In an alignment of singlecell trajectories describing human muscle differentiation and myogenic reprogramming, Trajan identifies and aligns the core paths without prior information. From Trajans alignment, we are able to reproduce recently reported barriers to reprogramming. In a perturbation experiment, we demonstrate the benefits in terms of robustness and accuracy of our model which compares entire trajectories at once, as opposed to a pairwise application of dtw.

Its core complex consists of Par3, Par6, and aPKC. However, the dynamic processes that occur during polarization are not well understood. Here, we artificially reconstructed Par-dependent polarity using non-polarized Drosophila S2 cells expressing all three components endogenously in the cytoplasm. The results indicated that elevated Par3 expression induces cortical localization of the Par-complex at the interphase. Its asymmetric distribution goes through three steps: emergence of cortical dots, development of island-like structures with dynamic amorphous shapes, repeating fusion and fission, and polarized clustering of the islands. Our findings also showed that these islands contain a meshwork of unit-like segments. Par-complex patches resembling Par-islands exist in Drosophila mitotic neuroblasts. Thus, this reconstruction system provides an experimental paradigm to study features of the assembly process and structure of Par-dependent cell-autonomous polarity.",

Here, we present an analysis of chigger ecology for 38 species sampled from 11 provinces of Thailand and microbiomes for eight widespread species. In total, >16 000 individual chiggers were collected from 1 574 small mammal specimens belonging to 18 species across four horizontally-stratified habitat types. Chigger species richness was positively associated with higher latitudes, dry seasonal conditions, and host maturity; but negatively associated with increased human land use. Human scrub typhus incidence was found to be positively correlated with chigger species richness. The bacterial microbiome of chiggers was highly diverse, with Sphingobium, Mycobacterium, Neisseriaceae and various Bacillales representing the most abundant taxa. Only Leptotrombidium deliense was found to be infected with Orientia. {beta}-diversity, but not -diversity, was significantly different between chigger species and geographic regions, although not between habitat types. This first field survey of the chigger microbiome provides a framework for future studies on interactions between pathogens and other symbionts in these understudied vectors.",

In this study, two DNA sets consisting of 12 protein-coding mitochondrial genes from 254 individuals and RAG1 gene from 106 individuals were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships and calculate the divergence times among the subfamily schizothoracinae. Our results indicated that both of the data sets supported a non-monophyletic relationship due to involving of species of Barbinae. However, the phylogenetic relationships based on mtDNA genes were more reliable than that inferred from RAG1 gene. The highly specialized grade formed a monophyletic group, together with Ptychobarbus as a sister group of Diptychus and Gymnodiptychus, which was belonging to specialized grade, indicating that Ptychobarbus may be transition species to involve to highly specialized schizothoracianae. In addition, the primitive grade clustered with Percocypris pingi, a species of Barbinae. Based on mtDNA gene, the speciation time of Schizothoracinae was 66 Ma, and the divergence time of the primitive grade and Percocypris pingi was 64 Ma. The speciation times of the three grades Schizothoracinae were 57 Ma, 51 Ma and 43 Ma, respectively; and the divergence time of specialized and highly specialized grade was 46 Ma.

    "abstract": "Selection is the force behind differences in fitness, with extinction being the most extreme example of selection. Modern experiments and observations have shown that average fitness and selection strength can vary over time and space. This begs the question: as average fitness increases, does selection strength increase or decrease? The fossil record illustrates how extinction rates have varied through time, with periods of both rapid and slow species turnover. Using Paleozoic brachiopods as a study system, I developed a model to understand how the average taxon duration (i.e. fitness) varies over time, to estimate trait-based differences in taxon durations (i.e. selection), and to measure the amount of correlation between taxon fitness and selection. I find evidence for when extinction intensity increases, selection strength on geographic range also increases. I also find strong evidence for a non-linear relationship between environmental preference for epicontinental versus open-ocean environments and expected taxon duration, where taxa with intermediate preferences are expected to have greater durations than environmental specialists. Finally, I find that taxa which appear more frequently in epicontinental environments will have a greater expected duration than those taxa which prefer open-ocean environments. My analysis supports the conclusions that as extinction intensity increases and average fitness decreases, as happens during a mass extinction, the trait-associated differences in fitness would increase. In contrast, during periods of low extinction intensity when fitness is greater than average, my model predicts that selection associated with geographic range and environmental preference would decrease and be less than average.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOur ability to investigate processes shaping the evolutionary diversification of corals (Cnidaria: Anthozoa) is limited by a lack of understanding of species boundaries. Discerning species has been challenging due to a multitude of factors, including homoplasious and plastic morphological characters and the use of molecular markers that are either not informative or have not completely sorted. Hybridization can also blur species boundaries by leading to incongruence between morphology and genetics. We used traditional DNA barcoding and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing combined with coalescence-based and allele-frequency methods to elucidate species boundaries and simultaneously examine the potential role of hybridization in a speciose genus of octocoral, Sinularia.\\n\\nResultsSpecies delimitations using two widely used DNA barcode markers, mtMutS and 28S rDNA, were incongruent with one another and with the morphospecies identifications, likely due to incomplete lineage sorting. In contrast, 12 of the 15 morphospecies examined formed well-supported monophyletic clades in both concatenated RAxML phylogenies and SNAPP species trees of >6,000 RADSeq loci. DAPC and Structure analyses also supported morphospecies assignments, but indicated the potential for two additional cryptic species. Three morphologically distinct species pairs could not, however, be distinguished genetically. ABBA-BABA tests demonstrated significant admixture between some of those species, suggesting that hybridization may confound species delimitation in Sinularia.\\n\\nConclusionsA genomic approach can help to guide species delimitation while simultaneously elucidating the processes generating diversity in corals. Results support the hypothesis that hybridization is an important mechanism in the evolution of Anthozoa, including octocorals, and future research should examine the contribution of this mechanism in generating diversity across the coral tree of life.",

When activated, the NLRP3 inflammasome of phagocytes releases inflammatory agents, their release resulting in the death of proximal cells.

Because crystalline particles are known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, to enhance -synuclein expression and aggregation in dopaminergic neurons and because their facets may mis-template adsorbed -synuclein, we probe here, by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), four human PD substantia nigra specimens for their crystalline particles. Samples weighing 5 mg of PD stages 1, 2, 4 and 5 were processed by proteolysis and centrifugation. TEM-grids were dipped in the centrifugate diluted to 1 mL and the dried films were searched for crystalline particles.

    "abstract": "Availability of extensive genetics data across multiple individuals and populations is driving the growing importance of graph based reference representations. Aligning sequences to graphs is a fundamental operation on several types of sequence graphs (variation graphs, assembly graphs, pan-genomes, etc.) and their biological applications. Though research on sequence to graph alignments is nascent, it can draw from related work on pattern matching in hypertext. In this paper, we study sequence to graph alignment problems under Hamming and edit distance models, and linear and affine gap penalty functions, for multiple variants of the problem that allow changes in query alone, graph alone, or in both. We prove that when changes are permitted in graphs either standalone or in conjunction with changes in the query, the sequence to graph alignment problem is [Formula]-complete under both Hamming and edit distance models for alphabets of size [&ge;] 2. For the case where only changes to the sequence are permitted, we present an O(|V| + m|E|) time algorithm, where m denotes the query size, and V and E denote the vertex and edge sets of the graph, respectively. Our result is generalizable to both linear and affine gap penalty functions, and improves upon the run-time complexity of existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClinical sequencing has traditionally focused on genomic DNA through the use of targeted panels and exome sequencing, rather than investigating the potential transcriptomic consequences of disease-associated variants. RNA sequencing has recently been shown to be an effective additional tool for identifying disease-causing variants. We here use targeted long-read genome and transcriptome sequencing to efficiently and economically identify molecular consequences of a rare, disease-associated variant in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\\n\\nMethods and ResultsOur study, which employed both Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencing, as well as two RNA targeting strategies, identified alternatively-spliced isoforms that resulted from a splice-site variant containing allele in HCM. These included a predicted in-frame exon-skipping event, as well as an abundance of additional isoforms with unexpected intron-inclusion, exon-extension, and pseudo-exon events. The use of long-read RNA sequencing allowed us to not only investigate full length alternatively-spliced transcripts but also to phase them back to the variant-containing allele.\\n\\nConclusionsWe suggest that targeted, long-read RNA sequencing in conjunction with genome sequencing may provide additional molecular evidence of disease for rare or de novo variants in cardiovascular disease, as well as providing new information about the consequence of these variants on downstream RNA and protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Mutation accumulation experiments followed by whole-genome sequencing have revealed that for several bacterial species the rate of base-pair substitutions is not constant across the chromosome but varies in a wave-like pattern symmetrical about the origin of replication. The experiments reported here demonstrate that in Escherichia coli several interacting factors determine the wave. Perturbing replication timing, progression, or the structure of the terminus disrupts the pattern. Biases in error-correction by proofreading and mismatch repair are major factors. The activities of the nucleoid binding proteins, HU and Fis, are important, suggesting that mutation rates increase when highly structured DNA is replicated. These factors should apply to most bacterial, and possibly eukaryotic, genomes, and imply that different areas of the genome evolve at different rates.",

    "abstract": "Stool contains DNA shed from cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and has great potential as a bio-specimen for non-invasive, nucleic acid-based detection of GI diseases. Whereas methods for studying faecal microbiome DNA are plentiful, there is a lack of well-characterised procedures for stabilisation, isolation, and quantitative analysis of faecal host DNA. We report an optimised pipeline for faecal host DNA analysis from the point-of-collection to droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) absolute quantification of host-specific gene targets. We evaluated multiple methods for preservation and isolation of host DNA from stool to identify the highest performing methods. To quantify host DNA even if present in partially degraded form, we developed sensitive, human-specific short-amplicon ddPCR assays targeting repetitive nuclear genomic elements (LINE-1) and mitochondrial genes. We validated the ability of these optimised methods to perform absolute quantification of host DNA in 200 stool DNA extracts from samples that were serially collected from three healthy individuals and three hospitalised patients. These specimens allowed assessment of host DNA day-to-day variability in stool specimens with widely varying physical characteristics (i.e., Bristol scores). We further extended this approach to mouse stool analysis, to enable faecal host DNA studies in animal disease models as well.",

    "abstract": "The integrity of the nuclear envelope membranes coupled to the diffusion barrier and selective transport properties of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are a prerequisite for the robust segregation of nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Recent work supports that mechanical membrane disruption or perturbation to NPC assembly can trigger an ESCRT-dependent surveillance system that seals nuclear envelope pores: how these pores are sensed and sealed remains to be fully defined. Here, we show that the principal components of the nuclear envelope surveillance system in yeast, which includes the ESCRT Chm7 and the integral inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein Heh1, are spatially segregated by the nuclear transport system. Specifically, at steady state Chm7 is actively restricted from the nucleus by Crm1/Xpo1. Consistent with the idea that it is the exposure of the INM that triggers surveillance, the expression of a transmembrane anchor and the winged helix domain of Heh1 is sufficient to recruit and activate Chm7 at a membrane interface. Correlative light electron tomography under conditions of Chm7 hyper-activation further show the formation of an elaborate network of fenestrated sheets at the INM and suggest ER-membrane delivery at sites of nuclear envelope herniation. Our data point to a model in which exposure of Chm7 to Heh1, driven by any perturbation in the nuclear envelope barrier would lead to local nuclear envelope remodeling to promote membrane sealing. Our findings have implications for disease mechanisms associated with defects in NPC assembly and nuclear envelope integrity.",
