    "abstract": "Although habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity, its genetic consequences are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we assess the genetic consequences of extreme habitat loss driven by mining in two endemic plants from Amazonian Savannas. Our analyses are the first to overcome major methodological limitations like the confounding effect of habitat fragmentation, historical processes underpinning genetic differentiation, time-lags between the onset of disturbances and genetic outcomes, and the need for large numbers of samples, genetic markers and replicated landscapes to ensure sufficient statistical power. We found that both species are remarkably resilient, as genetic diversity and gene flow patterns were unaffected by habitat loss. Our study unambiguously demonstrates that it is not possible to generalize about the genetic consequences of habitat loss, and imply that future conservation efforts need to consider species-specific genetic information.",

    "abstract": "Our modern understanding of adaptation by natural selection rests on assumptions about genes working together to produce organisms. However, there is considerable evidence for selfish genetic elements that distort the behaviour of individuals to increase their own transmission. How can we reconcile these opposing notions? We use a combination of population genetics, agent-based simulation, and game theory to model the evolution of both selfish genetic elements and genes that could suppress their distortion. We found that: (1) suppressor genes are more likely to be favoured when selfish genetic elements cause greater distortion; (2) selection on selfish genetic elements favours the evolution of greater distortion, making them more likely to be suppressed. We found these same results when examining an abstract model designed to illuminate the general principles, and models for three specific scenarios: an X chromosome driver, an imprinted gene, and a bacterial plasmid. Our results suggest that selection on selfish genetic elements will often drive coevolution with suppressors in a way that removes the impact of genetic conflict at the level of the individual.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. Previous large-scale genetic studies of MDD have explored genetic risk factors of MDD case-control status or aggregated sums of depressive symptoms, ignoring possible clinical or genetic heterogeneity.\n\nAimIn this study, we present the results of symptom-level genetic analyses and compare SNP-based heritability (h2 O_SCPCAPSNPC_SCPCAP) and genetic correlations across major depression symptoms. We further investigate genetic correlations with a range of psychiatric disorders and other associated traits. Methods: We have analysed data from the UK biobank and included 148,752 subjects of white British ancestry with genotype data who completed nine items of a self-rated measure of depression: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Genome-Wide Association analyses were conducted for nine symptoms and two composite measures. LD score regression analysis was used to calculate SNP-based heritability (h2 O_SCPCAPSNPC_SCPCAP) and genetic correlations (rg) across symptoms and to investigate genetic correlations with 25 external phenotypes. Confirmatory factor analyses were applied to test whether one, two, or three-factor models best fit the pattern of genetic correlations across the nine symptoms.\n\nResultsWe identified 9 novel genome-wide significant genomic loci, with no overlap in loci across depression symptoms. h2 O_SCPCAPSNPC_SCPCAP ranged from 3% (suicidal ideation) to 11% (fatigue). Genetic correlations range from 0.54 to 0.96 (all p < 1.39x10-3) with 30 of 36 correlations being significantly smaller than 1. A 3-factor model provided the best fit to the genetic correlation matrix, with factors representing \"psychological\", \"neurovegetative\", and \"psychomotor / concentration\" symptoms. The genetic correlations with external phenotypes showed large variation across the nine symptoms.\n\nDiscussionPatterns of h2 O_SCPCAPSNPC_SCPCAP and genetic correlations differed across the nine symptoms of depression. Our findings suggest that the large phenotypic heterogeneity observed for MDD is recapitulated at a genetic level. Future studies should investigate how genetic heterogeneity in MDD influences the efficacy of clinical interventions.",

The lack of robust small animal models has significantly hindered the understanding of norovirus biology and the development of effective therapeutics against HuNoV. Here we report that HuNoV GI and GII replicate to high titers in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae; replication peaks at day 2 post infection and is detectable for at least 6 days. HuNoV is detected in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, the intestine, liver and pancreas. Antiviral treatment reduces HuNoV replication by >2 log10, showing that this model is suited for antiviral studies. Downregulation of fucosyltransferase 8 (fut8) in the larvae reduces HuNoV replication, highlighting a common feature with infection in humans. Zebrafish larvae constitute a simple and robust replication model that will largely facilitate studies of HuNoV biology and the development of antiviral strategies.",

Despite the resemblance of the DMN with the unitary model of the limbic system, the anatomy and contribution of subcortical structures to the network may be underappreciated due to methods limitation. Here, we propose a new and more comprehensive neuroanatomical model of the DMN including the basal forebrain and anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei and cholinergic nuclei. This has been achieved by considering functional territories during interindividual brain alignment. Additionally, tractography of diffusion-weighted imaging was employed to explore the structural connectivity of the DMN and revealed that the thalamus and basal forebrain had high importance in term of values of node degree and centrality in the network. The contribution of these neurochemically diverse brain nuclei reconciles previous neuroimaging with neuropathological findings in diseased brain and offers the potential for identifying a conserved homologue of the DMN in other mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "The auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) is significantly reduced in schizophrenia. Notably, a similar MMN reduction can be achieved with NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. Both phenomena have been interpreted as reflecting an impairment of predictive coding or, more generally, the \"Bayesian brain\" notion that the brain continuously updates a hierarchical model to infer the causes of its sensory inputs. Specifically, predictive coding views perceptual inference as an NMDAR-dependent process of minimizing hierarchical precision-weighted prediction errors (PEs). Disturbances of this putative process play a key role in hierarchical Bayesian theories of schizophrenia.\n\nHere, we provide empirical evidence for this clinical theory, demonstrating the existence of multiple, hierarchically related PEs in a \"roving MMN\" paradigm. We applied a computational model, the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF), to single-trial EEG data from healthy volunteers that received the NMDAR antagonist S-ketamine in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject fashion. Using an unrestricted analysis of the entire time-sensor space, our computational trial-by-trial analysis indicated that low-level PEs (about stimulus transitions) are expressed early (102-207ms post-stimulus), while high-level PEs (about transition probability) are reflected by later components (152-199ms, 215-277ms) of single-trial responses. Furthermore, we find that ketamine significantly diminished the expression of high-level PE responses, implying that NMDAR antagonism disrupts inference on abstract statistical regularities.\n\nOur findings are consistent with long-standing notions that NMDAR dysfunction may cause positive symptoms in schizophrenia by impairing hierarchical Bayesian inference about the worlds statistical structure. Beyond their relevance for schizophrenia, our results illustrate the potential of computational single-trial analyses for assessing potential disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Humans and animals maintain accurate sound discrimination in the presence of loud sources of background noise. It is commonly assumed that this ability relies on the robustness of auditory cortex responses. However, no attempt has been made to characterize neural discrimination of sounds masked by noise at each stage of the auditory system and disentangle the sub-effects of noise, namely the distortion of temporal cues conveyed by modulations in instantaneous amplitude and frequency, and the introduction of randomness (stochastic fluctuations in amplitude). Here, we measured neural discrimination between communication sounds masked by steady noise in the cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, auditory thalamus, primary and secondary auditory cortex at several signal-to-noise ratios. Sound discrimination by neuronal populations markedly decreased in each auditory structure, but collicular and thalamic populations showed better performance than cortical populations at each signal-to-noise ratio. Comparison with neural responses to tone-vocoded sounds revealed that the reduction in neural discrimination caused by noise was mainly driven by the attenuation of slow amplitude modulation cues, with the exception of the cochlear nucleus that showed a dramatic drop in discrimination caused by the randomness of noise. These results shed new light on the specific contributions of subcortical structures to robust sound encoding, and demonstrate that neural discrimination in the presence of background noise is mainly determined by the distortion of the slow temporal cues conveyed by communication sounds.",

Also, ALA restored normal hepatic and renal histomorphology.\n\nConclusionIt is concluded that ALA therapy can ameliorate the negative effects of DM that affect the vital organs as the liver and kidney. Also ALA can reduce the occurrence of atherogensis by reducing the levels of bad cholesterol in the blood. ALA boosts the levels of testosterone so it augments the male sexual characters.",

Here, we show that strains of the fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae that are able to infect the same host plant harbour highly divergent LS effector repertoires. Our study outlines the variability within LS effector gene repertoires of V. dahliae strains, which may allow the various strains to be competitive in the co-evolution with their hosts.\n\nSummaryEffectors are proteins secreted by pathogens to support colonization of host plants, often by deregulating host immunity. Effector genes are often localized within dynamic lineage-specific (LS) genomic regions, allowing rapid evolution of effector catalogues. Such localization permits pathogens to be competitive in the co-evolutionary arms races with their hosts. For a broad host-range pathogen such as Verticillium dahliae it is unclear to what extent single members of their total effector repertoires contribute to disease development on multiple hosts. Here, we determined the core and LS effector repertoires of a collection of V. dahliae strains, as well as the ability of these strains to infect a range of plant species comprising tomato, cotton, Nicotiana benthamiana, Arabidopsis, and sunflower to assess whether the presence of particular LS effectors correlates with the ability to infect particular plant species. Surprisingly, we found that V. dahliae strains that are able to infect the same host plant harbor highly divergent LS effector repertoires. Furthermore, we observed differential V. dahliae core effector gene expression between host plants. Our data suggest that different V. dahliae lineages utilise divergent effector catalogs to colonize the same host plant, suggesting considerable redundancy among the activities of effector catalogs between lineages.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe principal objective of comparative genomics is inferring attributes of an unknown gene by comparing it with well-studied genes. In this regard, identifying orthologous genes plays a pivotal role as the orthologous genes remain less diverged in the course of evolution. However, identifying orthologous genes is often difficult, slow, and idiosyncratic, especially in the presence of multiplicity of domains in proteins, evolutionary dynamics (gene duplication, transfer, loss, introgression etc.), multiple paralogous genes, incomplete genome data, and for distantly related species where similarity is hard to recognize.\n\nMotivationAdvances in identifying orthologs have mostly been constrained to developing databases of genes or methods which involve computationally expensive BLAST search or constructing phylogenetic trees to infer orthologous relationships. These methods do not generally scale well and cannot analyze large amount of data from diverse organisms with high accuracy. Moreover, most of these methods involve manual parameter tuning, and hence are neither fully automated nor free from human bias.\n\nResultsWe present NORTH, a novel, automated, highly accurate and scalable machine learning based orhtologous gene clustering method. We have utilized the biological basis and intuition of orthologous genes and made an effort to incorporate appropriate ideas from machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). We have discovered that the BLAST search based protocols deeply resemble a \"text classification\" problem. Thus, we employ the robust bag-of-words model accompanied by a Naive Bayes classifier to cluster the orthologous genes. We studied 1,255,877 genes in the largest 250 ortholog clusters from the KEGG database, across 3,880 organisms comprising the six major groups of life, namely, Archaea, Bacteria, Animals, Fungi, Plants and Protists. Despite having more than a million of genes on distantly related species with acute data imbalance, NORTH is able to cluster them with 98.48% Precision, 98.43% Recall and 98.44% F1 score, showing that automatic orthologous gene clustering can be both highly accurate and scalable. NORTH is available as a web interface with a server side application, along with cross-platform native applications (available at https://nibtehaz.github.io/NORTH/) - allowing queries based on individual genes.",

However, this powerful technology is difficult to apply in diagnostic laboratories because of its computational and bioinformatic demands. We have developed DisCVR, which detects known human viruses in clinical samples by matching sample k-mers (22 nucleotide sequences) to k-mers from taxonomically labelled viral genomes. DisCVR was validated using published HTS data for 89 clinical samples from adults with upper respiratory tract infections. These samples had been tested for viruses metagenomically and also by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, which is the standard diagnostic method. DisCVR detected human viruses with high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (100%), and was able to detect mixed infections. Moreover, it produced results comparable to those in a published metagenomic analysis of 177 blood samples from patients in Nigeria. DisCVR has been designed as a user-friendly tool for detecting human viruses from HTS data using computers with limited RAM and processing power, and includes a graphical user interface to help users interpret and validate the output.

    "abstract": "Alterations of the retinoblastoma and/or the p53 signaling network are associated with specific cancers such as high-grade astrocytoma/glioblastoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), choroid plexus tumors and small-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (SC-PaNEC). However, the intricate functional compensation between RB1 and the related pocket proteins RBL1/p107 and RBL2/p130 in suppressing tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Here we performed lineage-restricted parallel inactivation of rb1 and rbl1 by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the true diploid Xenopus tropicalis to gain insight into these in vivo compensatory mechanisms. We show that while rb1 inactivation is sufficient to induce choroid plexus papilloma, combined rb1 and rbl1 inactivation is required and sufficient to drive SC-PaNEC, retinoblastoma and astrocytoma. Further, using a novel Li-Fraumeni syndrome-mimicking tp53 mutant X. tropicalis line, we demonstrate increased malignancy of retinoblastoma-mutant neural malignancies upon concomitant inactivation of tp53. Interestingly, although clinical SC-PaNEC samples are characterized by abnormal p53 expression or localization, in the current experimental models, the tp53 status had little effect on the establishment and growth of SC-PaNEC, but may rather be essential for maintaining chromosomal stability. SCLC was only rarely observed in our experimental set-up, indicating requirement of additional or alternative oncogenic insults. In conclusion, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delineate the tumor suppressor properties of Rbl1 and generate new insights in functional compensation within the retinoblastoma protein family in suppressing pancreatic and specific neural cancers.",

    "abstract": "Among mammals, the extent of placental invasion is correlated with vulnerability to malignancy. Animals with more invasive placentation (e.g. humans) are more vulnerable to malignancy, whereas animals with a non-invasive placenta (e.g. ruminants) are less likely to develop malignant cancer. To explain this correlation, we propose the hypothesis of Evolved Levels of Invasibility (ELI) positing that the permissiveness of stromal tissue to invasion is a unitary character affecting both placental and cancer invasion. We provide evidence for this hypothesis by contrasting invasion of human and bovine cancer and placental cells into a lawn of stromal cells from different species. We find that both bovine endometrial and skin fibroblasts are more resistant to invasion of placental and cancer cells than their human counterparts. Gene expression profiling identified genes with high expression in human but not bovine fibroblasts. Knocking down of a subset of them in human fibroblasts leads to significantly stronger resistance to cancer cell invasion. Comparative analysis of gene expression among mammals suggests that humans evolved higher vulnerability to malignancy than the eutherian ancestor, possibly as a correlate of more invasive placentation, and boroeutherians evolved to decrease stromal invasibility. Identifying the evolutionary determinants of stromal invasibility can provide significant insights to develop rational anti-metastatic therapeutics.",

Overexpression of C/EBP{delta} in different tumors as glioblastoma and breast cancer either promotes tumor progression or inhibits growth.

Further, our data supports a role for C/EBP{delta} as an early regulatory transcriptional factor that promotes a mesenchymal to epithelial (MET) phenotype by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating vimentin and N-cadherin in FTE cells. We demonstrate that overexpression of C/EBP{delta} in ovarian and breast cancer cell lines have consistent effects and phenotype as the FTE cells.

In tropical forests, a large percentage of seeds is dispersed by animals, and their foraging behaviour and movement patterns determine SDD.

    "abstract": "Experimental investigations into the rates and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations are fundamental for our understanding of the evolutionary process. To gain insights into the molecular and fitness consequences of spontaneous mutations, we conducted a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment at varying population sizes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, evolving 35 lines in parallel for 409 generations at three population sizes (N = 1, 10, 100 individuals). Here, we focus on nuclear SNPs and small indels under minimal influence of selection, as well as their accrual rates in larger populations under greater selection efficacy. The spontaneous rates of base substitutions and small indels are 1.84 x 10-9 substitutions and 6.84 x 10-10 changes /site/generation, respectively. Small indels exhibit a deletion-bias with deletions exceeding insertions by three-fold. Notably, there was no correlation between the frequency of base substitutions, nonsynonymous substitutions or small indels with population size. These results contrast with our previous analysis of mtDNA mutations and nuclear copy-number changes in these MA lines, and suggest that nuclear base substitutions and small indels are under less stringent purifying selection compared to the former mutational classes. A transition bias was observed in exons as was a near universal base substitution bias towards A/T. Strongly context-dependent base substitutions, where 5-T and 3-As increase the frequency of A/T [-&gt;] T/A transversions, especially at the boundaries of A or T homopolymeric runs, manifest as higher mutation rates in (i) introns and intergenic regions relative to exons, (ii) chromosomal cores versus arms and tips, and (iii) germline-expressed genes.",

    "abstract": "To increase statistical power to identify genes associated with complex traits, a number of transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods have been proposed using gene expression as a mediating trait linking genetic variations and diseases. These methods first predict expression levels based on inferred expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and then identify expression-mediated genetic effects on diseases by associating phenotypes with predicted expression levels. The success of these methods critically depends on the identification of eQTLs, which may not be functional in the corresponding tissue, due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the correlation of gene expression between tissues. Here, we introduce a new method called T-GEN (Transcriptome-mediated identification of disease-associated Gens with Epigenetic aNnotation) to identify disease-associated genes leveraging epigenetic information. Through prioritizing SNPs with tissue-specific epigenetic annotation, T-GEN can better identify SNPs that are both statistically predictive and biologically functional. We found that a significantly higher percentage (an increase of 18.7% to 47.2%) of eQTLs identified by T-GEN are inferred to be functional by ChromHMM and more are deleterious based on their Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores. Applying T-GEN to 207 complex traits, we were able to identify more trait-associated genes (ranging from 7.7 % to 102%) than those from existing methods. Among the identified genes associated with these traits, T-GEN can better identify genes with high (>0.99) pLI scores compared to other methods. When T-GEN was applied to late-onset Alzheimers disease, we identified 96 genes located at 15 loci, including two novel loci not implicated in previous GWAS. We further replicated 50 genes in an independent GWAS, including one of the two novel loci.\n\nAuthor summaryTWAS-like methods have been widely applied to understand disease etiology using eQTL data and GWAS results. However, it is still challenging to discriminate the true disease-associated genes from those in strong LD with true genes, which is largely due to the misidentification of eQTLs. Here we introduce a novel statistical method named T-GEN to identify disease-associated genes considering epigenetic information. Compared to current TWAS methods, T-GEN can not only identify eQTLs with higher CADD scores and function potentials in gene-expression imputation models, but also identify more disease-associated genes across 207 traits and more genes with high (>0.99) pLI scores. Applying T-GEN in late-onset Alzheimers disease identified 96 genes at 15 loci with two novel loci. Among 96 identified genes, 50 genes were further replicated in an independent GWAS.",

This is facilitated by the conduit network, a parenchymal tubular-like structure formed of bundles of aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrils ensheathed by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). LNs undergo 5-fold expansion with every adaptive immune response and yet these ECM-rich structures are not permanently damaged.

Here we show that the conduit structure is disrupted during acute LN expansion but FRC-FRC contacts remain intact.

ECM production by FRCs is regulated by the C-type lectin CLEC-2, expressed by dendritic cells (DCs), at transcriptional and secretory levels. Inflamed LNs maintain conduit size-exclusion, but flow becomes leaky, which allows soluble antigens to reach more antigen-presenting cells. We show how dynamic communication between peripheral tissues and LNs changes during immune responses, and describe a mechanism that enables LNs to prevent inflammation-induced fibrosis.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFRCs use polarized microtubule networks to guide matrix deposition\nC_LIO_LICLEC-2/PDPN controls matrix production at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels\nC_LIO_LIFRCs halt matrix production and decouple from conduits during acute LN expansion\nC_LIO_LIConduits leak soluble antigen during acute LN expansion\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Although there are many honey bee pathogens/parasites, it is still not understood how they change their gene expression to adapt to the host environment or how the host simultaneously responds to pathogen/parasite infection by modifying its own gene expression. Such interactions must lead to changes in the physiological states of both host and parasite. To address this question, we studied a trypanosomatid, Lotmaria passim, which can be cultured in medium and inhabit the honey bee hindgut. We found that L. passim dynamically modifies the expression of mRNAs associated with protein translation and the electron transport chain to adapt to the anaerobic and nutritionally poor honey bee hindgut at early stages of infection, and to become dormant at late stages of infection. Meanwhile, several genes are continuously up- or down-regulated during infection, including GP63 as well as genes coding for host cell signaling pathway modulators (up-regulated), and those involved in detoxification of radical oxygen species as well as flagellar formation (down-regulated). L. passim infection only slightly increases honey bee mortality and does not affect the number of microorganisms in the gut microbiota; but it induces honey bee innate immune response. Upon infection, the host appears to be in poor nutritional status, indicated by the increase in the levels of mRNAs for take-out and facilitated trehalose transporter and the decrease of vitellogenin mRNA level. Simultaneous gene expression profiling of L. passim and honey bee during infection provided insight into how both parasite and host modify their gene expressions. This study presents one of the best models to understand host-parasite interactions at the molecular and cellular levels in honey bee.",

    "abstract": "Heightened physiological responses to uncertainty are a common hallmark of anxiety disorders. Many separate studies have examined the relationship between individual differences in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and physiological responses to uncertainty during different contexts. Despite this, little is known about the extent to which physiological responses during different uncertain contexts covary within individuals based on IU. Anticipatory physiological responses to uncertainty were assessed in three different contexts (associative threat learning, basic threat uncertainty, decision-making) within the same sample (n = 45). During these tasks, behavioural responses (i.e. reaction times, choices), skin conductance and corrugator supercilli activity were recorded. In addition, self-reported IU and trait anxiety were measured. IU made different contributions to the physiological measures during each task. IU was found to modulate both skin conductance and corrugator supercilii activity for the associative threat learning and decision-making contexts. However, trait anxiety was found to modulate corrugator supercilii activity during the basic threat uncertainty context. Ultimately, this research helps us further tease apart the role of IU in different uncertain contexts, which will be relevant for future IU-related models of psychopathology.",

The Arabidopsis genome encodes six TIR1/AFB proteins representing three of the four clades that were established prior to angiosperm radiation. To determine the role of these proteins in plant development we performed an extensive genetic analysis involving the generation and characterization of all possible multiply mutant lines. We find that loss of all six TIR1/AFB proteins results in defects in embryogenesis as early as the 8-cell stage, and possibly earlier. Mutant embryos progress but exhibit frequent cell division errors followed by proliferation of the suspensor, and eventually seed abortion. Despite this dramatic phenotype, a single wild-type allele of TIR1 or AFB2 is sufficient to support growth throughout plant development. Further, gametophytic expression of the TIR1/AFB genes is not essential for development of the male or female gametophyte. Our analysis reveals extensive functional overlap between even the most distantly related TIR1/AFB genes except for AFB1. Surprisingly, the AFB1 protein has a specialized function in rapid auxin-dependent inhibition of root growth and early phase of root gravitropism. This activity may be related to a difference in subcellular localization compared to the other members of the family.",

To what extent the observed differences in cellular expression levels are persistent or transient is an intriguing question. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that resolves the expression variation into stable and unstable components. The difference between the expression means in two cohorts isolated from any cell population is shown to converge to an asymptotic value, with a characteristic time,{tau} T, that measures the timescale of the unstable dynamics. The asymptotic difference in the means, relative to the initial value, measures the stable proportion of the original population variance [Formula]. Empowered by this insight, we analysed the T-cell receptor (TCR) expression variation in CD4 T cells. About 70% of TCR expression variance is stable in a diverse polyclonal population, while over 80% of the variance in an isogenic TCR transgenic population is volatile. In both populations the TCR levels fluctuate with a characteristic time of 32 hours. This systematic characterisation of the expression variation dynamics, relying on time series of cohorts means, can be combined with technologies that measure gene or protein expression in single cells or in bulk.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions play a vital role in nearly all cellular functions. Hence, understanding their interaction patterns and three-dimensional structural conformations can provide crucial insights about various biological processes and underlying molecular mechanisms for many disease phenotypes. Cross-linking mass spectrometry has the unique capability to detect protein-protein interactions at a large scale along with spatial constraints between interaction partners. However, the current cross-link search algorithms follow an \"MS2-centric\" approach and, as a result, suffer from a high rate of mis-identified cross-links (~15%). We address this urgent problem, by designing a novel \"MS3-centric\" approach for cross-link identification and implemented it as a search engine called MaXLinker. MaXLinker significantly outperforms the current state of the art search engine with up to 18-fold lower false positive rate. Additionally, MaXLinker results in up to 31% more cross-links, demonstrating its superior sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we performed proteome-wide cross-linking mass spectrometry using K562 cells. Employing MaXLinker, we unveiled the most comprehensive set of 9,319 unique cross-links at 1% false discovery rate, comprising 8,051 intraprotein and 1,268 interprotein cross-links. Finally, we experimentally validated the quality of a large number of novel interactions identified in our study, providing a conclusive evidence for MaXLinkers robust performance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBreast cancer remains the most lethal type of cancer for women. A significant proportion of breast cancer cases are characterised by overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein (HER2). These cancers are commonly treated by Herceptin (Trastuzumab), but resistance to drug treatment frequently develops in tumour cells. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are thought to play a role in the mechanism of resistance, since some of them were reported to be overexpressed in tumours resistant to Herceptin.\n\nResultsWe used a systems biology approach to investigate how DUSP overexpression could favour cell proliferation and to predict how this mechanism could be reversed by targeted inhibition of selected DUSPs. We measured the expression of 20 DUSP genes in two breast cancer cell lines following long-term (6 months) exposure to Herceptin, after confirming that these cells had become resistant to the drug. We constructed several Boolean models including specific substrates of each DUSP, and showed that our models correctly account for resistance when overexpressed DUSPs were kept activated. We then simulated inhibition of both individual and combinations of DUSPs, and determined conditions under which the resistance could be reversed.\n\nConclusionsThese results show how a combination of experimental analysis and modelling help to understand cell survival mechanisms in breast cancer tumours, and crucially enable us to generate testable predictions potentially leading to new treatments of resistant tumours.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundArthropod eyes have diversified during evolution to serve multiple needs, such as finding mates, hunting prey, and navigating in complex surroundings under varying light conditions. This diversity is reflected in the optical apparatus, photoreceptors and neural circuits that underpin vision. While this diversity has been extensively documented, our ability to genetically manipulate the visual system to investigate its function is largely limited to a single species, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we describe the visual system of Parhyale hawaiensis, an amphipod crustacean for which we have established tailored genetic tools.\n\nResultsAdult Parhyale have apposition-type compound eyes made up of [~]50 ommatidia. Each ommatidium contains four photoreceptor cells with large rhabdomeres (R1-4), expected to be sensitive to the polarisation of light, and one photoreceptor cell with a smaller rhabdomere (R5). The two types of photoreceptors express different opsins, belonging to families with distinct wavelength sensitivities. Using the cis.-regulatory regions of opsin genes, we established transgenic reporters expressed in each photoreceptor cell type. Based on these reporters, we show that R1-4 and R5 photoreceptors extend axons to the first optic lobe neuropil, revealing striking differences compared with the photoreceptor projections found in related crustaceans and insects. Investigating visual function, we show that Parhyale has a positive phototactic response and is capable of adapting its eyes to different levels of light intensity.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that the visual system of Parhyale serves low-resolution visual tasks, such as orientation and navigation, based on broad gradients of light intensity and polarisation. Optic lobe structure and photoreceptor projections point to significant divergence from the conserved visual circuits found in other malacostracan crustaceans and insects, which could be associated with a shift to low-resolution vision. Our study provides the foundation for research in the visual system of this genetically tractable species.",

    "abstract": "All life exchanges molecules with its environment. While these metabolites are commonly measured in terrestrial and limnic ecosystems, the presence of salt in marine habitats has hampered quantitative analyses of the ocean metabolome. To overcome these limitations, we developed SeaMet, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method that detects hundreds of metabolites down to nano-molar concentrations in less than one milliliter of seawater. Using a set of metabolites dissolved in artificial seawater to benchmark our method, we show metabolite signal detection increased on average across ions by 324 fold in comparison to standard GC-MS methods. Our observed signal improvement occurred across tested metabolite classes and provides reproducible and quantifiable results. To showcase the capabilities of our method, we used SeaMet to explore the production and consumption of metabolites during culture of a heterotrophic bacteria that is widespread in the North Sea. Our approach revealed successional uptake of amino acids, while sugars were not consumed, and highlight the power of metabolomics in providing insights into nutrient uptake and energy conservation in marine microorganisms. We also applied SeaMet to explore the in situ metabolome of coral reef and mangrove sediment porewaters. Despite the fact that these ecosystems occur in nutrient-poor waters, we uncovered a remarkable diversity and abundance of sugars and fatty acids, compounds predicted to be rapidly consumed by marine microorganisms. Our method advances marine metabolomics by enabling the unbiased, and quantitative analysis of marine metabolites, and will help provide new insights into carbon cycle dynamics and ocean biogeochemistry.\n\nSignificanceMetabolites are the chemical currency of cellular metabolism across all domains of life. However, describing metabolites that occur in the oceans is lagging behind similar studies conducted on land. The central challenge in marine metabolomics is that salt prevents the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in seawater. We developed a method, SeaMet, that overcomes the limitations of salt on metabolite detection. SeaMet provides a time and cost efficient method, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, for the reproducible identification and quantification of a broad range of marine compounds. Considering the oceans contain the largest organic carbon pool on Earth, describing the marine metabolome is critical for understanding the drivers behind element cycles, biotic interactions, ecosystem function, and atmospheric CO2 storage.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate axon guidance is necessary to form accurate neuronal connections. Guidance cues stimulate reorganization of the cytoskeleton within the distal growth cone at the tip of the extending axon. Filopodia at the periphery of the growth cone have long been considered sensors for axon guidance cues, yet how they perceive and respond to extracellular cues remains ill-defined. Our previous work found that the filopodial actin polymerase VASP is regulated via TRIM9-dependent nondegradative ubiquitination, and that appropriate VASP ubiquitination and deubiquitination are required for axon turning in response to the guidance cue netrin-1. Here we show that the TRIM9-related protein TRIM67 antagonizes VASP ubiquitination by outcompeting the TRIM9:VASP interaction. This antagonistic role is required for netrin-1 dependent filopodial responses, axon turning and branching, and fiber tract formation. We suggest a novel model that coordinated regulation of nondegradative VASP ubiquitination by a pair of ligases is a critical element of axon guidance.",

    "abstract": "Appropriately defining and enumerating  fitness is fundamental to explaining and predicting evolutionary dynamics. Yet theoretical concepts of fitness are often hard to translate into quantities that can be quantified in wild populations experiencing complex environmental, demographic, genetic and selective variation. While the  fittest entities might be widely understood to be those that ultimately leave most descendants at some future time, such long-term legacies are hard to measure, impeding evaluation of how well more tractable short-term metrics of individual fitness directly predict longer-term outcomes. One opportunity for conceptual and empirical convergence stems from the principle of individual reproductive value (Vi), defined as the number of copies of each of an individuals alleles that is expected to be present in future generations given the individuals realised pedigree of descendants. Since Vi tightly predicts an individuals longer-term genetic contribution, quantifying Vi provides a tractable route to quantifying what, to date, has been an abstract fitness concept. We used complete pedigree data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to demonstrate that individuals expected genetic contributions stabilise within an observed 20-year time period, allowing individual Vi to be evaluated. Considerable among-individual variation in Vi was evident in both sexes. However, standard short-term metrics of individual fitness, comprising lifespan, lifetime reproductive success and projected growth rate, typically explained less than half the variation. Given these results, we discuss what evolutionary inferences can and cannot be directly drawn from short-term versus longer-term fitness metrics observed on individuals, and highlight that analyses of pedigree structure may provide useful complementary insights into evolutionary processes and outcomes.",

We analyzed 164,518 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences to quantify changes in genetic diversity between 1980-2016. We found temporal change in genetic diversity, with both increasing and decreasing trends observed. The magnitude and sign of human impacts on genetic diversity depended on scale and taxon. In contrast, latitude was a strong predictor of diversity in fish, insects, and mammals. Our analyses provide a first worldwide picture of human impacts on animal genetic diversity.

We analyzed the microbiome among fly populations that were sampled across Europe by the European Drosophila Population Genomics Consortium (DrosEU). We combined environmental data on climate and food-substrate, dense genomic data on host population structure, and microbiome profiling. Food-substrate, temperature, and host population-structure correlated with microbiome-structure. The microbes, whose abundance was co-structured with host populations, also differed in abundance between flies and their substrate in an independent survey, suggesting host-control. Patterns of enrichment and depletion of microbes between host and substrate were consistent with a model of host-control, where the host manipulates its microbiome for its benefit. Putative host-control was bacterial strain specific, supporting recent evidence for high specificity of D. melanogaster-microbe interaction.",

However, the mechanisms of maternal age effects are unknown, and it remains unclear if maternal age alters offspring response to therapeutic interventions to aging. Here, we evaluate maternal age effects on offspring lifespan, reproduction, and the response to caloric restriction, and investigate maternal investment as a source of maternal age effects using the rotifer, Brachionus manjavacas, an aquatic invertebrate. We found that offspring lifespan and fecundity decline with increasing maternal age. Caloric restriction increases lifespan in all offspring, but the magnitude of lifespan extension is greater in the offspring from older mothers. The trade-off between reproduction and lifespan extension under low food conditions expected by life history theory is observed in young-mother offspring, but not in old-mother offspring. Age-related changes in maternal resource allocation to reproduction do not drive changes in offspring fitness or plasticity under caloric restriction in B. manjavacas. Our results suggest that the declines in reproduction in old-mother offspring negate the evolutionary fitness benefits of lifespan extension under caloric restriction.",

We developed and trained a convolutional neural network with image datasets labeled from expert visual scores and used this  breeder-trained network to directly score wheat morphology and developmental stages. For both morphological (awned) and phenological (flowering time) traits, we demonstrate high heritability and extremely high accuracy against the  ground-truth values from visual scoring. Using the traits scored by the network, we tested genotype-to-phenotype association using the deep learning phenotypes and uncovered novel epistatic interactions for flowering time. Enabled by the time-series high-throughput phenotyping, we describe a new phenotype as the rate of flowering and show heritable genetic control.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated a field-based high-throughput phenotyping approach using deep learning that can directly score morphological and developmental phenotypes in genetic populations.

    "abstract": "Changes in the copy number of protein-coding genes would lead to detrimental effects if the consequent changes in protein concentration disrupt essential cellular functions. Large-scale genomic studies have identified thousands of dosage-sensitive genes in human genome. We are interested in the dosage-sensitivity of transcription factor (TF) genes whose products are essential for the growth, division and differentiation of cells by regulating the expression of the genetic information encoded in the genome. We first surveyed the enrichment of human TF genes in four recently curated datasets of dosage-sensitive genes, including the haploinsufficient genes identified by a large-scale genomic study, the haploinsufficient genes predicted by a machine learning approach, the genes with conserved copy number across mammals, and the ohnologs. Then we selected the dosage-sensitive genes that are present in all the four dataset and regarded them as the most reliable dosage-sensitive genes, and the genes that are absent from any one of the four datasets as the most reliable dosage-insensitive genes, and surveyed the enrichments of TFs genes in these two datasets. A large number of TF genes were found to be dosage-insensitive, which is beyond the expectation based on the role of TFs. In spite of this, the likeness of TF genes to be dosage-sensitive were supported by five datasets, with the conserved-copy-number genes as the exception. The nuclear receptors are the only one family of TFs whose dosage-sensitivity was consistently supported by all the six datasets. In addition, we found that TF families with very few members are also more likely to be dosage-sensitive while the largest TF family, C2H2-ZF, are most likely dosage-insensitive. The most extensively studied TFs, p53, are not special in dosage-sensitivity. They are significantly enriched in only three datasets. We also confirmed that dosage-sensitive genes generally have long coding sequences, high expression levels and experienced stronger selective pressure. Our results indicate some TFs function in a dose-dependent manner while some other not. Gene dosage changes in some TF families like nuclear receptor would result in disease phenotypes while the effects of such changes in some TFs like C2H2-ZF would be mild.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris is a recently described pathogenic fungus that is causing invasive outbreaks on all continents. The fungus is of high concern given the numbers of multidrug-resistant strains that have been isolated in distinct sites across the globe. The fact that its diagnosis is still problematic suggests that the spreading of the pathogen remains underestimated. Notably, the molecular mechanisms of virulence and antifungal resistance employed by this new species are largely unknown. In the present work, we compared two clinical isolates of C. auris with distinct drug susceptibility profiles and a Candida albicans reference strain using a multi-omics approach. Our results show that, despite the distinct drug-resistance profile, both C. auris strains appear to be very similar, albeit with a few notable differences. However, when compared to C. albicans both C. auris strains have major differences regarding their carbon utilization and downstream lipid and protein content, suggesting a multi-factorial mechanism of drug resistance. The molecular profile displayed by C. auris helps to explain the antifungal resistance and virulence phenotypes of this new emerging pathogen.\n\nImportanceCandida auris was firstly described in Japan in 2009 and has now been the cause of significant outbreaks across the globe. The high number of isolates that are resistant to one or more antifungals, as well as the high mortality rates from patients with bloodstream infections, has caught the attention of the medical mycology, infectious disease and public health communities to this pathogenic fungus. In the current work, we performed a broad multi-omics approach on two clinical isolates isolated in New York, the most affected area in the USA and found that the omic profile of C. auris differs significantly from C. albicans. Besides our insights into C. auris carbon utilization and lipid and protein content, we believe that the availability of these data will enhance our ability to combat this rapidly emerging pathogenic yeast.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWe studied the value of intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (iCEUS) for real-time monitoring of resection of cerebral gliomas, and analyzed the relationship between CEUS parameters and microvessel density (MVD) of different pathologic grades of cerebral gliomas.\n\nMaterials and MethodsICEUS was performed in 49 patients with cerebral gliomas. The enhancement characteristics of cerebral gliomas were observed before and after tumor resection. The number of microvessels was counted by immunostaining with anti-CD34. Differences in these quantitative parameters in cerebral gliomas were compared and subjected to a correlation analysis with MVD.\n\nResultsThe color Doppler flow classification within lesions were significantly different before and after iCEUS (p<0.05). The assessment of iCEUS parameters and tumor MVD showed that cerebral gliomas of different pathological grades had different characteristics. The time-to-peak (Tmax) was significantly shorter, the peak intensity (PI) and MVD were significantly higher in high-grade cerebral gliomas than in low-grade cerebral gliomas (p<0.05). According to the immunostaining, PI was positively (r=0.637) correlated with MVD and Tmax was negatively (r=-0.845) correlated with MVD.\n\nConclusionICEUS may determine the borders of lesions more clearly, indicate the microvascular perfusion in real time, and be helpful in understanding the cerebral gliomas grade.",

The second section focuses on their professional aspirations and institutional support provided. The third part describes the level of engagement of postdoctoral researchers and their institutions in working towards better research conditions and career development, and what initiatives are emerging within this community.\n\nOur Conclusions section pulls together this comprehensive analysis, highlighting some of the most concerning issues currently affecting postdoctoral researchers in Europe. We also make a number of recommendations that would significantly improve the career expectations and aspirations of postdoctoral researchers.

    "abstract": "Consistent codon usage patterns across species was supposed to be observed owing to the degeneracy of genetic code and the conservation of the translation machinery. In fact, however, codon usage vary dramatically among organisms, and the choice difference might also affect downstream protein expressions, structures as well as their functions. It is suggested that different codon usage patterns should encrypt distinct characters for a certain type of organism, and as a result, a series of machine-learning models have been constructed, not only for learning the patterns from certain species, but also for predicting the species based on given patterns. Two gene segments of influenza A virus, hemagglutinin (HA; gene 4) and neuraminidase (NA; gene 6), were so essential for the immune response of their hosts, that the serotypes of the viruses are named after their combinations. They thus become the objects of this study, and those proposed models work quite well on the designated tasks.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders affect nearly 50% of individuals who have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Anhedonia is a major symptom of numerous psychiatric disorders and is a diagnostic criterion for depression. Recently, anhedonia has been divided into consummatory, motivational and decisional components, all of which may be affected differently in disease. Although anhedonia is typically assessed using positive reinforcement, the importance of stress in psychopathology suggests the study of negative reinforcement (removal or avoidance of aversive events) may be equally important. The present study investigated positive and negative reinforcement following a rat model of mild TBI (mTBI) using lateral fluid percussion. Hedonic value of and motivation for reinforcement was determined by behavioral economic analyses. Following mTBI, the hedonic value of avoiding foot shock was reduced. In contrast, the hedonic value of escaping foot shock or obtaining a sucrose pellet was not altered by mTBI. Moreover, neither motivation to avoid or escape foot shock nor motivation to acquire sucrose was modified by mTBI. Our results suggest that individuals experiencing mTBI may experience more stress because of poor proactive control of stress resulting from reduced hedonic value of avoiding aversive events.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that post transcriptionally regulate gene expression and are involved in many biological processes including host-pathogen interactions. However, the potential role of miRNAs in the responses of eastern honeybees to Nosema ceranae invasion is completely unknown. Here, the expression profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) in the midguts of Apis cerana cerana workers 7 and 10 days post infection (dpi) with N. ceranae were investigated via small RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 529 miRNAs highly conserved between various species and 25 novel miRNAs with varied expressions were identified for the first time. In addition, stem-loop RT-PCR confirmed the expression of 16 predicted miRNAs, validating their existence. Eight up-regulated miRNAs and six down-regulated miRNAs were detected in midguts at 7 dpi, while nine and three miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in midguts at 10 dpi. In addition, Venn analysis showed that five DEmiRNAs were shared, while nine and seven DEmiRNAs were specifically expressed in midguts at 7 and 10 dpi, respectively. Gene ontology analysis suggested that a portion of the DEmiRNAs and corresponding target genes were involved in various biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions including immune system processes and response to stimulus and signaling. Moreover, KEGG pathway analysis shed light on the potential functions of some DEmiRNAs in the regulation of target genes engaged in material and energy metabolism, cellular immunity such as endocytosis and phagosome, and the humoral immune system, including the Jak-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways. Further investigation demonstrated a complex regulation network between DEmiRNAs and their target mRNAs, with miR-598-y, miR-252-y, miR-92-x and miR-3654-y at the center of the network, implying their key parts in host responses. This comprehensive miRNA transcriptome analysis demonstrated that N. ceranae invasion influenced the expression of miRNAs in the midguts of A. c. ceranae workers; the results can not only facilitate future exploration of the regulatory roles and mechanisms of miRNAs in hosts responses, especially their immune responses to N. ceranae, but also provide potential candidates for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying eastern honeybee-microsporidian interactions.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide bonds in proteins can strongly influence the folding pathways by constraining the conformational space. Hen egg white lysozyme has four disulfide bonds and is widely studied for its antibacterial properties. Experiments on lysozyme infer that the protein folds through a fast and a slow pathway. However, the reasons for the kinetic partitioning in the folding pathways are not completely clear. Using a coarse-grained protein model and simulations, we show that two out of the four disulfide bonds, which are present in the -domain of lysozyme, are responsible for the slow folding pathway. In this pathway, a kinetically trapped intermediate state, which is close to the native state is populated. In this state, the orientation of -helices present in the -domain are misaligned relative to each other. The protein in this state has to partially unfold by breaking down the inter-helical contacts between the misaligned helices to fold to the native state. However, the topological constraints due to the two disulfide bonds present in the -domain make the protein less flexible, and it is trapped in this conformation for hundreds of milliseconds. On disabling these disulfide bonds, we find that the kinetically trapped intermediate state and slow folding pathway disappear. Simulations mimicking the folding of protein without disulfide bonds in oxidative conditions show that the native disulfide bonds are formed as the protein folds indicating that folding guides the formation of disulfide bonds. The sequence of formation of the disulfide bonds is Cys64-Cys80 [-&gt;] Cys76-Cys94 [-&gt;] Cys30-Cys115 [-&gt;] Cys6-Cys127. Any disul-fide bond, which forms before its precursor in the sequence has to break and follow the sequence for the protein to fold. These results show that lysozyme also serves as a very good model system to probe the role of disulfide bonds and topological frustration in protein folding. The predictions from the simulations can be verified by single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or single molecule pulling experiments, which can probe heterogeneity in the folding pathways.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial inner membrane fusion is mediated by OPA1(optic atrophy 1). Under physiological condition, OPA1 undergoes proteolytic processing to form a membrane-anchored long isoform (LOPA1) and a soluble short isoform (SOPA1). A combination of LOPA1 and SOPA1 are required for membrane fusion, however, the relevant mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the cryo-EM structures of SOPA1 coated liposome tube at nucleotide-free and GTP{gamma}S bound states. SOPA1 exhibits a general structure of dynamin family and can assemble onto membrane in a helical array with a building block of dimer and thus induce membrane tubulation. A predicted amphipathic helix is discovered to mediate the tubulation activity of SOPA1. The binding of GTP{gamma}S causes a conformational rotation between GTPase domain and stalk region, and then induces a rearrangement of the helical array and an expansion of the tube, which is opposite to the behavior of other dynamin proteins, suggesting a unique role of SOPA1 in the fusion of mitochondrial inner membrane.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a common and devastating genetic disease that is primarily caused by exon deletions that create a genetic frameshift in dystrophin. Exon skipping therapy seeks to correct this by masking an exon during the mRNA maturation process, which restores dystrophin expression, but creates an edited protein missing both the original defect and the therapeutically skipped region. Crucially, it is possible to correct many defects in alternative ways, by skipping an exon either before, or after the patients defect. This results in alternatively edited, hybrid proteins, of possibly different properties and therapeutic consequences. Here, we examined three such dystrophin exon skipped edits, comprising two pairs of alternative repairs of the same underlying DMD defect. We found that in both cases, one member of each alternative repair was more stable than the other by a variety of thermodynamic and biochemical measures. We also examined the origin of these differences by molecular dynamics simulations, which showed that these stability differences were the result of different types of structural perturbations. For example, in one edit there was partial unfolding at the edit site which caused domain-localized perturbations, while in another there was unfolding at the protein domain junctions distal to the edit site which increased molecular flexibility. These results demonstrate that alternative exon skip repairs of the same underlying defect can have very different consequences at the level of protein structure and stability, and furthermore that these can arise by different mechanisms, either locally, or by more subtle long-range perturbations.",

The bioassays used to screen enzyme modulators can be affected by unaccounted interferences such as time-dependent inactivation and inhibition effects. Using procaspase-3, caspase-3, and -thrombin as model enzymes, we show that some of these effects are not eliminated by merely ignoring the reaction phases that follow initial-rate measurements. We thus propose a linearization method (LM) for detecting spurious changes of enzymatic activity based on the representation of progress curves in modified coordinates. This method is highly sensitive to signal readout distortions, thereby allowing rigorous selection of valid kinetic data. The method allows the detection of assay interferences even when their occurrence is not suspected a priori. By knowing the assets and liabilities of the bioassay, enzymology results can be reported with enhanced reproducibility and accuracy. Critical analysis of full progress curves is expected to help discriminating experimental artifacts from true mechanisms of enzymatic inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The TRAnsport-Protein-Particle (TRAPP) complex controls multiple membrane trafficking steps and is thus strategically positioned to mediate cell adaptation to diverse environmental conditions, including acute stress. We have identified TRAPP as a key component of a branch of the integrated stress response that impinges on the early secretory pathway. TRAPP associates with and drives the recruitment of the COPII coat to stress granules (SGs) leading to vesiculation of the Golgi complex and an arrest of ER export. Interestingly, the relocation of TRAPP and COPII to SGs only occurs in actively proliferating cells and is CDK1/2-dependent. We show that CDK1/2 activity controls the COPII cycle at ER exit sites (ERES) and that its inhibition prevents TRAPP/COPII relocation to SGs by stabilizing them at the ERES. Importantly, TRAPP is not just a passive constituent of SGs but controls their maturation since SGs that assemble in TRAPP-depleted cells are smaller and are no longer able to recruit RACK1 and Raptor, rendering the cells more prone to undergo apoptosis upon stress exposure.",

    "abstract": "Long-range gene regulation involves physical proximity between enhancers and promoters to generate precise patterns of gene expression in space and time. However, in some cases proximity coincides with gene activation, whereas in others preformed topologies already exist before activation. In this study, we investigate the preformed configuration underlying the regulation of the Shh gene by its unique limb enhancer, the ZRS, in vivo during mouse development. Abrogating the constitutive transcription covering the ZRS region led to a shift within the Shh-ZRS contacts and a moderate reduction in Shh transcription. Deletion of the CTCF binding sites around the ZRS resulted in a loss of the Shh-ZRS preformed interaction and a 50% decrease in Shh expression but no phenotype, suggesting an additional, CTCF-independent mechanism of promoter-enhancer communication. This residual activity, however, was diminished by combining the loss of CTCF binding with a hypomorphic ZRS allele resulting in severe Shh loss-of-function and digit agenesis. Our results indicate that the preformed chromatin structure of the Shh locus is sustained by multiple components and acts to reinforce enhancer-promoter communication for robust transcription.",

Usually it is intended to perform genetic analyses in the family member with the most severe phenotype, which, however, may not always be possible. Moreover, no standard criteria have been established to define the person who is most suitable for genetic testing within a family:  the best index case. We therefore established clinical criteria to identify the best index case in HBOC and analyzed the impact on genetic testing. 130 patients who presented at our department from 2016 to 2018 were divided into two groups. In group A (N = 98) genetic analyses were performed in the best index case based on our criteria. In group B (N = 32) at least one other family member was considered a better index case. The detection rate of expected mutations was significantly higher for group A (64.3% vs. 32.0%, p = 0.034) while there was no significant difference of calculated mutation carrier risks between these groups. We conclude that the mutation detection rate in families with HBOC is notably higher after identifying the best index case for genetic testing according to the clinical selection criteria reported here.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe cause of nasal polyposis in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is unknown. Elevated antibody levels have been associated with disease severity in nasal polyps, but the upstream drivers and cellular mechanisms of local antibody production in AERD remain to be investigated.\n\nObjectiveWe sought to identify the upstream drivers and phenotypic properties of local antibody-secreting cells in nasal polyps and to understand their clinical relevance in AERD.\n\nMethodsSinus tissue was obtained from subjects with AERD, aspirin-tolerant chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), aspirin-tolerant chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and healthy controls. Tissue antibody levels were quantified via ELISA and immunohistochemistry, and were correlated with clinical markers of disease severity. Tissue cytokine mRNA levels were measured with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Antibody-secreting cells were profiled with a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.\n\nResultsTissue IgE and IgG4 were elevated in AERD compared to controls (p<0.01 for IgE and p<0.001 for IgG4, vs. CRSwNP). Total IgG and IgG4 positively correlated with the number of polyp surgeries per subject (r=0.48, p=0.011 and r=0.58, p=0.0003, respectively). Polyp IL-10 mRNA expression was higher in AERD vs. CRSwNP (p<0.05), but there were no differences in mRNA expression of type 2 cytokines. ScRNA-seq revealed increased IL5RA, IGHG4, and IGHE in the antibody-associated cells of subjects with AERD compared to CRSwNP. Total plasma cells and IL-5R+ plasma cell numbers in the polyp tissue from AERD exceeded those in polyps from CRSwNP (p=0.0051 and p=0.026, respectively) by flow cytometry. With immunofluorescence, we determined that IL-5R and IgG4 are co-expressed in antibody-secreting cells in AERD.\n\nConclusionsOur study identifies unique clusters of antibody-secreting cells in AERD defined by enrichment of transcripts encoding IL5RA, IGHG4 and IGHE. We confirm surface expression of IL-5R on these cells, and identify T cells as a unique transcriptional source of IL-5. Tissue antibody levels are elevated in AERD and correlate with disease severity. Our findings suggest a role for IL-5 in facilitating local antibody production that may drive features of severe sinus disease.\n\nKey MessagesO_LIIgG4 and IgE levels are markedly increased in nasal polyp tissue from subjects with AERD compared to aspirin-tolerant CRSwNP.\nC_LIO_LITissue IgG4 levels positively correlate with disease recurrence.\nC_LIO_LIIL-10 mRNA levels are significantly higher in AERD polyp tissue compared to CRSwNP tissue, but differences were not noted for type 2 cytokines or cytokines involved in class switch recombination.\nC_LIO_LIIL-5R transcript and protein surface expression is elevated in antibody-secreting cells from subjects with AERD and may play a role in facilitating class switching and/or survival of antibody-secreting cells.\nC_LI\n\nCapsule SummarySingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of whole nasal polyp tissue identified increased IL5RA, IGHE, and IGHG4 expression in the antibody-secreting cell compartment of subjects with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) compared to aspirin-tolerant chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP).

    "abstract": "Eosinophils have emerged as multifaceted cells that contribute to tissue homeostasis. However, the factors that control their frequency and function at mucosal sites remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the microbiota in regulating enteric eosinophils. We found that small intestinal (SI) eosinophilia was significantly greater in germ-free (GF) mice compared to specific pathogen free (SPF) controls. This phenomenon was associated with enteric overexpression of signals that mediate attraction, retention and survival of eosinophils, and was reversed by colonization. Additionally, we generated a novel strain of eosinophil-deficient GF mice. These mice displayed intestinal fibrosis and were less prone to allergic sensitization as compared to GF controls. Overall, our study demonstrates that commensal microbes regulate intestinal eosinophil frequency and function, which impacts tissue repair and allergic sensitization to food antigens. These data support a critical interplay between the commensal microbiota and intestinal eosinophils in shaping homeostatic, innate and adaptive immune processes in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria in the order Rickettsiales are obligate intracellular parasites that cause human diseases such typhus and spotted fever. They have evolved a dependence on essential nutrients and metabolites from the host cell as a consequence of extensive genome streamlining. However, it remains largely unknown which nutrients they require and whether their metabolic dependency can be exploited therapeutically. Here, we describe a genetic rewiring of bacterial isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways in the Rickettsiales that has resulted from reductive genome evolution. We further investigated whether the spotted fever group Rickettsia species Rickettsia parkeri scavenges isoprenoid precursors directly from the host. Using targeted mass spectrometry in uninfected and infected cells, we found decreases in host isoprenoid products and concomitant increases in bacterial isoprenoid metabolites. Additionally, we report that bacterial growth is prohibited by inhibition of the host isoprenoid pathway with the statins class of drugs. We show that growth inhibition correlates with changes in bacterial size and shape that mimic those caused by antibiotics that inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, suggesting statins inhibit cell wall synthesis. Altogether, our results describe an Achilles heel of obligate intracellular pathogens that can be exploited with host-targeted therapeutics that interfere with metabolic pathways required for bacterial growth.\n\nImportanceObligate intracellular parasites, which include viruses as well as certain bacteria and eukaryotes, extract essential nutrients and metabolites from their host cell. As a result, these pathogens have often lost essential biosynthetic pathways and are metabolically dependent on the host. In this study, we describe a metabolic dependency of the bacterial pathogen Rickettsia parkeri on host isoprenoid molecules that are used in the biosynthesis of downstream products including cholesterol, steroid hormones, and heme. Bacteria make products from isoprenoids such as an essential lipid carrier for making the bacterial cell wall. We show that bacterial metabolic dependency can represent an Achilles heel, and that inhibiting host isoprenoid biosynthesis with the FDA-approved statin class of drugs inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with the integrity of the cell wall. This work highlights a potential to treat infections by obligate intracellular pathogens through inhibition of host biosynthetic pathways that are susceptible to parasitism.",

    "abstract": "Marine sponges represent one of the few eukaryotic groups that frequently harbor symbiotic members of the Thaumarchaeota, which are important chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizers in many environments. However, in most studies, direct demonstration of ammonia-oxidation by these archaea within sponges is lacking, and little is known about sponge-specific adaptations of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Here, we characterized the thaumarchaeal symbiont of the marine sponge Ianthella basta using metaproteogenomics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, qPCR and isotope-based functional assays. \"Candidatus Nitrosospongia bastadiensis\" is only distantly related to cultured AOA. It is an abundant symbiont that is solely responsible for nitrite formation from ammonia in I. basta that surprisingly does not harbor nitrite-oxidizing microbes. Furthermore, this AOA is equipped with an expanded set of extracellular subtilisin-like proteases, a metalloprotease unique among archaea, as well as a putative branched-chain amino acid ABC transporter. This repertoire is strongly indicative of a mixotrophic lifestyle and is (with slight variations) also found in other sponge-associated, but not in free-living AOA. We predict that this feature as well as an expanded and unique set of secreted serpins (protease inhibitors), a unique array of eukaryotic-like proteins, and a DNA-phosporothioation system, represent important adaptations of AOA to life within these ancient filter-feeding animals.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementMany marine sponges harbor symbiotic members of the Thaumarchaeota, but there is generally only indirect evidence available about their functional role within these filter-feeding animals. Furthermore, the specific adaptations of thaumarchaeal symbionts to their sponge hosts are incompletely understood. In this study, we thoroughly characterized a thaumarchaeal symbiont residing in the reef sponge Ianthella basta and demonstrate by using a combination of molecular tools and isotope techniques, that it is the only ammonia-oxidizer in its host. In contrast to other sponges, I. basta does not contain nitrite-oxidizing microbes and thus excretes considerable amounts of nitrite. Furthermore, using metagenomics and metaproteomics we reveal important adaptations of this symbiont, that represents a new genus within the Thaumarchaeota, and conclude that it most likely lives as a mixotroph in its sponge host.",

Nevertheless, the identities, ecophysiology and genetic features of key DNA-foraging microorganisms in marine sediments are completely unknown. Here we combined microcosm experiments, stable isotope probing and genome-centric metagenomics to study microbial catabolism of DNA and its sub-components in anoxic marine sediments. 13C-DNA added to sediment microcosms was degraded within ten days and mineralised to 13CO2. Stable isotope probing showed that diverse Candidatus Izemoplasma, Lutibacter, Shewanella, Fusibacteraceae and Nitrincolaceae incorporated DNA-derived 13C-carbon. Genomes representative of the 13C-labelled taxa were recovered and all encoded enzymatic repertoires for catabolism of DNA. Comparative genomics indicated that DNA can be digested by diverse members of the order Candidatus Izemoplasmatales (former Tenericutes), which appear to be specialised DNA-degraders that encode multiple extracellular nucleases. Fusibacteraceae lacked genes for extracellular nucleases but utilised various individual purine- and pyrimidine-based molecules, suggesting they  cheated on liberated sub-components of DNA. Close relatives of the DNA-degrading taxa are globally distributed in marine sediments, suggesting that these poorly understood taxa contribute widely to the key ecosystem function of degrading and recycling DNA in the seabed.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements contribute to bacterial adaptation and evolution; however, detecting these elements in a high-throughput and unbiased manner remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a de novo approach to identify mobile elements from short-read sequencing data. The method identifies the precise site of mobile element insertion and infers the identity of the inserted sequence. This is an improvement over previous methods that either rely on curated databases of known mobile elements or rely on  split-read alignments that assume the inserted element exists within the reference genome. We apply our approach to 12,419 sequenced isolates of nine prevalent bacterial pathogens, and we identify hundreds of known and novel mobile genetic elements, including many candidate insertion sequences. We find that the mobile element repertoire and insertion rate vary considerably across species, and that many of the identified mobile elements are biased toward certain target sequences, several of them being highly specific. Mobile element insertion hotspots often cluster near genes involved in mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and such insertions are associated with antibiotic resistance in laboratory experiments and clinical isolates. Finally, we demonstrate that mutagenesis caused by these mobile elements contributes to antibiotic resistance in a genome-wide association study of mobile element insertions in pathogenic Escherichia coli. In summary, by applying a de novo approach to precisely identify mobile genetic elements and their insertion sites, we thoroughly characterize the mobile element repertoire and insertion spectrum of nine pathogenic bacterial species and find that mobile element insertions play a significant role in the evolution of clinically relevant phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Aspartic proteases exhibit optimum enzyme activity under acidic condition and have been extensively used in food, fermentation and leather industries. In this study, a novel aspartic protease precursor (proTlAPA1) from Talaromyces leycettanus was identified and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. Subsequently, the auto-activation processing of the zymogen proTlAPA1 was studied by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing, under different processing conditions. TlAPA1 shared the highest identity of 70.3 % with the aspartic endopeptidase from Byssochlamys spectabilis (GAD91729) and was classified into a new subgroup of the aspartic protease A1 family, based on evolutionary analysis. Mature TlAPA1 protein displayed an optimal activity at 60 {degrees}C and remained stable at temperatures of 55 {degrees}C and below, indicating the thermostable nature of TlAPA1 aspartic protease. During the auto-activation processing of proTlAPA1, a 45 kDa intermediate was identified that divided the processing mechanism into two steps: formation of intermediates, and activation of the mature protein (TlAPA1). The former step was completely induced by pH of the buffer, while the latter process depended on protease activity. The discovery of the novel aspartic protease TlAPA1 and study of its activation process will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of aspartic proteases auto-activation.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe novel aspartic protease TlAPA1 was identified from T. leycettanus and expressed as a zymogen (proTlAPA1) in P. pastoris. Enzymatic characteristics of the mature protein were studied and the specific pattern of zymogen conversion was described. The auto-activation processing of proTlAPA1 proceeded in two stages and an intermediate was identified in this process. These results describe a new subgroup of aspartic protease A1 family and provide insights into a novel mode of activation processing in aspartic proteases.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination events are initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by the topoisomerase-like protein, Spo11. Similar to type-II topoisomerases, Spo11 becomes covalently linked to the 5' ends generated on each side of the DSB. Whilst Spo11-oligos--the product of nucleolytic removal by Mre11--have been detected in a number of biological systems, the lifetime of the covalent Spo11-DSB precursor has not been systematically determined and may be subject to alternative processing reactions. Here we explore the activity of human Tyrosyl DNA Phosphodiesterase, TDP2, on Spo11-DSBs isolated from S. cerevisiae cells. We demonstrate that TDP2 can remove Spo11 from natural ssDNA-oligos, and dsDNA ends even when in the presence of excess competitor genomic DNA. Interestingly, TDP2-processed Spo11-DSBs are refractory to resection by Exo1, suggesting that ssDNA generated by Mre11 may be essential in vivo to facilitate resection-dependent HR at Spo11-DSBs even if TDP2 were active. Moreover, although TDP2 can remove Spo11 peptides in vitro, TDP2 was unable to remove Spo11 in vivo--unlike during the repair of topoisomerase-induced DNA lesions. These results suggest that Spo11-DNA, but not topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complexes, are inaccessible to the TDP2 enzyme, perhaps due to occlusion by higher order protein complexes resident at sites of meiotic recombination.",

    "abstract": "Age-related memory decline is associated with changes in neural functioning but little is known about how aging affects the quality of information representation in the brain. Whereas a long-standing hypothesis of the aging literature links cognitive impairments to less distinct neural representations in old age, memory studies have shown that high similarity between activity patterns benefits memory performance for the respective stimuli. Here, we addressed this apparent conflict by investigating between-item representational similarity in 50 younger (19-27 years old) and 63 older (63-75 years old) human adults (male and female) who studied scene-word associations using a mnemonic imagery strategy while electroencephalography was recorded. We compared the similarity of spatiotemporal frequency patterns elicited during encoding of items with different subsequent memory fate. Compared to younger adults, older adults memory representations were more similar to each other but items that elicited the most similar activity patterns early in the encoding trial were those that were best remembered by older adults. In contrast, young adults memory performance benefited from decreased similarity between earlier and later periods in the encoding trials, which might reflect their better success in forming unique memorable mental images of the joint picture-word pair. Our results advance the understanding of the representational properties that give rise to memory quality as well as how these properties change in the course of aging.\n\nSignificance statementDeclining memory abilities are one of the most evident limitations for humans when growing older. Despite recent advances of our understanding of how the brain represents and stores information in distributed activation patterns, little is known about how the quality of information representation changes during aging and thus affects memory performance. We investigated how the similarity between neural representations relates to subsequent memory quality in younger and older adults. We present novel evidence that the interaction of pattern similarity and memory performance differs between age groups: Older adults benefited from increased similarity during early encoding whereas young adults benefited from decreased similarity between early and later encoding. These results provide insights into the nature of memory and age-related memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "Motor adaptation, the adjustment of sensorimotor representations in face of changes in the environment, may operate at different rates. When human participants encounter repeated or consistent perturbations, their corrections for the experienced errors are larger compared to when the perturbations are new or inconsistent. Such modulations of error sensitivity were traditionally considered to be an implicit process that does not require attentional resources. In recent years, the implicit view of motor adaptation is challenged by evidence showing a contribution of explicit strategies to learning. These findings raise a fundamental question regarding the nature of the error sensitivity modulation processes. We tested the effect of explicit control on error sensitivity in a series of experiments, in which participants controlled a screen cursor to virtual targets. We manipulated environmental consistency by presenting rotations in random (low consistency) or random walk (high consistency) sequences, and illustrated that perturbation consistency affects the rate of adaptation, corroborating previous studies. When participants were instructed to ignore the cursor and move directly to the target, thus, eliminating the contribution of explicit strategies, consistency-driven error sensitivity modulation was abolished. In addition, delaying the visual feedback, a manipulation that affects implicit learning, did not influence error sensitivity under consistent perturbations. These results suggest that increases of learning rate in consistent environments are attributable to an explicit rather than implicit process in sensorimotor adaptation.\n\nSignificant Statement\n\nWhen experiencing an error in a motor task (e.g., missing a basketball shot in a windy day), the motor system modifies its next action based on environmental consistency (how frequent the changes in winds direction and strength are). It is unknown whether this process is driven by an implicit and automatic process, or by an explicit process that employs cognitive strategies. We examined these possibilities in a simple visuomotor task by perturbing the feedback in each trial with different consistency levels, and manipulating the use of implicit and explicit processes. We found that participants increase their sensitivity to errors in consistent environments when employing explicit strategies, and do not change their behavior when the implicit process is operating alone.",

To provide a novel interpretation of the evolution of primate brains, sulcal morphological variability of the medial frontal cortex was assessed in old-world monkeys (macaque, baboon) and Hominoidea (chimpanzee, human). We discovered that both Hominoidea do possess a paracingulate sulcus, which was previously thought to be uniquely human and linked to higher cognitive functions like mentalizing. Also, we revealed systematic sulcal morphological organisations of the medial frontal cortex that can be traced from multiple old-world monkey to Hominoidea species, demonstrating an evolutionary conserved organizational principle. Our data provide a new framework to compare sulcal morphology, cytoarchitectonic areal distribution, connectivity, and function across the primate order, leading to clear predictions on how other primate brains might be anatomo-functionally organized.",

    "abstract": "Hormesis refers to a biphasic intensity-dependent response to stressors where low-intensity or short-duration exposure to potentially noxious stressors induces long-lasting adaptations that have positive physiological effects [1]. It was proposed that life-extending interventions, such as calorie restriction, retard aging via their hormetic action [2]. More recently, it was shown that a transient burst of reactive oxygen species is required to induce the effects of calorie restriction [3], physical exercise [4], inhibition of the insulin/IGF-I pathway [5] and metformin [6]. We have previously shown that partial inhibition of complex I of the respiratory chain by a low dose of the poison rotenone (ROT) administered in middle age increases the lifespan and reverts the transcriptomic signature of aging in a vertebrate species [7], an example of a hormetic effect. Here, we asked whether ROT treatment started at young age induces larger effects on life-span and transcriptome.",

    "abstract": "The tumor milieu consists of numerous cell types with each cell existing in a different nutritional environment. However, a characterization of intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity at the single-cell level in human cancer is not established. Here, we develop a computational pipeline to analyze metabolic gene expression programs of single cells within human tumors. In two representative cancer types, melanoma and head and neck, we apply this algorithm to define the single-cell metabolic landscape of human tumors. We find that malignant cells in general have higher metabolic activity and higher metabolic variation than previously observed from studies of bulk tumor comparisons. Indeed, most of the observed metabolic variation of single tumor and normal cells were found to be inconsistent with comparisons with bulk tumor samples. Variation in the expression of mitochondrial programs is the major contributor to intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity. Surprisingly, the expression of both glycolytic and mitochondrial programs strongly correlates with hypoxia in almost all cell types. Immune and stromal cells could also be distinguished by their metabolic features. Taken together this analysis establishes a computational framework for characterizing metabolism using single cell expression data and defines principles of intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries, and is characterized by slow retinal degeneration linked to chronic oxidative stress in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). The exact molecular mechanisms that lead to RPE death and dysfunction in response to chronic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are still unclear. In this work, human stem cell-derived RPE samples were treated with a low dose of paraquat (PQ) for 1 week or 3 weeks to induce chronic reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Cells were then harvested and both the intracellular and secreted RPE proteomes were quantified by mass spectrometry. Inside the RPE, chronic ROS caused concerted increase of glycolytic proteins but decreased mitochondrial proteins, as well as decreased extracellular matrix proteins and membrane proteins required for endocytosis. From the secreted proteins, we found that stressed RPE secrete over 1,000 detectable proteins, and the composition of the proteins secreted from RPE changes due to chronic ROS. Notably, secreted APOE is decreased 4-fold due to 3 weeks of chronic ROS stress, and urotensin-II, the strongest known vasoconstrictor, doubles. Further, secreted TGF-beta is increased, and its cognate signaler BMP1 decreased in the secretome. Together, these alterations of the RPE proteome and protein secretome paint a detailed molecular picture of the retinal stress response in space and time.",

    "abstract": "Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) are a technique that enables testing thousands of regulatory DNA sequences and their variants in a single, quantitative experiment. Despite growing popularity, there is lack of statistical methods that account for the different sources of uncertainty inherent to these assays, thus effectively leveraging their promise. Development of such methods could help enhance our ability to identify regulatory sequences in the genome, understand their function under various setting, and ultimately gain a better understanding of how the regulatory code and its alteration lead to phenotypic consequence.\n\nHere we present MPRAnalyze: a statistical framework dedicated to analyzing MPRA count data. MPRAnalyze addresses the major questions that are posed in the context of MPRA experiments: estimating the magnitude of the effect of a regulatory sequence in a single condition setting, and comparing differential activity of regulatory sequences across multiple conditions. The framework uses a nested construction of generalized linear models to account for uncertainty in both DNA and RNA observations, controls for various sources of unwanted variation, and incorporates negative controls for robust hypothesis testing, thereby providing clear quantitative answers in complex experimental settings.\n\nWe demonstrate the robustness, accuracy and applicability of MPR-Analyze on simulated data and published data sets and compare it against the existing analysis methodologies. MPRAnalyze is implemented as an R package and is publicly available through Bioconductor [1].",

    "abstract": "Understanding the imprint of environmental filtering on community assembly along environmental gradients is a key objective of trait-gradient analyses. Depending on local constraints, this filtering generally entails that species departing from an optimum trait value have lower abundances in the community. The Community-Weighted Mean (CWM) and Variance (CWV) of trait values are then expected to depict the optimum and intensity of filtering, respectively. However, the trait distribution within the regional species pool and its limits can also affect local CWM and CWV values apart from the effect of environmental filtering. The regional trait range limits are more likely to be reached in communities at the extremes of environmental gradients. Analogous to the mid-domain effect in biogeography, decreasing CWV values in extreme environments can then represent the influence of regional trait range limits rather than stronger filtering in the local environment. We name this effect the \"Trait-Gradient Boundary Effect\" (TGBE). First, we use a community assembly framework to build simulated communities along a gradient from a species pool and environmental filtering with either constant or varying intensity while accounting for immigration processes. We demonstrate the significant influence of TGBE, in parallel to environmental filtering, on CWM and CWV at the extremes of the environmental gradient. We provide a statistical tool based on Approximate Bayesian Computation to decipher the respective influence of local environmental filtering and regional trait range limits. Second, as a case study, we reanalyze the functional composition of alpine plant communities distributed along a gradient of snow cover duration. We show that leaf trait convergence found in communities at the extremes of the gradient reflect an influence of trait range limits rather than stronger environmental filtering. These findings challenge correlative trait-environment relationships and call for more explicitly identifying the mechanisms responsible of trait convergence/divergence along environmental gradients.",

For example, longleaf pine ecosystems are exposed to frequent fire disturbance, and this feature sustains biodiversity. We examined how fire frequency maintains beta diversity of multi-trophic interactions, as this community parameter provides a measure of functional redundancy of an ecosystem. We found that turnover in interaction diversity at small local scales is highest in the most frequently burned stands, conferring immediate resiliency to disturbance by fire. Interactions become more specialized and less resilient as fire frequency decreases. Local scale patterns of interaction diversity contribute to broader scale patterns and confer long-term ecosystem resiliency. Such natural disturbances are likely to be important for maintaining regional diversity of interactions for a broad range of ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are taxonomically pervasive strategies adopted by individuals to maximize reproductive success within populations. Even for conditionally-dependent traits, consensus postulates most ARTs involve both genetic and environmental interactions (GEIs), but to date, quantifying genetic variation underlying the threshold disposing an individual to switch phenotypes in response to an environmental cue has been a difficult undertaking. Our study aims to investigate the origins and maintenance of ARTs within environmentally disparate populations of the microscopic bulb mite, Rhizoglyphus robini, that express  fighter and  scrambler male morphs mediated by a complex combination of environmental and genetic factors.\n\nResultsUsing never-before-published individual genetic profiling, we found all individuals across populations are highly inbred with the exception of scrambler males in stressed environments. In fact within the poor environment, scrambler males and females showed no significant difference in genetic differentiation (Fst) compared to all other comparisons, and although fighters were highly divergent from the rest of the population in both poor or rich environments (e.g., Fst, STRUCTURE), fighters demonstrated approximately three times less genetic divergence from the population in poor environments. AMOVA analyses further corroborated significant genetic differentiation across subpopulations, between morphs and sexes, and among subpopulations within each environment.\n\nConclusionOur study provides new insights into the origin of ARTs in the bulb mite, highlighting the importance of GEIs: genetic correlations, epistatic interactions, and sex-specific inbreeding depression across environmental stressors. Asymmetric reproductive output, coupled with the purging of highly inbred individuals during environmental oscillations, also facilitates genetic variation within populations, despite evidence for strong directional selection. This cryptic genetic variation also conceivably facilitates stable population persistence even in the face of spatially or temporally unstable environmental challenges. Ultimately, understanding the genetic context that maintains thresholds, even for conditionally-dependent ARTs, will enhance our understanding of within population variation and our ability to predict responses to selection.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain (CP) is a condition characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms, missing a sound modelling at the neuronal network scale. Recently, we presented a general theory showing common electrophysiological traits in different CP rat models, i.e. a collapse of relevant functional connectivity network properties, such as modularity, in the somatosensory thalamo-cortical (TC) network. In this work, we preliminary investigated by an in silico accurate simulator of the six-layer mammalian cortical networks that evidenced the crucial collapse of network modularity in CP simulated conditions and the consequent reduction of network adaptive processes. On this track, in studies on CP experimental animals affected by sciatic nerve multiple ligature (Bennett-Xie model), by synchrotron-generated X-ray microbeam (MB) irradiations (7 parallel beams, 100um width), we targeted in vivo the CP involved hindlimb somatosensory projection cortex that, because of the doses radiation (360 Gy, peak at each beam), non-invasively produced fast and precise tissue destruction along the 7 beam projections. These parcellated the cortical tissue and restored the cortical network statistics related to modularity and information processing efficiency as evidenced from post irradiation in vivo electrophysiological recordings. In addition, by MB treatment there was an ensuing removal of behavioral signs of allodynia and hyperalgesia accompanied by recovered normal gait schemes yet preserving the normal sensory thresholds of the experimental rats up to three months after the MB irradiation. Finally, novel and unprecedented therapeutic appraisals for CP are devised.\n\nSignificance StatementChronic pain (CP) is an excruciating condition with severe effects on patients life. Apart from many clinical and experimental studies no current theory on CP is generally accepted. Recently, we proposed a general theory of CP in experimental animals as characterized by strong alteration of the connections among neurons in different brain regions. We show here on in silico simulations that specific connectivity changes in the somatosensory cortex recover the lost functional integrity. Concurrently, in experimental animals, we re-modulated, in vivo, some anatomical connections of the somatosensory cortex by extremely thin synchrotron generated X-ray microbeam irradiations. The resulting behavioral and electrophysiological signs of CP disappeared yet maintaining normal sensory responses. No adverse or pathological effects on blank animals were observable.",

    "abstract": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is atheroprotective by mediating cholesterol efflux, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidation functions. Atheroprotective functions of HDL are related to the activity of HDL-associated enzymes such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1). We examined the impact of inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO)-mediated HDL oxidation by PON1 on HDL malondialdehyde (MDA) content and HDL function. In the presence of PON1, crosslinking of apoAI in response to MPO-mediated oxidation of HDL was abolished and MDA-HDL adduct levels were decreased. In addition, PON1 prevented the impaired cholesterol efflux capacity of MPO-oxidized HDL from Apoe-/- macrophages. Direct modification of HDL with MDA increased apoAI crosslinking and reduced the cholesterol efflux capacity in a dose dependent manner. In addition, MDA modification of HDL reduced its anti-inflammatory function compared to native HDL as the expression of IL-1{beta} and IL6 increased by 3-(p<0.05) and 1.8-fold (p<0.05) in Apoe-/- macrophages in response to LPS. MDA-HDL also had impaired ability to increase PON1 activity. Importantly, HDL from subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH-HDL) versus controls had increased MDA-apoAI adducts, and normalization of the PON1 activity to PON1 mass revealed a 24 % (p<0.05) decrease in specific activity indicating that PON1 activity is also impaired in FH. Consistent with the impaired PON1 activity and increased MDA-apoAI, FH-HDL induced a pro-inflammatory response in Apoe-/- macrophages compared to incubation with LPS alone. FH-HDL versus control HDL also had an impaired ability to promote cholesterol efflux from Apoe-/- macrophages. Interestingly, reactive dicarbonyl scavengers effectively abolished MPO-mediated apoAI crosslinking, MDA adduct formation, and improved cholesterol efflux capacity. Importantly, in vivo treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice with reactive dicarbonyl scavengers effectively reduced MDA-HDL adduct formation and increased PON1 activity and HDL cholesterol efflux capacity, supporting a therapeutic potential of reactive carbonyl scavenging in maintaining HDL function.",

    "abstract": "Broad spectrum antimicrobials, both in dental products and within the clinic, have been used in the suppression of cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans for over 40 years. One such antimicrobial is chlorhexidine (CHX), and serves as a standard in dental research against which other antimicrobial therapies are compared against for their efficacy. However, very little is known about the mode of action for CHX against Streptococci and whether tolerance can be developed from repeated exposures. Here, we begin to answer such questions by passaging S. mutans with increasing concentrations of CHX and isolating spontaneously-arising tolerant variants (CTVs) from separate lineages. We find that these CTVs display a higher minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against CHX than the wild-type strain and have altered virulence properties such as acid tolerance and biofilm formation. We record higher MICs for the variants against both daptomycin and bacitracin, but find increased sensitivity to triclosan and sodium fluoride. Measurements of antagonistic capabilities against other health-associated oral streptococci show decreased bacteriocin production compared to wild-type and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Finally whole genome sequencing of the CTVs show common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a diacylglycerol kinase homolog and a glycolipid synthesis enzyme, altering LTA accumulation and potentially lipid profile of the cell wall. Together, these findings confirm that streptococci may develop tolerance to antimicrobial agents such as CHX but in the case of S. mutans, increased tolerance may come at a fitness cost for survival within oral biofilms that keeps variants suppressed within the population.",

Intradermal electroporation of the sa-RNA resulted in a plateau-shaped expression with the plateau between day 3 and 10. The overall protein expression of sa-RNA was significant higher than that obtained after electroporation of pDNA or non-replication mRNAs. Moreover, intradermal electroporation of sa-RNA induced a short-lived innate immune response that did not affect the expression of the sa-RNA. A complete different expression profile and innate immune response was observed when LNPs were used. The expression peaked 24h after intradermal injection of sa-RNA-LNPs and subsequently showed a sharp drop. This drop can be explained by the strong innate immune response elicited by the sa-RNA-LNPs 4h after injection.

Here we describe a new archaeal phylum, Helarchaeota, belonging to the Asgard superphylum with the potential for hydrocarbon oxidation. We reconstructed Helarchaeota genomes from hydrothermal deep-sea sediment metagenomes in hydrocarbon-rich Guaymas Basin, and show that these encode novel methyl-CoM reductase-like enzymes that are similar to those found in butane-oxidizing archaea. Based on these results as well as the presence of several alkyl-CoA oxidation and Wood-Ljungdahl pathway genes in the Helarchaeota genomes, we suggest that members of the Helarchaeota have the potential to activate and subsequently anaerobically oxidize short-chain hydrocarbons.

    "abstract": "T cells use microvilli to search the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells for antigenic ligands. The active motion of scanning microvilli provides a force-generating mechanism that is intriguing in light of single-molecule experiments showing that applied forces on stimulatory receptor-ligand bonds increase their lifetimes (catch-bond behavior). In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to explore the motion of a microvillus tip above an antigen-presenting surface when receptors on the tip stochastically bind to ligands on the surface and dissociate from them in a force-dependent manner. Forces on receptor-ligand bonds impact the motion of the microvillus, leading to feedback between binding and microvillar motion. We use computer simulations to show that the average microvillus velocity varies in a ligand-dependent manner, that catch bonds generate responses in which some microvilli almost completely stop while others move with a broad distribution of velocities, and that the frequency of stopping depends on the concentration of stimulatory ligands. Typically, a small number of catch bonds initially immobilize the microvillus, after which additional bonds accumulate and increase the cumulative receptor-engagement time. Our results demonstrate that catch bonds can selectively slow and stabilize scanning microvilli, suggesting a physical mechanism that may contribute to antigen discrimination by T cells.",

    "abstract": "Global change is simplifying the structure of ecological networks; however, we are currently in a poor position to predict how these simplified communities will affect the evolutionary potential of remaining populations. Theory on adaptive landscapes provides a framework for predicting how selection constrains phenotypic evolution, but often treats the community context of evolving populations as a \"black box\". Here, we integrate ecological networks and adaptive landscapes to examine how changes in food-web complexity shape evolutionary constraints. We conducted a field experiment that manipulated the diversity of insect parasitoids (food-web complexity) that were able to impose selection on an insect herbivore. We then measured herbivore survival as a function of three key phenotypic traits. We found that more traits were under selection in simpler vs. more complex food webs. The adaptive landscape was more neutral in complex food webs because different parasitoid species impose different selection pressures, minimizing relative fitness differences among phenotypes. Our results suggest that phenotypic evolution becomes more constrained in simplified food webs. This indicates that the simplification of ecological communities may constrain the adaptive potential of remaining populations to future environmental change. \"What escapes the eye, however, is a much more insidious kind of extinction: the extinction of ecological interactions.\" Janzen (1974)",

    "abstract": "Brain functional connectivity (FC) changes have been measured across seconds using fMRI. This is true for both rest and task scenarios. Moreover, it is well accepted that task engagement alters FC, and that dynamic estimates of FC during and before task events can help predict their nature and performance. Yet, when it comes to dynamic FC (dFC) during rest, there is no consensus about its origin or significance. Some argue that rest dFC reflects fluctuations in on-going cognition, or is a manifestation of intrinsic brain maintenance mechanisms, which could have predictive clinical value. Conversely, others have concluded that rest dFC is mostly the result of sampling variability, head motion or fluctuating sleep states. Here, we present novel analyses suggesting that rest dFC is influenced by short periods of distinct mental processing, and that the cognitive nature of such mental processes can be inferred blindly from the data. As such, several different behaviorally relevant whole-brain FC configurations may occur during a single rest scan even when subjects were continuously awake and displayed minimal motion. In addition, using low dimensional embeddings as visualization aids, we show how FC states--commonly used to summarize and interpret resting dFC--can accurately and robustly reveal periods of externally imposed tasks; however, they may be less effective in capturing periods of distinct cognition during rest.",

    "abstract": "Cell polarity plays a crucial role during development of vertebrates and invertebrates. Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) is defined as the coordinated polarity of cells within a tissue axis and is essential for processes such as gastrulation, neural tube closure or hearing. Wnt ligands can be instructive or permissive during PCP-dependent processes, and Wnt pathway mutants are often classified as PCP mutants due to the complexity and the similarities between their phenotypes. Our studies of the zebrafish sensory lateral line reveal that disruptions of the PCP and Wnt pathways have differential effects on hair cell orientations. While mutations in PCP genes cause random orientations of hair cells, mutations in Wnt pathway members induce hair cells to adopt a concentric pattern. We show that PCP signaling is normal in hair cells of Wnt pathway mutants and that the concentric hair cell phenotype is due to altered organization of the surrounding support cells. Thus, the PCP and Wnt pathways work in parallel, as separate pathways to establish proper hair cell orientation. Our data suggest that coordinated support cell organization is established during the formation of lateral line primordia, much earlier than the appearance of hair cells. Together, these finding reveal that hair cell orientation defects are not solely explained by defects in PCP signaling and that some hair cell phenotypes warrant reevaluation.",

Liebl.).\n\nMethodsWe estimated the variation of individual tree height as a function of long-term and short-term climates to tease apart local adaptation, plasticity and their interaction, using mixed-effect models calibrated with National Forest Inventory data (in-situ models). To validate our approach, we tested the ability of in-situ models to predict independently tree height observations in common gardens where local adaptation to climate of populations and their plasticity can be measured and separated. In-situ model predictions of tree height variation among provenances (populations of different geographical origin) and among planting sites were compared to observations in common gardens and to predictions from a similar model calibrated using common garden data (ex-situ model).\n\nResultsIn Q. petraea, we found high correlations between in-situ and ex-situ model predictions of provenance and plasticity effects and their interaction on tree height (r > 0.80). We showed that the in-situ models significantly predicted tree height variation among provenances and sites for Abies alba and Quercus petraea. Spatial predictions of phenotypic plasticity across species distribution ranges indicate decreasing tree height in populations of warmer climates in response to recent anthropogenic climate warming.\n\nMain conclusionsOur modelling approach using National Forest Inventory observations provides a new perspective for understanding patterns of intraspecific trait variation across species ranges. Its application is particularly interesting for species for which common garden experiments do not exist or do not cover the entire climatic range of the species.",

    "abstract": "HighlightFaster deacclimation and budbreak phenology is related to a faster regulon rather than higher expression of specific genes. ABA is a master regulator of deacclimation.\n\nAbstractDormancy release, loss of cold hardiness and budbreak are critical aspects of the annual cycle of deciduous perennial plants. Molecular control of these processes is not fully understood, and genotypic variation may be important for climate adaptation. Single-node cuttings from wild (Vitis amurensis, V. riparia) and cultivated Vitis genotypes (V. vinifera  Cabernet Sauvignon,  Riesling) were collected from the field during winter and placed under forcing conditions. Cold hardiness was measured daily, and buds were collected for RNA-Seq until budbreak. Field-collected single-node cuttings of  Riesling were treated with abscisic acid (ABA), and cold hardiness and budbreak at 7 {degrees}C were tracked. Wild Vitis genotypes had faster deacclimation and budbreak than V. vinifera. Temperature-sensing related genes were quickly and synchronously differentially expressed in all genotypes. ABA synthesis was down-regulated in all genotypes, and exogenous ABA prevented deacclimation. Ethylene- and oxidative stress-related genes were transiently up-regulated. Growth-related genes were up-regulated and showed staggering similar to deacclimation and budbreak of the four genotypes. The gene expression cascade that occurs during deacclimation and budburst phenology of fast (wild) and slow (cultivated) grapevines appears coordinated and temporally conserved. This may extend to other temperate woody species and suggest constraints on identification of process-specific keystone genes.",

However, it remains unclear in which cell types these variants may be active, which is essential for understanding disease etiology and for disease modelling. Here we integrate GWAS results with single-cell transcriptomic data from the entire nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlying psychiatric disorders, neurological conditions, and other brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with excitatory neurons from the cortex/hippocampus, medium spiny neurons from the striatum, diverse sets of midbrain neurons, and inhibitory neurons from the cortex/hippocampus. Cognitive traits were generally associated with similar cell types but their associations were driven by different genes. Neurological disorders were associated with different cell types, consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, we found that Parkinsons disease is not only genetically associated with dopaminergic neurons but also with serotonergic neurons and cells from the oligodendrocyte lineage. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression. Altogether, our study provides a solid framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain disorders and reveals a new unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSocial impairments, specifically in mentalizing and emotion recognition, are common and debilitating symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite this, little is known about the neural underpinnings of these impairments, as there have been no published neuroimaging investigations of social inference in PTSD.\n\nMethodsTrauma-exposed veterans with and without PTSD (N = 20 each) performed the Why/How social inference task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The PTSD group had two fMRI sessions, between which they underwent affect labeling training. We probed the primary networks of the \"social brain\"--the default mode network (DMN) and mirror neuron system (MNS)--by examining neural activity evoked by mentalizing and action identification prompts, which were paired with emotional and non-emotional targets.\n\nResultsHyperactivation to emotional stimuli differentiated PTSD patients from controls, correlated with symptom severity, and predicted training outcomes. Critically, these effects were generally non-significant for non-emotional stimuli. PTSD-related effects were widely distributed throughout DMN and MNS. Effects were strongest in regions associated with the dorsal attention, ventral attention, and frontoparietal control networks. Unexpectedly, effects were non-significant in core affect regions.\n\nConclusionsThe array of social cognitive processes subserved by DMN and MNS may be inordinately selective for emotional stimuli in PTSD. This selectivity may be tightly linked with attentional processes, as effects were strongest in attention-related regions. Putatively, we propose an attentional account of social inference dysfunction in PTSD, in which affective attentional biases drive widespread affect-selectivity throughout the social brain. This account aligns with numerous findings of affect-biased attentional processing in PTSD.",

    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC) supplies norepinephrine (NE) to the entire forebrain, regulates many fundamental brain functions, and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases. Although selective manipulation of the LC is not possible in humans, studies have suggested that strong LC activation might shift network connectivity to favor salience processing. To test this hypothesis, we use a mouse model to study the impact of LC stimulation on large-scale functional connectivity by combining chemogenetic activation of the LC with resting-state fMRI, an approach we term \"chemo-connectomics\". LC activation rapidly interrupts ongoing behavior and strongly increases brain-wide connectivity, with the most profound effects in the salience and amygdala networks. We reveal a direct correlation between functional connectivity changes and transcript levels of alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta-1 adrenoceptors across the brain, and a positive correlation between NE turnover and functional connectivity within select brain regions. These results represent the first brain-wide functional connectivity mapping in response to LC activation, and demonstrate a causal link between receptor expression, brain states and functionally connected large-scale networks at rest. We propose that these changes in large-scale network connectivity are critical for optimizing neural processing in the context of increased vigilance and threat detection.",
