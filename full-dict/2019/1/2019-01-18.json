    "abstract": "Codon composition, GC-content and local RNA secondary structures can have a profound effect on gene expression and mutations affecting these parameters, even though they do not alter the protein sequence, are not neutral in terms of selection. Although evidence exists that in some cases selection favors more stable RNA secondary structures, we currently lack a concrete idea of how many genes are affected within a species, and if this is a universal phenomenon in nature.\n\nWe searched for signs of structural selection in a global manner, analyzing a set of one million coding sequences from 73 species representing all domains of life, as well as viruses, by means of our newly developed software PACKEIS. We show that codon composition and amino acid identity are main determinants of RNA secondary structure. In addition, we show that the arrangement of synonymous codons within coding sequences is non-random, yielding extremely high, but also extremely low secondary structures significantly more often than expected by chance.\n\nTogether, we demonstrate that selection for high and low secondary structure is a widespread phenomenon. Our results provide another line of evidence that synonymous mutations are less neutral than commonly thought, which is of importance for many evolutionary models.",

    "abstract": "Humans carry a much larger percentage of body fat than other primates. Despite the central role of adipose tissue in metabolism, little is known about the evolution of white adipose tissue in primates. Phenotypic divergence is often caused by genetic divergence in cis-regulatory regions. We examined the cis-regulatory landscape of fat during human origins by performing comparative analyses of chromatin accessibility in human and chimpanzee adipose tissue using macaque as an outgroup. We find that many cis-regulatory regions that are specifically closed in humans are under positive selection, located near genes involved with lipid metabolism, and contain a short sequence motif involved in the beigeing of fat, the process in which white adipocytes are transdifferentiated into beige adipocytes. While the primary role of white adipocytes is to store lipids, beige adipocytes are thermogeneic. The collective closing of many putative regulatory regions associated with beiging of fat suggests an adaptive mechanism that increases body fat in humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has consistently been associated with substance (ab)use, but the nature of this association is not fully understood. In view of preventive efforts, a vital question is whether there are causal effects, from ADHD to substance use and/or from substance use to ADHD.\n\nMethodsWe applied bidirectional Mendelian randomization using summary-level data from the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on ADHD, smoking (initiation, cigarettes/day, cessation, and a compound measure of lifetime smoking), alcohol use (drinks/week and alcohol use disorder), cannabis use (initiation and cannabis use disorder (CUD)) and coffee consumption (cups/day). Genetic variants robustly associated with the  exposure were selected as instruments and then identified in the  outcome GWAS. Effect estimates from individual genetic variants were combined with inverse-variance weighted regression and five sensitivity analyses were applied (weighted median, weighted mode, MR-Egger, generalized summary-data-based MR, and Steiger filtering).\n\nResultsWe found strong evidence that liability to ADHD increases likelihood of smoking initiation and also cigarettes per day among smokers, decreases likelihood of smoking cessation, and increases likelihood of cannabis initiation and CUD. In the other direction, there was evidence that liability to smoking initiation and CUD increase ADHD risk. There was no clear evidence of causal effects between liability to ADHD and alcohol or caffeine consumption.\n\nConclusionsWe find evidence for causal effects of liability to ADHD on smoking and cannabis use, and of liability to smoking and cannabis use on ADHD risk, indicating bidirectional pathways. Further work is needed to explore causal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) studies have demonstrated widespread alterations in brain function in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, a clear and consistent conclusion regarding a repeatable pattern of MDD-relevant alterations is still limited due to the scarcity of large-sample, multisite datasets. Here, we address this issue by including a large R-fMRI dataset with 1,434 participants (709 patients with MDD and 725 healthy controls) from five centers in China. Individual functional activity maps that represent very local to long-range connections are computed using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity and distance-related functional connectivity strength. The reproducibility analyses involve different statistical strategies, global signal regression, across-center consistency, clinical variables, and sample size. We observed significant hypoactivity in the orbitofrontal, sensorimotor, and visual cortices and hyperactivity in the frontoparietal cortices in MDD patients compared to the controls. These alterations are not affected by different statistical analysis strategies, global signal regression and medication status and are generally reproducible across centers. However, these between-group differences are partially influenced by the episode status and the age of disease onset in patients, and the brain-clinical variable relationship exhibits poor cross-center reproducibility. Bootstrap analyses reveal that at least 400 subjects in each group are required to replicate significant alterations (an extent threshold of P<.05 and a height threshold of P<.001) at 50% reproducibility. Together, these results highlight reproducible patterns of functional alterations in MDD and relevant influencing factors, which provides crucial guidance for future neuroimaging studies of this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Increasing concerns over the environmental impacts of agriculture in Europe has led to the introduction of agri-environment schemes (AES) to help mitigate biodiversity loss. However, effectiveness of AES has been mixed and only partially successful in achieving desired outcomes. To improve effectiveness and reduce high costs, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can help support decision-making and determine the most effective management action. Although MCDA has great potential for evaluating policy measures, it rarely considers the context-dependency of species responses to management practices across different landscapes. Landscape simulations can, therefore, be valuable for reducing the uncertainties when predicting the consequences of management actions. A potential suitable simulation system is the Animal, Landscape, and Man Simulation System (ALMaSS), a mechanistic simulation with can improve MCDA with the automatic integration of a species ecology and behaviour and landscape context. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of ALMaSS in evaluating AES management practices across different landscapes and estimate their ability to achieve the proposed conservation outcomes of three typical species of conservation interest. In this study, the effect of a particular management strategy on a species was dependent on the landscape context, in our case, a combination of landscape structure and the type and distribution of farms, and varied depending on the metrics being measured. Although we did not aim to make recommendations of particular management strategies, we demonstrate how simulations can be used for MCDA to select between management strategies with different costs. Despite the complexity of ALMaSS models, the simulation results provided are easy to interpret. Landscape simulations, such as ALMaSS, can be an important tool in multi-criteria decision making by simulating a wide range of managements and contexts and provide supporting information for filtering management options based on specific conservation goals.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated individual differences in how much subjects rely on prior information, such as expectations or knowledge, when faced with perceptual ambiguity. The behavioural performance of forty-four participants was measured on four different visual paradigms (Mooney face recognition, illusory contours, blur detection and representational momentum) in which priors have been shown to affect perception. In addition, questionnaires were used to measure autistic and schizotypal traits in the non-clinical population. We hypothesized that someone who in the face of ambiguous or noisy perceptual input relies heavily on priors, would exhibit this tendency across a variety of tasks. This general pattern would then be reflected in high pairwise correlations between the behavioural measures and an emerging common factor. On the contrary, our results imply that there is no single factor that explains the individual differences present in the aforementioned tasks, as further evidenced by the overall lack of robust correlations between the separate paradigms. Instead, a two-factor structure reflecting differences in the hierarchy of perceptual processing was the best fit for explaining the individual variance in these tasks. This lends support to the notion that mechanisms underlying the effects of priors likely originate from several independent sources and that it is important to consider the role of specific tasks and stimuli more carefully when reporting effects of priors on perception.",

Building on our previous work using a similar approach, we distinguished between correlations which were \\\"class-driven,\\\" meaning those that could be explained by differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes, and those that reflected graded phenotypic differences within classes. Taking cell class identity into account increased the degree to which our results replicated in an independent dataset as well as their correspondence with known modes of ion channel function based on the literature. We also found a smaller set of genes whose relationships to electrophysiological or morphological properties appear to be specific to either excitatory or inhibitory cell types. Next, using data from Patch-seq experiments, allowing simultaneous single-cell characterization of gene expression and electrophysiology, we found that some of the gene-property correlations observed across cell types were further predictive of within-cell type heterogeneity. In summary, we have identified a number of relationships between gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology that provide testable hypotheses for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Traditional diagnostic imaging of the spine is performed in supine, a relatively unloaded position. However, the spine is subjected to complex loading environments in daily activities such as standing. Therefore, we seek to quantify the changes from supine to standing in the spines of young, healthy individuals in standing using a positional MRI system. This is an observational study that examined the changes in the spine and individual intervertebral discs (IVDs) during supine and standing of forty healthy participants (19 males / 21 females) without a history of low back pain. The regional lumbar spinal alignment was measured by the sagittal Cobb angle. Segmental IVD measurements included the segmental Cobb angle, anterior to posterior height (A/P) ratio, and IVD width measured at each L1/L2 - L5/S1 levels. The intra-observer intra-class correlation (ICC) consistency model showed values for measurements ranged from 0.76-0.98. The inter-observer ICC values ranged from 0.68-0.99. The Cobb angle decreased in standing. The L5/S1 segmental Cobb angle decreased in standing. The L2/L3 and L3/L4 A/P ratios increased and the L5/S1 A/P ratio decreased in standing. No differences in IVD width were observed from supine to standing. This study examined the regional lumbar spinal alignment and segmental IVD changes from supine to standing in young, healthy individuals without LBP using pMRI. In developing and validating these measurements, we have also established the normative data for healthy, asymptomatic population that could be useful for other investigations examining how individuals with spinal or IVD pathologies may adapt between supine and standing.",

    "abstract": "White matter development continues throughout childhood and into early adulthood, but few studies have examined early childhood, and the specific trajectories and regional variation in this age range remain unclear. The aim of this study was to characterize developmental trajectories and sex differences of white matter in typically developing young children. Three hundred and ninety-six diffusion tensor imaging datasets from 120 children (57 male) aged 2-8 years were analyzed using tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA) increased and mean diffusivity (MD) decreased in all white matter tracts by 5-15% over the 6-year period, likely reflecting increases in myelination and axonal packing. Males showed steeper slopes in a number of brain areas. Overall, early childhood is associated with substantial development of all white matter and appears to be an important period for the development of occipital and limbic connections, which showed the largest changes. This study provides a detailed characterization of age-related white matter changes in early childhood, offering baseline data that can be used to understand cognitive and behavioural development, as well as to identify deviations from normal development in children with various diseases, disorders, or brain injuries.",

    "abstract": "The addition of rewarding feedback to motor learning tasks has been shown to increase the retention of learning, spurring interest in the possible utility for rehabilitation. However, laboratory-based motor tasks employing rewarding feedback have repeatedly been shown to lead to great inter-individual variability in performance. Understanding the causes of such variability is vital for maximising the potential benefits of reward-based motor learning. Thus, in this pre-registered study, we assessed whether spatial (SWM), verbal (VWM) and mental rotation (RWM) working memory capacity as well as dopamine-related genetic profiles could predict performance in two reward-based motor tasks, using a large cohort of participants (N=241). The first task assessed participants ability to follow a hidden and slowly shifting reward region based on hit/miss (binary) feedback. The second task investigated participants capacity to preserve performance with binary feedback after adapting to the shift with full visual feedback. Our results demonstrate that SWM strongly predicts a participants capacity to reliably reproduce a successful motor action, measured as change in reach angle following reward, while RWM predicted a participants propensity to express an explicit strategy when required to make large adjustments in reach angle. Therefore, both SWM and RWM were reliable predictors of success during reward-based motor learning. Change in reach direction following failure was also a strong predictor of success rate, although we observed no consistent relationship with any type of working memory. Surprisingly, no dopamine-related genotypes predicted performance. Therefore, working memory capacity plays a pivotal in determining individual ability in reward-based motor learning.\\n\\nSignificance statementReward-based motor learning tasks have repeatedly been shown to lead to idiosyncratic behaviours that cause varying degrees of task success. Yet, the factors determining an individuals capacity to use reward-based feedback are unclear. Here, we assessed a wide range of possible candidate predictors, and demonstrate that domain-specific working memory plays an essential role in determining individual capacity to use reward-based feedback. Surprisingly, genetic variations in dopamine availability were not found to play a role. This is in stark contrast with seminal work in the reinforcement and decision-making literature, which show strong and replicated effects of the same dopaminergic genes in decision-making. Therefore, our results provide novel insights in reward-based motor learning, highlighting a key role for domain-specific working memory capacity.",

The second pair is a GEFS+ patient line with the K1270T mutation, and the corrected patient line.

    "abstract": "Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of oxalate metabolism leading to kidney failure as well as multi-organ damage. Overproduction of oxalate occurs in the liver due to an inherited genetic defect in the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT), causing pathology due to the insolubility of calcium oxalate crystals in body fluids. The main current therapy is dual liver-kidney transplant, which incurs high morbidity and has poor availability in some health systems where PH1 is more prevalent. One approach currently in active clinical investigation targets HAO1 (hydroxyacid oxidase 1), encoding glycolate oxidase, to reduce substrate levels for oxalate production. To inform drug development, we sought individuals with reduced HAO1 function due to naturally occurring genetic variation.\\n\\nAnalysis of loss of function variants in 141,456 sequenced individuals suggested individuals with complete HAO1 knockout would only be observed in 1 in 30 million outbred people. However in a large sequencing and health records program (Genes & Health), in populations with substantial autozygosity, we identified a healthy adult individual predicted to have complete knockout of HAO1 due to an ultra rare homozygous frameshift variant (rs1186715161, ENSP00000368066.3:p.Leu333SerfsTer4). Primary care and hospital health records confirmed no apparently related clinical phenotype. At recall, urine and plasma oxalate levels were normal, however plasma glycolate levels (171 nmol/mL) were 12 times the upper limit of normal in healthy, reference individuals (mean+2sd=14 nmol/mL, n=67) while her urinary glycolate levels were 6 times the upper limit of normal. Comparison with preclinical and phase 1 clinical trial data of an RNAi therapeutic targeting HAO1 (lumasiran) suggests the individual likely retains <2% residual glycolate oxidase activity.\\n\\nThese results provide important data to support the safety of HAO1 inhibition as a potential chronic therapy for a devastating metabolic disease (PH1). We also suggest that the effect of glycolate oxidase suppression in any potential other roles in humans beyond glycolate oxidation do not lead to clinical phenotypes, at least in this specific individual. This demonstrates the value of studying the lifelong complete knockdown of a target protein in a living human to aid development of a potential therapeutic, both in de-risking the approach and providing potential hypotheses to optimize its development. Furthermore, therapy for PH1 is likely to be required lifelong, in contrast to data from chronicity studies in non-human species or relatively short-term therapeutic studies in people.

    "abstract": "Predicting gene expression with genetic data has garnered significant attention in recent years. PrediXcan is one of the most widely used gene-based association methods for testing imputed gene expression values with a phenotype due to the invaluable insight the method has shown into the relationship between complex traits and the component of gene expression that can be attributed to genetic variation. The prediction models for PrediXcan, however, were obtained using supervised machine learning methods and training data from the Depression and Gene Network (DGN) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data, where the majority of subjects are of European descent. Many genetic studies, however, include samples from multi-ethnic populations, and in this paper we assess the accuracy of gene expression predictions with PrediXcan in diverse populations. Using transcriptomic data from the GEUVADIS (Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease) RNA sequencing project and whole genome sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes project, we evaluate and compare the predictive performance of PrediXcan in an African population (Yoruban) and four European populations. Prediction results are obtained using a range of models from PrediXcan weight databases, and Pearsons correlation coefficient is used to measure prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that the predictive performance of PrediXcan varies across populations (F-test p-value < 0.001), where prediction accuracy is the worst in the Yoruban sample compared to European samples. Moreover, the performance of PrediXcan varies not only among distant populations, but also among closely related populations as well. We also find that the qualitative performance of PrediXcan for the populations considered is consistent across all weight databases used.",

    "abstract": "Geochemical models typically represent organic matter (OM) as consisting of multiple, independent pools of compounds, each accessed by microorganisms at different rates. However, recent findings indicate that organic compounds can interact within microbial metabolisms. The relevance of interactive effects within marine systems is debated and a mechanistic understanding of its complexities, including microbe-substrate relationships, is lacking. As a first step toward uncovering mediating processes, the interactive effects of distinct pools of OM on the growth and respiration of marine bacteria, individual strains and a simple, constructed community of Roseobacter lineage members were tested. Isolates were provided with natural organic matter (NOM) and different concentrations (1, 4, 40, 400 M-C) and forms of labile organic matter (acetate, casamino acids, tryptone, coumarate). The microbial response to the mixed substrate regimes was assessed using viable counts and respiration in two separate experiments. Two marine bacteria and a six-member constructed community were assayed with these experiments. Both synergistic and antagonistic growth responses were evident for all strains, but all were transient. The specific substrate conditions promoting a response, and the direction of that response, varied amongst species. These findings indicate that the substrate conditions that result in OM interactive effects are both transient and species-specific and thus influenced by both the composition and metabolic potential of a microbial community.",

    "abstract": "Awns are stiff, hair-like structures that grow from the spikelets of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other grasses. In wild wheat relatives, awns play a role in seed dispersal. Awn suppression in domesticated wheat, where awns are shortened or even eliminated entirely, is variably adaptive with both awned and awnless types under widespread cultivation. Although the B1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 5A is a major determinant of awn suppression, no underlying gene or mechanism of action has been identified. Using association mapping, we identified a SNP marker located on the distal end of 5AL (5A28417) predictive of awn status in a panel of 640 U.S. winter wheat breeding lines, indicating that B1 was the determinant of awn suppression in this germplasm. Analysis of historical data available for the panel determined 5A28417 was also significantly associated with grain test weight. Evaluation of spike morphology and kernel traits was undertaken in a 341 RIL population developed from a cross between awned soft winter wheat cultivar LA95135 and awnless cultivar SS-MPV57. Awn suppression in the population co-segregated with 5A28417 and was co-located with QTL for number of spikelets per spike, kernel weight and kernel length. Fine-mapping located B1 to a region containing only two predicted genes, including a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor 219 bp from 5A28417 that we named AWNS-A1. Deletions encompassing both genes were present in awned mutants of the awnless cultivar Brundage. Polymorphisms in the AWNS-A1 coding region were not observed in diverse wheat germplasm. However, sequencing of wheat lines representing different marker haplotypes in the surrounding region identified a deletion 3 kb downstream of AWNS-A1. A marker for this deletion was highly predictive of awn suppression in a collection of diverse wheat accessions, and indicates that AWNS-A1 is likely the major determinant of awn suppression in global wheat germplasm. AWNS-A1 is more highly expressed in developing spikes of awnless individuals, suggesting a mechanism for awn suppression.",

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds to specific DNA sequences and directly induces transcription of anti-inflammatory genes that contribute to cytokine repression, frequently in cooperation with NF-kB. Whether inflammatory repression also occurs through local interactions between GR and inflammatory gene regulatory elements remains controversial. Here, using Global Run-on Sequencing (GRO-seq) in human airway epithelial cells, we show that glucocorticoid signaling represses transcription within 10 minutes. Many repressed regulatory regions reside within  hyper-ChIPable genomic regions that are subject to non-specific interactions with some antibodies. When this was accounted for, we determined that transcriptional repression occurs without local GR occupancy. Instead, widespread transcriptional induction through canonical GR binding sites is associated with reciprocal repression of distal TNF-regulated enhancers through a chromatin-dependent process, as evidenced by chromatin accessibility and enhancer-reporter assays. Simultaneously, transcriptional induction of key anti-inflammatory effectors is decoupled from primary repression through cooperation between GR and NF-kB at a subset of regulatory regions. Thus, glucocorticoids exert bimodal restraints on inflammation characterized by rapid primary transcriptional repression without local GR occupancy and secondary anti-inflammatory effects resulting from transcriptional cooperation between GR and NF-kB.",

Myelin-specific proteins play key roles in these assemblies, which may link membranes to each other or connect the myelinating cell cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. The myelin protein periaxin is known to play an important role in linking the Schwann cell cytoskeleton to the basal lamina through membrane receptors, such as the dystroglycan complex. Mutation that truncate periaxin from the C terminus cause demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4F, indicating a function for the periaxin C-terminal region in myelination. We identified the cytoplasmic domain of {beta}4 integrin as a specific high-affinity binding partner for periaxin. The C-terminal region of periaxin remains unfolded and flexible when bound to the third fibronectin type III domain of {beta}4 integrin. Our data suggest that periaxin is able to link the Schwann cell cytoplasm to the basal lamina through a two-pronged interaction via different membrane protein complexes, which bind close to the N and C terminus of this elongated, flexible molecule.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis may be accelerated by oxidative stress, which produces lipid peroxidation. Among the products of lipid peroxidation are highly reactive dicarbonyls including isolevuglandins (IsoLGs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) that covalently modify proteins. We investigated the impact of treatment with the dicarbonyl scavenger, 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) on HDL function and atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic Ldlr-/- mice, a model of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Compared to mice treated with vehicle, 2-HOBA significantly decreased atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic Ldlr-/- mice by 31% in the proximal aortas and 60% in en face aortas, in the absence of changes in blood lipid levels. 2-HOBA reduced MDA content in HDL and LDL. Consuming a western diet increased plasma MDA-apoAI adduct levels in Ldlr-/- mice. 2-HOBA inhibited MDA-apoAI formation and increased the capacity of the mouse HDL to reduce macrophage cholesterol stores. Importantly, 2-HOBA reduced the MDA- and IsoLG-lysyl content in atherosclerotic aortas in Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, 2-HOBA diminished oxidative stress-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages, reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in atherosclerotic lesions by 72%, and decreased serum proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, 2-HOBA enhanced efferocytosis and promoted characteristics of stable plaque formation in mice as evidenced by a 69% (p<0.01) reduction in necrotic core and by increased collagen content (2.7-fold) and fibrous cap thickness (2.1-fold). HDL from patients with FH had increased MDA content resulting in a reduced ability of FH-HDL to decrease macrophage cholesterol content versus controls. Our results demonstrate that dicarbonyl scavenging with 2-HOBA has multiple atheroprotective effects on lipoproteins and reduces atherosclerosis in a murine model of FH, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nAbbreviations2-HOBA, 2-hydroxybenzylamine; 4-HOBA, 4-hydroxybenzylamine; MDA, malondialdehyde; 4-HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; IsoLGs, isolevuglandins; HDL, high-density lipoproteins; LDL, lowdensity lipoprotein; LDLR, low-density lipoprotein receptor; ApoAI, apolipoprotein AI; ApoB, apolipoprotein B; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IL, interleukin.",

    "abstract": "Bee species worldwide are facing a future of further land-use change and intensification. Populations of closely-related species with similar ecological characteristics are likely to respond similarly to such pressures. Such phylogenetic signal in species responses could undermine the stability of pollination services in agricultural and natural systems. We use abundance data from a global compilation of bee assemblages in different land uses to assess the sensitivity of 573 bee species to agricultural expansion, intensification and urbanization; and combine the results with the Bee Tree of Life to assess phylogenetic signal. In addition, we assess whether variation in species sensitivity to land-use change is better explained by phylogenetic or available functional trait differences. Bee species show strong phylogenetic signal in sensitivity to agricultural land expansion but only a weak signal in sensitivity to agricultural intensification and urbanisation. Sensitivities were usually best explained by a combination of functional and phylogenetic distances. This finding suggests that the commonly-recorded traits, despite being meaningful as functional response traits, do not capture all important determinants of bee species vulnerability or resistance. However, it also suggests that model-based predictions of the sensitivity of poorly known species may be sufficient to help guide conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses are increasingly popular to explore the genetic architecture of complex traits, but existing studies do not leverage shared regulatory patterns and suffer from a large multiplicity burden, which hampers the detection of weak signals such as trans associations. Here, we present a fully multivariate proteomic QTL (pQTL) analysis performed with our recently proposed Bayesian method LOCUS on data from two clinical cohorts, with plasma protein levels quantified by mass-spectrometry and aptamer-based assays. Our two-stage study identifies 136 pQTL associations in the first cohort, of which > 80% replicate in the second independent cohort and have significant enrichment with functional genomic elements and disease risk loci. Moreover, 78% of the pQTLs whose protein abundance was quantified by both proteomic techniques are confirmed across assays. Our thorough comparisons with standard univariate QTL mapping on (1) these data and (2) synthetic data emulating the real data show how LOCUS borrows strength across correlated protein levels and markers on a genome-wide scale to effectively increase statistical power. Notably, 15% of the pQTLs uncovered by LOCUS would be missed by the univariate approach, including several trans and pleiotropic hits with successful independent validation. Finally, the analysis of extensive clinical data from the two cohorts indicates that the genetically-driven proteins identified by LOCUS are enriched in associations with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and might therefore act as endophenotypes for metabolic diseases. While considerations on the clinical role of the pQTLs are beyond the scope of our work, these findings generate useful hypotheses to be explored in future research; all results are accessible online from our searchable database. Thanks to its efficient variational Bayes implementation, LOCUS can analyse jointly thousands of traits and millions of markers. Its applicability goes beyond pQTL studies, opening new perspectives for large-scale genome-wide association and QTL analyses.\n\nAuthor summaryExploring the functional mechanisms between the genotype and disease endpoints in view of identifying innovative therapeutic targets has prompted molecular quantitative trait locus studies, which assess how genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) affect intermediate gene (eQTL), protein (pQTL) or metabolite (mQTL) levels. However, conventional univariate screening approaches do not account for local dependencies and association structures shared by multiple molecular levels and markers. Conversely, the current joint modelling approaches are restricted to small datasets by computational constraints. We illustrate and exploit the advantages of our recently introduced Bayesian framework LOCUS in a fully multivariate pQTL study, with {approx} 300K tag SNPs (capturing information from 4M markers) and 100 - 1,000 plasma protein levels measured by two distinct technologies. LOCUS identifies novel pQTLs that replicate in an independent cohort, confirms signals documented in studies 2 - 18 times larger, and detects more pQTLs than a conventional two-stage univariate analysis of our datasets. Moreover, some of these pQTLs might be of biomedical relevance and would therefore deserve dedicated investigation. Our extensive numerical experiments on these data and on simulated data demonstrate that the increased statistical power of LOCUS over standard approaches is largely attributable to its ability to exploit shared information across outcomes while efficiently accounting for the genetic correlation structures at a genome-wide level.",
