    "abstract": "Antler regeneration, a stem cell-based epimorphic process, has potential as a valuable model for regenerative medicine. A pool of antler stem cells (ASCs) for antler development is located in the antlerogenic periosteum (AP). However, whether this ASC pool is homogenous or heterogeneous has not been fully evaluated. In this study, we produced a comprehensive transcriptome dataset at the single-cell level for the ASCs based on the 10x Genomics platform (scRNA-seq). A total of 4,565 ASCs were sequenced and classified into a large cell cluster, indicating that the ASCs resident in the AP are likely to be a homogeneous population. The scRNA-seq data revealed that tumor-related genes were highly expressed in these homogeneous ASCs: i.e. TIMP1, TMSB10, LGALS1, FTH1, VIM, LOC110126017 and S100A4. Results of screening for stem cell markers suggest that the ASCs may be considered as a special type of stem cell between embryonic (CD9) and adult (CD29, CD90, NPM1 and VIM) stem cells. Our results provide the first comprehensive transcriptome analysis at the single-cell level for the ASCs, and identified only one major cell type resident in the AP and some key stem cell genes, which may hold the key to why antlers, the unique mammalian organ, can fully regenerate once lost.",

    "abstract": "The WNT signaling network is comprised of multiple receptors that relay various input signals via distinct transduction pathways to execute multiple complex and context-specific output processes. Integrity of the WNT signaling network relies on proper specification between canonical and non-canonical pathways, which presents a regulatory challenge given that several signal transducing elements are shared between pathways. Here, we report that USP9X, a deubiquitylase, and WWP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interact physically to regulate a ubiquitin switch on DVL2, a WNT signaling protein. Our findings indicate that USP9X-mediated deubiquitylation of DVL2 is required for canonical WNT activation, while DVL2 ubiquitylation promotes its localization to actin-rich projections and increased cellular motility. We propose that a WWP1-USP9X axis regulates a ubiquitin switch on DVL2 that specifies its participation in either canonical WNT or WNT-PCP pathways. These findings have important implications for therapeutic targeting of USP9X in human cancer.",

    "abstract": "A neural code adapted to the statistical structure of sensory cues may optimize perception. We investigated whether interaural time difference (ITD) statistics inherent in natural acoustic scenes are parameters determining spatial discriminability. The natural ITD rate of change across azimuth (ITDrc) and ITD variability over time (ITDv) were combined in a Fisher information statistic for assessing the amount of azimuthal information conveyed by this sensory cue. We hypothesized that natural ITD statistics drive the neural code for ITD and thus influence spatial perception. Human spatial discriminability and spatial novelty detection of sounds with invariant statistics correlated with natural ITD statistics. The lack of natural statistics in the stimuli suggests that this correlation results from natural statistics driving the neural code. Additionally, the density distribution of ITD tuning matching natural statistics is consistent with classic models of ITD coding and can explain the ITD tuning distribution observed in the mammalian brainstem.\n\nImpact statementHuman brain has incorporated natural statistics of spatial cues to the neural code supporting perception of sound location.\n\nMajor subject areaNeuroscience;\n\nResearch organismHuman;",

    "abstract": "It is commonly accepted that microplastic (MP) ingestion can lead to lower food intake and bioaccumulation of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in aquatic organisms. However, causal links between MP and contaminant levels in biota are poorly understood and in situ data are very limited. Here, we investigated whether HOC concentrations in herring muscle tissue (Clupea harengus membras) are related to MP ingestion using fish caught along the West coast of the Baltic Sea. The MP occurrence exhibited a large geographic variability, with MP found in 22.3% of the fish examined. The population average was 1.0 MP ind-1; however, when only individuals containing MP were considered, the average MP burden was 4.4 MP ind-1. We also found that MP burden decreased with reproductive stage of the fish but increased with its body size. To predict MP abundance in fish guts, we constructed a mass-balance model using literature data on MP in the water column and physiological rates on ingestion and gut evacuation for clupeids of a similar size. The model output was in agreement with the observed values, thus supporting the validity of the results. Contaminant concentrations in the muscle tissue were unrelated to the MP levels in fish, suggesting a lack of direct links between the levels of HOCs and MP ingestion. Thus, despite their ubiquity, MP are unlikely to have a measurable impact on food intake or the total body burden of hydrophobic contaminants in Baltic herring.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/363127v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4cb5b6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2de3c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c58baborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@154b828_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Optimal Bayesian models have been highly successful in describing human performance on perceptual decision-making tasks, such as cue combination and visual search. However, recent studies have argued that these models are often overly flexible and therefore lack explanatory power. Moreover, there are indications that neural computation is inherently imprecise, which makes it implausible that humans would perform optimally on any non-trivial task. Here, we reconsider human performance on a visual search task by using an approach that constrains model flexibility and tests for computational imperfections. Subjects performed a target detection task in which targets and distractors were tilted ellipses with orientations drawn from Gaussian distributions with different means. We varied the amount of overlap between these distributions to create multiple levels of external uncertainty. We also varied the level of sensory noise, by testing subjects under both short and unlimited display times. On average, empirical performance - measured as d - fell 18.1% short of optimal performance. We found no evidence that the magnitude of this suboptimality was affected by the level of internal or external uncertainty. The data were well accounted for by a Bayesian model with imperfections in its computations. This \"imperfect Bayesian\" model convincingly outperformed the \"flawless Bayesian\" model as well as all ten heuristic models that we tested. These results suggest that perception is founded on Bayesian principles, but with suboptimalities in the implementation of these principles. The view of perception as imperfect Bayesian inference can provide a middle ground between traditional Bayesian and anti-Bayesian views.\n\nAuthor summaryThe main task of perceptual systems is to make truthful inferences about the environment. The sensory input to these systems is often astonishingly imprecise, which makes human perception prone to error. Nevertheless, numerous studies have reported that humans often perform as accurately as is possible given these sensory imprecisions. This suggests that the brain makes optimal use of the sensory input and computes without error. The validity of this claim has recently been questioned for two reasons. First, it has been argued that a lot of the evidence for optimality comes from studies that used overly flexible models. Second, optimality in human perception is implausible due to limitations inherent to neural systems. In this study, we reconsider optimality in a standard visual perception task by devising a research method that addresses both concerns. In contrast to previous studies, we find clear indications of suboptimalities. Our data are best explained by a model that is based on the optimal decision strategy, but with imperfections in its execution.",

    "abstract": "Domoic acid (DA) is an excitatory neurotoxin produced by marine algae and responsible for Amnesiac Shellfish Poisoning in humans. Current regulatory limits (~0.075-0.1 mg/kg/day) protect against acute toxicity, but recent studies suggest that the chronic consumption of DA below the regulatory limit may produce subtle neurotoxicity in adults, including decrements in memory. As DA-algal blooms are increasing in both severity and frequency, we sought to better understand the effects of chronic DA exposure on reproductive and neurobehavioral endpoints in a preclinical nonhuman primate model. To this end, we initiated a long-term study using adult, female Macaca fascicularis monkeys exposed to daily, oral doses of 0.075 or 0.15 mg/kg of DA for a range of 321-381, and 346-554 days, respectively. This time period included a pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum period. Throughout these times, trained data collectors observed intentional tremors in some exposed animals during biweekly clinical examinations.\n\nThe present study explores the basis of this neurobehavioral finding with in vivo imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Diffusion tensor analyses revealed that, while DA exposed macaques did not significantly differ from controls, increases in DA-related tremors were negatively correlated with fractional anisotropy, a measure of structural integrity, in the internal capsule, fornix, pons, and corpus callosum. Brain concentrations of lactate, a neurochemical closely linked with astrocytes, were also weakly, but positively associated with tremors. These findings are the first documented results suggesting that chronic oral exposure to DA at concentrations near the current human regulatory limit are related to structural and chemical changes in the adult primate brain.",

    "abstract": "SummaryRadiation therapy is among the most effective and widely used modalities of cancer therapy in current clinical practice. With the advent of new high throughput genomic technologies and the continuous inflow of transcriptomic data, there has been a paradigm shift in the landscape of radiation oncology. In this era of personalized radiation medicine, genomic datasets hold great promise to investigate novel biomarkers predictive of radiation response. In this regard, the number of available gene expression based signatures built under oxic and hypoxic conditions is getting larger. This poses two main questions in the field, namely, i) how reliable are these signatures when applied across a compendium of datasets in different model systems; and ii) is there redundancy of gene signatures. To address these fundamental radiobiologic questions, we curated a database of gene expression signatures predictive of radiation response under oxic and hypoxic conditions. RadiationGeneSigDB has a collection of 11 oxic and 24 hypoxic signatures with the standardized gene list as a gene symbol, Entrez gene ID, and its function. We present the utility of this database through three case studies: i) comparing breast cancer oxic signatures in cell line data vs. patient data; ii) comparing the similarity of head and neck cancer hypoxia signatures in clinical tumor data; and iii) gaining an understanding of hypoxia-associated miRNA. This valuable, curated repertoire of published gene expression signatures provides a motivating example for how to search for similarities in radiation response for tumors arising from different tissues across model systems under oxic and hypoxic conditions, and how a well-curated set of gene signatures can be used to generate novel hypotheses about the functions of non-coding RNA.\n\nAvailability and implementationRadiationGeneSigDB is implemented in R.

    "abstract": "mtDNA recombination following hybridization is rarely found in animals and was never until now reported in reef-building corals. Here we report unexpected topological incongruence among mitochondrial markers as evidence of mitochondrial introgression in the phylogenetic history of Stylophora species distributed along broad geographic ranges. Our analyses include specimens from the Indo-Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the full latitudinal (2000 km) and environmental gradient (21{degrees}C-33{degrees}C) of the Red Sea (N=827). The analysis of Stylophora lineages in the framework of the mitogenome phylogenies of the family Pocilloporidae, coupled with analyses of recombination, shows the first evidence of asymmetric patterns of introgressive hybridization associated to mitochondrial recombination in this genus. Hybridization likely occurred between an ancestral lineage restricted to the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden basins and migrants from the Indo-Pacific/Indian Ocean that reached the Gulf of Aden. The resulting hybrid lives in sympatry with the descendants of the parental Red Sea lineage, from which it inherited most of its mtDNA (except a highly variable recombinant region that includes the nd6, atp6, and mtORF genes) and expanded its range into the hottest region of the Arabian Gulf, where it is scarcely found. Noticeably, across the Red Sea both lineages exhibit striking differences in terms of phylogeographic patterns, clades-morphospecies association, and zooxanthellae composition. Our data suggest that the early colonization of the Red Sea by the ancestral lineage, which involved overcoming multiple habitat changes and extreme temperatures, resulted in changes in mitochondrial proteins, which led to its successful adaptation to the novel environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput DNA sequencing data is accumulating in public repositories, and efficient approaches for storing and indexing such data are in high demand. In recent research, several graph data structures have been proposed to represent large sets of sequencing data and to allow for efficient querying of sequences. In particular, the concept of labeled de Bruijn graphs has been explored by several groups. While there has been good progress towards representing the sequence graph in small space, methods for storing a set of labels on top of such graphs are still not sufficiently explored. It is also currently not clear how characteristics of the input data, such as the sparsity and correlations of labels, can help to inform the choice of method to compress the graph labeling. In this work, we present a new compression approach, Multi-BRWT, which is adaptive to different kinds of input data. We show an up to 29% improvement in compression performance over the basic BRWT method, and up to a 68% improvement over the current state-of-the-art for de Bruijn graph label compression. To put our results into perspective, we present a systematic analysis of five different state-of-the-art annotation compression schemes, evaluate key metrics on both artificial and real-world data and discuss how different data characteristics influence the compression performance. We show that the improvements of our new method can be robustly reproduced for different representative real-world datasets.",

In order to study their contribution to tissue-specific gene expression, we developed novel tools to profile miRNA targets in the C. elegans intestine and body muscle.\n\nWe validated many previously described interactions, and identified ~3,500 novel targets. Many of the miRNA targets curated are known to modulate the functions of their respective tissues. Within our datasets we observed a disparity in the use of miRNA-based gene regulation between the intestine and body muscle. The intestine contained significantly more miRNA targets than the body muscle highlighting its transcriptional complexity. We detected an unexpected enrichment of RNA binding proteins targeted by miRNA in both tissues, with a notable abundance of RNA splicing factors.\n\nWe developed in vivo genetic tools to validate and further study three RNA splicing factors identified as miRNA targets in our study (asd-2, hrp-2 and smu-2), and show that these factors indeed contain functional miRNA regulatory elements in their 3UTRs that are able to repress their expression in the intestine. In addition, the alternative splicing pattern of their respective downstream targets (unc-60, unc-52, lin-10 and ret-1) is dysregulated when the miRNA pathway is disrupted.\n\nA re-annotation of the transcriptome data in C. elegans strains that are deficient in the miRNA pathway from past studies supports and expands on our results.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicroarray technologies have identified imbalances in the expression of specific genes and biological pathways in Alzheimers disease (AD) brains. However, there is a lack of reproducibility across individual AD studies, and many related neurodegenerative and mental health disorders exhibit similar perturbations. We are yet to identify robust transcriptomic changes specific to AD brains.\n\nMethods and ResultsTwenty-two AD, eight Schizophrenia, five Bipolar Disorder, four Huntington's disease, two Major Depressive Disorder and one Parkinsons disease dataset totalling 2667 samples and mapping to four different brain regions (Temporal lobe, Frontal lobe, Parietal lobe and Cerebellum) were analysed. Differential expression analysis was performed independently in each dataset, followed by meta-analysis using a combining p-value method known as Adaptively Weighted with One-sided Correction. This identified 323, 435, 1023 and 828 differentially expressed genes specific to the AD temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parietal lobe and cerebellum brain regions respectively. Seven of these genes were consistently perturbed across all AD brain regions with SPCS1 gene expression pattern replicating in RNA-seq data. A further nineteen genes were perturbed specifically in AD brain regions affected by both plaques and tangles, suggesting possible involvement in AD neuropathology. Biological pathways involved in the \"metabolism of proteins\" and viral components were significantly enriched across AD brains.\n\nConclusionThis study solely relied on publicly available microarray data, which too often lacks appropriate phenotypic information for robust data analysis and needs to be addressed by future studies. Nevertheless, with the information available, we were able to identify specific transcriptomic changes in AD brains which could make a significant contribution towards the understanding of AD disease mechanisms and may also provide new therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Monocular deprivation (MD) during the juvenile critical period leads to long-lasting impairments in binocular function and visual acuity. The site of these changes has been widely considered to be cortical. However, recent evidence indicates that binocular integration may first occur in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN), raising the question of whether MD during the critical period may produce long-lasting deficits in dLGN binocular integration. Using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of dLGN afferents and excitatory neurons in superficial layers of primary visual cortex (V1), we demonstrate that critical-period MD leads to a persistent and selective loss of binocular dLGN inputs, while leaving spatial acuity in the thalamocortical pathway intact. Despite being few in number, binocular dLGN boutons display remarkably robust visual responses, on average twice stronger than monocular boutons, and their responses are exquisitely well-matched between the eyes. To our surprise, we found that MD leads to a profound binocular mismatch of response amplitude, spatial frequency and orientation tuning detected at the level of single thalamocortical synapses. In comparison, V1 neurons display deficits in both binocular integration and spatial acuity following MD. Our data provide the most compelling evidence to date demonstrating that following critical-period MD, binocular deficits observed at the level of V1 may at least in part originate from dLGN binocular dysfunction, while spatial acuity deficits arise from cortical circuits. These findings highlight a hitherto unknown role of the thalamus as a site for developmental refinement of binocular vision.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMass spectrometry-based metabolomics coupled to liquid chromatography, or LC-MS metabolomics, has become the most popular tool for global metabolite abundance profiling to study metabolism. However, the physicochemical complexity of metabolites poses a major challenge for reliable measurements of metabolite abundance. One way to address the issue is to use multiple chromatographic methods to capture a greater range of molecular diversity. We previously developed a tandem mass spectrometry-based label-free targeted metabolomics analysis framework coupled to two distinct chromatographic methods, reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), with dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) for simultaneous detection of over 200 metabolites to study core metabolic pathways.\n\nObjectivesWe aim to analyze a large-scale heterogeneous data compendium generated from our LC-MS/MS platform with both RPLC and HILIC methods to systematically assess measurement quality in biological replicate groups and to gain insights into metabolite dynamics across different biological conditions.\n\nMethodsOur metabolomics framework was applied in a wide range of experimental systems including cancer cell lines, tumors, extracellular media, primary cells, immune cells, organoids, organs (e.g. pancreata), tissues, and sera from human and mice. We also developed computational and statistical analysis pipelines, which include hierarchical clustering, replicate-group CV analysis, correlation analysis, and case-control paired analysis.\n\nResultsWe generated a compendium of 42 heterogeneous deidentified datasets with 635 samples using both RPLC and HILIC methods. There exist signature metabolites that correspond to heterogeneous phenotypes, involved in several metabolic pathways. The RPLC method shows overall better reproducibility than the HILIC method for most metabolites including polar amino acids. Correlation analysis reveals high confidence metabolites irrespective of experimental systems such as methionine, phenylalanine, and taurine. We also identify homocystine, reduced glutathione, and phosphoenolpyruvic acid as highly dynamic metabolites across all case-control paired samples.\n\nConclusionsOur study is expected to serve as a resource and a reference point for a systematic analysis of label-free LC-MS/MS targeted metabolomics data in both RPLC and HILIC methods with dMRM.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila species communicate the presence of parasitoid wasps to naive individuals. This observation suggests a rudimentary Drosophila social structure. Communication between closely related species is efficient, while more distantly related species exhibit a dampened, partial communication. Partial communication between some species is enhanced following a period of cohabitation, suggesting that species-specific variations in communication \"dialects\" can be learned through social interactions. However, it remains unclear as to how the behavioral acquisition and how learning dialects is facilitated by distinct brain regions. In this study, we have identified six regions of the Drosophila brain essential for dialect learning, including the odorant receptor Or69a. Furthermore, we pinpoint subgroups of neurons such as motion detecting neurons in the optic lobe, layer 5 of the fan-shaped body, and the D glomerulus in the antennal lobe, where activation of each are necessary for dialect learning. These results demonstrate that Drosophila can display complex social behaviors with inputs to multiple regions of the Drosophila brain and unique subsets of neurons that must integrate olfactory, visual and motion cues.",

    "abstract": "Cells have evolved quality control mechanisms to ensure protein homeostasis by detecting and degrading aberrant mRNAs and proteins. A common source of aberrant mRNAs is premature polyadenylation, which can result in non-functional protein products. Translating ribosomes that encounter poly(A) sequences are terminally stalled, followed by ribosome recycling and decay of the truncated nascent polypeptide via the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC). Here, we demonstrate that the conserved RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligase Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) promotes ribosome stalling at poly(A) sequences during RQC. We show that MKRN1 interacts with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and is positioned upstream of poly(A) tails in mRNAs. Ubiquitin remnant profiling uncovers PABP and ribosomal protein RPS10, as well as additional translational regulators as main ubiquitylation substrates of MKRN1. We propose that MKRN1 serves as a first line of poly(A) recognition at the mRNA level to prevent production of erroneous proteins, thus maintaining proteome integrity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Brown Swiss dual-purpose cattle breed is renowned for high milk and protein yield and long productive lifetime under different production conditions. However, little is known about the genetic architecture of those traits because only few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out in this breed. Moreover, most GWAS had been performed for single traits, thus preventing insights into potentially existing pleiotropic effects of trait-associated loci.\n\nResultsTo compile a comprehensive catalogue of large-effect QTL segregating in Brown Swiss cattle, we carried out association tests between partially imputed genotypes at 598,016 SNPs and daughter-derived phenotypes for more than 50 economically important traits, including milk production, growth and carcass quality, body conformation, reproduction and calving traits in 4,578 artificial insemination bulls from two cohorts of Brown Swiss cattle (Austrian-German and Swiss populations). Across-cohort multi-trait meta-analyses of the results from the single-trait GWAS revealed 25 quantitative trait loci (QTL; P < 8.36 x 10-8) for economically relevant traits on 17 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA). Evidence of pleiotropy was detected at five QTL located on BTA5, 6, 17, 21 and 25. Of these, two QTL at BTA6:90,486,780 and BTA25:1,455,150 affect a diverse range of economically important traits, including traits related to body conformation, calving, longevity and milking speed. Furthermore, the QTL at BTA6:90,486,780 seems to be a target of ongoing selection as evidenced by an integrated haplotype score of 2.49 and significant changes in allele frequency over the past 25 years, whereas either no or only weak evidence of selection was detected at all other QTL.\n\nConclusionsOur findings provide a comprehensive overview of QTL segregating in Brown Swiss cattle. Detected QTL explain between 2 and 10% of the variation in the daughter-derived phenotypes and thus may be considered as the most important QTL segregating in the Brown Swiss cattle breed. Multi-trait association testing boosts the power to detect pleiotropic QTL and assesses the full spectrum of phenotypes that are affected by trait-associated variants.",

    "abstract": "Rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma range is a signature of active cortical processing and its synchronization across distant sites has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism of network communication. While this has been shown within sensory modalities, we tested whether crosstalk between the senses relies on similar mechanisms. In two consecutive experiments, we used a task in which human participants (male and female) matched amplitude changes of concurrent visual, auditory and tactile stimuli. In this task, matching of congruent stimuli was associated with a behavioral benefit compared to matching of incongruent stimuli. In the first experiment, we used source-level analysis of high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and observed that cross-modal matching of congruent inputs was associated with relatively weaker coherence between gamma oscillations in early sensory regions. Next, we used bifocal high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (hd-tACS) to manipulate the strength of coupling between sensory cortices. Here, we used a lateralized version of the task in which hd-tACS was applied either ipsilateral or contralateral to the hemisphere receiving sensory stimuli. Ipsilateral gamma, but not alpha stimulation slowed responses to congruent trials whereas responding to incongruent trials was not changed by tACS. We speculate that fast responding to congruent stimuli involves decoupling of sensory gamma oscillations, which was prevented by tACS. These results indicate that synchronization of gamma oscillations promotes direct communication between sensory modalities. The framework of coupled gamma oscillations underlying cortical communication might thus be generalizable from processing within sensory streams to interactions between sensory networks.\n\nSignificance statementCortical gamma oscillations structure segregated neural activity and were suggested to represent a fundamental mechanism of network communication. While there is ample evidence for the role of long-range gamma synchronization in unisensory processing, its significance in multisensory networks is still unclear. We show that direct interactions between sensory cortices rely on synchronization of gamma band activity. To that end, we carried out two consecutive experiments using state-of-the-art high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (hd-tACS). By complementing an observational with an interventional method, we provide novel evidence for the role of synchronized gamma oscillations in multisensory communication.",

    "abstract": "Most existing research into the default-mode network (DMN) has taken a corticocentric approach. Despite the resemblance of the DMN with the unitary model of the limbic system, the anatomy and contribution of subcortical structures to the network may be underappreciated due to methods limitation. Here, we propose a new and more comprehensive neuroanatomical model of the DMN including the basal forebrain and anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei and cholinergic nuclei. This has been achieved by considering functional territories during interindividual brain alignment. Additionally, tractography of diffusion-weighted imaging was employed to explore the structural connectivity of the DMN and revealed that the thalamus and basal forebrain had high importance in term of values of node degree and centrality in the network. The contribution of these neurochemically diverse brain nuclei reconciles previous neuroimaging with neuropathological findings in diseased brain and offers the potential for identifying a conserved homologue of the DMN in other mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "To increase statistical power to identify genes associated with complex traits, a number of transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods have been proposed using gene expression as a mediating trait linking genetic variations and diseases. These methods first predict expression levels based on inferred expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and then identify expression-mediated genetic effects on diseases by associating phenotypes with predicted expression levels. The success of these methods critically depends on the identification of eQTLs, which may not be functional in the corresponding tissue, due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the correlation of gene expression between tissues. Here, we introduce a new method called T-GEN (Transcriptome-mediated identification of disease-associated Gens with Epigenetic aNnotation) to identify disease-associated genes leveraging epigenetic information. Through prioritizing SNPs with tissue-specific epigenetic annotation, T-GEN can better identify SNPs that are both statistically predictive and biologically functional. We found that a significantly higher percentage (an increase of 18.7% to 47.2%) of eQTLs identified by T-GEN are inferred to be functional by ChromHMM and more are deleterious based on their Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores. Applying T-GEN to 207 complex traits, we were able to identify more trait-associated genes (ranging from 7.7 % to 102%) than those from existing methods. Among the identified genes associated with these traits, T-GEN can better identify genes with high (>0.99) pLI scores compared to other methods. When T-GEN was applied to late-onset Alzheimers disease, we identified 96 genes located at 15 loci, including two novel loci not implicated in previous GWAS. We further replicated 50 genes in an independent GWAS, including one of the two novel loci.\n\nAuthor summaryTWAS-like methods have been widely applied to understand disease etiology using eQTL data and GWAS results. However, it is still challenging to discriminate the true disease-associated genes from those in strong LD with true genes, which is largely due to the misidentification of eQTLs. Here we introduce a novel statistical method named T-GEN to identify disease-associated genes considering epigenetic information. Compared to current TWAS methods, T-GEN can not only identify eQTLs with higher CADD scores and function potentials in gene-expression imputation models, but also identify more disease-associated genes across 207 traits and more genes with high (>0.99) pLI scores. Applying T-GEN in late-onset Alzheimers disease identified 96 genes at 15 loci with two novel loci. Among 96 identified genes, 50 genes were further replicated in an independent GWAS.",

    "abstract": "The polymerase of the influenza virus is part of the key machinery necessary for viral replication. However, the avian influenza virus polymerase is restricted in mammalian cells. The cellular protein ANP32A has been recently found to interact with viral polymerase, and to both influence polymerase activity and interspecies restriction. Here we report that either ANP32A or ANP32B is indispensable for influenza A virus RNA replication. The contribution of ANP32B is equal to that of ANP32A, and together they play a fundamental role in the activity of mammalian influenza A virus polymerase, while neither human ANP32A nor ANP32B support the activity of avian viral polymerase. Interestingly, we found that avian ANP32B was naturally inactive, leaving ANP32A alone to support viral replication. Two amino acid mutations at sites 129-130 in chicken ANP32B lead to the loss of support of viral replication and weak interaction with the viral polymerase complex, and these amino acids are also crucial in the maintenance of viral polymerase activity in other ANP32 proteins. Our findings strongly support ANP32A&B as key factors for both virus replication and adaption.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe key host factors involved in the influenza A viral the polymerase activity and RNA replication remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that ANP32A and ANP32B from different species are powerful factors in the maintenance of viral polymerase activity. Human ANP32A and ANP32B contribute equally to support human influenza virus RNA replication. However, unlike avian ANP32A, the avian ANP32B is evolutionarily non-functional in supporting viral replication because of a 129-130 site mutation. The 129-130 site plays an important role in ANP32A/B and viral polymerase interaction, therefore determine viral replication, suggesting a novel interface as a potential target for the development of anti-influenza strategies.",

However, the role that microdiversity plays in the stability of whole microbial communities remains underexplored. Understanding the drivers of microbial community stability is necessary to predict community response to future disturbances. Here, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicons from eight different temperate bog lakes at OTU-97% and amplicon sequence variant (ASV) levels, and we found ecotypes within the same species with different distribution patterns in space and time. We observed that these ecotypes are adapted to different values of environmental factors such as water temperature and oxygen concentration. Our results showed that the existence of several ASVs within a species favored its persistence across changing environmental conditions. We propose that microdiversity aids the stability of microbial communities in the face of fluctuations in environmental factors.",

We present rhto-GEM, the first genome-scale model of R. toruloides metabolism, that was largely reconstructed using RAVEN toolbox. The model includes 4869 genes, 897 reactions, and 3334 metabolites. Lipid metabolism was described using the SLIMEr formalism, which allows direct integration of lipid class and acyl chain experimental distribution data. The simulation results confirmed that the R. toruloides model provides valid growth predictions on glucose, xylose and glycerol, while prediction of genetic engineering targets to increase production of linolenic acid and triacylglycerols highlighted genes that have previously been successfully used to increase lipid production. This renders rtho-GEM useful for future studies to improve the production of other industrially important oleochemicals including both value-added fatty acids and carotenoids, while it will also be valuable tool for system-wide omics-data analysis in R. toruloides. Expanding the portfolio of GEMs for lipid accumulating fungi contributes to both understanding of metabolic mechanisms of the oleaginous phenotype but also uncover particularities of lipid production machinery in R. toruloides.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEntrainment of cortical oscillations by repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is an attractive approach to modulate brain function non-invasively in humans. Here, we applied rTMS in order to modulate oscillatory activity in ventral premotor cortex (PMv), primary motor cortex (M1), and anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS). These areas are thought to contribute to recovery after motor stroke and our overarching goal is to enhance their impact by rTMS. To this end, we established a setup with bifocal, neuronavigated rTMS combined with EEG and tested its technical feasibility.\n\nMethodsBifocal zero-phase lag synchronized rTMS at 11Hz was applied in seven young healthy volunteers to the target pairs (i) PMv and M1 and (ii) aIPS and M1. Adapting to the close vicinity between target areas, we used two small, commercially available coils and applied subthreshold stimuli in order to avoid motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Besides a parieto-occipital sham stimulation, we also included auditory and sensory stimulation in a further control experiment.\n\nResultsFirst, subthreshold TMS led to a phase synchronization and evoked time-averaged potentials in the EEG. However, the same findings could be elicited by peripheral, somatosensory stimulation combined with auditory stimulation. Second, despite the small coils neuronavigation analysis showed that in most participants aIPS and M1 or PMv and M1 could not precisely be targeted due to their vicinity and restriction in coil positioning. Third, bifocal subthreshold rTMS tended to sum up where the induced fields showed the greatest overlap resulting in overt MEPs and thus raising potential safety issues.\n\nConclusionsThe presented data show refinements for bifocal rTMS studies regarding (i) spurious entrainment or resetting effects on brain oscillations, (ii) precise anatomical targeting of areas in close vicinity, and (iii) summing up of overlapping induced electrical fields.",

    "abstract": "In most eukaryotes, centromeric histone (CenH3) proteins mediate the highly conserved process of chromosome segregation as the foundational kinetochore assembly factor. However, in multicellular organisms, CenH3 proteins have to perform their essential functions in different chromatin environments. CenH3 proteins not only mediate mitosis and meiosis but also ensure epigenetic inheritance of centromere identity on sperm chromatin, which is highly compact and almost completely stripped of histones during spermiogenesis. We hypothesized that such disparate chromatin environments might impose different functional constraints on CenH3. If so, gene duplications could ameliorate the difficulty of encoding divergent and even potentially incompatible centromeric functions in the same gene. Here, we analyzed the cytological localization of two recently identified CenH3 paralogs, Cid1 and Cid5, in D. virilis using specific antibodies and epitope-tagged transgenic strains. We find that only ancestral Cid1 is present in somatic cells, whereas both Cid1 and Cid5 are expressed in testes and ovaries. However, Cid1 and Cid5 are alternately retained in male and female gametes; Cid1 is lost in male meiosis but retained throughout oogenesis, whereas Cid5 is lost during female meiosis but retained in mature sperm. Following fertilization, maternally deposited Cid1 rapidly replaces paternal Cid5 during the protamine-to-histone transition. Our studies reveal mutually exclusive gametic specialization of two divergent CenH3 paralogs. We suggest that centromeric histone duplication and divergence may allow essential genes involved in chromosome segregation to specialize and thereby resolve an intralocus conflict between maternal and paternal centromeric histone requirements in many animal species.",

    "abstract": "A gene, a locatable region of genomic sequence, is the basic functional unit of heredity. Differences in genes lead to the various congenital physical conditions of people. One kind of these major differences are caused by genetic variations named single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs). SNPs may affect splice sites, protein structures and so on, and then cause gene abnormities. Some abnormities will lead to fatal diseases. People with these diseases have a small probability of having children. Thus the distributions of SNP patterns on these sites will be different with distributions on other sites. Based on this idea, we present a novel statistical method to detect the abnormal distributions of SNP patterns and then to locate the suspicious lethal genes. We did the test on HapMap data and found 74 suspicious SNPs. Among them, 10 SNPs can map reviewed genes in NCBI database. 5 genes out of them relate to fatal children diseases or embryonic development, 1 gene can cause spermatogenic failure, the other 4 genes are also associated with many genetic diseases. The results validate our idea. The method is very simple and is guaranteed by a statistical test. It is a cheap way to discover the suspicious pathogenic genes and the mutation site. The mined genes deserve further study.\n\nAuthor summaryXiaojun Ding received the BS, MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Central South University.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Madagascar National Strategic Plan for Malaria Control 2018 (NSP) outlines malaria control pre-elimination strategies that include detailed goals for mosquito control. Primary surveillance protocols and mosquito control interventions focus on indoor vectors of malaria, while many potential vectors feed and rest outdoors. Here we describe the application of novel tools that advance our understanding of diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection in the Anopheline mosquitoes of the Western Highland Fringe of Madagascar.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsWe employed a novel outdoor trap, the QUadrant Enabled Screen Trap (QUEST), in conjunction with the recently developed multiplex BLOOdmeal Detection Assay for Regional Transmission (BLOODART). We captured a total of 1252 female Anopheles mosquitoes (10 species), all of which were subjected to BLOODART analysis. QUEST collection captured a heterogenous distribution of mosquito density, diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection. Concordance between Anopheles morphology and BLOODART species identifications ranged from 93-99%. Mosquito feeding behavior in this collection frequently exhibited multiple blood meal hosts (single host = 53.6%, two hosts = 42.1%, three hosts = 4.3%). The overall percentage of human positive bloodmeals increased between the December 2017 and the April 2018 timepoints (27% to 44%). Plasmodium positivity was found primarily in vectors considered to be of secondary importance, with an overall prevalence of 6%.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe QUEST was an efficient tool for sampling Anopheline mosquitoes. Vectors considered to be of secondary importance were commonly found with Plasmodium DNA in their abdomens, indicating a need to account for these species in routine surveillance efforts. Mosquitoes exhibited multiple blood feeding behavior within a gonotrophic cycle, with predominantly non-human hosts in the bloodmeal. Taken together, this complex feeding behavior could enhance the role of multiple Anopheline species in malaria transmission, possibly tempered by zoophilic feeding tendencies.\n\nAuthor SummaryMalaria continues to be a significant threat to public health in Madagascar. Elimination of this disease is impeded by numerous factors, such as vector surveillance that does little to account for the potential role of secondary malaria vectors, which rest and feed outdoors. In this study, we designed a novel, low cost QUadrant Enabled Screen Trap (QUEST) to address the lack of traps for outdoor mosquitoes. We used this in conjunction with our novel BLOOdmeal Detection Assay for Regional Transmission (BLOODART) to assess mosquito feeding behavior in the Western Highland Fringe of Madagascar. Our analysis revealed significant variability in mosquito density, diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection across traps placed within and between two nearby villages at two timepoints; indicating a strong, small-scale spatial component to disease transmission that warrants further investigation. Many of the mosquitoes in this sample (46.4%) fed on two or three host species, indicating complex feeding behaviors that could influence malaria transmission. Further, Plasmodium DNA was detected in the abdomens of numerous vectors of supposed secondary importance, indicating a neglected parasite reservoir and an increased need to account for these species in routine surveillance efforts.",

    "abstract": "Population studies suggest that genetic factors play an important role in refractive error development; however, the precise role of genetic background and the composition of the signaling pathways underlying refractive eye development remain poorly understood. Here, we analyzed normal refractive development and susceptibility to form-deprivation myopia in the eight progenitor mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC). Genetic background strongly influenced both baseline refractive development and susceptibility to environmentally-induced myopia. Baseline refractive errors ranged from -21.2 diopters (D) in 129S1/svlmj mice to +22.0 D in CAST/EiJ mice and represented a continuous distribution typical of a quantitative genetic trait. The extent of induced form-deprivation myopia ranged from -5.6 D in NZO/HILtJ mice to -20.0 D in CAST/EiJ mice and also followed a continuous distribution. Whole-genome (RNA-seq) gene expression profiling in retinae from CC progenitor strains identified genes whose expression level correlated with either baseline refractive error or susceptibility to myopia. Expression levels of 2,302 genes correlated with the baseline refractive state of the eye, whereas 1,917 genes correlated with susceptibility to induced myopia. Genome-wide gene-based association analysis in the CREAM and UK Biobank human cohorts revealed that 985 of the above genes were associated with refractive error development in humans, including 847 genes which were implicated in the development of human myopia for the first time. Although the gene sets controlling baseline refractive development and those regulating susceptibility to myopia overlapped, these two processes appeared to be controlled by largely distinct sets of genes. Comparison with data for other animal models of myopia revealed that the genes identified in this study comprise a well-defined set of retinal signaling pathways, which are highly conserved across different species. These results provide attractive targets for the development of anti-myopia drugs.\n\nAuthor SummarySeveral lines of evidence suggest that variations in genetic background have a strong impact on a default (baseline) trajectory of eye growth and refractive development. Many studies also highlighted differences in susceptibility of different individuals to environmentally induced changes in refractive eye development, suggesting that genetic background plays an important role in visual regulation of eye growth. However, genes and signaling pathways that control the baseline trajectory of refractive eye development and those that regulate the impact of visual environment on refractive eye development are still poorly understood. Our data suggest that both processes are regulated by elaborate retinal genetic networks. Surprisingly, we found that although genes that control baseline refractive eye development and genes regulating the impact of visual environment on refractive development overlap, there is a large number of genes and pathways which exclusively control either the baseline trajectory of refractive eye development or the impact of visual environment on refractive development. Moreover, we found that many of the genes and pathways, which we found to be associated with either baseline refractive development or susceptibility to environmentally induced myopia in mice, are also associated with refractive error development in the human population and are highly conserved across different species. Identification of genes and pathways that underlie visual regulation of eye growth versus genes and pathways that control default trajectory of refractive eye development sheds light on the basic mechanisms of eye emmetropization and provides previously unexplored possibilities for the development of new treatment options for myopia.",

    "abstract": "The ability of wheat genotypes to save water by reducing their transpiration rate (TR) under times of the day with high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) has been linked to increasing yields in terminal drought environments. Further, recent evidence shows that reducing nocturnal transpiration (TRN) could amplify water-saving. Previous research indicates that such traits involve a root-based hydraulic limitation, but the contribution of hormones, particularly auxin and abscisic acid (ABA) has not been explored to explain the shoot-root link. In this investigation, based on physiological, genetic and molecular evidence gathered on a mapping population, we hypothesized that root auxin accumulation regulates whole-plant water use during both times of the day. Eight double-haploid lines were selected from a mapping population descending from two parents with contrasted water-saving strategies and root hydraulic properties. These spanned the entire range of slopes of TR responses to VPD and TRN encountered in the population. On those lines, we examined daytime/night-time auxin and ABA contents in the roots and the leaves in relation to hydraulic traits that included whole-plant TR, plant hydraulic conductance (KPlant), slopes of TR responses to VPD and leaf-level anatomical traits. Root auxin levels were consistently genotype-dependent in this group irrespective of experiments and times of the day. Daytime root auxin concentrations were found to be strongly and negatively correlated with daytime TR, KPlant and the slope of TR response to VPD. Night-time root auxin levels significantly and negatively correlated with TRN. In addition, daytime and night-time leaf auxin and ABA concentrations did not correlate with any of the examined traits. The above results indicate that accumulation of auxin in the root system reduces daytime and night-time water use and modulates plant hydraulic properties to enable the expression of water-saving traits that have been associated with enhanced yields under drought.",

    "abstract": "1.Protein-coding DNA sequences are thought to primarily affect phenotypes via the peptides they encode. Yet, emerging data suggest that, although they do not affect protein sequences, synonymous mutations can cause phenotypic changes. Previously, we have shown that signatures of selection on gene-specific codons usage bias are common in genomes of diverse eukaryotic species. Thus, synonymous codon usage, just as amino acid usage pattern, is likely a regular target of natural selection. Consequently, here we propose the hypothesis that at least for some protein-coding genes, codon clusters with biased synonymous codon usage patterns might represent \"hidden\" nucleic-acid-level functional domains that affect the action of the corresponding proteins via diverse hypothetical mechanisms. To test our hypothesis, we used computational approaches to identify over 3,000 putatively functional codon clusters (PFCCs) with biased usage patterns in about 1,500 protein-coding genes in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Specifically, our data suggest that these PFCCs are likely associated with specific categories of gene function, including enrichment in genes that encode membrane-bound and secreted proteins. Yet, the majority of the PFCCs that we have identified are not associated with previously annotated functional protein domains. Although the specific functional significance of the majority of the PFCCs we have identified remains unknown, we show that in the highly conserved family of voltage-gated sodium channels, the existence of rare-codon cluster(s) in the nucleic-acid region that encodes the cytoplasmic loop that constitutes inactivation gate is conserved across paralogs as well as orthologs across distant animal species. Together, our findings suggest that codon clusters with biased usage patterns likely represent \"hidden\" nucleic-acid-level functional domains that cannot be simply predicted from the amino acid sequences they encode. Therefore, it is likely that on the evolutionary timescale, protein-coding DNA sequences are shaped by both amino-acid-dependent and codon-usage-dependent selective forces.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic in their size and morphology yet must also precisely control their protein composition according to cellular energy demand. This control is particularly complicated for mitochondria, as they must coordinate gene expression from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genome. We have found that cells are able to use this dynamic morphology to post-transcriptionally coordinate protein expression with the metabolic demands of the cell through enhanced mRNA localization to the mitochondria. As yeast switch to respiratory metabolism, they increase their mitochondrial volume fraction that is, the ratio of mitochondrial volume to intracellular volume which drives the localization of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs to the surface of the mitochondria. Through artificial tethering experiments, we show that this mitochondrial localization is sufficient to increase protein production, whereas sequestering mRNAs away from the mitochondrial surface decreases protein production, and those cells are deficient in growth in respiratory conditions. Furthermore, we find that this mRNA sensitivity to mitochondrial volume fraction is driven by the speed of translation downstream of the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), as local ribosome stalling through a stretch of polyprolines in the nascent peptide can drive constitutive localization of mRNAs to the mitochondria. This points to a mechanism by which organelle volume fraction provides feedback to regulate organelle-specific gene expression through mRNA localization while potentially circumventing the need to directly coordinate with the nuclear genome.",

To facilitate this, the brain is faster to bring threatening or rewarding visual stimuli into conscious awareness than neutral stimuli. Unexpected events may indicate a potential threat, and yet we tend to respond slower to unexpected than expected stimuli. It is unclear if or how these effects of emotion and expectation interact with ones conscious experience. To investigate this, we presented neutral and fearful faces with different probabilities of occurance in a breaking continuous flash suppression (bCFS) paradigm. Across two experiments, we discovered that fulfilled prior expectations hastened responses to neutral faces but had either no significant effect (Experiment 1) or the opposite effect (Experiment 2) on fearful faces. Drift diffusion modelling revealed that, while prior expectations accelerated stimulus encoding time (associated with the visual cortex), evidence was accumulated at an especially rapid rate for unexpected fearful faces (associated with activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus). Hence, these findings demonstrate a novel interaction between emotion and expectation during bCFS, driven by a unique influence of surprising fearful stimuli that expedites evidence accumulation in a fronto-occipital network.",

However, the morphological patterns associated with the molecular subtypes have not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we developed a quantitative histopathology analytic framework to identify the gene expression subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer objectively. We processed whole-slide histopathology images of lung adenocarcinoma (n=427) and lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (n=457) in The Cancer Genome Atlas. To establish neural networks for quantitative image analyses, we first build convolutional neural network models to identify tumor regions from adjacent dense benign tissues (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) > 0.935) and recapitulated expert pathologists diagnosis (AUC > 0.88), with the results validated in an independent cohort (n=125; AUC > 0.85). We further demonstrated that quantitative histopathology morphology features identified the major transcriptomic subtypes of both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (P < 0.01). Our study is the first to classify the transcriptomic subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer using fully-automated machine learning methods. Our approach does not rely on prior pathology knowledge and can discover novel clinically-relevant histopathology patterns objectively.

In mammary epithelial cells, dystroglycan (Dg) is believed to be necessary for polymerization of laminin-111 into networks, thus we asked whether correct polymerization could compensate for Dg loss. Artificially polymerized laminin-111 and the laminin-glycoprotein mix Matrigel, both formed branching, spread networks with fractal dimensions from 1.7-1.8, whereas laminin-111 in media formed small aggregates without fractal properties (a fractal dimension of 2). In Dg knockout cells, either polymerized laminin-111 or Matrigel readily attached to the cell surface, whereas aggregated laminin-111 did not. In contrast, polymerized and aggregated laminin-111 bound similarly to Dg knock-ins. Both polymerized laminin-111 and Matrigel promoted cell rounding, clustering, formation of tight junctions, and expression of milk proteins, whereas aggregated Ln-1 did not attach to cells or promote functional differentiation.\n\nHighlightsO_LILaminin assembles into a fractal network when in presence of either the cell surface receptor dystroglycan or acidic glycoproteins or an acidic buffer.\nC_LIO_LIWhen this microstructure is recreated with an acidic treatment, laminin binds readily to dystroglycan null cells and induces functional differentiation of mammary epithelial cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Picolinic acid (PA) is a natural toxic pyridine derivative. Microorganisms can degrade and utilize PA for growth. However, the full metabolic pathway and its physiological and genetic foundation remain unknown. In this study, we identified the pic gene cluster responsible for the complete degradation of PA from Alcaligenes faecalis JQ135. PA was initially 6-hydroxylated into 6-hydroxypicolinic acid (6HPA) by PA dehydrogenase (PicA). 6HPA was then 3-hydroxylated by a four-component 6HPA monooxygenase (PicB) to form 3,6-dihydroxypicolinic acid (3,6DHPA), which was then converted into 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (2,5DHP) by a decarboxylase (PicC). The 2,5DHP was further degraded into fumaric acid, through PicD (2,5DHP dioxygenase), PicE (N-formylmaleamic acid deformylase), PicF (maleamic acid amidohydrolase), and PicG (maleic acid isomerase). Homologous pic gene clusters with diverse organizations were found to be widely distributed in -, {beta}-, and{gamma} -Proteobacteria. Our findings provide new insights into the microbial metabolism of environmental toxic pyridine derivatives.\n\nImportancePicolinic acid is a common metabolite of L-tryptophan and some aromatic compounds and is an important intermediate of industrial concern. Although the microbial degradation/detoxification of picolinic acid has been studied for over 50 years, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we show the pic gene cluster responsible for the complete degradation of picolinic acid into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This gene cluster was found to be widespread in other -, {beta}-, and{gamma} -Proteobacteria. These findings provide new perspective for understanding the mechanisms of picolinic acid biodegradation in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Mutualisms can be promoted by win-win mutations which directly benefit self (self-serving) and partner (partner-serving). Intuitively, partner-serving phenotype could be quantified as the benefit supply rate to partner by an individual. Here, we demonstrate the inadequacy of this thinking, and propose an alternative measure. Specifically, we evolved well-mixed mutualistic communities where two engineered yeast strains exchanged essential metabolites lysine and hypoxanthine. Among cells that consumed lysine and released hypoxanthine, a chromosome duplication mutation seemed win-win: it improved cells affinity for lysine, and increased hypoxanthine release rate per cell. However, increased release rate was due to increased cell size accompanied by increased lysine consumption per birth. Consequently this mutation is solely self-serving, since a fixed amount of intake lysine leads to an identical total hypoxanthine release rate - either by more numerous lower-releasing ancestors or fewer higher-releasing mutants. By extension, individuals with reduced benefit production rates may not be cheaters.",

    "abstract": "Predator-prey systems are ubiquitous across ecological systems. Typical ecological models focus on the dynamics of predator-prey populations. Eco-evolutionary models integrate arms race or Red-Queen like dynamics. The roles of the predator and prey species are always assumed to be static. Nevertheless, sometimes predators can bite off more than they can chew. For example, predators that encounter multiple or dangerous prey types may need to develop new predatory tactics to capture prey. We explore the dynamics of predator-prey dynamics when the prey can injure or kill the predator. This common ecological scenario places pressure on the predator to develop novel predatory tactics to both capture prey and avoid counter-attack from prey. Taking a bottom-up approach, we develop the Holling function mechanistically and then implement it in a model of innovationselection dynamics inspired by economic theory. We show how an interdisciplinary approach can be used to explain the emergence of complex predatory behaviours. Notably, our study shows why predators may hunt dangerous prey even when safe prey are available. In a broader context, we demonstrate how a multidisciplinary approach combining ecology, evolution and economics improves our understanding of a complex behavioural trait.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring primary canine lung cancers are aggressive malignancies that are increasingly common in pet dogs. They share clinicopathologic features with human lung cancers in never-smokers, but their genetic underpinnings are unknown. Through multi-platform sequencing of 88 primary canine lung tumors or cell lines, we discovered somatic, coding HER2 (ERRB2) point mutations in 38% of canine pulmonary adenocarcinomas (cPAC, 28/74), but none in adenosquamous (cPASC, 0/11) or squamous cell (cPSCC, 0/3) carcinomas. In cPASC, PTEN was the most frequently mutated gene (18%) while one case each bore likely pathogenic HRAS, KRAS, EGFR, MET, TP53, or VHL somatic mutations. In cPSCC, no recurrently mutated genes were identified, but individual somatic coding mutations were found in BRAF and PTPN11. In cPAC, we also identified recurrent somatic mutation of TP53 (13.5%), SMAD4 (5.4%), PTEN (4.1%), and VHL (2.7%). cPACs assessed by exome sequencing displayed a low somatic mutation burden (median 64 point mutations, 19 focal copy number variants, and 1 translocation). The majority (93%) of HER2 mutations were hotspot V659E transmembrane domain (TMD) mutations comparable to activating mutations at this same site in human cancer. Other HER2 mutations identified in this study were located in the extracellular domain and TMD. HER2V659E was detected in the plasma of 33% (2/6) of dogs with localized HER2V659E tumors. HER2V659E correlated with constitutive phosphorylation of AKT in cPAC cell lines and HER2V659E lines displayed hypersensitivity to the HER2 inhibitors lapatinib and neratinib relative to HER2-wild-type cell lines. These findings have translational and comparative relevance for lung cancer and HER2 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Unconventional integrated domains in plant intracellular immune receptors (NLRs) can directly bind translocated pathogen effector proteins to initiate an immune response. The rice immune receptor pairs Pik-1/Pik-2 and RGA5/RGA4 both use integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domains to bind the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pik and AVR-Pia, respectively. These effectors both belong to the MAX effector family and share a core structural fold, despite being divergent in sequence. How integrated domains maintain specificity of recognition, even for structurally similar effectors, has implications for understanding plant immune receptor evolution and function. Here we show that the rice NLR pair Pikp-1/Pikp-2 triggers an immune response leading to partial disease resistance towards the \"mismatched\" effector AVR-Pia in planta, and that the Pikp-HMA domain binds AVR-Pia in vitro. The HMA domain from another Pik-1 allele, Pikm, is unable to bind AVR-Pia, and does not trigger a response in plants. The crystal structure of Pikp-HMA bound to AVR-Pia reveals a different binding interface compared to AVR-Pik effectors, suggesting plasticity in integrated domain/effector interactions. This work shows how a single NLR can bait multiple pathogen effectors via an integrated domain, and may enable engineering immune receptors with extended disease resistance profiles.",

    "abstract": "The Social Approach Task is commonly used to identify sociability deficits when modeling liability factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mice. It was developed to expand upon assays available to examine distinct aspects of social behavior in rodents and has become a standard component of mouse ASD-relevant phenotyping pipelines. However, there is variability in the statistical analysis and interpretation of results from this task. A common analytical approach is to conduct within-group comparisons only, and then interpret a difference in significance levels as if it were a group difference, without any direct comparison. As an efficient shorthand, we named this approach EWOCs: Erroneous Within-group Only Comparisons. Here we examined the prevalence of EWOCs and used simulations to test whether it could produce misleading inferences. Our review of Social Approach studies of high-confidence ASD genes revealed 45% of papers sampled used only this analytical approach. Through simulations, we then demonstrate how a lack of significant difference within one group often doesnt correspond to a significant difference between groups, and show this erroneous interpretation increases the rate of false positives up to 25%. Finally, we define a simple solution: use an index, like a social preference score, with direct statistical comparisons between groups to identify significant differences. We also provide power calculations to guide sample size in future studies. Overall, elimination of EWOCs and adoption of direct comparisons should result in more accurate, reliable, and reproducible data interpretations from the Social Approach Task across ASD liability models.\n\nLay SummaryThe Social Approach Task is widely used to assess social behavior in mice and is frequently used in studies modeling autism. However, reviewing published studies showed nearly half do not use correct comparisons to interpret the data. Using simulated and original data, we argue the correct statistical approach is a direct comparison of scores between groups. This simple solution should reduce false positives and improve consistency of results across studies.",

However, pipelines for analysis of these datasets that provide reproducible, efficient, and interactive visualization and interpretation are sorely lacking. To address this need, we introduce Thunor, an open-source software platform to manage, analyze, and visualize large, dose-dependent cell proliferation datasets. Thunor supports both end-point and time-based proliferation assays as input. It provides a simple, user-friendly interface with interactive plots and publication-quality images of cell proliferation time courses, dose-response curves, and derived dose-response metrics, e.g. IC50, including across datasets or grouped by tags. Tags are categorical labels for cell lines and drugs, used for aggregation, visualization, and statistical analysis, e.g. cell line mutation or drug class/target pathway. A graphical plate map tool is included to facilitate plate annotation with cell lines, drugs, and concentrations upon data upload. Datasets can be shared with other users via point-and-click access control. We demonstrate the utility of Thunor to examine and gain insight from two large drug response datasets: a large, publicly available cell viability database and an in-house, high-throughput proliferation rate dataset.

    "abstract": "Microbial induced corrosion of steel structures, used for transport or storage of fuels, chemical weapons or waste radionuclides, is an environmental and economic threat. In non-sulfidic environments, the exact role of methanogens in steel corrosion is poorly understood. From the non-sulfidic, methanogenic sediments of the Baltic Sea corrosive communities were enriched using exclusively Fe0 as electron donor and CO2 as electron acceptor. Methane and acetate production were persistent for three years of successive transfers. Methanosarcina and Clostridium were attached to the Fe0, and dominated metagenome libraries. Since prior reports indicated Methanosarcina were merely commensals, consuming the acetate produced by acetogens, we investigated whether these methanogens were capable of Fe0 corrosion without bacterial partners (inhibited by an antibiotic cocktail). Unassisted, methanogens corroded Fe0 to Fe2+ at similar rates to the mixed community. Surprisingly, in the absence of competitive bacteria, Baltic-Methanosarcina produced six times more methane than they did in the mixed community. This signifies that Baltic-Methanosarcina achieved better corrosion alone, exclusive of an operative bacterial partner. Our results also show that together with acetogens, Methanosarcina interact competitively to retrieve electrons from Fe0 rather than as commensals as previously assumed.",

    "abstract": "Attention is a fundamental brain process by which we selectively prioritize relevant information in our environment. Cognitively, we can employ different methods for selecting visual information for further processing, but the extent to which these are implemented by similar or different neural processes remains unclear. Spatial and feature-selective attention both change the stimulus related information signaled by single-cells and neural populations, but relatively few studies have directly compared the effects of these distinct types of attention. We scanned participants (n=20) using MEG, while they covertly attended to an object on the left or the right of fixation (spatial attention manipulation) and reported the objects shape or color (feature-selective attention manipulation). We used multivariate pattern classification to measure population stimulus-coding in occipital and frontal areas, for attended and non-attended stimulus features, at attended and non-attended locations. In occipital cortex, we show that both spatial and feature-selective attention enhanced object representations, and the effects of these two attention types interacted multiplicatively. We also found that spatial and feature-selective attention induced qualitatively different patterns of enhancement in occipital cortex for the encoding of stimulus color. Specifically, feature-based attention primarily enhanced small color differences, while spatial attention produced greater enhancement for larger differences. We demonstrate that principles of response-gain and tuning curve sharpening that have been applied to describe the effects of attention at the level of a single neuron can account for these differences. An information flow analysis suggested that these attentional effects may be driven by feedback from frontal areas.",

    "abstract": "Visceral leishmaniasis is a major public health concern in Nepal. During the last few years, several KA outbreaks have been reported from Tarai region including Morang district. A case control study was conducted to assess the risk factors associated with VL in 5 endemic VDC of Morang district with 62 cases already treated from BPKIHS and Koshi zonal hospital and 248 controls selected randomly from the same village. Data collected using semi structured questionnaire from September to November 2013. This study revealed that people living in thatched house, sleeping in ground floor, ownership of animal, history of migration to India (Bihar and Jharkhand) and proximity to other KA cases within 50 m distance of household were strong risk factors for VL. Education remains protective (OR 0.39,95 % CI 0.19-0.79). The association with socioeconomic status showed clear dose - response effect. The odds for VL consistently decreased as the level of socioeconomic status increased (OR 4.26, 3.81). Strengthening surveillance system for early diagnosis and treatment, awareness programme and further extensive study is needed on risk factor, vector and control measures.\n\nAuthor SummaryThis study aims to explore the risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis. Based on findings there is a need to educate people in high-transmission areas how to realize, reduce or avoid environmental factors that favor the survival of the vector in the community. Similarly introduction of more exact surveillance tools in order to improve morbidity and mortality surveillance by health sector. People living in mud thatched houses need to be aware about cracks and crevices in the mud walls, their function as breeding places and how they can be controlled, for example by plastering with lime and mud.. However, a primary condition is that people need to understand the purpose of all these efforts in order to be motivated to put them into practice.",

    "abstract": "The mode of action for most mosquito repellents is unknown. This is primarily due to the difficulty in monitoring how the mosquito olfactory system responds to repellent odors. Here, we used the Q-system of binary expression to enable activity-dependent Ca2+ imaging in olfactory neurons of the African malaria mosquito Anopheles coluzzii. This system allows neuronal responses to common insect repellents to be directly visualized in living mosquitoes from all olfactory organs including the antenna. The synthetic repellents DEET and IR3535 did not activate Odorant Receptor Co-Receptor (Orco) expressing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) at any concentration, while picaridin weakly activated ORNs only at high concentrations. In contrast, natural repellents (i.e. lemongrass oil and eugenol) strongly activated small numbers of ORNs in the mosquito antennae at low concentrations. We determined that DEET, IR3535, and picaridin decrease the response of Orco expressing ORNs when these repellents are physically mixed with activating human-derived odorants. We present evidence that synthetic repellents may primarily exert their olfactory mode of action by decreasing the amount of activating ligand reaching ORNs. These results suggest that synthetic repellents disruptively change the chemical profile of host scent signatures on the skin surface rendering humans invisible to mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "With the identification of a large number of genetic loci associated with human fat distribution and its importance for metabolic health, the question arises as to what the genetic drivers for discrete fat depot expansion might be. To date most studies have focussed on conventional anthropometric measures such as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index. We searched for genetic loci determining discrete fat depots mass size using an exome-wide approach in 3 large cohorts.\n\nHere we report an exome-wide analysis of non-synonymous genetic variants in 17,212 participants in which regional fat masses were quantified using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The missense variant CCDC92S70C, previously associated with WHR, is associated specifically with reduced visceral and increased leg fat masses. Allele-specific expression analysis shows that the deleterious minor allele carrying transcript also has a constitutively higher expression. In addition, we identify two variants associated with the transcriptionally distinct fat depot arm fat (SPATA20K422R and UQCC1R51Q). SPATA20K422R, a rare novel locus with a large effect size specific to arm, and UQCC1R51Q, a common variant exome-wide significant in arm but showing similar trends in other subcutaneous fat depots. In terms of the understanding of human fat distribution, these findings suggest distinct regulation of discrete fat depot expansion.\n\nAuthor summaryHuman fat storing tissues are heterogeneous and comprise functionally and structurally distinct regional fat depots, the relative size of which appear to have significant implications for health. Whilst it is known that inter-individual differences in fat distribution have genetic drivers, studies to date have focussed on crude anthropometric approximations of region fat masses rather than precise measures. Here we describe an exome-wide analysis of a large collection of men and women who have undergone body scanning using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to better define regional fat masses and identify new genetic drivers for human fat distribution. With this approach we identify three gene regions associated with distinct fat depots which can help to explain the variation in fat distribution between people and may lead to a better understanding of the depot specific fat tissue expansion.",

That progress leads to a demand for intensive astrobiological research aimed at improving strategies of the pharmacological protection of the human cells against extreme conditions. Although routine research in space remain out of our reach, it is worth noticing that unique severe environment of the Earths stratosphere have been found to mimic subcosmic conditions, giving rise to the opportunity for use of stratospheric surface as a research model for the astrobiological studies. Our study included launching balloon into the stratosphere containing the human normal and cancer cells treated with various compounds to examine whether these medicines are capable to protect the cells against the stress caused by rapidly varying temperature, pressure and radiation, especially UV. Due to oxidative stress caused by irradiation and temperature shock, we used natural compounds which display antioxidant properties, namely catechin isolated from green tea, honokiol derived from magnolia, curcumin from turmeric and cinnamon extract. \"After-flight\" laboratory tests displayed the most active antioxidants as potential agents which can minimize harmful impact of extreme conditions to the human cells.",

We conducted genome-wide association studies of these traits using longitudinal Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) scores (reflecting alcohol consumption) and AUD diagnoses from electronic health records (EHRs) in a single, large multi-ancestry Million Veteran Program sample. Meta-analysis across population groups (N = 274,424) identified 18 genome-wide significant loci, 5 of which were associated with both traits and 13 with either AUDIT-C (N = 8) or AUD (N = 5). A significant genetic correlation between the traits reflects this overlap. However, downstream analyses revealed biologically meaningful points of divergence. Cell-type group partitioning heritability enrichment analyses indicated that central nervous system was the most significant cell type for AUDIT-C and the only significant cell type for AUD. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for both traits were associated with alcohol-related disorders in two independent samples. Genetic correlations for 188 non-alcohol-related traits were significantly different for the two traits, as were the phenotypes associated with the traits polygenic risk scores. We conclude that EHR-derived, longitudinal, repeated measures of alcohol consumption level and AUD diagnosis can facilitate genetic discovery and help to elucidate the relationship between drinking level and AUD risk. Finally, although heavy drinking is a key risk factor for AUD, it is not a sufficient cause of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "The holdfast polysaccharide adhesin is crucial for irreversible cell adhesion and biofilm formation in Caulobacter crescentus. Holdfast production is tightly controlled via developmental regulators, and environmental and physical signals. Here we identified a novel mechanism of holdfast production regulation that involves chemotaxis proteins. We characterized the two identified chemotaxis operons of C. crescentus and showed that only the previously characterized, major operon is involved in chemotactic response towards different carbon sources. However, both chemotaxis operons encoded in the C. crescentus genome play a role in biofilm formation and holdfast production, by regulating the expression of hfiA, the gene encoding the holdfast inhibitor HfiA. We show that CheA and CheB proteins act in an antagonistic manner: while the two CheA proteins negatively regulate hfiA expression, the CheB proteins are positive regulators, thus providing a modulation of holdfast synthesis and surface attachment.\n\nIMPORTANCEChemosensory pathways are major signal transduction mechanisms in bacteria. These systems are involved in chemotaxis and other cell responses to environment conditions, such as production of adhesins that enable irreversible adhesion to a surface and surface colonization. The C. crescentus genome encodes two complete chemotaxis operons. Here we characterized the second, novel chemotaxis-like operon. While only the major chemotaxis operon is involved in chemotaxis, both chemotaxis systems modulate C. crescentus adhesion by controlling expression of the holdfast synthesis inhibitor, HfiA. Thus, we identified a new level in holdfast regulation, providing new insights into the control of adhesin production that leads to the formation of biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Human noroviruses are a major cause of gastroenteritis, yet there are still no vaccines or antivirals available. Nevertheless, a number of vaccine candidates that are currently in clinical trials are composed of norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs are recognized as morphologically and antigenically similar to norovirus virions. An X-ray crystal structure of the prototype (GI.1) VLPs showed that the norovirus capsid has a T=3 icosahedral symmetry and is composed of 180 copies of the major capsid protein (VP1) that folds into three quasi-equivalent subunits (A, B, and C). In this study, we determined the cryo-EM structure of VLPs for two GII.4 noroviruses that were detected in 1974 and 2012. We showed that these VLPs had a T=4 symmetry and were composed of 240 copies of VP1. The VP1 on the T=4 VLPs adapted four quasi-equivalent subunits (termed A, B, C, and D), which formed two distinct dimers (A/B and C/D). We found that the T=4 protruding domain was elevated ~21 [A] off the capsid shell, which was ~7 [A] more than the previously determined for the T=3 GII.10 norovirus. Another interesting feature of the T=4 VLPs was a small cavity and flaplike structure located at the twofold axis. This structural feature was associated with the shell domain (D subunit) and disrupted the contiguous shell. Altogether, we showed that the T=4 VLPs had a number of structural similarities and differences with other noroviruses, but how these structural changes associate with norovirus virions could be important for vaccine studies.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe discovery that the GII.4 VLPs (identified in 1974 and 2012, termed CHDC-1974 and NSW-2012, respectively) have a T=4 symmetry is of major significance, since the NSW-2012 is clinically important and previous structural and biochemical studies assumed noroviruses have a T=3 symmetry and are composed of 180 copies of VP1. More importantly, NSW-2012 norovirus shared 96% amino acid identity with a GII.4 vaccine candidate and our data suggests that this vaccine might also have a T=4 symmetry. Although it is not clear if the T=4 VLPs were an artifact of the insect cell expression system, the T=4 VLP vaccines might not recognize equivalent epitopes on T=3 virions, which will be important for future neutralization studies. Finally, further studies with other norovirus genotypes and virions are clearly needed in order to determine the level of this structural diversity.",

    "abstract": "Taste perception changes with obesity but the underlying neural changes remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we recorded taste responses from single cells in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS, the fist central synapse in the gustatory circuit) in awake, diet-induced obese [(DIO; [&ge;]8wks on a high-energy diet (HED)] and lean rats. Rats were implanted with a bundle of microelectrodes in the NTS and allowed to recover. Water-deprived rats were allowed to freely lick various tastants in an experimental chamber. Taste stimuli included an array of sapid stimuli dissolved in artificial saliva (AS). Each taste trial consisted of 5 consecutive licks followed by 5 AS licks presented on a VR5 schedule. Results showed that taste responses in NTS cells in DIO rats (n=49) were smaller in magnitude, shorter in duration and longer in latency that those in lean rats (n=74). However, there were proportionately more taste-responsive cells in DIO than in lean rats. Lick coherence in DIO rats was significantly lower than in lean rats, both in taste-responsive and lick-related cells (n=172 in lean; n=65 in DIO). Analyses of temporal coding showed that taste cells in DIO rats conveyed less information about taste quality than cells in lean rats. Collectively, results suggest that a HED produces blunted, but more prevalent, responses to taste in the NTS and a weakened association of taste responses with ingestive behavior. These neural adaptations may represent both negative effects and compensatory mechanisms of a HED that may underlie deficits in taste-related behavior associated with obesity.",

    "abstract": "Broadband High-frequency Activity (BHA; 70-150 Hz), also known as \\\"high gamma,\\\" a key analytic signal in human intracranial recordings is often assumed to reflect local neural firing (multiunit activity; MUA). Accordingly, BHA has been used to study neuronal population responses in auditory (1,2), visual (3,4), language (5), mnemonic processes (6-9) and cognitive control (10,11). BHA is arguably the electrophysiological measure best correlated with the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in fMRI (12-13). However, beyond the fact that BHA correlates with neuronal spiking (12, 14-16), the neuronal populations and physiological processes generating BHA are not precisely defined. Although critical for interpreting intracranial signals in human and non-human primates, the precise physiology of BHA remains unknown. Here, we show that BHA dissociates from MUA in primary visual and auditory cortex. Using laminar multielectrode data in monkeys, we found a bimodal distribution of stimulus-evoked BHA across depth of a cortical column: an early-deep, followed by a later-superficial layer response. Only, the early-deep layer BHA had a clear local MUA correlate, while the more prominent superficial layer BHA had a weak or undetectable MUA correlate. In many cases, particularly in V1 (70%), supragranular sites showed strong BHA in lieu of any detectable increase in MUA. Due to volume conduction, BHA from both the early-deep and the later-supragranular generators contribute to the field potential at the pial surface, though the contribution may be weighted towards the late-supragranular BHA. Our results demonstrate that the strongest generators of BHA are in the superficial cortical layers and show that the origins of BHA include a mixture of the neuronal action potential firing and dendritic processes separable from this firing. It is likely that the typically-recorded BHA signal emphasizes the latter processes to a greater extent than previously recognized.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 2,500 years, contemplative traditions have explored the nature of the mind using meditation. More recently, neuroimaging research on meditation has revealed differences in brain function and structure in meditators. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. In order to understand how meditation shapes global activity through the brain, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole-brain functional network using the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different states of consciousness differ in their underlying dynamical complexity, i.e., how the broadness of communication is elicited and distributed through the brain over time and space. In this work, controls and experienced meditators were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). Our results evidenced that the dynamical complexity underlying meditation shows less complexity than during resting-state in the meditator group but not in the control group. Furthermore, we report that during resting-state, the brain activity of experienced meditators showed higher metastability (i.e., a wider dynamical regime over time) than the one observed in the control group. Overall, these results indicate that the meditation state operates in a different dynamical regime than the resting-state.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is growing evidence that secondary motor areas are relevant for recovery after motor stroke. Communication among brain areas occurs via synchronization of oscillatory activity which can potentially be modulated via transcranial alternating-current stimulation (tACS).\\n\\nHypothesisWe hypothesized that tACS to secondary motor areas of the stroke-lesioned hemisphere leads to modulation of task-related connectivity among primary and secondary motor areas, reflected in metrics of EEG coupling in the frequency domain.\\n\\nMethodsWe applied focal tACS at 1mA peak-to-peak intensity to ipsilesional ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in chronic stroke patients while they moved their impaired hand. To probe effects of stimulation on cortical oscillations, several task-related EEG-based connectivity metrics (coherence, imaginary coherence, phase-locking value, mutual information) were assessed before and after each stimulation.\\n\\nResultsOverall, we found significant but weak modulations of the motor network by tACS. Stimulation of PMv reduced task-related coupling between (i) both primary motor cortices (M1) (coherence, -0.0514{+/-}0.0665 (mean{+/-}SD, active stimulation) vs. 0.0085{+/-}0.0888 (sham), p=0.0029) and (ii) between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional PMv (coherence, - 0.0386{+/-}0.0703 vs. 0.0226{+/-}0.0694, p=0.0283; phase-locking value, -0.0363{+/-}0.0581 vs. 0.0036{+/-}0.0497, p=0.0097) compared with sham stimulation.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this exploratory analysis, tACS to the ipsilesional PMv induced a weak decrease of task-related connectivity between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional M1 and PMv. As an excess of interhemispheric coupling is under discussion as maladaptive phenomenon of motor reorganization after stroke (e.g., bimodal balance-recovery model), tACS-induced reduction of coupling might be an interesting approach to assist re-normalization of the post-stroke motor network.",

To examine potential developmental mechanisms driving sex disparity in risk for anxiety and depression, we established a two-hit developmental stress model including maternal separation in early life followed by social isolation in adolescence. Our study shows complex interactions between early-life and adolescent stress, between stress and sex, and between stress and female estrogen status in shaping behavioral phenotypes of adult animals. In general, increased locomotor activity and body weight reduction were the only two phenotypes where two stressors showed synergistic activity. In terms of anxiety- and depression-related phenotypes, single exposure to early-life stress had the most significant impact and was female-specific. We show that early-life stress disrupts the protective role of estrogen in females, and promotes female vulnerability to anxiety- and depression-related phenotypes associated with the low-estrogenic state. We found plausible transcriptional and epigenetic alterations in psychiatric risk genes, Nr3c1 and Cacna1c, that likely contributed to the stress-induced behavioral effects. In addition, two general transcriptional regulators, Egr1 and Dnmt1, were found to be dysregulated in maternally-separated females and in animals exposed to both stressors, respectively, providing insights into possible transcriptional mechanisms that underlie behavioral phenotypes. Our findings provide a novel insight into developmental risk factors and biological mechanisms driving sex differences in depression and anxiety disorders, facilitating the search for more effective, sex-specific treatments for these disorders.",
