    "abstract": "Epithelial organ size and shape depend on cell shape changes, cell-matrix communication and apical membrane growth. The Drosophila embryonic tracheal network is an excellent model to study these processes. Here, we show that the transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway, Yorkie (YAP in vertebrates), plays distinct roles in the developing Drosophila airways. Yorkie exerts a cytoplasmic function by binding Drosophila Twinstar, the orthologue of the vertebrate actin-severing protein Cofilin, to regulate F-actin levels and apical cell membrane size, which are required for proper tracheal tube elongation. Second, Yorkie controls water-tightness of tracheal tubes by transcriptional regulation of the enzyme{delta} -aminolevulinate synthase (Alas). We conclude that Yorkie has a dual role in tracheal development to ensure proper tracheal growth and functionality.\n\nShort SummaryThis work identified an alternative role of the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki) in controlling water impermeability and tube size of the developing Drosophila airways. Tracheal impermeability is triggered by Yki-mediated transcriptional regulation of{delta} -aminolevulinate synthase, Alas, whereas tube elongation is controlled by binding of Yki to the actin severing factor Twinstar.",

    "abstract": "The Pseudomonas syringae acetyltransferase HopZ1a is delivered directly into host cells by the type III secretion system to promote bacterial growth. However, in the model plant host Arabidopsis thaliana, HopZ1a activity results in an effector-triggered immune response (ETI) that limits bacterial proliferation. HopZ1a-triggered immunity requires the nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat domain (NLR) protein, ZAR1, and the ZED1 pseudokinase. Here we demonstrate that HopZ1a can acetylate members of a family of  receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCK family VII; also known as PBS1-like kinases, or PBLs) and promote their interaction with ZED1 and ZAR1 to form a ZAR1/ZED1/PBL ternary complex. Interactions between ZED1 and PBL kinases are determined by the pseudokinase features of ZED1, and mutants designed to restore ZED1 kinase motifs can (1) bind to PBLs, (2) recruit ZAR1, and (3) trigger immunity in planta, all independently of HopZ1a. Our results suggest that interactions between these two RLCK families are promoted by perturbations of structural features that distinguish active from inactive kinase domain conformations. We propose that effector-induced interactions between ZED1/ZRK pseudokinases (RLCK family XII) and PBL kinases (RLCK family VII) provide a sensitive mechanism for detecting perturbations of either kinase family and activating ZAR1-mediated ETI.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAll plants must ward off potentially infectious microbes, and those grown in large-scale crop operations are especially vulnerable to the rapid spread of disease by successful pathogens. Although many bacteria and fungi can supress plant immune responses by producing specialized virulence proteins called  effectors, these effectors can also trigger immune responses that render plants resistant to infection. We studied the molecular mechanisms underlying one such effector-triggered immune response elicited by the bacterial effector HopZ1a in the model plant host Arabidopsis thaliana. We have shown that HopZ1a promotes binding between a ZED1, a  pseudokinase required for HopZ1a-triggered immunity, and several  true kinases (known as PBLs) that are likely targets of HopZ1a activity in planta. HopZ1a-induced ZED1-PBL interactions also recruit ZAR1, an Arabidopsis  resistance protein previously implicated in HopZ1a-triggered immunity. Importantly, ZED1 mutants that restore degenerate kinase motifs can bridge interactions between PBLs and ZAR1 (independently of HopZ1a) and trigger immunity in planta. Our results suggest that equilibria between active and inactive kinase domain conformations regulate ZED1-PBL interactions and formation of ternary complexes with ZAR1. Improved models describing molecular interactions between immunity determinants, effectors and effector targets will inform efforts to exploit natural diversity for development of crops with enhanced disease resistance.",

    "abstract": "Basal ganglia dysfunctions have been suggested to play a causal role in the pathophysiology of most motor and non-motor symptoms of movement disorders as Tourette Syndrome (TS) or Parkinsons Disease (PD). Intra/post-operative recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) procedures in PD patients have highlighted specific pathological patterns of neural activity. Spatial and temporal patterns of STN neural activity in TS are still unknown due to the lack of direct microrecordings in humans. Here, we describe for the first time specific neural activities of sensorimotor STN in TS patients, as recorded during intraoperative microrecordings. We analyzed 125 single units at 0.5 mm-spaced depths from the STN of anesthetized TS patients and we observed a large fraction of units (39/125, 31.2%) intensely bursting in the delta band (<4 Hz). In anesthetized PD patients we found similar average firing rate and spectral density of STN units, but differently to TS patients, only 4/54 (7.4%) of the units displayed bursting. Remarkably, bursting units in TS STN were not homogeneously distributed over the dorso-ventral trajectory of the recording: the highest density of bursting units was reliably found at the depth for which the clinical effect was maximal. Our results provide an unprecedented characterization of STN functional architecture and single units dynamics in TS patients, paving the way to an understanding of the role of STN subterritories in TS.\n\nKey PointsO_LISingle neuron activity in Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) of patients with Tourette Syndrome (TS) was analyzed for the first time in literature.\nC_LIO_LIFiring rate and spectral content of single STN neurons in TS patients were found to be similar to those of anesthetized PD patients, while the analysis of arrhythmic bursting activity revealed that in TS patients the STN is characterized by a larger fraction of bursting neurons and more intense bursts\nC_LIO_LIBursting activity in TS was widespread across the whole STN, but with a higher density at the optimal lead location depth for DBS\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Although the three-dimensional structures of mouse and Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase are very similar, their responses to the covalent sulfonylating agents benzenesulfonyl fluoride and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride are qualitatively different. Both agents inhibit the mouse enzyme effectively by covalent modification of its active-site serine. In contrast, whereas the Torpedo enzyme is effectively inhibited by benzenesulfonyl fluoride, it is completely resistant to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A bottleneck midway down the active-site gorge in both enzymes restricts access of ligands to the active site at the bottom of the gorge. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the mouse enzyme is substantially more flexible than the Torpedo enzyme, suggesting that enhanced  breathing motions of the mouse enzyme relative to the Torpedo enzyme might explain why phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride can reach the active site in mouse acetylcholinesterase, but not in the Torpedo enzyme. Accordingly, we performed docking of the two sulfonylating agents to the two enzymes, followed by molecular dynamics simulations. Whereas benzenesulfonyl fluoride closely approached the active-site serine in both mouse and Torpedo acetylcholinesterase in such simulations, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was able to approach the active-site serine of mouse acetylcholinesterase - but remained trapped above the bottleneck in the case of the Torpedo enzyme. Our studies demonstrate that reliance on docking tools in drug design can produce misleading information. Docking studies should, therefore, also be complemented by molecular dynamics simulations in selection of lead compounds.\n\nAuthor summaryEnzymes are protein molecules that catalyze chemical reactions in living organisms, and are essential for their physiological functions. Proteins have well defined three-dimensional structures, but display flexibility; it is believed that this flexibility, known as their dynamics, plays a role in their function. Here we studied the neuronal enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. The active site of this enzyme is deeply buried, and accessed by a narrow gorge. A particular inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, is known to inhibit mouse acetylcholinesterase, but not that of the electric fish, Torpedo, even though their structures are very similar. A theoretical technique called molecular dynamics (MD) shows that the mouse enzyme is more flexible than the Torpedo enzyme. Furthermore, when the movement of the inhibitor down the gorge towards the active site is simulated using MD, the phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride can reach the active site in the mouse enzyme, but not in the Torpedo enzyme, in which it remains trapped midway down the gorge. Our study emphasizes the importance of taking into account not only structure, but also dynamics, in designing drugs targeted towards proteins.",

This study assessed family cost at neonatal intensive care units of two hospitals in the state of Kedah, Malaysia. Familys expenditure was obtained using a structured questionnaire. 126 families who were government employed spent a mean total cost of MYR 549 (MYR 0 - MYR 4,700) compared to MYR 650 (MYR 40 - MYR 9,300) for 244 families who were not government employed. Mean income loss was MYR 310 (MYR 0 - MYR 15,000) and MYR 348 (MYR 0 - MYR 5,500) respectively. Travel expenses was the cost driver for all families. 15% of families in this study were already living below the income poverty line and majority were not government employed. For the rest of the families, 21% became impoverished when one month household income was used for hospitalization cost but this lowered to 9% with cumulative household income by length of hospital stay. Overall incidence of catastrophic health expenditure among families was 38%. Using multivariable logistic regression household income and residential location were predictive factors for catastrophic health expenditure. Despite universal health coverage through subsidy of direct medical (hospital) cost, the high incidence of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment among families of preterm infants was attributable to out of pocket payment for direct non-medical cost (such as travel and food) and indirect cost from income loss. Government employed families with an array of employment benefits appear better protected against financial hardship compared to those in private sector or self-employed. Remedial measures include improving neonatal intensive care unit rooming-in service for mothers, complementary financial assistance for families and enhancing universal health coverage through affordable social health insurance for infant healthcare.",

To investigate sustained visual attention, we assessed visuocortical alpha suppression in response to conditioned and extinguished threat. N = 87 participants underwent a two-day threat conditioning paradigm with acquisition and extinction on one day and a critical recall test one day later. EEG time-frequency analyses revealed that, on Day 2, threat-conditioned vs. safety cues evoked stronger occipital alpha power suppression from 600 to 1200 ms. Notably, this suppression was resistant to extinction. The present study showed for the first time that threat conditioning enhances sustained modulation of visuocortical attention to threat in the long term. The long-term stability and extinction resistance of alpha suppression suggests a crucial role of visuocortical attention mechanisms in the maintenance of learned fears.",

    "abstract": "GDE2 is a six-transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase with phospholipase D-like activity that cleaves select glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and thereby influences biological signaling cascades. GDE2 promotes neuronal differentiation cell-autonomously through glypican cleavage and is a prognostic marker in neuroblastoma, while GDE2 deficiency causes progressive neurodegeneration in mice and developmental defects in zebrafish. However, the regulation of GDE2 remains unclear. Here we show that in undifferentiated neuronal cells, GDE2 undergoes constitutive internalization and traffics back along both fast and slow recycling routes, while a small percentage is sorted to late endosomes. GDE2 trafficking is dictated by distinctive C-terminal tail sequences that determine secretion, endocytosis and recycling preference, respectively, and thereby regulate GDE2 function both positively and negatively. Our study reveals the sequence determinants of GDE2 trafficking and surface localization, and provides insight into the control of GPI-anchored protein activities with potential implications for nervous system disorders associated with impaired trafficking and beyond.",

The demand and cost of initial hospitalization has also increased. This study assessed care provider cost in neonatal intensive care units of two hospitals in the state of Kedah, Malaysia.

A total of 112 preterm infants were recruited from intensive care (93 infants) and minimal care (19 infants). Majority were from the moderate (23%) and late (36%) preterm groups followed by very preterm (32%) and extreme preterm (9%). Mean total cost per infant increased with level of care and degree of prematurity from MYR 2,751 (MYR 374 - MYR 10,103) for preterm minimal care, MYR 8,478 (MYR 817 - MYR 47,354) for late preterm intensive care to MYR 41,598 (MYR 25,351- MYR 58,828) for extreme preterm intensive care.

Cost was dominated by overhead (fixed) costs for general (hospital), intermediate (clinical support services) and final (NICU) cost centers where it constituted at least three quarters of mean admission cost per infant while the remainder was consumables (variable) costs. Breakdown of overhead cost showed NICU specific overhead contributing at least two thirds of mean admission cost per infant. Personnel salary made up three quarters of NICU specific overhead. Laboratory investigation was the cost driver for consumables ranging from 29% (intensive care) to 84% (minimal care) of mean total consumables cost per infant.

    "abstract": "Cocaine addiction is a major health concern with limited effective treatment options. A better understanding of mechanisms underlying relapse may help inform the development of new pharmacotherapies. Emerging evidence suggests that collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) regulates presynaptic excitatory neurotransmission and contributes to pathological changes during diseases, such as neuropathic pain and substance use disorders. We examined the role of CRMP2 and its interactions with a known binding partner, CaV2.2, in cocaine-seeking behavior. We employed the rodent self-administration model of relapse to drug-seeking and focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) for its well-established role in reinstatement behaviors. Our results indicated that repeated cocaine self-administration resulted in a dynamic and persistent alteration in the PFC expression of CRMP2 and its binding partner, the CaV2.2 (N-type) voltage-gated calcium channel. Following cocaine self-administration and extinction training, the expression of both CRMP2 and CaV2.2 was reduced relative to Yoked saline controls. By contrast, cued-reinstatement potentiated CRMP2 expression and increased CaV2.2 expression above extinction levels. Lastly, we utilized the recently developed peptide myr-TAT-CBD3 to disrupt the interaction between CRMP2 and CaV2.2 in vivo. We assessed the reinstatement behavior after infusing this peptide directly into the medial PFC and found that it decreased cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Taken together, these data suggest that neuroadaptations in the CRMP2/CaV2.2 signaling cascade in the PFC can facilitate drug seeking behavior. Targeting such interactions has implications for the treatment of cocaine relapse behavior.",

During movie watching, stability in the primary visual cortex was decreased, which was associated with larger DFC variation with neighboring regions.

    "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an inherited autoinflammatory syndrome caused by mutations in the MEFV gene. MEFV variants are still in large part classified as variant of uncertain significance (VOUS), or with classification unresolved, posing significant challenges in the clinical diagnosis of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). REVEL is a recently developed variant metapredictor tool. To reduce the number of MEFV variants with ambiguous classification we extracted the REVEL score for all missense variants reported at the locus specific database INFEVERS, and analyzed its correlation with expert-based classification and localization in the MEFV-encoded pyrin protein functional domains.\n\nThe data set of 216 missense variants was divided in four classification categories (BENIGN, VOUS, PATHOGENIC and UNRESOLVED). MEFV variants were plotted onto the pyrin protein, the distribution of REVEL scores in each category was computed and means, confidence intervals, and area under the receiver operating curve were calculated.\n\nWe observed a non-random distribution of pathogenic variants along the functional domains of the pyrin protein. The REVEL scores demonstrated a good correlation with the consensus classification of the International Study Group for Systemic Autoinflammatory Diseases (INSAID). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for different cutoff values of REVEL scores and a gene-specific threshold was computed with confidence boundary limits. A REVEL score of 0.298 was the best performing cut-off to reclassify 96 MEFV gene variants previously of uncertain significance or unsolved thus reducing their proportion from 61.6% to 17.6%.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of available expert information with highly sensitive predictor tools yields to more accurate interpretation of clinical consequences of MEFV gene variants. This approach should bring to a better genetic counseling and patient management.\n\nAuthor summaryWe aimed to refine MEFV gene variants classification using the metapredictor REVEL. We demonstrate that a gene-specific threshold is effective for accurate variants classification. Using this threshold, we reduced significantly the proportion of MEFV variants with an ambiguous classification. The proposed classification could represent a useful resource for variant interpretation in the context of FMF diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections (NSTIs), often reaching the deep fascia and muscle, are mainly caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) and to a lesser extent by Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Conversely SA is a leading etiologic agent of pyomyositis suggesting that SA could have a specific tropism for the muscle. To assess the pathogenicity of these two bacterial species for muscles cells in comparison to keratinocytes, adhesion and invasion of NSTI-GAS and NSTI-SA were assessed on these cells. Bloodstream infections (BSI) SA isolates and non-invasive coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) isolates were used as controls.\n\nSA isolates from NSTI and from BSI exhibited stronger internalization into human keratinocytes and myoblasts than CNS or NSTI-GAS. While the median level of SA internalization culminated at 2% in human keratinocytes, it reached over 30% in human myoblasts due to a higher percentage of infected myoblasts (>11%) as compared to keratinocytes (<3%) assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Higher cytotoxicity for myoblasts of NSTI-SA as compared to BSI-SA, was attributed to higher levels of psm and RNAIII transcripts in NSTI group as compared to hematogenous group. However, the two groups were not discriminated at the genomic level. The cellular basis of high internalization rate in myoblasts was attributed to higher expression of 5{beta}1 integrin in myoblasts as compared to keratinocytes. Major contribution of FnbpAB-integrin 5{beta}1 pathway to internalization was confirmed by isogenic mutants.\n\nOur findings suggest the contribution of NSTI-SA severity by its unique propensity to invade and kill myoblasts, a property not shared by NSTI-GAS.\n\nImportanceNecrotizing Soft Tissue Infection (NSTI) is a severe infection caused mainly by group A Streptococcus (GAS) and occasionally by S. aureus (SA); the latter being more often associated with pyomyositis. NSTIs frequently involve the deep fascia and may provoke muscle necrosis. The goal of this study was to determine the tropism and pathogenicity of these two bacterial species for muscle cells. The results revealed a high tropism of SA for myoblasts and myotubes followed by cytotoxicity as opposed to GAS that did not invade these cells. This study uncover a novel mechanism of SA contribution to NSTI with a direct muscle involvement, while in GAS NSTI this is likely indirect, for instance, secondary to vascular occlusion.",
