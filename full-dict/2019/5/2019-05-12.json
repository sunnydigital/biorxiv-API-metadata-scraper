    "abstract": "Non-random mating has a significant impact on the evolution of organisms. Here, I developed a modelling framework for discrete traits (with any number of phenotypes) to explore different models connecting the non-random mating causes (intra sexual competition and/or mate choice) and their consequences (sexual selection and/or assortative mating).\n\nI derived the formulas for the maximum likelihood estimates of each model and used information criteria for performing multimodel inference. Simulation results showed a good performance of both model selection and parameter estimation. The methodology was applied to data from Galician Littorina saxatilis ecotypes, to show that the mating pattern is better described by models with two parameters that involve both mate choice and intrasexual competition, generating positive assortative mating plus female sexual selection.\n\nAs far as I know, this is the first standardized methodology for model selection and multimodel inference of mating parameters for discrete traits. The advantages of this framework include the ability of setting up models from which the parameters connect causes, as intrasexual competition and mate choice, with their outcome in the form of data patterns of sexual selection and assortative mating. For some models, the parameters may have a double effect i.e. they cause both kind of patterns, while for others models there are separated parameters for one kind of pattern or another.\n\nThe full methodology was implemented in a software called InfoMating (available at http://acraaj.webs6.uvigo.es/InfoMating/Infomating.htm).",

    "abstract": "The plasma membrane and cytoskeleton of living cells are closely coupled dynamical systems. Internal cytoskeletal elements such as actin filaments and microtubules continually exert forces on the membrane, resulting in the formation of membrane protrusions. In this paper we investigate the interplay between the shape of a cell distorted by pushing and pulling forces generated by microtubules and the resulting rearrangement of the microtubule network. From analytical calculations, we find that two microtubules that deform the vesicle can both attract or repel each other, depending on their angular separations and the direction of the imposed forces. We also show how the existence of attractive interactions between multiple microtubules can be deduced analytically, and further explore general interactions through Monte Carlo simulations. Our results suggest that the commonly reported parallel structures of microtubules in both biological and artificial systems can be a natural consequence of membrane mediated interactions.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation of cytosine residues across the genome influences how genes and phenotypes are regulated in a wide range of organisms. As such, understanding the role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms has become very much a part of mapping genotype to phenotype, a major question in evolutionary biology. Ideally, we would like to manipulate DNA methylation patterns on a genome-wide scale, to help us to elucidate the role that epigenetic modifications play in phenotypic expression. Recently, the demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; commonly used in the epigenetic treatment of certain cancers), has been deployed to explore the epigenetic regulation of a number of traits of interest to evolutionary ecologists, including facultative sex allocation in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. In a recent study, we showed that treatment with 5-aza-dC did not ablate the facultative sex allocation response in Nasonia, but shifted the patterns of sex allocation in a way predicted by genomic conflict theory. This was the first (albeit indirect) experimental evidence for genomic conflict over sex allocation facilitated by DNA methylation. However, that work lacked direct evidence of the effects of 5-aza-dC on DNA methylation, and indeed the effect of the chemical has since been questioned in Nasonia. Here, using whole-genome bisulphite sequencing of more than 4 million CpGs, across more than 11,000 genes, we demonstrate unequivocally that 5-aza-dC disrupts methylation on a large scale across the Nasonia vitripennis genome. We show that the disruption can lead to both hypo- and hyper-methylation, may vary across tissues and time of sampling, and that the effects of 5-aza-dC are context- and sequence specific. We conclude that 5-aza-dC does indeed have the potential to be repurposed as a tool for studying the role of DNA methylation in evolutionary ecology, whilst many details of its action remain to be discovered.\n\nAuthor SummaryShedding light on the mechanistic basis of phenotypes is a major aim in the field of evolutionary biology. If we understand how phenotypes are controlled at the molecular level, we can begin to understand how evolution has shaped that phenotype and conversely, how genetic architecture may constrain trait evolution. Epigenetic markers (such as DNA methylation) also influence phenotypic expression by regulating how and when genes are expressed. Recently, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a hypomethylating agent used in the treatment of certain cancers, has been used to explore the epigenetic regulation of traits of interest to evolutionary ecologists. Previously, we used 5-aza-dC to validate a role for DNA methylation in facultative sex allocation behaviour in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis. However, the direct effects of the chemical were not examined at that point and its efficacy in insects was questioned. Here, we demonstrate that 5-aza-dC disrupts DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale in a context- and sequence-specific manner and results in both hypo- and hyper-methylation. Our work demonstrates that 5-aza-dC has the potential to be repurposed as a tool for studying the role of DNA methylation in phenotypic expression.",

Despite the similarity in behavior between these two contexts, previous efforts to reconcile these observations in terms of a consistent pattern of time preferences have failed. Here, via extensive behavioral testing and quantitative modeling, we show that rats exhibit similar time preferences in both contexts: they prefer immediate vs. delayed rewards and they are sensitive to opportunity costs -- delays to future decisions. Further, a quasi-hyperbolic discounting model, a form of hyperbolic discounting with separate components for short-and long-term rewards, explains individual rats time preferences across both contexts, providing evidence for a common mechanism for myopic behavior in foraging and intertemporal choice.",

Their common regulatory factors and functional mechanisms can be targeted applying multi-target drugs including Metformin (MTFN) and Curcumin (CURC). In this study, we used in-silico approaches to study the potential underlying mechanisms of this co-treatment strategy on BC and DM2 in order to introduce novel therapeutic targets.\\n\\nThe total number of 48 shared differentially expressed genes (17 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated) were identified through establishing diseases protein-protein network and BC RNA-sequencing expression data. The integration of functional clustering and pathway analyses revealed that the most involved cellular pathways and processes are regard to cells proliferation, death, migration, and response to external stimulus. Afterwards, the MTFN/CURC correlation and co-treatment optimization was probed through response surface methodology (RSM) based on MCF7 cell line and confirmed by MDA-MB-231. Combination index calculation by MTT viability assay proved supportive effects on both cell lines. The superior apoptotic potential of co-treatment compared to single treatments was shown on inhibition of MCF7 proliferation and induction of cell death demonstrated by cell body co-staining and flow cytometry as well as gene expression analysis via RT-PCR. Furthermore, wound-healing scratch assay showed that this co-treatment has a slightly higher effect on migration inhibition compared to single treatments.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our study used in-silico and in-vitro approaches and introduced a potential regulatory panel between BC and DM2. We also provided a linear model and equation that show the positive relation of drugs co-treatment.

    "abstract": "Previous evidence suggests different cortical areas naturally oscillate at distinct frequencies, reflecting tuning properties of each region. The concurrent use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to perturb cortical regions, resulting in an observed post-stimulation response that is maximal at the natural frequency of that region. However, little is known about the spatial extent of TMS-induced activation differences in cortical regions when comparing resting state (passive) versus active task performance. Here, we employed TMS-EEG to directly perturb three cortical areas in the right hemisphere while measuring the resultant changes in maximal evoked frequency in healthy human subjects during a resting state (N=12) and during an active sensorimotor task (N=12). Our results revealed that the brain engages a higher dominant frequency mode when actively engaged in a task, such that the frequency evoked during a task is consistently higher across cortical regions, regardless of the region stimulated. These findings suggest that a distinct characteristic of active performance versus resting state is a higher state of natural cortical frequencies.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of host specialization has been studied intensively, yet it is still often difficult to determine why parasites do not evolve broader niches - in particular when the available hosts are closely related and ecologically similar. Here, we used an experimental evolution approach to study the evolution of host specialization, and its underlying traits, in two sympatric parasites: Anostracospora rigaudi and Enterocytospora artemiae, microsporidians infecting the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana and Artemia parthenogenetica. In the field, both parasites regularly infect both hosts, yet experimental work has revealed that they are each partially specialized. We serially passaged the parasites on one, the other, or an alternation of the two hosts; after ten passages, we assayed the infectivity, virulence, and spore production rate of the evolved lines. In accordance with previous studies, A. rigaudi maintained a higher fitness on A. parthenogenetica, and E. artemiae on A. franciscana, in all treatments. The origin of this specialization was not infectivity, which readily evolved and traded off weakly between the host species for both parasites. Instead, the overall specialization was caused by spore production, which did not evolve in any treatment. This suggests the existence of a strong trade-off between spore production in A. franciscana and spore production in A. parthenogenetica, making this trait a barrier to the evolution of generalism in this system. This study highlights that the shape of between-host trade-offs can be very heterogeneous across parasite traits, so that only some traits are pivotal to specialization.",

We report widespread cryptic variation in the requirement for two key regulatory inputs, SKN-1/Nrf2 and MOM-2/Wnt, into the C. elegans endoderm GRN. While some natural variants show a nearly absolute requirement for these two regulators, in others, most embryos differentiate endoderm in their absence. GWAS and analysis of recombinant inbred lines reveal multiple genetic regions underlying this broad phenotypic variation. We observe a reciprocal trend, in which genomic variants, or knockdown of endoderm regulatory genes, that result in a high SKN-1 requirement often show low MOM-2/Wnt requirement and vice-versa, suggesting that cryptic variation in the endoderm GRN may be tuned by opposing requirements for these two key regulatory inputs. These findings reveal that while the downstream components in the endoderm GRN are common across metazoan phylogeny, initiating regulatory inputs are remarkably plastic even within a single species.",

    "abstract": "As part of its response to a perturbation, an animal often needs to reposition its body. Inertia acts to oppose motion, delaying the completion of the movement--we refer to this additional elapsed time as inertial delay. As animal size increases, muscle moment arms also increase, but muscles are proportionally weaker, and limb inertia is proportionally larger. Consequently, the scaling of inertial delays is complex. Here, we quantify it using two biomechanical models representing common scenarios in animal locomotion: a distributed mass pendulum approximating swing limb repositioning (swing task), and an inverted pendulum approximating whole body posture recovery (posture task). We parameterized the anatomical, muscular, and inertial properties of these models using literature scaling relationships, then determined inertial delay for each task across a large range of movement magnitudes and the full range of terrestrial mammal sizes. We found that inertial delays scaled with an average of M0.28 in the swing task and M0.35 in the posture task across movement magnitudes--larger animals require more absolute time to perform the same movement as small animals. The time available to complete a movement also increases with animal size, but less steeply. Consequently, inertial delays comprise a greater fraction of swing duration and other characteristic movement times in larger animals. We also compared inertial delays to the other component delays within the stimulus-response pathway. As movement magnitude increased, inertial delays exceeded these sensorimotor delays, and this occurred for smaller movements in larger animals. Inertial delays appear to be a challenge for motor control, particularly for bigger movements in larger animals.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication promotes adaptive evolution in two principle ways: allowing one duplicate to evolve a new function and resolving adaptive conflicts by splitting ancestral functions between the duplicates. In an apparent departure from both scenarios, low-expressing transcription factor (TF) duplicates commonly regulate similar sets of genes and act in overlapping conditions. To examine for possible benefits of such apparently redundant duplicates, we examined the budding yeast duplicated stress regulators Msn2 and Msn4. We show that Msn2,4 indeed function as one unit, inducing the same set of target genes in overlapping conditions, yet this two-factor composition allows its expression to be both environmental-responsive and with low-noise, thereby resolving an adaptive conflict that inherently limits expression of single genes. Our study exemplified a new model for evolution by gene duplication whereby duplicates provide adaptive benefit through cooperation, rather than functional divergence: attaining two-factor dynamics with beneficial properties that cannot be achieved by a single gene.",

    "abstract": "WRINKLED1 (WRI1) is a transcriptional activator that binds to AW boxes in the promoters of many genes from central metabolism and FA synthesis, resulting in their transcription. BIOTIN ATTACHMENT DOMAIN-CONTAINING (BADC) proteins are homologs of BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN (BCCP) that lack a biotin-attachment domain and are therefore inactive. In the presence of excess FA, BADC1 and BADC3 are primarily responsible for the observed long-term irreversible inhibition of ACETYL-COA CARBOXYLASE (ACCase), and consequently FA synthesis. Purified WRI1 bound with high affinity (Kds in the low nanomolar range) to canonical AW-boxes from the promoters of all three BADC genes. Consistent with this observation, the expression of BADC1, BADC2 and BADC3 genes and BADC1 protein levels were reduced in wri1-1 relative to wild type (WT), and BADCs gene expression and BADC1 protein levels also were elevated upon WRI1 overexpression. The double mutant badc1badc2 phenocopied wri1-1 with respect to both reduction in root length, and elevation of indole-3-acetic acid-Asp (IAA-Asp) levels relative to WT. Overexpression of BADC1 in wri1-1 decreased its IAA-Asp and partially rescued its short-root phenotype demonstrating a role for BADCs in seedling establishment. That WRI1 positively regulates genes encoding both FA synthesis and BADCs i.e., conditional inhibitors of FA synthesis, represents a coordinated mechanism to achieve lipid homeostasis in which plants couple the transcription their FA synthetic capacity with their capacity to biochemically downregulate it.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryWRI1 regulates genes encoding both fatty acid synthesis and inhibitors of FA synthesis (BADCs), creating a lipid homeostatic mechanism in which the transcription of FA synthetic capacity is coordinated with the capacity to biochemically downregulate FA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mutans, a bacterium with high cariogenic potential, coordinates competence for natural transformation and bacteriocin production via the XIP and CSP pheromones. CSP is effective in inducing bacteriocin responses, but not competence in chemically defined media (CDM). This is in contrast to XIP, which is a strong inducer of competence in CDM, but can also stimulate bacteriocin genes as a late response. Inter-connections between the pathways activated by the two pheromones have been characterized in certain detail in S. mutans UA159, but it is mostly unknown whether such findings are representative for the species. In this study, we used bioassays based on luciferase reporters for the bacteriocin gene cipB and the alternative sigma factor sigX to investigate various S. mutans isolates for production and response to CSP and XIP pheromones in CDM. Similar to S. mutans UA159, endogenous CSP was undetectable in the culture supernatants of all tested strains. During optimization of the bioassay using the cipB reporter, we discovered that the acivity of exogenous CSP used as a standard was reduced over time during S. mutans growth. Using a FRET-CSP reporter peptide, we found that S. mutans UA159 was indeed able to degrade CSP, and that such proteolytic activity was not significantly different in isogenic mutants with deletion of the protease gene htrA, or the competence genes sigX, oppD, and comR. CSP proteolysis was also detected in all the wild type strains, indicating that such activity is conserved in S. mutans. For the XIP pheromone, endogenous production was observed in the supernatants of all 34 tested strains at peak concentrations in culture supernatants that varied between 200 nM and 26000 nM. Transformation in the presence of exogenous XIP was detected in all, but one, of the isolates. The efficiency of transformation varied, however, among the different strains, and for those with the highest transformation rates, endogenous XIP peak concentrations in the supernatants were above 2000 nM XIP. We conclude that XIP production and inducing effect on transformation, as well as proteolytic activity leading to the inactivation of CSP are conserved functions among different S. mutans isolates.

Here we report that, in larval zebrafish, primarily serotonergic neurons of the ventromedial caudal hypothalamus (cH) become increasingly active during food deprivation, whereas activity in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is reduced. Exposure to food sensory and consummatory cues reverses the activity patterns of these two nuclei, consistent with their representation of opposing internal hunger states. Baseline activity is restored as food-deprived animals return to satiety via voracious feeding. The antagonistic relationship and functional importance of cH and LH activity patterns were confirmed by targeted stimulation and ablation of cH neurons. Collectively, the data allow us to propose a model in which these hypothalamic nuclei regulate different phases of hunger and satiety and coordinate energy balance via antagonistic control of distinct behavioral outputs.",

We introduce a computational method, TRIAGE, that uses discordance between gene-repressive tendency and expression to identify genetic drivers of cell identity. We apply TRIAGE to millions of genome-wide single-cell transcriptomes, diverse omics platforms, and eukaryotic cells and tissue types. Using a wide range of data, we validate TRIAGEs performance for identifying cell-type specific regulatory factors across diverse species including human, mouse, boar, bird, fish, and tunicate. Using CRISPR gene editing, we use TRIAGE to experimentally validate RNF220 as a regulator of Ciona cardiopharyngeal development and SIX3 as required for differentiation of endoderm in human pluripotent stem cells.

We detected cells expressing double (/{beta}, /{delta}, {beta}/{delta} cell-types) and triple (/{beta}/{delta} cell-type) hormone transcripts. The most common mixed-identity cell-type was the /{beta} group where the cells could be grouped into {beta}- and -like subgroups. The {beta}-like cells had low GCG/INS expression ratio (< 0.6) and significantly higher frequency of single-channel iGABAAR openings than the -like cells where the GCG/INS expression ratio was high (> 1.2). The difference in expression levels and single channel iGABAAR characteristics varied in the /{beta}/{delta} cell-type.

However, the factors causing excessive BA excretion remains unclear. Given the importance of gut microbiota in BA metabolism, we hypothesized that gut dysbiosis might contribute to excessive BA excretion in IBS-D.\\n\\nDesignMetabolomic and metagenomic analyses were performed of specimens from 290 IBS-D patients and 89 healthy volunteers. By transplanting human microbiota and manipulating specific microbiome species in mice, the effects of microbiota on host BA metabolism were assessed at metabolic, genetic and protein levels. Effects of individual and mixed BAs on enterohepatic feedback pathways were also tested in vitro and in vivo.\\n\\nResultsTotal fecal BAs were excessively excreted in 24.5% of IBS-D patients. Their fecal metagenomes showed increased abundances of Clostridia and BA-transforming genes (hdhA and bais). The increases of Clostridia bacteria (e.g. C. scindens) were positively associated with the levels of fecal BAs and serum 7-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), while being negatively correlated with serum fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). Both Clostridia-rich human microbiota and C. scindens enhanced levels of serum C4 and hepatic conjugated BAs in mice recipients and reduced ileal FGF19 expression. Inhibition of Clostridium species by vancomycin yielded opposite findings. Clostridia-derived BAs (e.g. conjugated and free ursodeoxycholic acid) significantly suppressed intestinal FGF19 expression.\\n\\nConclusionThe Clostridia-rich microbiota contributes to excessive BA excretion in IBS-D patients.

    "abstract": "The lipid aldehyde 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE) derived from peroxidation of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and generated in parallel to 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) is a highly reactive protein crosslinker. Crosslinking of proteins in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by lipid peroxidation products causes HDL dysfunction and contributes to atherogenesis. While HNE is relatively well studied, the relevance of ONE in atherosclerosis and in modifying HDL has not been examined. In the present study, we found a significant increase in ONE-ketoamide (lysine) adducts in HDL derived from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (1620 {+/-} 985.4 pmol/mg) compared to healthy controls (664 {+/-} 219.5 pmol/mg). ONE crosslinked apoA-I on HDL at a concentration of >3 mol ONE per 10 mol apoA-I (0.3 eq), which is 100-fold lower than HNE but comparable to the potent protein crosslinker, isolevuglandin. ONE-modified HDL partially inhibited the ability of HDL to protect against LPS-induced TNF and IL-1{beta} mRNA expression in murine macrophages. At 3 eq., ONE dramatically decreased the ability of apoA-I to exchange from HDL, from ~46.5% to only ~18.4% (P<0.001). Surprisingly, ONE-modification of HDL or apoA-I did not alter macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity. LC/MS/MS analysis showed modification of Lys12, Lys23, Lys96, and Lys226 of apoA-I by ONE-ketoamide adducts. Compared to other dicarbonyl scavengers, pentylpyridoxamine (PPM) was most efficacious at blocking ONE-induced protein crosslinking in HDL. Our studies show that ONE HDL adducts are elevated in FH who have severe hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis and causes HDL dysfunction. We demonstrate the use of PPM in preferentially scavenging ONE in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "The conventional approach to understanding neural responses underlying complex computations is to study across-trial averages of repeatedly performed computations from single neurons. When a brain region performs complex computations, such as processing stimulus related information or motor planning, it has been repeatedly shown through measures such as the Fano factor (FF) that neural variability across trials in the network decreases. However, in reality, multiple neurons contribute to a common computation on a single trial, rather than a single neuron contributing to a computation on multiple trials. Therefore, on individual trials the concept of FF loses significance. In this study, we extended previous work using measures of variability that are confined to a single trial and found that neurons perform a common computation, they briefly fire with increased regularity in spike timings, with similar inter-spike interval durations. We propose that this decrease in within-trial variability in neural spiking contributes to a decrease in across-trial variability in neural firing rates during network level computations. We confirmed our hypothesis by testing it on the activity of frontal eye field neurons recorded as two monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task, and also on simulated spike trains. Furthermore, this phenomenon also has important behavioral correlates: the reaction time of the animal was faster when the within-trial variability was lower. We show that a decrease in within-trial variability is linked to a decrease in across-trial variability in neural response and indicates stationarity of neural network variability across time.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyDuring computations, neural variability across trials decreases.

    "abstract": "Anabolic and catabolic signalling mediated via mTOR and AMPK have to be intrinsically coupled to mitochondrial functions for maintaining homeostasis and mitigate cellular/organismal stress. Although, glutamine is known to activate mTOR, if/how differential mitochondrial utilization of glutamine impinges on mTOR signalling is less explored. Mitochondrial SIRT4, which unlike other sirtuins is induced in a fed state, is known to inhibit catabolic signalling/pathways through AMPK-PGC1a/SIRT1-PPARa axis and negatively regulate glutamine metabolism via TCA cycle. However, physiological significance of SIRT4 functions during a fed state is still unknown. Here, we establish SIRT4 as key anabolic factor that activates TORC1 signalling and regulates lipogenesis, autophagy and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the ability of SIRT4 to inhibit anaplerotic conversion of glutamine to -ketoglutarate potentiates TORC1. Interestingly, we also show that mitochondrial glutamine sparing or utilization is critical for differentially regulating TORC1 under fed and fasted conditions. Moreover, we conclusively show that differential expression of SIRT4 during fed and fasted states is vital for coupling mitochondrial energetics and glutamine utilization with anabolic pathways. These significant findings also illustrate that SIRT4 integrates nutrient inputs with mitochondrial retrograde signals to maintain a balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways.",

Two bean fly species, Ophiomyia spencerella and Ophiomyia phaseoli are harmful insect pests of beans causing significant yield losses. Our objectives were to assess the population structure of common bean germplasm of different market classes and to identify polymorphic loci associated with resistance to O. spencerella. The study was carried out on a diversity panel of 284 genotypes using 9040 SNP markers. The genotypes were differentiated in to 14 distinct clusters. The mean FST of 0.4849, revealed major differentiation among the populations. Andean gene pool was more diverse compared to Mesoamerica gene pool which could be attributed to preference for large seeded cultivars. Multi-dimensional scaling and structure analyses revealed admixture among seed types. From genome wide association studies (GWAS), major genomic regions associated with O. spencerella resistance were identified on chromosome 1 (Pv01). The most significant SNP on Pv01 was aligned to gene PHAVU_001G075500g that is related to the Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) pathway, critical in regulating inherent immune responses to disease infection and insect herbivore attack.

    "abstract": "There is considerable evidence that after a stroke, ipsilesional deficits increase as contralesional impairment increases. Here, we asked if the relationship between the motor capacities of the two limbs differs based on the side of stroke. Forty-two pre-morbidly right-handed chronic stroke survivors (left hemisphere damage, LHD = 21) with mild-to-moderate paresis performed distal items of the Wolf Motor Function Test (dWMFT). We found that compared to RHD, the relationship between contralesional arm impairment (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer, UEFM) and ipsilesional hand motor capacity was stronger (R2LHD= 0.42; R2RHD < 0.01; z = 2.12; p = 0.03) and the slope was steeper (t = -2.03; p = 0.04) in LHD. Similarly, the relationship between contralesional dWMFT and ipsilesional hand motor capacity was stronger (R2LHD= 0.65; R2RHD= 0.09; z = 2.45; p = 0.01) and the slope was steeper (t = 2.03; p = 0.04) in LHD compared to RHD. Multiple regression analysis confirmed the presence of an interaction between contralesional UEFM and side of stroke ({beta}3= 0.66 {+/-} 0.30; p = 0.024) but only trended towards significance for the interaction between contralesional dWMFT and side of stroke ({beta}3= -0.51 {+/-} 0.34; p = 0.05). Results were confirmed after removal of potential outliers. Our findings suggest that the relationship between contra- and ipsi-lesional motor capacity depends on the side of stroke, such that the inter-limb relationship is stronger for stroke survivors with left hemisphere damage compared to those with right hemisphere damage.",

Using a new method, we have calculated that approximately 18% of all authors contact email addresses in MEDLINE are invalid. While an unfortunate number, it is, however, lower than previously estimated. To mitigate this problem, institutions should provide email forwarding and scientific authors should use more stable email addresses. In fact, a steadily growing share already use free private email addresses: 32% of all new addresses in MEDLINE in 2018 were of this kind.",

    "abstract": "Recording biological signals can be difficult in three-dimensional matrices, such as tissue. We present a DNA polymerase-based strategy that records temporal biosignals locally onto DNA to be read out later, which could obviate the need to extract information from tissue on the fly. We use a template-independent DNA polymerase, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) that probabilistically adds dNTPs to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrates without a template. We show that in vitro, the dNTP-incorporation preference of TdT changes with the presence of Co2+, Ca2+, Zn2+ and temperature. Extracting the signal profile over time is possible by examining the dNTP incorporation preference along the length of synthesized ssDNA strands like a molecular ticker tape. We call this TdT-based untemplated recording of temporal local environmental signals (TURTLES). We show that we can determine the time of Co2+ addition to within two minutes over a 60-minute period. Further, TURTLES has the capability to record multiple fluctuations. We can estimate the rise and fall of an input Co2+ pulse to within three minutes. TURTLES has at least 200-fold better temporal resolution than all previous DNA-based recording techniques.",

    "abstract": "This study uses electrocorticography in humans to assess how alpha- and beta-band rhythms modulate excitability of the sensorimotor cortex during movement selection, as indexed through a psychophysically-controlled movement imagery task. Both rhythms displayed effector-specific modulations, tracked spectral markers of action potentials in the local neuronal population, and showed spatially systematic phase relationships (traveling waves). Yet, alpha- and beta-band rhythms differed in their anatomical and functional properties, were weakly correlated, and traveled along opposite directions across the sensorimotor cortex. Increased alpha-band power in the somatosensory cortex ipsilateral to the selected arm was associated with spatially-unspecific inhibition. Decreased beta-band power over contralateral motor cortex was associated with a focal shift from relative inhibition to excitation. These observations indicate the relevance of both inhibition and disinhibition mechanisms for precise spatiotemporal coordination of neuronal populations during movement selection. Those mechanisms are implemented through the substantially different neurophysiological properties of sensorimotor alpha- and beta-band rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Efficient sensory processing requires that the brain is able to maximize its response to unexpected stimuli, while suppressing responsivity to expected events. Mismatch negativity (MMN) is an auditory event-related potential that occurs when a regular pattern is interrupted by an event that violates the expected properties of the pattern. MMN has been found to be reduced in individuals with schizophrenia in over 100 separate studies, an effect believed to be underpinned by glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) dysfunction, as it is observed that NMDA-R antagonists also reduce MMN in healthy volunteers. The aim of the current study is to examine this effect in rodents. Using single unit recording in specific auditory areas using methods not readily utilized in humans, we have previously demonstrated that neuronal indices of rodent mismatch responses recorded from thalamic and cortical areas of the brain can be decomposed into a relatively simple repetition suppression and a more sophisticated prediction error process. In the current study, we aimed to test how the NMDA-R antagonist, MK-801, affected both of these processes along the rat auditory thalamocortical pathway. We found that MK-801 had the opposite effect than expected, and enhanced thalamic repetition suppression and cortical prediction error. These single unit data correlate with the recordings of local field responses. Together with previous data, this study suggests that our understanding of the contribution of NMDA-R system to MMN generation is far from complete, and also has potential implications for future research in schizophrenia.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn this study, we demonstrate that an NMDA-R antagonist, MK-801, differentially affects single neuron responses to auditory stimuli along the thalamocortical axis by increasing the response magnitude of unexpected events in the auditory cortex and intensifying the adaptation of responses to expected events in the thalamus. Thus, we provide evidence that NMDA-R antagonists alter the balance between prediction-error and repetition suppression processes that underlie the generation of mismatch responses in the brain, and these effects are differentially expressed at different levels of auditory processing. As effects of MK-801 were in the opposite direction to our expectations, it demonstrates that our understanding of role of NMDA-R in synaptic plasticity and the neural processes underpinning MMN generation are far from complete.",

    "abstract": "Cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors increase the risk of late-life cognitive impairment and dementia, and have also been associated with detrimental grey and white matter changes. However the functional brain changes associated with cardiometabolic health in late-life are unclear. We sought to characterise these functional changes by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during a n-back working memory task (0, 1 and 2 back) in 85 adults (60% female) between 50 and 80 years of age. Due to a stratified recruitment approach, participants varied widely regarding cognitive function and cardiometabolic health. Standard and objective cut-offs for high blood glucose, waist to hip ratio (i.e. obesity), high blood cholesterol, and hypertension were employed to generate a summative score for cardiometabolic burden (none, one, or two or more above cut-off). Mixed effects modelling (covarying for age and gender) revealed no statistically significant associations between cardiometabolic burden and visual P1 and N1 component amplitudes. There was a significant effect for the P3b component: as cardiometabolic burden increased, P3b amplitude decreased. We show that cardiometabolic factors related to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in late-life associate with functional brain activity, as recorded via ERPs. Findings have relevance for the monitoring of lifestyle interventions (typically targeting cardiometabolic factors) in ageing, as ERPs may provide a more sensitive measure of change than cognitive performance. Further, our results raise questions related to the findings of a broad range of ERP studies where the groups compared may differ in their cardiometabolic health status (not only in psychological symptomatology).",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo investigate the performance of a metric of functional connectivity to classify and grade the excitability of brain regions based on evoked potentials to single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES).\\n\\nMethodsPatients who received 1-Hz frequency stimulation between 2003 and 2014 at Yale at prospectively selected contacts were included. The stimulated contacts were classified as seizure onset zone (SOZ), highly irritative zone (IZp) or control. Response contacts were classified as seizure onset zone (SOZ), active interictal (IZp), quiet or other. The normalized number of responses was defined as the number of contacts with any evoked responses divided by the total number of recorded contacts, and the normalized distance is the ratio of the average distance between the site of stimulation and sites of evoked responses to the average distances between the site of stimulation and all other recording contacts. A new metric we labeled the connectivity index (CI) is defined as the product of the two values.\\n\\nResults57 stimulation-sessions in 22-patients were analyzed. The connectivity index (CI) of the SOZ was higher than control (median CI of 0.74 vs. 0.16, p = 0.0002). The evoked responses after stimulation of SOZ were seen at further distance compared to control (median normalized distance 0.96 vs. 0.62, p = 0.0005). It was 1.8 times more likely to record a response at SOZ than in non-epileptic contacts after stimulation of a control site. Habitual seizures were triggered in 27% of patients and 35 % of SOZ contacts (median stimulation intensity 4 mA) but in none of the control or IZp contacts. Non-SOZ contacts in multifocal or poor surgical outcome cases had a higher CI than non-SOZ contacts in those with localizable onsets (medians CI of 0.5 vs. 0.12, p = 0.04). There was a correlation between the stimulation current intensity and the normalized number of evoked responses (r = + 0.49, p 0.01) but not with distance (r = + 0.1, p 0.64)\\n\\nConclusionsWe found enhanced connectivity when stimulating the SOZ compared to stimulating control contacts; responses were more distant as well. Habitual auras and seizures provoked by SPES were highly predictive of brain sites involved in seizure generation.",
