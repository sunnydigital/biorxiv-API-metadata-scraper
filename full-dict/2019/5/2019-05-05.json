    "abstract": "The assembly of the seed microbiota involves some early microbial seed colonizers that are transmitted from the maternal plant through the vascular system, while other microbes enter through the stigma. Thus, the seed microbiota consists of microbes not only recruited from the vascular tissues of the plant, but also from the flower. Flowers are known to be a hub for microbial transmission between plants and insects. This floral-insect exchange opens the possibility for insect-transmitted bacteria to colonize the ovule and subsequently the seed, and to pass then into the next plant generation. In this study, we evaluated the contribution of insect pollination to the seed microbiota through high-throughput sequencing. Oilseed rape (OSR) Brassica napus flowers were exposed to visits and pollination by honey bees (Apis mellifera) or red mason bees (Osmia bicornis), hand pollination, or autonomous self-pollination (ASP). Sequence analyses revealed that honey bee visitation reduced the bacterial richness and diversity, increased the variability in the seed microbial structure, and introduced bee-associated taxa. In contrast, mason bee pollination had minor effects on the seed microbiota. We highlight the need to consider insect pollination as an ecological process involved in the transmission of bacteria from flower to seeds.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEInsect pollinators and flowering plants have a very old mutualistic relationship in which animal mobility is used for the dispersal of pollen. The pollination services provided by insects are extremely important to many natural plant populations as well as agricultural crops. Here we show that while visiting flowers, insect pollinators can disperse bacteria that are able to colonize the developing seed via the flower. Hence, insect pollination participates in the assembly of the seed microbiota, the inoculum for the next plant generation. This novel insight has important implications in terms of re-assessing pollinator services by including microbe transfer.",

    "abstract": "Kinetochores are the chromosomal attachment points for spindle microtubules. They are also signaling hubs that control major cell cycle transitions and coordinate chromosome folding. Most well-studied eukaryotes rely on a conserved set of factors, which are divided among two loosely-defined groups, for these functions. Outer kinetochore proteins contact microtubules or regulate this contact directly. Inner kinetochore proteins designate the kinetochore assembly site by recognizing a specialized nucleosome containing the H3 variant Cse4/CENP-A. We previously determined the structure, resolved by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of the yeast Ctf19 complex (Ctf19c, homologous to the vertebrate CCAN), providing a high-resolution view of inner kinetochore architecture. We now extend these observations by reporting a near-atomic model of the Ctf3 complex, the outermost Ctf19c sub-assembly seen in our original cryo-EM density. The model is sufficiently well-determined by the new data to enable molecular interpretation of Ctf3 recruitment and function.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA substantial number of infants infected with RSV develop severe symptoms requiring hospitalization. We currently lack accurate biomarkers that are associated with severe illness.\n\nMethodWe defined airway gene expression profiles based on RNA sequencing from nasal brush samples from 106 full-tem previously healthy RSV infected subjects during acute infection (day 1-10 of illness) and convalescence stage (day 28 of illness). All subjects were assigned a clinical illness severity score (GRSS). Using AIC-based model selection, we built a sparse linear correlate of GRSS based on 41 genes (NGSS1). We also built an alternate model based upon 13 genes associated with severe infection acutely but displaying stable expression over time (NGSS2).\n\nResultsNGSS1 is strongly correlated with the disease severity, demonstrating a naive correlation ({rho}) of {rho}=0.935 and cross-validated correlation of 0.813. As a binary classifier (mild versus severe), NGSS1 correctly classifies disease severity in 89.6% of the subjects following cross-validation. NGSS2 has slightly less, but comparable, accuracy with a cross-validated correlation of 0.741 and classification accuracy of 84.0%.\n\nConclusionAirway gene expression patterns, obtained following a minimally-invasive procedure, have potential utility for development of clinically useful biomarkers that correlate with disease severity in primary RSV infection.",
