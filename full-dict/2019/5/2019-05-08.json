    "abstract": "This research has been carried out among climbing performers in Romania (a group of 60 climbers), starting from the desire to induce a state of preparation by watching a motivational short movie before performing a high difficulty route. The concept of preparation was related to the emotional impact of tonic or sensitive type (depending on the content of the movie) and the personality structure of the athletes, the conclusions drawn being in the area of optimization of performance by inducing an optimal state of preparation.\\n\\nPerformance climbers can have two main attitudes to impact with emotional stimuli in the competitive environment: tonic versus sensitivity. We propose the study of the correlations between the personality structure of the athletes, the emotional impact on stimulation, respectively the quality of the prepared state of state, as the active regulatory status.\\n\\nThe methodology included a batch of 60 climbers divided into two equal subgroups, before making a difficult route being allowed to view a movie with a tonic impact, or a sensitive impact. Personality was evaluated through five scales (Intelligence, Emotional Stability, Sensitivity, Imagination, and Perspicacity) while administering a Preparatory and Motivation Questionnaire.\\n\\nPeople with a high level of intelligence, imagination and perspicacity can more easily create attitudes, habits and habitual contests, as well as conduct appropriate to the concrete conditions of the competitive situation, while people with low emotional stability and sensitivity are more inclined towards a sensitive, labile, sensitive approach to the competitive situation. The research implies the necessity of organizing the mental operators with the purpose of suitability to the performance poor, in accordance with the tactical training of the athlete and with the personality traits.\\n\\nEmotional stimulation leads to affective participation, reception and awareness of favoring issues, stimulation of will, self-regulation of activity according to aspirations and strategies.",

    "abstract": "The fine balance of growth and division is a fundamental property of the physiology of cells and one of the least understood. Its study has been thwarted by difficulties in the accurate measurement of cell size and the even greater challenges of measuring growth of a single-cell over time. We address these limitations by demonstrating a new computationally enhanced methodology for Quantitative Phase Microscopy (ceQPM) for adherent cells, using improved image processing algorithms and automated cell tracking software. Accuracy has been improved more than two-fold and this improvement is sufficient to establish the dynamics of cell growth and adherence to simple growth laws. It is also sufficient to reveal unknown features of cell growth previously unmeasurable. With these methodological and analytical improvements, we document a remarkable oscillation in growth rate in several different cell lines, occurring throughout the cell cycle, coupled to cell division or birth, and yet independent of cell cycle progression. We expect that further exploration with this improved tool will provide a better understanding of growth rate regulation in mammalian cells.\n\nSignificance StatementIt has been a long-standing question in cell growth studies that whether the mass of individual cell grows linearly or exponentially. The two models imply fundamentally distinct mechanisms, and the discrimination of the two requires great measurement accuracy. Here, we develop a new method of computationally enhanced Quantitative Phase Microscopy (ceQPM), which greatly improves the accuracy and throughput of single-cell growth measurement in adherent mammalian cells. The measurements of several cell lines indicate that the growth dynamics of individual cells cannot be explained by either of the simple models but rather present an unanticipated and remarkable oscillatory behavior, suggesting more complex regulation and feedbacks.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a severe complication associated with the neurotoxic effects of circulating autoantibodies in the central nervous system (CNS) manifested frequently as a learning and memory deficit. Pristane-induced lupus in BALB/c female mice is an experimental model that resembles some clinical and immunological SLE pathogenesis associated with environmental factors. Nevertheless, there is no experimental evidence that relate pristane-induced lupus with cognitive dysfunction associated with autoantibodies production.\\n\\nObjectiveTo evaluate cognitive impairment related to memory deficits in a pristane-induced lupus BALB/c female mice related to mRNA expression levels of NR2A/2B hippocampal subunits in short and long-term memory task at 7 and 12 weeks after LPS exposition (7wLPS and 12wLPS) in a behavioral test with the employment of Barnes maze.\\n\\nMethodsFifty-four female BALB/c mice of 8-12 weeks old were included in 2 experimental groups: 7 and 12 weeks after lypopolissacharide (LPS) exposure and classified in subgroups (control, pristane and pristane+LPS). To determine cognitive dysfunction, mice were tested in a Barnes maze. Serum anti-Sm antibodies and relative expression of hippocampal NR2A/NR2B subunits were quantified.\\n\\nResultsPristane and pristane+LPS mice showed a prolonged escape latency at 7wLPS than at 12wLPS in short-term memory. Downregulation of hippocampal NR2A subunit was more evident than NR2B in pristane and pristane+LPS at 7wLPS and 12wLPS. The anti-Sm autoantibodies levels correlate with the relative expression of NR2A.\\n\\nConclusionDownregulation of hippocampal NR2A/2B subunits in the pristane-model of lupus in BALB/c mice may be related to anti-Sm autoantibodies production with the consequence of cognitive impairment in early stages of autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation contributes to the development of insulin resistance in obesity. While the role of adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) pro-inflammatory signalling in the development of insulin resistance has been established, it is less clear how WAT inflammation is initiated. Here, we show that ATMs from obese mice and humans exhibit markers of increased de novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis rate. Macrophage-specific knockout of phosphocholine-cytidylyltransferase A (CCT), the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo PC biosynthesis pathway, alleviated obesity-induced WAT inflammation and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, CCT-deficient macrophages showed reduced ER stress and inflammation in response to palmitate. Surprisingly, this was not due to lower exogenous palmitate incorporation into cellular PCs. Instead, CCT-null macrophages had lower PC turnover, leading to elevated membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids that negated the pro-inflammatory effects of palmitate. Our results reveal a link between obesity-associated increase in PC synthesis, accelerated PC turnover and pro-inflammatory activation of ATMs.",

    "abstract": "Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are organized groups of genes involved in the production of specialized metabolites. Typically, one BGC is responsible for the production of one or several similar compounds with bioactivities that usually only vary in terms of strength and/or specificity. Here we show that the previously described ferroverdins and bagremycins, which are families of metabolites with different bioactivities, are produced from the same BGC, whereby the fate of the biosynthetic pathway depends on iron availability. Under conditions of iron depletion, the monomeric bagremycins are formed, which are amino-aromatic antibiotics resulting from the condensation of 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid with p-vinylphenol. Conversely, when iron is abundantly available, the biosynthetic pathway additionally produces a molecule based on p-vinylphenyl-3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoate, which complexes iron to form the trimeric ferroverdins that have anticholesterol activity. Thus our work challenges the concept that BGCs should produce a single family of molecules with one type of bioactivity, the occurrence of the different metabolites being triggered by the environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO), Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) has implemented training in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) for health professionals in countries where the condition is highly endemic through an interactive on-line course. With three editions of the course successfully completed, we consider assessment of the courses social impact through analysis of the outcomes beyond knowledge acquisition to be of paramount importance.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal findingsTo this end, we have conducted a study using the Theory of Change theoretical approach, combined with an exploration of students experiences through in-depth interviews before, during and after taking the course. These testimonies have been analyzed and classified according to their type of result - outputs, outcomes and longer-term impacts - and distributed along three different levels: individual, collective (meso), and systemic change. Insights about intercultural communication in qualitative research are discussed in relation to the characteristics of UOC researchers and the class composition of faculty and students in the Middle East and North Africa countries (MENA) region.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThis analysis fills a gap in the knowledge of social impact assessment through the establishment of a new methodological approach. The course has proven to be a valuable source of social capital and provided a space to build a network of professionals with a shared focus on how to treat CL in particular - a community of practice - and increase knowledge of other skin NTDs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting the skin (Buruli ulcer, cutaneous leishmaniasis, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, mycetoma, onchocerciasis, scabies and yaws) cause considerable disability, increase stigma and exacerbate poverty. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the most neglected NTDs. It has an estimated incidence of between 900,000 and 1.3 million new cases worldwide each year. A co-venture between the World Health Organization (WHO) and Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) has developed an on-line interactive course entitled \\\"Clinical management of CL\\\" to provide health personnel with thorough and up-to-date information on the various aspects of CL. Using a new methodological approach, we have conducted a social impact assessment of this training program in order to identify the different type and level of results. The most significant impact has been the mobilizing of students and professors from the different editions of the course in a community of practice, thereby enhancing learning, knowledge sharing and effectivity.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a potentially fatal complex autoimmune disease, that is characterized by widespread inflammation manifesting tissue damage and comorbidities across the human body including heart, blood vessels, joints, skin, liver, kidneys, and periodontal tissues. The etiology of SLE is partially attributed to a deregulated inflammatory response to microbial dysbiosis and environmental changes. In the mouth, periodontal environment provides an optimal niche to assay local dynamic microbial ecological changes in health and disease important to systemic inflammation in SLE subjects. Our aim was to evaluate the reciprocal impact of periodontal subgingival microbiota on SLE systemic inflammation. Ninety-one female subjects were recruited, including healthy (n=31), SLE-inactive (n=29), and SLE-active (n=31). Patients were screened for probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), and classified with or without periodontal dysbiosis, periodontitis. Serum inflammatory cytokines were measured by human cytokine panel and subgingival biofilm was examined by DNA-DNA checkerboard. The results showed significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines in individuals with SLE when compared to controls. Stratification of subjects into SLE-inactive (I) and SLE-active (A) phenotypes or periodontitis and non-periodontitis groups provided new insights into SLE pathophysiology. While low-grade inflammation was found in SLE-I subjects, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 was found to control clinical phenotypes. Out of twenty-four significant differential oral microbial abundances found in SLE, fourteen unique subgingival bacteria profiles were found to be elevated in SLE. Pathogens from periodontal disease sites (Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia) showed increase abundance in SLE-A subjects when compared to controls. Cytokine-microbial correlations showed that periodontal pathogens dominating the environment increased proinflammatory cytokines systemically. Deeper clinical attachment loss and periodontal pathogens were found in SLE subjects, especially on SLE-I, likely due to long-term chronic and low-grade inflammation. Altogether, local periodontal pathogen enrichment was positively associated with high systemic inflammatory profiles, relevant to the overall health and SLE disease pathogenesis.",

Here, we develop a \"dynamic perturbation\" approach to manipulate the relative memory strength of a list of WM items, by interfering with their neural dynamics during the delay period in a temporally correlated way. Six experiments on human subjects confirm the effectiveness of this WM manipulation method. A computational model combining continuous attractor neural network (CANN) and short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) principles further reproduces all the empirical findings. The model shows that the \"dynamic perturbation\" modifies the synaptic efficacies of WM items through STP principles, eventually leading to changes in their relative memory strengths.

    "abstract": "Utilizing a high-speed camera and recording back-scattered laser light at more than 20,000 frames per second, we introduce the first wide-field dynamic laser speckle imaging (DLSI) in which we are able to quantify the laser speckleintensity temporal auto-correlation function g2({tau}) for every pixel individually to obtain a quantitative image of the dynamics of the light scattering particles in the sample. The ability to directly and quantitatively measure the intensity auto-correlation function allows us to solve the problem of how to quantitatively interpret data measured by laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), multi-exposure laser speckle imaging (MESI) and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). The intensity auto-correlation function is related to the field temporal auto-correlation function g1({tau}), which has been quantitatively related to the dynamics of the light scattering particles including flowing red blood cells. The form of g1({tau}) depends on the amount of light scattering (i.e. single or multiple scattering) and the type of particle motion (i.e. ordered or unordered). Although these forms of the field correlation functions have been established for over 30 years, there is no agreement nor experimental support on what scattering and motion regimes are relevant for the varied biomedical applications. We thus apply DLSI to image cerebral blood flow in mouse through a cranial window and show that the generally accepted form of g1({tau}), is applicable only to visible surface vessels of a specific size (20 - 200m). We demonstrate that for flow in smaller vessels and in parenchymal regions that the proper g1({tau}) form corresponds with multiple scattering light and unordered motion which was never considered to be relevant for these techniques. We show that the wrong assumption for the field auto-correlation model results in a severe underestimation of flow changes when measuring blood flow changes during ischemic stroke. Finally, we describe how DLSI can be integrated with other laser speckle methods to guide model selection, or how it can be used by itself as a quantitative blood flow imaging technique.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding is by now a well-established method for biodiversity assessment in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. Metabarcoding datasets are usually used for - and {beta}-diversity estimates, that is, interspecies (or inter-MOTU) patterns. However, the use of hypervariable metabarcoding markers may provide an enormous amount of intraspecies (intra-MOTU) information - mostly untapped so far. The use of cytochrome oxidase (COI) amplicons is gaining momentum in metabarcoding studies targeting eukaryote richness. COI has been for a long time the marker of choice in population genetics and phylogeographic studies. Therefore, COI metabarcoding datasets may be used to study intraspecies patterns and phylogeographic features for hundreds of species simultaneously, opening a new field which we suggest to name metaphylogeography. The main challenge for the implementation of this approach is the separation of erroneous sequences from true intra-MOTU variation. Here, we develop a cleaning protocol based on changes in entropy of the different codon positions of the COI sequence, together with co-occurrence patterns of sequences. Using a dataset of community DNA from several benthic littoral communities in the Mediterranean and Atlantic seas, we first tested by simulation on a subset of sequences a two-step cleaning approach consisting of a denoising step followed by a minimal abundance filtering. The procedure was then applied to the whole dataset. We obtained a total of 563 MOTUs that were usable for phylogeographic inference. We used semiquantitative rank data instead of read abundances to perform AMOVAs and haplotype networks. Genetic variability was mainly concentrated within samples, but with an important between-seas component as well. There were inter-group differences in the amount of variability between and within communities in each sea. For two species the results could be compared with traditional Sanger sequence data available for the same zones, giving similar patterns. Our study shows that metabarcoding data can be used to infer intra- and interpopulation genetic variability of many species at a time, providing a new method with great potential for basic biogeography, connectivity and dispersal studies, and for the more applied fields of conservation genetics, invasion genetics, and design of protected areas.",

    "abstract": "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging opportunistic pathogens that form biofilms in environmental reservoirs such as household water systems and aggregate into phagocytosis-resistant clusters during infection. NTM constitutively aggregate in vitro, a phenotype typically considered to be a by-product of the mycolic-acid-rich cell wall. While culturing a model NTM, Mycobacterium smegmatis, in rich medium, we fortuitously discovered that planktonic cells accumulated in the culture after [~]3 days. By providing selective pressure for bacteria that disperse earlier, we isolated a strain with two mutations in the oligopeptide permease operon (opp). A mutant lacking the opp operon ({Delta}opp) dispersed earlier and more completely than wildtype (WT). We show that {Delta}opps aggregation defect was nutrient related; aggregation was restored by non-peptide carbon sources. Experiments with WT M. smegmatis revealed that growth as aggregates is favored when carbon is replete, while dispersal can be induced by carbon starvation. In addition, under conditions of low available carbon relative to available nitrogen, M. smegmatis grows as planktonic cells. By adjusting carbon and nitrogen sources in defined medium, we tuned the cellular C:N ratio such that M. smegmatis grows either as aggregates or planktonic cells. Lastly, we tested the effect of C:N balance on aggregation in clinically relevant NTM. Altogether, we show that NTM aggregation is a controlled process that is regulated by the relative availability of carbon and nitrogen for metabolism. Because NTM aggregation is correlated with increased virulence, these results may contribute to targeted anti-biofilm therapeutics.\\n\\nImportanceFree-living bacteria can assemble into multicellular aggregates called biofilms. Biofilms help bacteria tolerate multiple stresses, including antibiotics and the host immune system. Differing environmental pressures have resulted in biofilm architecture and regulation varying among bacterial species and strains. Nontuberculous mycobacteria are a group of emerging opportunistic pathogens that utilize biofilms to adhere to household plumbing and showerheads and to avoid phagocytosis by host immune cells. Mycobacteria harbor a unique cell wall built chiefly of long chain mycolic acids that confers hydrophobicity and has been thought to cause constitutive aggregation in liquid media. Here we show that aggregation is instead a regulated process dictated by the balance of available carbon and nitrogen. Understanding that mycobacteria utilize metabolic cues to regulate the transition between planktonic and aggregated cells reveals an inroad to controlling aggregation through targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division requires assembly of a multi-protein machinery or \\\"divisome\\\" that remodels the cell envelope to cause constriction. The cytoskeletal protein FtsZ forms a ring-like scaffold for the divisome at the incipient division site. FtsZ has three major regions - a conserved, polymerizing GTPase domain; a C-terminal conserved (CTC) peptide required for binding membrane-anchoring proteins; and a C-terminal linker (CTL) of poor length and sequence conservation. We previously demonstrated that, in Caulobacter crescentus, the CTL regulates FtsZ polymerization in vitro and cell wall metabolism in vivo. To understand the mechanism of CTL-dependent regulation of cell wall metabolism, here we investigated the impact of the CTL on Z-ring structure in cells and employed genetics to identify molecular determinants of the dominant lethal effects of {Delta}CTL. Deleting the CTL specifically resulted in formation of dense, asymmetric, non-ring FtsZ assemblies in vivo. Moreover, we observed that production of an FtsZ variant with the GTPase domain of Escherichia coli FtsZ fused to the CTC of C. crescentus FtsZ phenocopied the effects of C. crescentus {Delta}CTL, suggesting the CTC mediates signaling to cell wall metabolism. Finally, whereas overproduction of ZapA, FzlC, or FtsEX had slight protective effects against {Delta}CTL, depletion of FtsA partially suppressed the effects of {Delta}CTL. From these results, we propose that the cell wall misregulation downstream of {Delta}CTL results from its aberrant assembly properties and is propagated through the interaction between the CTC of FtsZ and FtsA. Our study provides mechanistic insights into CTL-dependent regulation of cell wall enzymes downstream of FtsZ.\\n\\nImportanceBacterial cell division is essential and requires the recruitment and regulation of a complex network of proteins needed to initiate and guide constriction and cytokinesis. FtsZ serves as a master regulator for this process, and its function is highly dependent on both its self-assembly into a canonical \\\"Z-ring\\\" and interaction with protein binding partners, which results in the activation of enzymes that remodel the cell wall to drive constriction. Using mutants of FtsZ and its binding partners, we have established the role of its C-terminal linker domain in regulating Z-ring organization, as well as the requirement for its C-terminal conserved peptide and interaction with the membrane-anchoring protein FtsA for regulating cell wall remodeling for constriction.",

We apply, for the first time to our knowledge, dispersion-relation phase spectroscopy (DPS) in polar coordinates to generate the radial and rotational cell mass-transport. Our data show that cells cultured on engineered substrates undergo rotational transport in a radially independent manner and exhibit faster vertical growth than the control, unpatterned cells.

    "abstract": "The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) are major targets for pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine development. However, the most advanced CSP-based vaccine RTS,S provides only partial protection, highlighting the need for innovative approaches for vaccine design and development. Here we design and characterize TRAP-CSP fusion antigens, and evaluate their immunogenicity and protection against malaria infection. TRAP N-terminal folded domains were fused to CSP C-terminal fragments consisting of the C-terminal TSR domain with or without the intervening repeat region. Homogenous, monomeric and properly folded fusion proteins were purified from mammalian transfectants. Notably, fusion improved expression of chimeras relative to the TRAP or CSP components alone. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the P. berghei TRAP-CSP fusion antigens formulated in AddaVax adjuvant elicited antigen-specific antibody responses. Remarkably, fusion antigens containing the CSP repeat region conferred complete sterile protection against P. berghei sporozoite challenge, and furthermore, mice that survived the challenge were completely protected from re-challenge 16 weeks after the first challenge. In contrast, fusion antigens lacking the CSP repeat region were less effective, indicating that the CSP repeat region provided enhanced protection, which correlated with higher antibody titers elicited by fusion antigens containing the CSP repeat region. In addition, we demonstrated that N-linked glycans had no significant effect on antibody elicitation or protection. Our results show that TRAP-CSP fusion antigens could be highly effective vaccine candidates. Our approach provides a platform for designing multi-antigen/multi-stage fusion antigens as next generation more effective malaria vaccines.",

We identify Zinc-Finger Protein at 72D (Zn72D) as a regulator of editing levels at a majority of editing sites in the brain. Zn72D both regulates ADAR protein levels and interacts with ADAR in an RNA-dependent fashion, and similar to ADAR, Zn72D is necessary to maintain proper neuromuscular junction architecture and motility in the fly. Furthermore, the mammalian homolog of Zn72D, Zfr, regulates editing in mouse primary neurons, demonstrating the conservation of this regulatory role. The broad and conserved regulation of ADAR editing by Zn72D in neurons represents a novel mechanism by which critically important editing events are sustained.",

Here we report the m6A and m6Am methylome through an extensive profiling of 42 human tissues and 16 mouse tissue samples. Globally, the m6A and m6Am peaks in non-brain tissues demonstrates mild tissue-specificity but are correlated in general, whereas the m6A and m6Am methylomes of brain tissues are clearly resolved from the non-brain tissues. Nevertheless, we identified a small subset of tissue-specific m6A peaks that can readily classify the tissue types. The number of m6A and m6Am peaks are partially correlated with the expression levels of their writers and erasers. In addition, the m6A- and m6Am-containing regions are enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms. Furthermore, cross-species analysis of m6A and m6Am methylomes revealed that species, rather than tissue types, is the primary determinant of methylation.

    "abstract": "PURPOSEXenopus has the remarkable ability to regenerate a lens from the basal cornea epithelial cells in response to signals from the retina. Previous work demonstrated that the Retinoic Acid (RA) metabolizing enzyme CYP26 is expressed in the cornea, and that its activity is required for lens regeneration. Gaps remain in our knowledge as to whether CYP26 is needed only to attenuate RA signaling via RA elimination, or whether it also acts to generate retinoid metabolites, such as 4-oxo-RA, to act as signaling ligands. Other key questions are why CYP26 antagonism, but not exogenous retinoids, can reduce cell division in the cornea, and when during regeneration CYP26 is important.\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODSEx vivo cultures supplemented with RA, 4-oxo-RA, or the CYP26 inhibitor Liarozole were used to assay the effects of these compounds on lens regeneration. Similarly, corneas were explanted, cultured in the presence of these compounds, and assayed for mitotic changes by counting anti-Histone H3 positive nuclei. qPCRs validated responsiveness to these compounds.\\n\\nRESULTSEx vivo cultures showed that when the media was supplemented with the RA metabolite 4-oxo-RA in addition to Liarozole, lens regeneration was still inhibited. 4-oxo-RA also does not rescue the loss of cell division in the cornea that is observed upon CYP26 antagonism. Liarozole inhibited regeneration when added 12 hours after lentectomy, but not when added 48 hours after.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThese data show that the necessity of CYP26 is not explained as a generator of 4-oxo-RA for regeneration. Moreover, Liarozole-induced mitotic reduction is not explained by 4-oxo-RA deficiency. These results support a model of RA-independent mitotic regulation by CYP26, though other retinoid metabolites may be active. Finally, CYP26 activity is only needed between 12 and 48 hours post-surgery, showing that its action is required only during the earliest stages of lens regeneration.\\n\\nFinancial interestsThe authors declare no competing financial interests.",

Here we report that Trpv6, a cation channel responsible for epithelial Ca2+ absorption, functions as a key regulator of cellular quiescence. Genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of Trpv6 promoted zebrafish epithelial cells to exit from quiescence and re-enter the cell cycle. Reintroducing Trpv6, but not its channel dead mutant, restored the quiescent state. Ca2+ imaging showed that Trpv6 is constitutively open in vivo. Mechanistically, Trpv6-mediated Ca2+ influx maintained the quiescent state by suppressing insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-mediated Akt and Tor signaling. In zebrafish epithelia and human colon cancer cells, Trpv6/TRPV6 elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels and activated PP2A, which down-regulated IGF signaling and promoted the quiescent state. Our findings suggest that Trpv6 mediates constitutive Ca2+ influx into epithelial cells to continuously suppress growth factor signaling and maintain the quiescent state.",

Recent studies suggest that DR-driven lifespan extension can be cost-free, calling into question a central tenant of the evolutionary theory of ageing. Nevertheless, boosting parental longevity can reduce offspring fitness. Such intergenerational trade-offs are often ignored but can account for the  missing costs of longevity. Here, we use the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei to test for effects of DR by fasting on fitness of females and their offspring. Females deprived of food for six days indeed had increased fecundity, survival and stress resistance after re-exposure to food compared to their counterparts with constant food access. However, offspring of DR mothers had reduced early and lifetime fecundity, slower growth rate, and smaller body size at sexual maturity. These findings support the direct trade-off between investment in soma and gametes challenging the hypothesis that increased somatic maintenance and impaired reproduction can be decoupled.",

    "abstract": "Several epithelial tissues contain stem cell reserves to replenish cells lost during normal homeostasis or upon injury. However, how epithelial tissues respond to distinct types of damage, and how stem cell plasticity and proliferation are regulated in these contexts, remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that genotoxic agents, but not mechanical damage, induce hyperplasia and lineage infidelity in three related epithelial tissues: the mammary gland, interfollicular epidermis and hair follicle. Furthermore, DNA damage also promotes stromal proliferation. In the mammary gland, we find that DNA damage activates multipotency within the myoepithelial population and hyper-proliferation of their luminal progeny, resulting in tissue disorganization. Additionally, in epidermal and hair follicle epithelia, DNA damage induces basal cell hyperplasia with the formation of abnormal, multi-layered K14+/K10+ cells. This behavior does not involve apoptosis or immunity, and is epithelial cell non-autonomous; stromal fibroblasts are both necessary and sufficient to induce the epithelial response. Thus, genotoxic agents that are used chemotherapeutically to promote cancer cell death can have the opposite effect on wild-type epithelial tissue, paradoxically promoting hyperplasia and inducing both stemness and lineage infidelity.",

    "abstract": "Determining the function of non-coding regulatory variants in cancer is a key challenge transcriptional biology. We investigated genetic (germline and somatic) determinants of regulatory mechanisms in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using H3K27ac ChIP-seq data in 10 matched tumor/normal samples and RNA-seq data from 496/66 tumor/normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Unsupervised clustering of H3K27ac activity cleanly separated tumor from normal individuals, highlighting extensive epigenetic reprogramming during transformation. We developed a novel method to test each chromatin feature for evidence of an allele-specific quantitative trait locus (asQTL) and evaluate tumor/normal differences in allele-specificity (d-asQTLs) while modelling local structural variation and read overdispersion. At an FDR of 5%, we identified 1,356 unique asQTL chromatin peaks in normal tissues; 2,868 in tumors; and 1,054 d-asQTLs (primarily imbalanced in tumor). The d-asQTL peaks were significantly enriched for RCC genome-wide association study (GWAS) heritability (32x, P=1.8x10-3), more so than any other functional feature including all H3K27ac peaks (12x), super-enhancers (5x), and asQTL genes (4x). Intersection of asQTLs with RCC GWAS loci identified putative functional features for 6/17 known loci including tumor-specific activity at SCARB1, a cholesterol metabolism mediator, which has recently been implicated in RCC progression. We validated the asQTL variant through CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and demonstrated a concomitant allelic effect on the overlapping enhancer and on downstream SCARB1 expression. Knockdowns of master transcription factors (TFs) involved in the hypoxia pathway altered the expression of SCARB1 in a kidney cancer cell line, consistent with a variant-TF interaction. Genome-wide, d-asQTLs were significantly enriched for tumor-specific binding of hypoxic transcription factors, implicating a more general mechanism for polygenic germline-somatic interaction.",

    "abstract": "ANO1 (TMEM16A) is a Ca2+-activated Cl- channel that regulates diverse cellular functions including fluid secretion, neuronal excitability, and smooth muscle contraction. ANO1 is activated by elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ and modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Here we describe a closely concerted experimental and computational study, including electrophysiology, mutagenesis, functional assays, and extended sampling of lipid-protein interactions with molecular dynamics (MD) to characterize PI(4,5)P2 binding modes and sites on ANO1. ANO1 currents in excised inside-out patches activated by 270 nM Ca2+ at +100 mV are increased by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 with an EC50 = 1.24 {micro}M. The effect of PI(4,5)P2 is dependent on membrane voltage and Ca2+ and is explained by a stabilization of the ANO1 Ca2+-bound open state. Unbiased atomistic MD simulations with 1.4 mol% PI(4,5)P2 in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer identified 8 binding sites with significant probability of binding PI(4,5)P2. Three of these sites captured 85% of all ANO1 - PI(4,5)P2 interactions. Mutagenesis of basic amino acids near the membrane-cytosol interface found three regions of ANO1 critical for PI(4,5)P2 regulation that correspond to the same three sites identified by MD. PI(4,5)P2 is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between amino acid sidechains and phosphate/hydroxyl groups on PI(4,5)P2. Binding of PI(4,5)P2 alters the position of the cytoplasmic extension of TM6, which plays a crucial role in ANO1 channel gating, and increases the accessibility of the inner vestibule to Cl-ions. We propose a model consisting of a network of three PI(4,5)P2 binding sites at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane allosterically regulating ANO1 channel gating.\\n\\nSignificance statementMembrane proteins dwell in a sea of phospholipids that not only structurally stabilize the proteins by providing a hydrophobic environment for their transmembrane segments, but also dynamically regulate protein function. While many cation channels are known to be regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), relatively little is known about anion channel regulation by phosphoinositides. Using a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified several PI(4,5)P2 binding sites in ANO1 (TMEM16A), a Cl- channel that performs myriad physiological functions from epithelial fluid secretion to regulation of electrical excitability. These binding sites form a band at the cytosolic interface of the membrane that we propose constitute a network to dynamically regulate this highly allosteric protein.",

A combined approach of phylogenetic- and functional trait-based analyses using forewing length and aspect ratio as traits, were used to this hypothesis.\\n\\nA 3-year survey was carried out at three sites (i.e., wet, transition and dry forests) across a climatic gradient in western Ecuador. Transition and dry forests were considered as seasonal, whereas wet forest were considered aseasonal. Butterflies were sampled using traps baited with rotting banana and prawn every two months from Nov 2010 to Sep 2013. Traps were set up at two heights, in the understory and canopy. DNA was extracted to sequence the barcode section of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) for phylogenetic analyses. Measurements of morphological traits, forewing length and aspect ratio were done using digital photographs of specimens.\\n\\nA total of 6466 specimens representing 142 species of Nymphalidae were recorded. Based on phylogenetic- and trait-based analyses, we rejected the hypothesis that assembly processes that limit species similarity (i.e., competition) are likely to predominantly occur in more  stable abiotic environments, whereas habitat filtering can be a major driver of community composition within more variable environments at regional (i.e., aseasonal forest vs seasonal forests) and local scales (i.e., understory vs. canopy). My study of assembly mechanisms revealed the opposite pattern, with stronger evidence for the action of ecological filters in the assembly of butterfly communities from the wet aseasonal forests, and competition likely to be a major assembly process within dry seasonal forests. The present study therefore provided new insights into community assembly mechanisms in one of the richest butterfly faunas worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in phenomics coupled with increased output from sequencing technologies can create the platform needed to rapidly increase abiotic stress tolerance of crops, which increasingly face productivity challenges due to climate change. In particular, the high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) enables researchers to generate large-scale data with temporal resolution. Recently, a random regression model (RRM) was used to model a longitudinal rice projected shoot area (PSA) dataset in an optimal growth environment. However, the utility of RRM is still unknown for phenotypic trajectories obtained from stress environments. Here, we sought to apply RRM to forecast the rice PSA in control and water-limited conditions under various longitudinal cross-validation scenarios. To this end, genomic Legendre polynomials and B-spline basis functions were used to capture PSA trajectories. Prediction accuracy declined slightly for the water-limited plants compared to control plants. Overall, RRM delivered reasonable prediction performance and yielded better prediction than the baseline multi-trait model. The difference between the results obtained using Legendre polynomials and that using B-splines was small; however, the former yielded a higher prediction accuracy. Prediction accuracy for forecasting the last five time points was highest when the entire trajectory from earlier growth stages was used to train the basis functions. Our results suggested that it was possible to decrease phenotyping frequency by only phenotyping every other day in order to reduce costs while minimizing the loss of prediction accuracy. This is the first study showing that RRM could be used to model changes in growth over time under abiotic stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cortical atrophy and degraded axonal health have been shown to coincide during normal aging; however, few studies have examined these measures together. To lend insight into both the regional specificity and the relative timecourse of structural degradation of these tissue compartments across the lifespan, we analyzed grey matter (GM) morphometry (cortical thickness, surface area, volume) and estimates of white matter (WM) microstructure (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity) using traditional univariate and more robust multivariate techniques to examine age associations in 186 healthy adults aged 20-94 years old. Univariate analysis of each tissue type revealed that negative age associations were largest in frontal grey and white matter tissue and weaker in temporal, cingulate, and occipital regions, representative of not only an anterior-to-posterior gradient, but also a medial-to-lateral gradient. Multivariate partial least squares correlation (PLSC) found the greatest covariance between GM and WM was driven by the relationship between WM metrics in the anterior corpus callosum and projections of the genu, anterior cingulum, and fornix; and with GM thickness in parietal and frontal regions. Surface area was far less susceptible to age effects and displayed less covariance with WM metrics, while regional volume covariance patterns largely mirrored those of cortical thickness. Results support a retrogenesis-like model of aging, revealing a coupled relationship between frontal and parietal GM and the underlying WM, which evidence the most protracted development and the most vulnerability during healthy aging.",

While soluble protein design has advanced, membrane protein design remains challenging due to difficulties in modeling the lipid bilayer. In this work, we developed an implicit approach that captures the anisotropic structure, shape of water-filled pores, and nanoscale dimensions of membranes with different lipid compositions. The model improves performance in computational bench-marks against experimental targets including prediction of protein orientations in the bilayer, {Delta}{Delta}G calculations, native structure dis-crimination, and native sequence recovery. When applied to de novo protein design, this approach designs sequences with an amino acid distribution near the native amino acid distribution in membrane proteins, overcoming a critical flaw in previous membrane models that were prone to generating leucine-rich designs. Further, the proteins designed in the new membrane model exhibit native-like features including interfacial aromatic side chains, hydrophobic lengths compatible with bilayer thickness, and polar pores. Our method advances high-resolution membrane protein structure prediction and design toward tackling key biological questions and engineering challenges.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMembrane proteins participate in many life processes including transport, signaling, and catalysis. They constitute over 30% of all proteins and are targets for over 60% of pharmaceuticals.

Recent studies suggest that parental CENP-A is asymmetrically distributed upon stem cell asymmetric division. However, a direct link between centromeres and stem cell identity has not been demonstrated. We show that Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs) and neuroblasts assemble centromeres between G2-phase and prophase, requiring CYCLIN A. Intriguingly, chromosomes that will be inherited by GSCs incorporate more CENP-A and capture more spindle fibers at pro-metaphase. Furthermore, over-expression of CAL1 (Drosophila CENP-A assembly factor) causes GSC-like tumours, while over-expression of both CENP-A and CAL1 promotes stem cell self-renewal. Finally, once centromeres have been assembled in GSCs, continued CENP-A assembly is not required in differentiating cells outside of the niche and CAL1 becomes dispensable. According to our results CENP-A regulates stem cell identity/maintenance. Moreover, crucial centromere assembly occurs in the niche prior to oocyte meiosis.",

Here we utilize a novel analytic approach to quantify and track developmental changes in white matter micro- and macro-structure, calculated from individually oriented fiber-bundle populations, termed \\\"fixels\\\". Fixel-based analysis and mixed-effects models were used to assess tract-wise changes in fiber density and bundle morphology in 73 girls scanned at baseline (ages 4.09-7.02, mean=5.47, SD=0.81), 6-month (N=7), and one-year follow-up (N=42). For comparison, we also assessed changes in commonly utilized diffusion tensor metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, radial and axial diffusivity (MD, RD, AD). Maturational increases in fixel-metrics were seen in most major white matter tracts, with the most rapid increases in the corticospinal tract and slowest or non-significant increases in the genu of the corpus callosum and uncinate fasciculi. As expected, we observed developmental increases in FA and decreases in MD, RD and AD, though percentage changes were smaller relative to fixel-metrics. The majority of tracts showed more substantial morphological than microstructural changes. These findings highlight early childhood as a period of dynamic white matter maturation, characterized by large increases in macroscopic fiber bundle size, mild changes in axonal density, and parallel, albeit less substantial, changes in diffusion tensor metrics.",

Yet, it remains unknown whether interacting areas exhibit the matched traveling waves necessary to support this hypothesized form of interaction.

We demonstrate that both the field potential and spiking in the MEC exhibit prominent 6-12 Hz  theta traveling waves matching those of the hippocampus. The theta phase shifts observed along the MEC were accounted for largely by variation in waveform asymmetry. From this, we hypothesize that that gradients in local physiology underlie both the generation of MEC traveling waves and the functional variations observed previously across the MEC.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems are bacterial adaptive immune pathways that have revolutionized biotechnology and biomedical applications. Despite the potential for human therapeutic development, there are many hurdles that must be overcome before its use in clinical settings. Some clinical safety concerns arise from persistent activity of Cas9 after the desired editing is complete, or from editing activity in unintended cell types or tissues upon in vivo delivery [e.g. by adeno-associated viruses (AAV)]. Although tissue-specific promoters and serotypes with tissue tropisms can be used, suitably compact promoters are not always available for desired cell types, and AAV tissue tropisms are not absolute. To reinforce tissue-specific editing, we exploited anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs), which are proteins evolved as countermeasures against CRISPR immunity. To inhibit Cas9 in all ancillary tissues without compromising editing in the target tissue, we established a flexible platform in which an Acr transgene is repressed by endogenous, tissue-specific microRNAs (miRNAs). We demonstrate that miRNAs regulate the expression of an Acr transgene bearing miRNA-binding sites in its 3 UTR, and control subsequent genome editing outcomes in a cell-type specific manner. We also show that the strategy is applicable to multiple Cas9 orthologs and their respective Acrs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in vivo delivery of Cas9 and Acrs that are targeted for repression by liver-specific miR-122 allow editing in the liver while Acrs devoid of miRNA regulation prevent Cas9 activity. This strategy provides additional safeguards against off-tissue genome editing by confining Cas9 activity to selected cell types.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed the dynamics of multi-species butterfly communities along a climatic gradient with varying precipitation regimes for three consecutive years, and determine how climatic variables associate with observed butterfly seasonality. To provide a baseline for future studies of how climate change might affect these butterfly populations, we additionally explored the role of butterfly seasonality as a potential contributing factor for their susceptibility to climate variation. As far as we know, this represents the first study that simultaneously sampled and described seasonality patterns of tropical butterfly communities across ecosystems with varying climatic seasonality. A 3-year survey was carried out at three sites (i.e., wet, transition and dry forests) across a climatic gradient in western Ecuador. Butterflies were sampled using traps baited with rotting banana and prawn every two months from Nov 2010 to Sep 2013. Traps were set up at two heights, in the understory and canopy. In total, 7046 individuals of 212 species were sampled over 180 sampling days.\\n\\nButterfly communities exhibited conspicuous intra and inter-annual variation in temporal dynamics with certain elements (e.g., maximum abundance recorded) of seasonality patterns likely synchronized in seasonal forests (i.e., transition and dry forest) across years but not in aseasonal forests (i.e., wet forest). In addition, the highest numbers of species and individuals occurred during the wet season across all study sites and years; indeed, rainfall was significantly positively associated with temporal abundance. Likewise, butterfly species displaying stronger seasonality were significantly associated with higher rainfall periods in seasonal forests. Variation in precipitation regimes might significantly affect more seasonal species.",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules may experience independent selection pressures on their sequence and (secondary) structure. Structural features then may be preserved without maintaining their exact position along the sequence. In such cases, corresponding base pairs are no longer formed by homologous bases, leading to the incongruent evolutionary conservation of sequence and structure. In order to model this phenomenon, we introduce bi-alignments as a superposition of two alignments: one modeling sequence homology; the other, structural homology. We show that under natural assumptions on the scoring functions, bi-alignments form a special case of 4-way alignments, in which the incongruencies are measured as indels in the pairwise alignment of the two alignment copies. A preliminary survey of the Rfam database suggests that incongruent evolution of RNAs is not a very rare phenomenon.\\n\\nAvailabilityOur software is freely available at https://github.com/s-will/BiAlign",

We have previously shown non-proteolytic functions of MT1-MMP mediated by its cytoplasmic tail, where the unique tyrosine (Y573) controls intracellular signaling. The Y573D mutation blocks TIMP2/MT1-MMP-induced Erk1/2 and Akt signaling without affecting proteolytic activity.

Skeletal stem cells (SSC) of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice show defective differentiation consistent with the mouse phenotype, which is rescued by wild-type SSC transplant.

    "abstract": "CFTR, a plasma membrane anion channel, plays a key role in controlling transepithelial fluid movement. Excessive activation results in intestinal fluid loss during secretory diarrhoeas, while CFTR mutations underlie cystic fibrosis (CF). Anion permeability depends both on how well CFTR channels work (permeation/gating) and on how many are present at the membrane (reflecting folding, trafficking, metabolic stability). Recently, treatments with two drug classes targeting CFTR - one boosting ion-channel function (potentiators), the other increasing plasma membrane density (correctors) - have provided significant health benefits to CF patients.\n\nHere we present an image-based fluorescence assay that can rapidly and simultaneously estimate both CFTR ion-channel function and the proteins proximity to the membrane. We monitor F508del-CFTR, the most common CF-causing variant, and confirm rescue by low temperature, CFTR-targeting drugs and second-site revertant mutation R1070W. In addition, we characterize a panel of 62 CF-causing mutations. Our measurements correlate well with published data (electrophysiology and biochemistry), further confirming validity of the assay.\n\nFinally, we profile effects of acute treatment with approved potentiator drug VX-770 on the rare-mutation panel. Mapping the potentiation profile on CFTR structures raises mechanistic hypotheses on drug action, suggesting that VX-770 might allow an open-channel conformation with an alternative arrangement of domain interfaces around site 1.\n\nThe assay is a valuable tool for investigation of CFTR molecular mechanisms, allowing accurate inferences on gating/permeation. In addition, by providing a two-dimensional characterization of the CFTR protein, it could better inform development of single-drug and precision therapies addressing the root cause of CF disease.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia-scavenging transmembrane pH-gradient poly(styrene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) polymersomes were investigated for the oral treatment and diagnosis of hyperammonemia, a condition associated with serious neurologic complications in patients with liver disease as well as in infants with urea cycle disorders. While these polymersomes were highly stable in simulated intestinal fluids at extreme bile salt and osmolality conditions, they unexpectedly did not reduce plasmatic ammonia levels in cirrhotic rats after oral dosing. Incubation in dietary fiber hydrogels mimicking the colonic environment suggested that the vesicles were probably destabilized during the dehydration of the intestinal chyme. Our findings question the relevance of commonly used simulated intestinal fluids for studying vesicular stability. With the encapsulation of a pH-sensitive dye in the polymersome core, the local pH increase upon ammonia influx could be exploited to assess the ammonia concentration in the plasma of healthy and cirrhotic rats as well as in other fluids. Due to its high sensitivity and selectivity, this novel polymersome-based assay could prove useful in the monitoring of hyperammonemic patients and in other applications such as drug screening tests.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/631630v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (28K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dd9b02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ebb129org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc15e3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1411a28_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Low pass sequencing has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative to genotyping arrays to identify genetic variants that influence multifactorial traits in humans. For common diseases this typically has required both large sample sizes and comprehensive variant discovery. Genotyping arrays are also routinely used to perform pharmacogenetic (PGx) experiments where sample sizes are likely to be significantly smaller, but clinically relevant effect sizes likely to be larger. To assess how low pass sequencing would compare to array based genotyping for PGx we compared a low-pass assay (in which 1x coverage or less of a target genome is sequenced) along with software for genotype imputation to standard approaches. We sequenced 79 individuals to 1x genome coverage and genotyped the same samples on the Affymetrix Axiom Biobank Precision Medicine Research Array (PMRA). We then down-sampled the sequencing data to 0.8x, 0.6x, and 0.4x coverage, and performed imputation. Both the genotype data and the sequencing data were further used to impute human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes for all samples. We compared the sequencing data and the genotyping array data in terms of four metrics: overall concordance, concordance at single nucleotide polymorphisms in pharmacogenetics-related genes, concordance in imputed HLA genotypes, and imputation r2. Overall concordance between the two assays ranged from 98.2% (for 0.4x coverage sequencing) to 99.2% (for 1x coverage sequencing), with qualitatively similar numbers for the subsets of variants most important in pharmacogenetics. At common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the mean imputation r2 from the genotyping array was 90%, which was comparable to the imputation r2 from 0.4x coverage sequencing, while the mean imputation r2 from 1x sequencing data was 96%. These results indicate that low-pass sequencing to a depth above 0.4x coverage attains higher power for trait mapping when compared to the PMRA.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of classical inbred mouse strains include genes derived from all three major subspecies of the house mouse, Mus musculus. We recently posited that genetic diversity in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene loci of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice reflect differences in subspecies origin. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted high-throughput sequencing of IGH gene rearrangements to document IGH variable (IGHV), joining (IGHJ), and diversity (IGHD) genes in four inbred wild-derived mouse strains (CAST/EiJ, LEWES/EiJ, MSM/MsJ, and PWD/PhJ), and a single disease model strain (NOD/ShiLtJ), collectively representing genetic backgrounds of several major mouse subspecies. A total of 341 germline IGHV sequences were inferred in the wild-derived strains, including 247 not curated in the International Immunogenetics Information System. In contrast, 83/84 inferred NOD IGHV genes had previously been observed in C57BL/6 mice. Variability among the strains examined was observed for only a single IGHJ gene, involving a description of a novel allele. In contrast, unexpected variation was found in the IGHD gene loci, with four previously unreported IGHD gene sequences being documented. Very few IGHV sequences of C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were shared with strains representing major subspecies, suggesting that their IGH loci may be complex mosaics of genes of disparate origins. This suggests a similar level of diversity is likely present in the IGH loci of other classical inbred strains. This must now be documented if we are to properly understand inter-strain variation in models of antibody-mediated disease.",

    "abstract": "The human T cell leukemia virus HTLV-1 establishes a persistent infection in vivo in which the viral sense-strand transcription is usually silent at a given time in each cell. However, cellular stress responses trigger the reactivation of HTLV-1, enabling the virus to transmit to a new host cell. Using single-molecule RNA FISH, we measured the kinetics of the HTLV-1 transcriptional reactivation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from HTLV-1+ individuals. The abundance of the HTLV-1 sense and antisense transcripts was quantified hourly during incubation of the HTLV-1-infected PBMCs ex vivo. We found that, in each cell, the sense-strand transcription occurs in two distinct phases: the initial low-rate transcription is followed by a phase of rapid transcription. The onset of transcription peaked between 1 and 3 hours after the start of in vitro incubation. The variance in the transcription intensity was similar in polyclonal HTLV-1+ PBMCs (with tens of thousands of distinct provirus insertion sites), and in samples with a single dominant HTLV-1+ clone. A stochastic simulation model was developed to estimate the parameters of HTLV-1 proviral transcription kinetics. In PBMCs from a leukemic subject with one dominant T-cell clone, the model indicated that the average duration of HTLV-1 sense-strand activation by Tax (i.e. the rapid transcription) was less than one hour. HTLV-1 antisense transcription was stable during reactivation of the sense-strand. The antisense transcript HBZ was produced at an average rate of x~0.1 molecules per hour per HTLV-1+ cell; however, between 20% and 70% of HTLV-1-infected cells were HBZ-negative at a given time, the percentage depending on the individual subject. HTLV-1-infected cells are exposed to a range of stresses when they are drawn from the host, which initiate the viral reactivation. We conclude that whereas antisense-strand transcription is stable throughout the stress response, the HTLV-1 sense-strand reactivation is highly heterogeneous and occurs in short, self-terminating bursts.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman retroviruses such as HIV-1 and HTLV-1 (human T cell leukemia virus) can establish a latent infection in the host cell. However, these viruses need to be able to produce viral genome to propagate in a new host. HTLV-1-infected cells are transmitted through breastfeeding, blood transfusion and sexual contact, and HTLV-1 restores transcription once the infected cells are drawn from infected individuals. We measured the kinetics of the HTLV-1 transcriptional reactivation in blood cells isolated from HTLV-1+ individuals by single-molecule RNA FISH. Viral transcripts were visualised as diffraction-limited spots and their abundance was quantified at one-hour intervals. The onset of the virus transcription peaked after one to three hours of incubation. In each cell, a short period of slow HTLV-1 transcription was followed by a phase of rapid transcription. Computer simulation, based on experimental data on PBMCs from a leukemic patient with a single dominant HTLV-1-infected T cell clone, indicated that this rapid transcription from the HTLV-1 sense-strand promoter activated by Tax was terminated in less than an hour. The HTLV-1 antisense transcript HBZ was constantly produced at a low level, and 50% {+/-} 20% of HTLV-1+ cells were negative for HBZ at a given time. These results demonstrate how rapidly HTLV-1 is reactivated and potentially becomes infectious, once HTLV-1+ cells are transmitted into a new host.",

    "abstract": "Drought represents a significant stress to soil microorganisms and is known to reduce microbial activity and organic matter decomposition in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, we still lack a detailed understanding of the drought stress adaptations of microbial decomposers. We hypothesised that drought causes greater microbial allocation to stress tolerance relative to growth pathways. Here we present metatranscriptomic and metabolomic data on the physiological response of in situ microbial communities on plant leaf litter to long-term drought and pulse wetting in Californian grass and shrub ecosystems. Wetting litter after a long dry summer caused only subtle shifts in gene expression. On grass litter, communities from the decade-long ambient and reduced precipitation treatments had distinct functional profiles. The most discernable physiological adaptations to drought were production or uptake of compatible solutes to maintain cellular osmotic balance, and synthesis of capsular and extracellular polymeric substances as a mechanism to retain water. The results show a clear functional response to drought in grass litter communities with greater allocation to survival relative to growth that could affect decomposition under drought. In contrast, communities on chemically more diverse and complex shrub litter had smaller physiological differences in response to long-term drought but higher investment in resource acquisition traits across treatments, suggesting that the functional response to drought is constrained by substrate quality. Our findings suggest, for the first time in a field setting, a trade-off between microbial drought stress tolerance, resource acquisition and growth traits in leaf litter microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Because predator-prey interactions in nature are multifarious, linking phenomenological predation rates to the underlying behavioural or ecological mechanisms is challenging. Size- and sex-specific predation has been implicated as a major selective force keeping animals small, affecting the evolution of body size and sexual size dimorphism. We experimentally assessed predation by various amphibian (frogs and toads) and arthropod predators (bugs, flies, spiders) on three species of dung flies with similar ecology but contrasting body sizes, sexual size dimorphism and coloration. Predators were offered a size range of flies in single- or mixed-sex groups. As expected based on optimal foraging theory, some anurans (e.g. Bufo bufo) selected larger prey, thus selecting against large body size of the flies, while others (Bombina variagata and Rana esculenta) showed no such pattern. Small juvenile Rana temporaria metamorphs, in contrast, preferred small flies, as did all arthropod predators, a pattern that can be explained by larger prey being better at escaping. The more mobile males were not eaten more frequently or faster than the cryptic females, even when conspicuously colored. Predation rates on flies in mixed groups permitting mating activity were not higher, contrary to expectation, nor was predation generally sex-specific. We conclude that the size-selectivity of predators, and hence the viability selection pattern exerted on their prey, depends foremost on the relative body sizes of the two in a continuous fashion. Sex-specific predation by single predators appears to contribute little to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, the mechanistic study of predation requires integration of both the predators and the preys perspectives, and phenomenological field studies of predation remain indispensable.",
