    "abstract": "Standard infectious disease practice calls for aggressive drug treatment that rapidly eliminates the pathogen population before resistance can emerge. When resistance is absent, this elimination strategy can lead to complete cure. However, it also removes drug-sensitive cells as quickly as possible, removing competitive barriers that may slow the growth of resistant cells. In contrast to the elimination strategy, the containment strategy aims to maintain the maximum tolerable number of pathogens, exploiting competitive suppression to achieve chronic control. Here we combine in vitro experiments in computer-controlled bioreactors with mathematical modeling to investigate whether containment strategies can delay failure of antibiotic treatment regimens. To do so, we measured the \\\"escape time\\\" required for drug-resistant E. coli populations to eclipse a threshold density maintained by adaptive antibiotic dosing. Populations containing only resistant cells rapidly escape containment, but we found that matched populations with the maximum possible number of sensitive cells could be contained for significantly longer. The increase in escape time occurs only when the threshold density-the acceptable bacterial burden-is sufficiently high, an effect that mathematical models attribute to increased competition. The findings provide decisive experimental confirmation that maintaining the maximum number of sensitive cells can be used to contain resistance when the size of the population is sufficiently large.",

    "abstract": "AbstractsSimian T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (STLV-1) is disseminated among various non-human primate species and is closely related to human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. Notably, the prevalence of STLV-1 infection in Japanese macaques (JMs) is estimated to be much greater than that in other non-human primates; however, the mechanism and mode of STLV-1 transmission remain unknown. We hypothesized that a substantial proportion of infected macaques may play a critical role as viral super-spreaders for efficient inter-individual transmission leading to the high prevalence of infection. To address this, we examined a cohort of 280 JMs reared in a free-range facility for levels of anti-STLV-1 antibody titers (ABTs) and STLV-1 proviral loads (PVLs). We found that the prevalence of STLV-1 in the cohort reached up to 65% (180/280), however, the ABTs and PVLs were normally distributed with mean values of 4076 and 0.62%, respectively, which were comparable to those of HTLV-1-infected humans. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe the macaques with abnormally high PVLs and poor ABTs, and therefore, the possibility of viral super-spreaders was unlikely. Results from further analyses regarding age-dependent changes in STLV-1 prevalence and a longitudinal follow-up of STLV-1 seroconversion strongly suggest that frequent horizontal transmission is a major route of STLV-1 infection, probably due to the unique social ecology of JMs associated with environmental adaptation.\\n\\nImportanceWe investigated the cause of the high prevalence of STLV-1 infection in the studied JMs cohort. Contrary to our expectations, the potential viral super-spreaders as shown by abnormally high PVLs and poor ABTs were not observed among the JMs. Rather, the ABTs and PVLs among the infected JMs were comparable to those of HTLV-1-infected humans although the prevalence of HTLV-1 in humans is much less than the macaques. Further analyses demonstrate that the prevalence drastically increased over one year of age and most of these animals over 6 years of age were infected with STLV-1, and that in the longitudinal follow-up study frequent seroconversion occurred in not only infants but also in juvenile and adult seronegative monkeys (around 20% per year). This is the first report showing that frequent horizontal transmission without viral super-spreaders may cause high prevalence of STLV-1 infection in JMs.",

    "abstract": "The chronnectome of the human brain represents the dynamics of functional organization in interacting regions, but its organizational principle and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using task-free fMRI and postmortem gene expression data, we conduct a transcriptome-chronnectome association study to investigate the spatial configurations of dynamic brain networks and their associations with transcriptional signatures. We reveal a spatial layout of network dynamics in the human brain chronnectome that reflects the cortical hierarchy and myelin content spanning from primary to transmodal areas. We further identify the transcriptional signature of this layout, with the top-related genes enriched for the ion channel and mitochondria terms. Moreover, the expression of these genes significantly predicts brain dynamics-behavior coupling. These findings highlight the hierarchical organizing principle and underlying molecular basis of the spatial configurations of dynamic brain networks, thereby contributing to our understanding of the associations among gene expression, network dynamics, and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "One of the principal internal signals controlling plant growth and defense is jasmonate (JA), a potent growth inhibitor that is simultaneously a central regulator of plant immunity to herbivores and pathogens. When shade-intolerant plants perceive the proximity of competitors using the photoreceptor phytochrome B (phyB), they accelerate growth and down-regulate JA responses. However, the mechanisms by which photoreceptors relay light cues to the JA signaling pathway are not understood. Here we identify a sulfotransferase (ST2a) that is strongly up-regulated by plant proximity perceived by phyB via the phyB-Phytochrome Interacting Factor (PIF) signaling module. By catalyzing the formation of a sulfated JA derivative, ST2a acts to degrade bioactive forms of JA and represents a direct molecular link between photoreceptors and hormone signaling in plants. The enzyme provides a molecular mechanism for prioritizing shade avoidance over defense under close plant competition.",
