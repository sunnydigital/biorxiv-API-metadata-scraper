    "abstract": "Bacteria are able to adapt to different environments by changing their \\\"metabolic strategies\\\", i.e. the ways in which they uptake available resources from the environment. For example, in a celebrated experiment Jacques Monod showed that bacteria cultured in media containing two different sugars consume them sequentially, resulting in bi-phasic growth curves called \\\"diauxic shifts\\\". From the theoretical point of view, microbial communities are commonly described using MacArthurs consumer-resource model, which describes the population dynamics of species competing for a given set of resources. In this model, however, metabolic strategies are treated as constant parameters. Here, we introduce adaptive metabolic strategies in the framework of consumer-resource models, allowing the strategies to evolve to maximize each species relative fitness. By doing so, we are able to describe quantitatively, and without invoking any specific molecular mechanisms for the metabolism of the microbial species, growth curves of the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae measured in a controlled experimental set-up, with galactose as the primary carbon source. We also show that metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment. A connection between the Competitive Exclusion Principle and the metabolic theory of ecology is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "While it is well established that cortical morphology differs in relation to a variety of inter-individual factors, it is often characterized using estimates of volume, thickness, surface area, or gyrification. Here we developed a computational approach for estimating sulcal width and depth that relies on cortical surface reconstructions output by FreeSurfer. While other approaches for estimating sulcal morphology exist, studies often require the use of multiple brain morphology programs that have been shown to differ in their approaches to localize sulcal landmarks, yielding morphological estimates based on inconsistent boundaries. To demonstrate the approach, sulcal morphology was estimated in three large sample of adults across the lifespan, in relation to aging. A fourth sample is additionally used to estimate test-retest reliability of the approach.

    "abstract": "The purpose of perception is driving action. During tasting, for instance, every stimulus must be either swallowed or rejected (the latter via a behavior known as \"gaping\"). Taste responses in the rodent primary gustatory cortex (GC) span this sensorimotor divide, progressing through a series of firing epochs that culminate in the emergence of action-related firing. Population analyses reveal this emergence to be a sudden, coherent ensemble transition that, despite varying in latency between trials, precedes gaping onset by 0.2-0.3s. Here, we tested whether this transition drives gaping, delivering 0.5s GC perturbations at various time-points in tasting trials. Perturbations significantly delayed gaping, but only when they preceded the action-related transition - thus, the same perturbation might have an impact or not, depending on the transition latency in that particular trial. Our results suggest a distributed attractor network model of taste processing, and a dynamical role for cortex in driving motor behavior.",

    "abstract": "Self-reported smoking status is prone to misclassification due to under-reporting, while biomarkers like cotinine can only measure recent exposure. Smoking strongly influences DNA methylation, with current, former and never smokers exhibiting different methylation profiles. Recently, two approaches were proposed to calculate scores based on smoking-responsive DNA methylation loci, to serve as reliable indicators of long-term exposure and potential biomarkers to estimate smoking behavior. However, these two methodologies need significant improvements to make them globally applicable to all populations and to achieve an optimal classification of individuals with unknown smoking habits. To advance the practical applicability of the smoking-associated methylation signals, we used machine learning methodology to train a classifier for smoking status prediction. We show the prediction performance of our classifier on three independent whole-blood test datasets demonstrating its robustness and global applicability. Furthermore, we show the cross-tissue functionality of our classifier in tissues other than blood. Additionally, we provide the community with an R package, EpiSmokEr, facilitating implementation of our classifier to predict smoking status in future studies.",

Single molecule Cav1 super-resolution microscopy analysis previously identified caveolae and three distinct scaffold domains: smaller S1A and S2B scaffolds and larger hemispherical S2 scaffolds. Application here of network modularity analysis of SMLM data for endogenous Cav1 labeling in HeLa cells shows that small scaffolds combine to form larger scaffolds and caveolae. We find modules within Cav1 blobs by maximizing the intra-connectivity between Cav1 molecules within a module and minimizing the inter-connectivity between Cav1 molecules across modules, which is achieved via spectral decomposition of the localizations adjacency matrix. Features of modules are then matched with intact blobs to find the similarity between the module-blob pairs of group centers. Our results show that smaller S1A and S1B scaffolds are made up of small polygons, that S1B scaffolds correspond to S1A scaffold dimers and that caveolae and hemi-spherical S2 scaffolds are complex, modular structures formed from S1B and S1A scaffolds, respectively. Polyhedral interactions of Cav1 oligomers therefore leads progressively to the formation of larger and more complex scaffold domains and the biogenesis of caveolae.",

This has led to a proliferation of poorly characterized antibodies of suspect quality, which in turn has led to flaws in the literature that hamper research progress, including the study of human disease. We selected the human protein C9ORF72 as a test case to implement a more standardized antibody characterization process. Mutations in the gene C9ORF72 are the major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia but much remains unknown regarding the function of the encoded protein. We used CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout cells and knockout mice as controls to characterize 14 C9ORF72 antibodies including 12 commercially available antibodies advertised as selective for C9ORF72. We found one monoclonal antibody that is specific for the protein in immunoblot and that also recognizes C9ORF72 specifically in immunohistochemical applications on brain sections. A second C9ORF72 monoclonal antibody is effective for immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Some of the antibodies that do not recognize C9ORF72 have been used in highly cited papers, raising concern over conclusions regarding previously reported C9ORF72 properties.",

    "abstract": "Studying the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory networks is essential to understand the biological mechanisms by which genetic variation causes variation in phenotypes. Bayesian networks provide an elegant statistical approach for multi-trait genetic mapping and modelling causal trait relationships. However, inferring Bayesian gene networks from high-dimensional genetics and genomics data is challenging, because the number of possible networks scales super-exponentially with the number of nodes, and the computational cost of conventional Bayesian network inference methods quickly becomes prohibitive. We propose an alternative method to infer high-quality Bayesian gene networks that easily scales to thousands of genes. Our method first reconstructs a node ordering by conducting pairwise causal inference tests between genes, which then allows to infer a Bayesian network via a series of independent variable selection problems, one for each gene. We demonstrate using simulated and real systems genetics data that this results in a Bayesian network with equal, and sometimes better, likelihood than the conventional methods, while having a significantly higher over-lap with groundtruth networks and being orders of magnitude faster. Moreover our method allows for a unified false discovery rate control across genes and individual edges, and thus a rigorous and easily interpretable way for tuning the sparsity level of the inferred network. Bayesian network inference using pairwise node ordering is a highly efficient approach for reconstructing gene regulatory networks when prior information for the inclusion of edges exists or can be inferred from the available data.",

We investigated the effects of dihydrotestosterone, a potent androgen, on neurogenesis in adult and middle-aged males and females. Rats were gonadectomized and injected with the DNA synthesis marker, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). The following day rats began receiving daily injections of oil or DHT for 30 days. We evaluated cell proliferation (Ki67) and new neuron survival (BrdU and BrdU/NeuN) in the hippocampus of male and female rats using immunohistochemistry. As expected, DHT increased new neuron survival in young males but surprisingly not in middle-aged male rats. In females, DHT did not significantly affect adult neurogenesis in young or middle age. Our results indicate that DHT regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a sex- and age-dependent manner.",

A key method to address this question is to collect data on introduced species that have successfully invaded a broad diversity of novel environments, and analyze how their life-history traits changed with these new constraints. Here, we present and analyze such a unique data set in the European earwig Forficula auricularia L, an insect that invaded North America during the last century. We conducted a common garden experiment, in which we measured 13 life-history traits in 4158 individuals from 19 populations across North America. Our results demonstrate that the successful invasion of this species came with changes in 10 of their life-history traits in response to thermal regimes (winter-summer and autumn-spring temperatures), but with no change in response to the overall mean temperatures of the invaded locations. Importantly, we show that some of these changes are by-products of novel thermal regimes, whereas others reflect adaptive strategies of females to these constraints. Overall, our findings reveal the importance of thermal regimes over mean temperatures in climate adaptation, and emphasize that studying adaptive capabilities is crucial to predict the limits of biological invasions.",

    "abstract": "Language impairment is common after left-hemisphere damage. However, the involvement of perilesional and homologous contralateral regions in compensating for left-sided lesions remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine acute organizational changes in brain activity related to conceptual and lexical retrieval in unimpaired language production following transient disruption of the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG). In a randomized singleblind within-subject experiment, we recorded the electroencephalogram from sixteen healthy participants during a context-driven picture-naming task. Prior to the task, the left MTG was perturbed with real neuronavigated continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) or sham stimulation. During the task, participants read lead-in sentences that created a constraining (e.g. \"The farmer milks the\") or non-constraining context (e.g. \"The farmer buys the\"). The last word was shown as a picture that participants had to name (e.g. \"cow\"). Replicating behavioral studies, participants were overall faster in naming pictures following a constraining relative to a non-constraining context, but this effect did not differ between real and sham cTBS. Real cTBS, however, increased overall error rates compared to sham cTBS. In line with previous studies, we observed a decrease in alpha-beta (8-24 Hz) oscillatory power for constraining relative to non-constraining contexts over left temporal-parietal cortex after participants received sham cTBS. However, following real cTBS, this decrease extended towards left prefrontal regions associated with both domain-general and domain-specific control mechanisms. Our findings provide evidence that immediately after the disruption of the left MTG, the lexical-semantic network is able to quickly reconfigure, also recruiting domain-general regions.",

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin that acts by binding to the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor, has also been implicated in the progression of several types of cancer. However, its role in medulloblastoma (MB), the most common type of malignant brain tumor afflicting children, remains unclear. Here we show that selective TrkB inhibition with the small molecule compound ANA-12 impaired proliferation and viability of human UW228 and D283 MB cells. These effects were accompanied by increased apoptosis, reduced extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, increased expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and differential modulation of p21 expression dependent on the cell line. In addition, MB cells treated with ANA-12 showed morphological alterations consistent with differentiation, increased levels of the neural differentiation marker {beta}-III Tubulin (TUBB3), and reduced expression of the stemness marker Nestin. Finally, TrkB inhibition was able to slow the growth of MB tumors xenografted into nude mice. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that selective TrkB inhibition can display consistent anticancer effects in MB, possibly by modulating intracellular signaling and gene expression related to tumor progression, apoptosis, and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Regional variation in climate can generate differences in population dynamics and stage structure. Where regional differences exist, the best approach to pest management may be region specific. Salmon lice are a stage structured marine copepod that parasitizes salmonids at aquaculture sites worldwide, and have fecundity, development, and mortality rates that depend on temperature and salinity. We show that in Atlantic Canada and Norway, where the oceans are relatively cold, salmon lice abundance decreases during the winter months, but ultimately increases from year-to-year, while in Ireland and Chile, where the oceans are warmer, the population size grows monotonically without any seasonal declines. In colder regions, during the winter the stage structure is dominated by the adult stage, which is in contrast to warmer regions where all stages are abundant year round. These differences translate into region specific recommendations for management: regions with slower population growth have lower critical stocking densities, and regions with cold winters have a seasonal dependence in the timing of follow-up chemotherapeutic treatments. Predictions of our salmon lice model agree with empirical data, and our approach provides a method to understand the effects of regional differences in climate on salmon lice dynamics and management.",

Here, we aimed to overcome this challenge using a unique combination of three methods. First, we leveraged a histological dataset with unprecedented 3D coverage, 3D BigBrain. Second, we imposed a computational unfolding framework that respects the topological continuity of hippocampal subfields, which are traditionally defined by laminar composition. Third, we adapted neocortical parcellation techniques to map the hippocampus with respect to not only laminar but also morphological features. Unsupervised clustering of these features revealed subdivisions that closely resemble ground-truth manual subfield segmentations. Critically, we also show that morphological features alone are sufficient to derive most hippocampal subfield boundaries. Moreover, some features showed differences within subfields along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. Our findings highlight new characteristics of internal hippocampal structure, and offer new avenues for its characterization with in-vivo neuroimaging.",

Here we provide evidence of a crucial role for BLIMP1 in the survival of WM cells and further demonstrate that BLIMP1 is necessary for the expression of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in both WM and multiple myeloma. The effect of BLIMP1 on EZH2 levels is post translational, at least partially through the regulation of proteasomal targeting of EZH2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and transcriptome profiling suggest that the two factors co-operate in regulating genes involved in cancer cell immune evasion. Co-cultures of natural killer cells and WM cells further reveal that both factors participate directly in immune evasion, promoting escape from natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity. Together, the interplay of BLIMP1 and EZH2 plays a vital role in promoting the survival of WM cells.",

Insulin signaling has been implicated in OCD. We extend previous work by assessing genetic overlap between OCD, population-based OCS, and central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral insulin signaling.\\n\\nMethodsWe conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in the population-based Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC, 650 children and adolescents) of the total OCS score and six OCS factors from an exploratory factor analysis of 22 questions. Subsequently, we performed polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis to assess shared genetic etiologies between clinical OCD (using GWAS data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium), the total OCS score and OCS factors. We then performed gene-set analyses with a set of OCD-linked genes centered around CNS insulin-regulated synaptic function and PRS analyses for five peripheral insulin signaling-related traits. For validation purposes, we explored data from the independent Spit for Science population cohort (5047 children and adolescents).\\n\\nResultsIn the PNC, we found a shared genetic etiology between OCD and  impairment,  contamination/cleaning and  guilty taboo thoughts. In the Spit for Science cohort, we were able to validate the finding for  contamination/cleaning, and additionally observed genetic sharing between OCD and  symmetry/counting/ordering.

We also identified genetic sharing between peripheral insulin signaling-related traits (type 2 diabetes and the blood levels of HbA1C, fasting insulin and 2 hour glucose) and OCD as well as certain OCS.\\n\\nConclusionsOCD, OCS in the population and insulin-related traits share genetic risk factors, indicating a common etiological mechanism underlying somatic and psychiatric disorders.",

On the 39 newly released membrane proteins, our approach successfully identifies the correct TM segments and boundaries for at least 3 cases while all existing methods fail to do so. When applied to the entire human proteome, our method can identify the incorrect annotations of TM regions by UniProt and discover the membrane-related proteins that are not manually curated as membrane proteins.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttp://pureseqtm.predmp.com/",

Sometimes referred to as muscle cancer, RMS is a cancer of muscle and non-muscle origin that phenocopies incompletely differentiated myoblasts or activated satellite (muscle stem) cells. Interestingly, embryonal RMS (ERMS) has been observed to undergo terminal myogenic differentiation in response to stress induced by chemotherapy and radiation therapy4, 9, 24. Given the propensity of rhabdomyosarcoma to differentiation, in this report we explore the use of differentiation therapy combining MEK inhibitor (MEKi) cobimetinib and chemotherapy as a strategy to halt RMS growth. We evaluated a representative panel of RMS cell lines with cobimetinib and chemotherapy in two dosing schedules that mimic clinical use followed by cell growth evaluation and high content analysis (differentiation) assays. We uncovered that cobimetinib does not have significant additive or synergistic effects on cell differentiation or cell growth with chemotherapy in RMS and can have unanticipated antagonistic effects; specifically, pre-exposure of cobimetinib to cells can decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy-mediated cell growth inhibition in vitro. Although differentiation-therapy is still a potential viable strategy in RMS, our data do not support MEKi/chemotherapy co-treatment in this context.",

    "abstract": "Autologous, CCR5 gene-edited hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is a promising strategy for achieving HIV remission. However, only a fraction of HSPCs can be edited ex vivo to provide protection against infection prior to autologous transplantation. The optimal transplantation conditions for achieving viral control in the absence of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) are still unknown. We analyzed data from SHIV-1157ipd3N4-infected juvenile pig-tailed macaques that underwent autologous HSPC transplantation with and without CCR5 gene editing. We developed a mathematical model that recapitulates reconstitution of T cell subset counts and SHIV plasma viral loads in control and transplanted macaques. The model predicts that viral control can be obtained following ART treatment interruption (ATI) when: 1) levels of transplanted HSPCs are at least 10-fold higher than residual endogenous HSPCs after total body irradiation and 2) the fraction of protected HSPCs in the transplant achieves a threshold (73%-90%) sufficient to overcome transplantation-dependent loss of SHIV immunity. Under these conditions, if ATI is withheld until transplanted gene-modified cells engraft and reconstitute to a steady state, then spontaneous viral control is projected to occur immediately. Our results support strategies that 1) increase stem cell dose, 2) enhance potency of conditioning regimen, 3) elevate fraction of gene modified SHIV-resistant cells, 4) extend periods between HSPC transplantation and ATI with tracking of CD4+CCR5- cell recovery and / or 5) augment anti-SHIV immunity to achieve sustained SHIV remission.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAutologous transplantation of {Delta}CCR5 HSPCs may induce post-ATI SHIV control when the gene-edited cell dose is sufficient to overcome SHIV immunity loss.",

A combined approach of phylogenetic- and functional trait-based analyses using forewing length and aspect ratio as traits, were used to this hypothesis.\\n\\nA 3-year survey was carried out at three sites (i.e., wet, transition and dry forests) across a climatic gradient in western Ecuador. Transition and dry forests were considered as seasonal, whereas wet forest were considered aseasonal. Butterflies were sampled using traps baited with rotting banana and prawn every two months from Nov 2010 to Sep 2013. Traps were set up at two heights, in the understory and canopy. DNA was extracted to sequence the barcode section of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) for phylogenetic analyses. Measurements of morphological traits, forewing length and aspect ratio were done using digital photographs of specimens.\\n\\nA total of 6466 specimens representing 142 species of Nymphalidae were recorded. Based on phylogenetic- and trait-based analyses, we rejected the hypothesis that assembly processes that limit species similarity (i.e., competition) are likely to predominantly occur in more  stable abiotic environments, whereas habitat filtering can be a major driver of community composition within more variable environments at regional (i.e., aseasonal forest vs seasonal forests) and local scales (i.e., understory vs. canopy). My study of assembly mechanisms revealed the opposite pattern, with stronger evidence for the action of ecological filters in the assembly of butterfly communities from the wet aseasonal forests, and competition likely to be a major assembly process within dry seasonal forests. The present study therefore provided new insights into community assembly mechanisms in one of the richest butterfly faunas worldwide.",

We compared the accuracy, continuity, and gene annotation of genome assemblies generated from either high-fidelity (HiFi) or continuous long-read (CLR) datasets from the same complete hydatidiform mole human genome. We find that the HiFi sequence data assemble an additional 10% of duplicated regions and more accurately represent the structure of tandem repeats, as validated with orthogonal analyses. As a result, an additional 5 Mbp of pericentromeric sequences are recovered in the HiFi assembly, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in the NG50 within 1 Mbp of the centromere (HiFi 480.6 kbp, CLR 191.5 kbp). Additionally, the HiFi genome assembly was generated in significantly less time with fewer computational resources than the CLR assembly. Although the HiFi assembly has significantly improved continuity and accuracy in many complex regions of the genome, it still falls short of the assembly of centromeric DNA and the largest regions of segmental duplication using existing assemblers. Despite these shortcomings, our results suggest that HiFi may be the most effective stand-alone technology for de novo assembly of human genomes.",

However, the mechanisms governing afferent responsiveness to dually modulate these processes are not well characterized.

This correlated with primary muscle afferent sensitization and increased expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in injured muscle and increased expression of GDNF family receptor 1 (GFR1) in DRGs. Here we report that increased GDNF/GFR1 signaling to sensory neurons from ischemia/reperfusion affected muscle modulated nociceptive-like behaviors, increased EPRs, and group III/IV muscle afferent sensitization. This appeared to have taken effect through increased CREB/CREB-binding protein mediated expression of the purinergic receptor P2X5 in the DRGs. Muscle GDNF signaling to neurons may play an important dual role in nociception and sympathetic reflexes and could provide a novel therapeutic target for treating complications from ischemic injuries.",

    "abstract": "Bacteroides fragilis constitutes a significant part of the normal human gut microbiota and can also act as an opportunistic pathogen. Antimicrobial resistance and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes are increasing, and prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility based on sequence information could support targeted antimicrobial therapy in a clinical setting. Complete identification of insertion sequence (IS) elements carrying promoter sequences upstream of resistance genes is necessary for prediction of antimicrobial resistance. However, de novo assemblies from short reads alone are often fractured due to repeat regions and the presence multiple copies of identical IS elements. Identification of plasmids in clinical isolates can aid in the surveillance of the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance and comprehensive sequence databases support microbiome and metagenomic studies. Here we test several short-read, hybrid and long-lead assembly pipelines by assembling the type strain B. fragilis CCUG4856T (=ATCC25285=NCTC9343) with Illumina short reads and long reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing. Hybrid assembly with Unicycler, using quality filtered Illumina reads and Filtlong filtered and Canu corrected ONT reads produced the assembly of highest quality. This approach was then applied to six clinical multidrug resistant B. fragilis isolates and, with minimal manual finishing of chromosomal assemblies of three isolates, complete, circular assemblies of all isolates were produced. Eleven circular, putative plasmids were identified in the six assemblies of which only three corresponded to a known cultured Bacteroides plasmid. Complete IS elements could be identified upstream of antimicrobial resistance genes, however there was not complete correlation between the absence of IS elements and antimicrobial susceptibility. As our knowledge on factors that increase expression of resistance genes in the absence of IS elements is limited, further research is needed prior to implementing antimicrobial resistance prediction for B. fragilis from whole genome sequencing.\\n\\nREPOSITORIESSequence files (MinION reads de-multiplexed with Deepbinner and basecalled with Albacore in fast5 format and Illumina MiSeq reads in fastq format) and final genome assemblies have been deposited to NCBI/ENA/DDBJ under Bioproject accessions PRJNA525024, PRJNA244942, PRJNA244943, PRJNA244944, PRJNA253771, PRJNA254401, and PRJNA254455\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTBacterial whole genome sequencing is increasingly used in public health, clinical, and research laboratories for typing, identification of virulence factors, phylogenomics, outbreak investigation and identification of antimicrobial resistance genes. In some settings, diagnostic microbiome amplicon sequencing or metagenomic sequencing directly from clinical samples is already implemented and informs treatment decisions. The prospect of prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility based on resistome identification holds promises for shortening time from sample to report and informing treatment decisions. Databases with comprehensive reference sequences of high quality are a necessity for these purposes. Bacteroides fragilis is an important part of the human commensal gut microbiota and is also the most commonly isolated anaerobic bacterium from non-faecal clinical samples but few complete genome assemblies are available through public databases. The fragmented assemblies from short read de novo assembly often negate the identification of insertion sequences upstream of antimicrobial resistance gens, which is necessary for prediction of antimicrobial resistance from whole genome sequencing. Here we test multiple assembly pipelines with short read Illumina data and long read data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencing to select an optimal pipeline for complete genome assembly of B. fragilis. However, B. fragilis is a highly plastic genome with multiple inversive repeat regions, and complete genome assembly of six clinical multidrug resistant isolates still required minor manual finishing for half the isolates. Complete identification of known insertion sequences and resistance genes was possible from the complete genome. In addition, the current catalogue of Bacteroides plasmid sequences is augmented by eight new plasmid sequences that do not have corresponding, complete entries in the NCBI database. This work almost doubles the number of publicly available complete, finished chromosomal and plasmid B. fragilis sequences paving the way for further studies on antimicrobial resistance prediction and increased quality of microbiome and metagenomic studies.\\n\\nDATA SUMMARYO_LISequence read files (Oxford Nanopore (ONT) fast5 files and Illumina fastq files) as well as the final genome assemblies have been deposited to NCBI/ENA/DDBJ under Bioproject accessions PRJNA525024, PRJNA244942, PRJNA244943, PRJNA244944, PRJNA253771, PRJNA254401, and PRJNA254455.\\nC_LIO_LIFastq format of demultiplexed ONT reads trimmed of adapters and barcode sequences are available at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2677927\\nC_LIO_LIGenome assemblies from the assembly pipeline validation are available at doi: doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2648546.\\nC_LIO_LIGenome assemblies corresponding to each stage of the process of the assembly are available at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2661704.\\nC_LIO_LIFull commands and scripts used are available from GitHub: https://github.com/thsyd/bfassembly as well as a static version at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2683511\\nC_LI",

Decisions regarding the clinical management of suspected arboviral infection are challenging in resource-limited settings, particularly when deciding on patient hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine if hospitalization of individuals with suspected arboviral infections could be predicted using subject intake data.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsTwo prediction models were developed using data from a surveillance study in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador with a high burden of arboviral infections. Data was obtained from subjects who presented at sentinel medical centers with suspected arboviral infection (November 2013 to September 2017). The first prediction model--called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus (SISA)-- used only demographic and symptom data. The second prediction model--called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus with Laboratory (SISAL)--incorporated laboratory data. These models were selected by comparing the prediction ability of seven machine learning algorithms; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from the prediction of a test dataset was used to select the final algorithm for each model. After eliminating those with missing data, the SISA dataset had 534 subjects, and the SISAL dataset had 98 subjects. For SISA, the best prediction algorithm was the generalized boosting model, with an AUC of 0.91. For SISAL, the best prediction algorithm was the elastic net with an AUC of 0.94. A sensitivity analysis revealed that SISA and SISAL are not directly comparable to one another.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceBoth SISA and SISAL were able to predict arbovirus hospitalization with a high degree of accuracy in our dataset. These algorithms will need to be tested and validated on new data from future patients. Machine learning is a powerful prediction tool and provides an excellent option for new management tools and clinical assessment of arboviral infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPatient triage is a critical decision for clinicians; patients with suspected arbovirus infection are difficult to diagnose as symptoms can be vague and molecular testing can be expensive or unavailable. Determining whether these patients should be hospitalized or not can be challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. Our study included data from 543 subjects with a diagnosis of suspected dengue, chikungunya, or Zika infection. Using a machine learning approach, we tested the ability of seven algorithms to predict hospitalization status based on the signs, symptoms, and laboratory data that would be available to a clinician at patient intake. Using only signs and symptoms, we were able to predict hospitalization with high accuracy (94%). Including laboratory data also resulted in highly accurate prediction of hospitalization (92%). This tool should be test in future studies with new subject data. Upon further development, we envision a simple mobile application to aid in the decision-making process for clinicians in areas with limited resources.",

The platform facilitates the development of image segmentation protocols with rigorous validation, and extraction of object-level data in an automated and stereological manner. Mouse dorsal root ganglion neurones were assessed to validate this platform, which revealed a profound loss and shift in neurone size, and loss of axonal input and synaptic terminations within the spinal dorsal horn following their injury. In conclusion, the StereoMate platform provides a general-purpose automated stereological analysis platform to generate rich and unbiased object-level datasets from immunofluorescent data.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a treatment for many types of cancer, primarily due to deep and durable clinical responses mediated by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)1, 2. Prostate cancer is a notable exception in that it is generally unresponsive to ICB. The standard treatment for advanced prostate cancer is androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), a form of castration (CTX). ADT is initially effective, but over time patients eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we focused on defining tumor-cell intrinsic factors that contribute to prostate cancer progression and resistance to immunotherapy. We analyzed cancer cells isolated from castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate tumors, and discovered that castration resulted in significant secretion of Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and its likely murine homolog Cxcl15. These chemokines drove subsequent intra-tumoral infiltration with polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), promoting tumor progression. PMN-MDSC infiltration was abrogated when IL-8 was deleted from prostate cancer epithelial cells using CRISPR/Cas9, or when PMN-MDSC migration was blocked with antibodies against the IL-8 receptor CXCR2. Blocking PMN-MDSC infiltration in combination with anti-CTLA-4 delayed the onset of castration resistance and increased the density of polyfunctional CD8 T cells in tumors. Taken together, our findings establish castration-mediated IL-8 secretion and subsequent PMN-MDSC infiltration as a key suppressive mechanism in the progression of prostate cancer. Targeting of the IL-8/CXCR2 axis around the time of ADT, in combination with ICB, represents a novel therapeutic approach to delay prostate cancer progression to advanced disease.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) often plays a critical role in cancer metastasis and chemoresistance, and decoding its dynamics is crucial to design effective therapeutics. EMT is regulated at multiple levels transcriptional, translational, protein stability, and epigenetics; the mechanisms by which epigenetic regulation can alter the dynamics of EMT remain elusive. Here, to identify the possible effects of epigenetic regulation in EMT, we incorporate a feedback term in our previously proposed model of EMT regulation of the miR 200/ZEB/miR 34/SNAIL circuit. This epigenetic feedback that stabilizes long-term transcriptional activity can alter the relative stability and distribution of states in a given cell population, particularly when incorporated in the inhibitory effect on miR 200 from ZEB. This feedback can stabilize the mesenchymal state, thus making transitions out of that state difficult. Conversely, epigenetic regulation of the self activation of ZEB has only minor effects. Our model predicts that this effect could be seen in experiments, when epithelial cells are treated with an external EMT inducing signal for a sufficiently long period of time and then allowed to recover. Our preliminary experimental data indeed shows that a prolonged TGF beta; exposure gives rise to increasing difficult reversion back to the epithelial state. Thus, this integrated theoretical experimental approach yields insights into how an epigenetic feedback may alter the dynamics of EMT.",

Multiciliated cells (also known as ciliated cells) are evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable epithelial cells, as suggested by the link between ciliated cell dysfunction and chronic human disease. Ciliated cell differentiation is an ordered process that involves initial cell fate determination and multiciliogenesis. STK11, a serine/threonine kinase, has been reported to be down-regulated in human diseases associated with ciliopathies and functions as a tumor suppressor. Here, we show that STK11 is a physiological factor for the normal program of ciliated cell differentiation by phosphorylating MARK3, which directly suppresses ERK1/2 mediated pRB inactivation. Loss of Stk11 in airway progenitors impairs the differentiation of ciliated cells in both embryonic and adult airways. Our study establishes that STK11/MARK3/ERK1/2 signaling cascade is a key regulator to integrate ciliated cell fate commitment and the subsequent process of multiciliogenesis.",

The purpose of this investigation was to assess to determine the effects of ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculation on Pinus paulta seedling growth and resistance to the fungal pathogen F. circiantum. Explants from ECM basidiocarps, collected from Pinus stands, were plated onto MMN medium to obtain isolates which were verified using molecular techniques. These isolates were identified as Boletus edulis f. reticulatus, Lactarius quieticolor, Suillus granulatus and an additional Suillus isolate. P. patula growth in the presence of the pathogen F. circinatum was significantly increased and promoted by the L. quieticolor and Suillus isolates. Inoculation of seedlings in the nursery would ensure the production of stronger healthy plants which may be more tolerant to fusarial infection, increasing survival in the plantation.",

The orange and black colors were analyzed quantitatively, which in combination with Functional Data Analysis and statistical analysis of Euclidean distances for color components, describe and test the color differences between genera. The data analyzed by means of Functional Data Analysis proved to be a better method to treat the reflectance data because it gave a better representation of the physical information. When comparing the differences between curves of the same color but different genera, maximum differences were present in different ranges of the spectra, depending on the genus. Reflectance spectra were separated into their spectral color components contributions (red, blue and green). Each component had its own dominant wavelength at the maximum of the spectrum. We found differences in the dominant wavelength for specimens of the same genus, which are equivalent to differences in the hue. A correlation between the mean values of characteristics of the color components was used in an attempt to group the genera that show similar values. The spectral blue components of the orange and black areas were almost identical, suggesting that there is a common compound for the pigments. The results also suggest that cuticle from different genera, but with the same color (black vs black, orange vs orange) might have a similar chemical composition.",

    "abstract": "Kinesins are well-known to power diverse long-range transport processes in virtually all eukaryotic cells. The ATP-dependent processive stepping as well as the regulation of kinesin activity have thus been focus of extensive studies over the past decades. It is widely accepted that kinesin motors can self-regulate their activity by suppressing the catalytic activity of the  heads. The distal random coil at the C-terminus, termed  tail domain, is proposed to mediate this autoinhibition, however, a direct regulatory influence of the tail on the processive stepping of kinesin proved difficult to capture. Here, we simultaneously tracked the two distinct head domains in the kinesin-2 motor using dual-color super resolution microscopy (dcFIONA) and reveal for the first time their individual properties during processive stepping. We show that the autoinhibitory wild type conformation selectively impacts one head in the heterodimer but not the other. Our results provide key insights into the regulated kinesin stepping that had escaped experimental scrutiny.",

Self-reported oral health was linked to electronic health records at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Participants under the age of 40, missing self-reported oral health and those who could not be identified in linked databases were excluded (N=5,183). A series of Cox Proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the risk of diabetes complications. Participants who did not experience any diabetes complication were censored at time of death or at the study termination date (March 31, 2016). Models were adjusted for age and sex, followed by social characteristics and behavioural factors.\\n\\nResultsDiabetes complications differed by self-reported oral health. For those reporting \\\"poor to fair\\\" oral health, the hazard of a diabetes complication was 30% greater (HR 1.29 95%CI 1.03, 1.61) than those reporting \\\"good to excellent\\\" oral health.\\n\\nConclusionsOur findings indicate that oral health status is associated with increased risk for complications among diabetics, after adjusting for a wide range of confounders.

Low level of knowledge and poor practice of breast cancer screening could be due to many factors. The aim of our study is to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of breast cancer screening of women attending primary care centers in Abu Dhabi region.\\n\\nMethodA cross sectional study was done in 2017 using questionnaire about breast cancer awareness measure. Six primary health care centers were included which were located inside and outside Abu Dhabi island. Three hundred eighty three women participated in the study, between the age of 40-65.\\n\\nResultsThe facilities to screen for breast cancer screening is available, but it is still underutilized by women. Even though we found in our study that women had high level of knowledge about breast cancer (45.7%), but their practice for mammogram was poor (52.2%). We also found that, the higher the education, employment and family history of breast cancer women had better knowledge, with statistically significant result respectively (P=0.000), (P=0.018), (P=0.013), and women older than 49 had better practice of mammogram (P=0.000). In our study, we concluded that women who attend clinic located inside island of Abu Dhabi had better knowledge and practice compared to women attending clinics located outside the island who had better attitude.\\n\\nConclusionIn our study we found that despite having the modalities and services for breast cancer screening, it is still underutilized. Our population sample showed that women had good knowledge about breast cancer but poor practice for mammogram. Educational level, age and region all played role in their knowledge, attitude and practice. As primary care providers we are a big influencers on the society and the first contact to them, we can utilize this to spread the awareness. We can approach the women through social media, more campaigns and offering free mammogram to women who cannot afford paying for it. Spreading the awareness about screening will reduce the burden of breast cancer treatment on the health care system government too.",

This most probably results from confounding by indication. Reaching clinical stability is associated with the decision to de-escalate and with survival.

The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We performed Cox proportional-hazards regression with de-escalation as time-dependent variable and adjusted for baseline characteristics using propensity scores. The potential impact of unmeasured confounding was quantified through simulating a variable representing clinical stability on day three, using data on prevalence and associations with mortality from the literature.\\n\\nResultsOf 1,536 included patients, 257 (16.7%) were de-escalated, 123 (8.0%) were escalated and in 1156 (75.3%) the antibiotic spectrum remained unchanged. The adjusted hazard ratio of de-escalation for 30-day mortality (compared to patients with unchanged coverage), without adjustment for clinical stability, was 0.36 (95%CI: 0.18-0.73). If 90% to 100% of de-escalated patients were clinically stable on day three, the fully adjusted hazard ratio would be 0.53 (95%CI: 0.26-1.08) to 0.90 (95%CI: 0.42-1.91), respectively. The simulated confounder was substantially stronger than any of the baseline confounders in our dataset.\\n\\nConclusionsWith plausible, literature-based assumptions, clinical stability is a very strong confounder for the effects of de-escalation. Quantification of effects of de-escalation on patient outcomes without proper adjustment for clinical stability results in strong negative bias. As a result, the safety of de-escalation remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Inflammasome-induced pyroptosis comprises a key cell-autonomous immune process against intracellular bacteria, namely the generation of dying cell structures. These so-called pore-induced intracellular traps (PITs) entrap and weaken intracellular microbes. However, the immune importance of pyroptosis against extracellular pathogens remains unclear. Here, we report that Type-3 secretion system (T3SS)-expressing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) escaped PIT immunity by inducing a NLRC4 inflammasome-dependent macrophage pyroptosis response in the extracellular environment. To the contrary, phagocytosis of Salmonella Typhimurium promoted NLRC4-dependent PIT formation and the subsequent bacterial caging. Remarkably, T3SS-deficient Pseudomonas were efficiently sequestered within PIT-dependent caging, which favored exposure to neutrophils. Conversely, both NLRC4 and caspase-11 deficient mice presented increased susceptibility to T3SS-deficient P. aeruginosa challenge, but not to T3SS-expressing P. aeruginosa. Overall, our results uncovered that P. aeruginosa uses its T3SS to overcome inflammasome-triggered pyroptosis, which is primarily effective against intracellular invaders.\\n\\nImportanceAlthough innate immune components confer host protection against infections, the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) exploits the inflammatory reaction to thrive. Specifically the NLRC4 inflammasome, a crucial immune complex, triggers an Interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and -18 deleterious host response to P. aeruginosa. Here, we provide evidence that, in addition to IL-1 cytokines, P. aeruginosa also exploits the NLRC4 inflammasome-induced pro-inflammatory cell death, namely pyroptosis, to avoid efficient uptake and killing by macrophages. Therefore, our study reveals that pyroptosis-driven immune effectiveness mainly depends on P. aeruginosa localization. This paves the way toward our comprehension of the mechanistic requirements for pyroptosis effectiveness upon microbial infections and may initiate targeted approaches in order to ameliorate the innate immune functions to infections.\\n\\nGraphical abstractMacrophages infected with T3SS-expressing P. aeruginosa die in a NLRC4-dependent manner, which allows bacterial escape from PIT-mediated cell-autonomous immunity and neutrophil efferocytosis. However, T3SS-deficient P. aeruginosa is detected by both NLRC4 and caspase-11 inflammasomes, which promotes bacterial trapping and subsequent efferocytosis of P. aeruginosa-containing-PITs by neutrophils.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=64 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/650333v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (15K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e05c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aca55forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d2853org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c275f9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The proportion and distribution of local inhibitory neurons (interneurons) in the thalamus varies widely across mammals. The ubiquitous presence of interneurons in the thalamus of primates contrasts with the extreme sparsity of interneurons reported in mice and other small-brained mammals. This is reflected in the structure and function of thalamic local circuits, which are more complex in primates compared to rodents. To what extent the broad range of interneuron densities observed in mammalian species reflect the appearance of novel interneuron types or the elaboration of a plesiomorphic ontogenetic program, remains unclear.\n\nHere, we identify a larger than expected complexity and distribution of interneurons across the mouse thalamus, where all thalamic interneurons can be traced back to two developmental programs: one specified in the midbrain and the other in the forebrain. Interneurons migrate to functionally distinct thalamocortical nuclei depending on their origin the abundant, midbrain-derived class populates the first and higher order sensory thalamus while the rarer, forebrain-generated class is restricted to some higher order associative regions. We also observe that markers for the midbrain-born class are abundantly expressed throughout the thalamus of the New World monkey marmoset. These data therefore reveal that, despite the broad variability in interneuron density across mammalian species, the blueprint of the ontogenetic organization of thalamic interneurons of larger-brained mammals exists and can be studied in mice.",

    "abstract": "The biomass equation is a critical component in genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs): it is used as the de facto objective function in flux balance analysis (FBA). This equation accounts for the quantities of all known biomass precursors that are required for cell growth based on the macromolecular and monomer compositions measured at certain conditions. However, it is often reported that the macromolecular composition of cells could change across different environmental conditions; the use of the same single biomass equation in FBA, under multiple conditions, is questionable. Thus, we first investigated the qualitative and quantitative variations of macromolecular compositions of three representative host organisms, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cricetulus griseus, across different environmental/genetic variations. While macromolecular building blocks such as DNA, RNA, protein, and lipid composition vary notably, variations in fundamental biomass monomer units such as nucleotides and amino acids are not appreciable. We further observed that while macromolecular compositions are similar across taxonomically closer species, certain monomers, especially fatty acids, vary substantially. Based on the analysis results, we subsequently propose a new extension to FBA, named \"Flux Balance Analysis with Ensemble Biomass (FBAwEB)\", to embrace the natural variation in selected components of the biomass equation. The current study clearly highlights that certain components of the biomass equation are very sensitive to different conditions, and the ensemble representation of biomass equation in the FBA framework enables us to account for such natural variations accurately during GEM-guided in silico simulations.",

In this study, we investigated the drug transport from a blood vessel to tumor tissue, and explored the effect of tumor size, tumor numbers and positioning on drug concentration distribution using a numerical method in combination with a microfluidic Tumor-Vasculature-on-a-Chip (TVOC) model. The TVOC model is composed of a vessel channel, a tumor channel sandwiched with a porous membrane. A species transport model based on computational fluid dynamics was adapted to investigate drug transport. The numerical simulation was firstly validated using experimental data, and then used to analyse the spatial-temporal structure of the flow, and to investigate the effect of tumor size and positioning on drug transport and drug concentration heterogeneity. We found the drug concentration surrounding the tumor is highly heterogeneous, with the most downstream point the most difficult for drugs to transport and the nearest point to the blood vessel the easiest. Moreover, tumor size and positioning contribute significantly to this drug concentration heterogeneity on tumor surface, which is dramatically augmented in large and downstream-positioned tumors. These studies established the relationship between solid tumor size/positioning and drug concentration heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment, which could help to understand heterogenous drug distribution in tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "While environmentally inducible epigenetic marks are discussed as one mechanism of transgenerational plasticity, environmentally stable epigenetic marks emerge randomly. When resulting in variable phenotypes, stable marks can be targets of natural selection analogous to DNA sequence-based adaptation processes. We studied both postulated pathways in natural populations of three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and sequenced their methylomes and genomes across a salinity cline. Consistent with local adaptation, populations showed differential methylation (pop-DMS) at genes enriched for osmoregulatory processes. In a two-generation experiment, 62% of these pop-DMS were insensitive to salinity manipulation, suggesting that they could be stable targets for natural selection. Two-thirds of the remaining inducible pop-DMS became more similar to patterns detected in wild populations from the corresponding salinity, and this pattern accentuated over consecutive generations, indicating a mechanism of adaptive transgenerational plasticity. Natural DNA methylation patterns can thus be attributed to two epigenetic pathways underlying the rapid emergence of adaptive phenotypes in the face of environmental change.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA major goal of phylogenetic systematics is to understand both the patterns of diversification and the processes by which these patterns are formed. Few studies have focused on the ancient, species-rich Magnoliales clade and its diversification pattern. Within Magnoliales, the pantropically distributed Annonaceae are by far the most genus-rich and species-rich family-level clade, with c. 110 genera and c. 2,400 species. We investigated the diversification patterns across Annonaceae and identified traits that show varied associations with diversification rates using a time-calibrated phylogeny of 835 species (34.6% sampling) and 11,211 aligned bases from eight regions of the plastid genome (rbcL, matK, ndhF, psbA-trnH, trnL-F, atpB-rbcL, trnS-G, and ycf1). Two hypotheses that might explain patterns of diversification--the  museum model and heterogeneous diversification rates--are also evaluated.\\n\\nResultsTwelve rate shifts were identified using BAMM: in Annona, Artabotrys, Asimina, Drepananthus, Duguetia, Goniothalamus, Guatteria, Uvaria, Xylopia, the tribes Miliuseae and Malmeeae, and the Desmos-Dasymaschalon-Friesodielsia-Monanthotaxis clade (which collectively account for over 80% of the total species richness in the family). TurboMEDUSA and method-of-moments estimator analyses showed largely congruent results. A positive relationship between species richness and diversification rate is revealed using PGLS. We further explore the possible role of selected traits (habit, pollinator trapping, floral sex expression, pollen dispersal unit, anther septation, and seed dispersal unit) in shaping diversification patterns, based on inferences of BiSSE, MuSSE, HiSSE, and FiSSE analyses. Our results suggest that the liana habit, the presence of circadian pollinator trapping, androdioecy, and the dispersal of seeds as single-seeded monocarp fragments are closely correlated with higher diversification rates; pollen aggregation and anther septation, in contrast, are associated with lower diversification rates.\\n\\nConclusionOur results show that the high species richness in Annonaceae is likely the result of recent increased diversification rather than the steady accumulation of species via the  museum model. BAMM, turboMEDUSA, and the method-of-moments estimator all indicate heterogeneity in diversification rates across the phylogeny, with different traits associated with shifts in diversification rates in different Annonaceae clades.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudying multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) synergism in gene regulation could help to understand the regulatory mechanisms of complicated human diseases caused by miRNAs. Several existing methods have been presented to infer miRNA synergism. Most of the current methods assume that miRNAs with shared targets at the sequence level are working synergistically. However, it is unclear if miRNAs with shared targets are working in concert to regulate the targets or they individually regulate the targets at different time points or different biological processes. A standard method to test the synergistic activities is to knock-down multiple miRNAs at the same time and measure the changes in the target genes. However, this approach may not be practical as we would have too many sets of miRNAs to test.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper, we present a novel framework called miRsyn for inferring miRNA synergism by using a causal inference method that mimics the multiple-intervention experiments, e.g. knocking-down multiple miRNAs, with observational data. Our results show that several miRNA-miRNA pairs that have shared targets at the sequence level are not working synergistically at the expression level. Moreover, the identified miRNA synergistic network is small-world and biologically meaningful, and a number of miRNA synergistic modules are significantly enriched in breast cancer. Our further analyses also reveal that most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs show the same expression patterns. The comparison results indicate that the proposed multiple-intervention causal inference method performs better than the single-intervention causal inference method in identifying miRNA synergistic network.\\n\\nConclusionsTaken together, the results imply that miRsyn is a promising framework for identifying miRNA synergism, and it could enhance the understanding of miRNA synergism in breast cancer.",

Surprisingly, P-TEFb exhibits Ser5 phosphorylation activity in vitro. The mechanism garnering Ser2 specificity to P-TEFb remains elusive and hinders understanding of the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. Through in vitro reconstruction of CTD phosphorylation, mass spectrometry analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis we uncover a mechanism by which Tyr1 phosphorylation directs the kinase activity of P-TEFb and alters its specificity from Ser5 to Ser2. The loss of Tyr1 phosphorylation causes a reduction of phosphorylated Ser2 and accumulation of RNA polymerase II in the promoter region as detected by ChIP-seq. We demonstrate the ability of Tyr1 phosphorylation to generate a heterogeneous CTD modification landscape that expands the CTDs coding potential. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a combinatorial CTD phosphorylation code wherein previously installed modifications direct the identity and abundance of subsequent coding events by influencing the behavior of downstream enzymes.",

On continents, the majority of these exceptions have been described from tropical montane areas in Africa, where geographically-restricted bird species are unusually abundant. We asked how the local abundances of passerine and non-passerine bird species along an elevational gradient on Mt. Wilhelm, Papua New Guinea relate to their geographical range size. We collected data on bird assemblages at eight elevations (200 - 3,700 m, at 500 m elevational increments). We used a standardized point-counts at 16 points at each elevational study site. We partitioned the birds into feeding guilds, and we obtained data on geographical range sizes from Bird-Life International data zone. We observed a positive relationship between abundance and geographical range size in the lowlands. This trend changed to a negative one towards higher elevations. The total abundances of the assemblage showed a hump-shaped pattern along the elevational gradient, with passerine birds, namely passerine insectivores, driving the observed pattern. In contrast to abundances, the mean biomass of the bird assemblages decreased with increasing elevation. Our results show that montane bird species maintain dense populations which compensate for the decreased available area near the top of the mountain.",

We propose a scalable, automatable framework to evaluate digital resources that encompasses measurable indicators, open source tools, and participation guidelines, which come together to accommodate domain relevant community-defined FAIR assessments. The components of the framework are: (1) Maturity Indicators - community-authored specifications that delimit a specific automatically-measurable FAIR behavior; (2) Compliance Tests - small Web apps that test digital resources against individual Maturity Indicators; and (3) the Evaluator, a Web application that registers, assembles, and applies community-relevant sets of Compliance Tests against a digital resource, and provides a detailed report about what a machine \\\"sees\\\" when it visits that resource. We discuss the technical and social considerations of FAIR assessments, and how this translates to our community-driven infrastructure. We then illustrate how the output of the Evaluator tool can serve as a roadmap to assist data stewards to incrementally and realistically improve the FAIRness of their resources.",

    "abstract": "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is widely used to diagnose diabetes and assess glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, nonglycemic determinants, including genetic variation, may influence how accurately HbA1c reflects underlying glycemia. Analyzing the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) sequence data in 10,338 individuals from five studies and four ancestries (6,158 Europeans, 3,123 African-Americans, 650 Hispanics and 407 East Asians), we confirmed five regions associated with HbA1c (GCK in Europeans and African-Americans, HK1 in Europeans and Hispanics, FN3K/FN3KRP in Europeans and G6PD in African-Americans and Hispanics) and discovered a new African-ancestry specific low-frequency variant (rs1039215 in HBG2/HBE1, minor allele frequency (MAF)=0.03). The most associated G6PD variant (p.Val98Met, rs1050828-T, MAF=12% in African-Americans, MAF=2% in Hispanics) lowered HbA1c (-0.88% in hemizygous males, -0.34% in heterozygous females) and explained 23% of HbA1c variance in African-Americans and 4% in Hispanics. Additionally, we identified a rare distinct G6PD coding variant (rs76723693 - p.Leu353Pro, MAF=0.5%; -0.98% in hemizygous males, -0.46% in heterozygous females) and detected significant association with HbA1c when aggregating rare missense variants in G6PD. We observed similar magnitude and direction of effects for rs1039215 (HBG2) and rs76723693 (G6PD) in the two largest TOPMed African-American cohorts and replicated the rs76723693 association in the UK Biobank African-ancestry participants. These variants in G6PD and HBG2 were monomorphic in the European and Asian samples. African or Hispanic ancestry individuals carrying G6PD variants may be underdiagnosed for diabetes when screened with HbA1c. Thus, assessment of these variants should be considered for incorporation into precision medicine approaches for diabetes diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Tumors of Lynch syndrome (LS) patients display high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI), which results from complete loss of DNA mismatch repair (MMR), in line with Knudson\u2019s two-hit hypothesis. Why some organs, in particular those of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, are especially prone to tumorigenesis in LS remains unknown. We hypothesized that MMR is haploinsufficient in certain tissues, compromising microsatellite stability in a tissue-specific manner before tumorigenesis. Using mouse genetics, we tested how levels of MLH1, a central MMR protein, affect microsatellite stability in vivo and whether elevated MSI is detectable prior to loss of MMR function and to neoplastic growth. We assayed MSI by sensitive single-molecule PCR in normal jejunum and spleen of 4- and 12-month old Mlh1+/+, Mlh1+/\u2212 and Mlh1\u2212/\u2212 mice, accompanied by measurements of Mlh1 mRNA and MLH1 protein expression levels.While spleen MLH1 levels of Mlh1+/\u2212 mice were, as expected, approximately 50% compared to wildtype mice, MLH1 levels in jejunum varied substantially between individual Mlh1+/\u2212 mice and decreased with age. Apparently, Mlh1+/\u2212 mice with soma-wide Mlh1 promoter methylation were the most venerable to MLH1 expression level decrease in jejunum. MLH1 levels (prior to complete loss of the protein) inversely correlated with MSI severity in Mlh1+/\u2212 jejunum, while in spleens of the same mice, MLH1 levels and microsatellites remained stable. Thus, Mlh1 haploinsufficiency affects specifically the intestine where MMR levels are particularly labile, inducing MSI in normal cells long before neoplasia. A similar mechanism likely also operates in the human GI epithelium, and could explain the wide range in age of onset of LS-associated tumorigenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals drawbacks in current sample preparation protocols, such as sample waste and lack of reproducibility. Here, we present several technical developments that provide controlled and efficient sample preparation for cryo-EM studies. Pin printing substantially reduces sample waste by depositing only a sub-nanoliter volume of sample on the carrier surface. Sample evaporation is mitigated by dewpoint control feedback loops. The deposited sample is vitrified by jets of cryogen followed by submersion into a cryogen bath. Because the cryogen jets cool the sample from the center, premounted autogrids can be used and loaded directly into automated cryo-EMs. We integrated these steps into a single device, named VitroJet. The devices performance was validated by resolving 4 standard proteins (apoferritin, GroEL, worm hemoglobin, beta-galactosidase) to ~3 [A] resolution using a 200-kV electron microscope. The VitroJet offers a promising solution for improved automated sample preparation in cryo-EM studies.",

    "abstract": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that regulates axonal transport, stabilizes and spatially organizes microtubules in parallel networks. The Tau-microtubule pair is crucial for maintaining the architecture and integrity of axons. Therefore, it is essential to understand how these two entities interact to ensure and modulate the normal axonal functions. Based on evidence from several published experiments, we have developed a two-dimensional model that describes the interaction between a population of Tau proteins and a stabilized microtubule at the scale of the tubulin dimers (binding sites) as an adsorption-desorption dynamical process in which Tau can bind on the microtubule outer surface via two distinct modes: a longitudinal (along a protofilament) and lateral (across adjacent protofilaments) modes. Such a process yields a dynamical distribution of Tau molecules on the microtubule surface referred to as microtubule decoration that we have characterized at the equilibrium using two observables: the total microtubule coverage (density of the Taus on the microtubule surface) and the nearest neighbor distribution of Tau. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we have derived expressions and computed these observables as a function of key parameters controlling the binding reaction: the stoichiometries of the Taus in the two binding modes, the binding equilibrium constants and the ratio of the Tau concentration to that of microtubule tubulin dimers.",

    "abstract": "Proteins involved in peptide uptake and transport belong to the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter (POT) family. Crystal structures of POT family members reveal a common fold consisting of two domains of six transmembrane  helices that come together to form a \\\"V\\\" shaped transporter with a central substrate binding site. Proton coupled oligopeptide transporters operate through an alternate access mechanism, where the membrane transporter undergoes global conformational changes, alternating between inward-facing (IF), outward-facing (OF) and occluded (OC) states. Conformational transitions are promoted by proton and ligand binding, however, due to the absence of crystallographic models of the outward-open state, the role of H+ and ligands are still not fully understood. To provide a comprehensive picture of the POT conformational equilibrium, conventional and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of PepTst in the presence or absence of ligand and protonation were performed. Free energy profiles of the conformational variability of PepTst were obtained from microseconds of adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations. Our results reveal that both, proton and ligand, significantly change the conformational free energy landscape. In the absence of ligand and protonation, only transitions involving IF and OC states are allowed. After protonation of the residue Glu300, the wider free energy well for Glu300 protonated PepTst indicates a greater conformational variability relative to the apo system, and OF conformations becames accessible. For the Glu300 Holo-PepTst, the presence of a second free energy minimum suggests that OF conformations are not only accessible, but also, stable. The differences in the free energy profiles demonstrate that transitions toward outward facing conformation occur only after protonation and, probably, this should be the first step in the mechanism of peptide transport. Our extensive ABF simulations provide a fully atomic description of all states of the transport process, offering a model for the alternating access mechanism and how protonation and ligand control the conformational changes.\\n\\nGraphical TOC Entry\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/651646v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (21K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8c8a84org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@da15bborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c8dab0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d87e3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Mediator is a multi-protein complex composed of subunits called head, body, tail, and CDK that is conserved from yeast to humans and plays a central role in transcription. However, not all the components are required for basal transcription. Components of the tail are not essential but to varying degrees are required for growth in different stresses. While some stresses are familiar such as heat, desiccation, and starvation, others are exotic, yet yeast can elicit a successful stress response. MCHM is a hydrotrope that induces growth arrest in yeast. By exploiting genetic variation, specifically in Med15, between yeast strains, we found that a naturally occurring Med15 allele with polyQ (polyglutamine) expansion conferred MCHM sensitivity. Expansion in polyQ repeat can induce protein aggregation and in humans can cause neurodegenerative diseases. In yeast, the MCHM sensitivity was not from a loss of function as the reciprocal hemizygous hybrids were all sensitive and the homozygous null mutant was less sensitive than the hemizygous hybrids. This suggests that there is an incompatibility between Mediator components from genetic divergent yeast strains. Transcriptomics from yeast expressing the incompatible Med15 (longer polyQ repeats in the strain with fewer repeats) changed gene expression in diverse pathways. Med15 protein existed in multiple isoforms, mostly from likely post-translational modifications and different alleles have different patterns of isoforms. Stability of both alleles of Med15 was dependent on Ydj1, a J-type chaperone. The protein level of the incompatible Med15 allele was lower than the compatible allele and was turned over faster. Med15 is tethered to the rest of the Mediator complex via Med2 and 3. Deletion of either Med2 or Med3 changed the Med15 isoform patterns in a similar manner. Whereas deletion of Med5, a distal component of the Mediator tail, did not change the pattern. The med2 and med3 mutants were similarly sensitive to MCHM while med5 mutants were not. Differences in the phenotype of yeast carrying different Med15 alleles extend to other stresses. The incompatible allele of Med15 improved growth of yeast to chemicals that produce free radicals and the compatible allele of Med15 improved growth to reducing agents, caffeine, and hydroxyurea. Med15 directly interacts with Gcn4 and other TFs and in vitro form phase-separated droplets. This variation may reflect the positive and negative role that Med15 has in transcription. Genetic variation in transcriptional regulators can magnify differences in response to environmental changes, in contrast, genetic variation in a metabolic enzyme. These polymorphic control genes are master variators.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 70% of all breast cancers are estrogen receptor positive (ER+BC) and endocrine therapy has improved survival for patients with ER+BC. Yet, up to half of these tumors recur within 20 years. Recurrent ER+BCs develop resistance to endocrine therapy; thus, novel targets are needed to treat recurrent ER+BC. We found that semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A) confers significantly decreased patient survival rates in ER+BC. We show that SEMA7A is hormonally regulated in ER+BC, but its expression does not uniformly decrease with anti-estrogen treatments. Additionally, overexpression of SEMA7A in ER+ cell lines drives increased in vitro growth in the presence of estrogen-deprivation, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant. In in vivo studies, we found that SEMA7A confers primary tumor resistance to fulvestrant and, importantly, induced lung metastases. Finally, we identify pro-survival signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability of ER+SEMA7A+ tumors and propose that targeting with inhibitors of survival signaling such as venetoclax may have efficacy for treating SEMA7A+ tumors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe report that SEMA7A predicts for, and likely contributes to, poor response to standard-of-care therapies and suggest that patients with SEMA7A+ER+ tumors may benefit from alternative therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication stress stalls replication forks leading to chromosome breakage and Intra-S checkpoint activation. In S. cerevisiae, this checkpoint arrests the cell cycle by stabilizing securin (Pds1) and inhibiting the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) through multiple pathways. Pds1 inhibits separase (Esp1) which cleaves the cohesin subunit Scc1 and also functions in spindle elongation. However, the role of Pds1-Esp1 in spindle elongation during replication stress response is unknown. Here, we show that Pds1 phosphorylation plays a positive role in spindle elongation through the Pds1-Esp1 interaction in unperturbed and replication stress conditions. PP2ACdc55 directly dephosphorylates Pds1 both in vivo and in vitro. Pds1 hyperphosphorylation in a cdc55{Delta} mutant enhanced the Pds1-Esp1 interaction, which accelerated spindle elongation. This PP2ACdc55-dependent Pds1 dephosphorylation plays a role during replication stress and acts independently of the known Mec1, Swe1 or Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) checkpoint pathways. We propose a model where PP2ACdc55 dephosphorylates Pds1 to disrupt the Pds1-Esp1 interaction that inhibits spindle elongation during replication stress.",

While puberty onset marks the initiation of adolescence, it is unclear whether the pubertal rise in gonadal hormones generates sex differences in approach-avoidance behaviors that may impact psychiatric vulnerability. To examine the influence of peripubertal gonadal hormone exposure on adult behavior, we removed the gonads or performed sham surgery in male and female mice just prior to puberty onset and assessed performance in an odor-guided foraging task and anxiety-related behaviors in adulthood. We observed no significant sex differences in foraging or anxiety-related behaviors between intact adult male and female mice but found significant differences between adult male and female mice that had been gonadectomized (GDX) prior to puberty. GDX males failed to acquire the odor-guided foraging task, showed reduced locomotion, and exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, while GDX females showed the opposite pattern of behavior. These data suggest that similar approach-avoidance phenotypes are achieved in male and female mice via different mechanisms mediated by the sex-specific hormonal milieus during pubertal maturation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVitamin D inadequacy affects almost 50% of adults in the United States and is associated with numerous adverse health effects. Vitamin D concentration [25(OH)D] is a complex trait with genetic and environmental predictors that work in tandem to influence 25(OH)D and may determine how much vitamin D intake is required to reach an optimal 25(OH)D concentration. To date, there has been little investigation into how genetics and environment interact to affect 25(OH)D.\\n\\nObjectiveInteractions between continuous measures of a polygenic score (PGS) and vitamin D intake (PGS*intake) or available ultra-violet (UV) radiation (PGS*UV) were evaluated separately in individuals of African or European ancestry.\\n\\nMethodsMega-analyses were performed using three independent cohorts (N=9,668; African ancestry n=1,099; European ancestry n=8,569). Interaction terms and joint effects (main and interaction terms) were tested using one-degree of freedom (DF) and 2-DF models, respectively. All models controlled for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), cohort, and dietary intake/available UV. Additionally, in participants achieving Institute of Medicine (IOM) vitamin D intake recommendations, 25(OH)D was evaluated by level of genetic risk of 25(OH)D deficiency.\\n\\nResultsThe 2-DF PGS*intake, 1-DF PGS*UV and 2-DF PGS*UV results were statistically significant in participants of European ancestry (p=3.3x10-18, 2.1x10-2, and 2.4x10-19, respectively), but not in those of African ancestry. In European-ancestry participants who reached IOM vitamin D intake guidelines, the percent of participants achieving adequate 25(OH)D (>20ng/ml) increased as genetic risk decreased (72% vs 89% in the highest vs lowest risk categories; p=0.018).\\n\\nConclusionsAvailable UV radiation and vitamin D intake interact with genetics to influence 25(OH)D. Individuals with higher genetic risk of deficiency may require more vitamin D exposure to maintain optimal 25(OH)D concentrations.

    "abstract": "Heme is an essential cofactor for many enzymes, but free heme is toxic and its levels are tightly regulated. G-quadruplexes bind heme avidly in vitro, raising the possibility that they may sequester heme in vivo. If so, then treatment that displaces heme from quadruplexes is predicted to induce expression of genes involved in iron and heme homeostasis. Here we show that PhenDC3, a G-quadruplex ligand structurally unrelated to heme, displaces quadruplex-bound heme in vitro and alters transcription in cultured human cells, up-regulating genes that support heme degradation and iron homeostasis, and most strikingly causing a 30-fold induction of heme oxidase 1, the key enzyme in heme degradation. We propose that G-quadruplexes sequester heme to protect cells from the pathophysiological consequences of free heme. This identifies a new function for G-quadruplexes and a new mechanism for protection of cells from heme.",

    "abstract": "A common human experience is noticing that emotional life events are more vividly remembered than dull ones. Studies show that the amygdala plays a central role in such emotionally driven enhancement of memory. With this in mind, we investigated the effect of electrical brain stimulation of the left human amygdala on performance on an emotional perception and emotional memory task. We randomly applied sub-threshold 50 Hz stimulation to the left amygdala in 10 patients (5 female and 5 male) with intracranial electrodes during the encoding portion of an emotional valence perception and emotional memory task. We found that amygdala stimulation did not affect reported valence for neutral stimuli (non-stimulated group average valence 5.34, stimulated 5.38, p=0.68) but it did affect positively (non-stimulated group average valence 7.31, stimulated 6.70, p=0.004) and negatively (non-stimulated group average valence 2.79, stimulated 3.55, p=0.0002) valenced stimuli in effect reporting both valence categories as more neutral. Furthermore, we found that stimulation did not significantly disrupt memory for neutral stimuli (68% vs. 61% correctly remembered p=0.48) or positive stimuli (87% vs. 70% correct, trend towards significant difference p=0.09) but did for negative stimuli (83% vs. 67% correct, p=0.03). These results suggest that electrical brain stimulation by our parameters likely reversibly inhibits amygdala function disrupting neural networks responsible for emotional perception and memory. This effect may have clinical implications in treatment of certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as emotional dysregulation and post-traumatic stress disorder.\\n\\nStatement of significanceThe current study builds and expands on extensive prior research into the function of the human amygdala. It provides the first systematic description in humans of a cognitive change brought about by direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala on perception of emotional valence and emotional memory. The results provide further evidence on the importance of the amygdala in human cognition. Likewise, out method utilized to study the function of the amygdala can be extended to study the function of other brain regions in humans, such as the cingulate. While these results are preliminary and need to be duplicated, we aim to further study the effects of amygdala stimulation on emotional processing including possible therapeutic application for diverse group of neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImmobilization of skeletal muscle in a stretched position is associated with marked protection against disuse atrophy. Some intramyocellular changes in known proteins and post-translational modifications were previously linked to this phenomenon but there are likely many presently unknown proteins and post-translational modifications that contribute to this beneficial effect.\\n\\nMethodsTo identify novel proteins and phosphorylation events involved in stretch-induced reduction of disuse atrophy, we conducted a global unbiased screen of the changes occurring in skeletal muscle in control vs. 1 day and 1 week stretched cast-immobilized mouse tibialis anterior muscle, using quantitative tandem mass spectrometry on HILIC-fractionated muscle peptides with follow-up studies in transgenic mice and humans.\\n\\nResultsOur mass spectrometry analyses detected 11714 phosphopeptides and 2081 proteins, of which 53 phosphopeptides and 5 proteins, 125 phosphopeptides and 43 proteins were deregulated after 1D and 7D of stretched immobilization, respectively. The sarcomere and muscle tendinous junction-associated putative multi-adaptor protein Xin was among the most highly upregulated proteins both in terms of phosphorylation and protein expression and was confirmed to increase with stretch but not disuse atrophy in mice and to increase and decrease with exercise and cast immobilization, respectively, in humans. Xin-/- mice were partially protected against disuse but not denervation atrophy in both stretched and flexed immobilized muscles compared to WT.\\n\\nConclusionThis study identified Xin as a novel protein involved in disuse atrophy and also provides a resource to guide future hypothesis-driven investigations into uncovering critical factors in the protection against disuse atrophy.",

    "abstract": "The Transatlantic Slave Trade transported more than 9 million Africans to the Americas between the early 16th and the mid-19th centuries. We performed genome-wide analysis of 6,267 individuals from 22 populations and observed an enrichment in West-African ancestry in northern latitudes of the Americas, whereas South/East African ancestry is more prevalent in southern South-America. This pattern results from distinct geographic and geopolitical factors leading to population differentiation. However, we observed a decrease of 68% in the African gene pool between-population diversity within the Americas when compared to the regions of origin from Africa, underscoring the importance of historical factors favoring admixture between individuals with different African origins in the New World. This is consistent with the excess of West-Central Africa ancestry (the most prevalent in the Americas) in the US and Southeast-Brazil, respect to historical-demography expectations. Also, in most of the Americas, admixture intensification occurred between 1,750 and 1,850, which correlates strongly with the peak of arrivals from Africa. This study contributes with a population genetics perspective to the ongoing social, cultural and political debate regarding ancestry, race, and admixture in the Americas.\\n\\nSignificance StatementDifferently from most genetic studies, that have estimated the overall African ancestry in the Americas, we perform a finer geographic analysis and infer how different African groups contributed to North-, South-American and Caribbean populations, in the context of geographic and geopolitical factors. We also perform a formal comparison of information from demographic history records of the Transatlantic Slave Trade with inferences based on genomic diversity of current populations. Our approach reveals the distinct regional African ancestry roots of different populations from North-, South-America and the Caribe and other important aspects of the historical process of mestizaje and its dynamics in the American continent.",
