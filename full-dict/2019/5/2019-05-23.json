    "abstract": "The precise expression of genes is one of the foundations of biotechnology. Here we present GeneEE, a straightforward method for generating artificial gene expression systems. We demonstrate that GeneEE segments, containing a 200 nucleotide DNA with random nucleotide composition, can facilitate constitutive and inducible gene expression. To highlight the universal character of our method, we demonstrate GeneEE-mediated gene and protein expression in six bacterial species and Bakers yeast.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe gut microbiota is closely associated with colorectal neoplasia. While most metagenomics studies utilized fecal samples, circulating microbial DNA in colorectal neoplasia patients remained unexplored. This study aimed to characterize microbial DNA in plasma samples and build a machine learning model for colorectal neoplasia early detection.\\n\\nDesignWe performed whole genome sequencing of plasma samples from 25 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, 10 colorectal adenoma (CRA) patients and 22 healthy controls (HC). Microbial DNA was obtained by removing the host genome and relative abundance was measured by mapping reads into microbial genomes. Significant biomarker species were identified in the discovery cohort and built into a random forest model, which was tested in the validation cohort.\\n\\nResultsIn the discovery cohort, there were 127 significant species between CRC patients and HC. Based on the random forest model, 28 species were selected from the discovery cohort (AUC=0.944) and yielded an AUC of 1 in the validation cohort. Interestingly, relative abundance of most biomarker species in CRA patients were between CRC patients and HC with a trend towards CRC patients. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis also showed similar pattern where CRA patients had intermediate relative abundance of significant pathways compared to CRC patients and HC. Finally, species network analysis revealed that CRC and HC displayed distinct patterns of species association.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrated characteristic alteration of circulating bacterial DNA in colorectal neoplasia patients. The predictive model accurately distinguished CRC and CRA from HC, suggesting the utility of circulating bacterial biomarkers as a non-invasive tool for colorectal neoplasia screening and early diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSince several studies have been reporting an increase in the decline of forests, a major issue in ecology is to better understand and predict tree mortality. The interactions between the different factors and the physiological processes giving rise tree mortality, as well as the inter-individual variability in mortality risk, still need to be better assessed.\n\nThis study investigates mortality in a rear-edge population of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) using a combination of statistical and process-based modelling approaches. Based on a survey of 4323 adult beeches since 2002 within a natural reserve, we first used statistical models to quantify the effects of competition, tree growth, size, defoliation and fungi presence on mortality. Secondly, we used an ecophysiological process-based model (PBM) to separate out the different mechanisms giving rise to temporal and inter-individual variations in mortality by simulating depletion of carbon stocks, loss of hydraulic conductance and damage due to late frosts in response to climate.\n\nThe combination of all these simulated processes was associated with the temporal variations in the population mortality rate. The individual probability of mortality decreased with increasing mean growth, and increased with increasing crown defoliation, earliness of budburst, fungi presence and increasing competition, in the statistical model. Moreover, the interaction between tree size and defoliation was significant, indicating a stronger increase in mortality associated to defoliation in smaller than larger trees. Finally, the PBM predicted a higher conductance loss together with a higher level of carbon reserves for trees with earlier budburst, while the ability to defoliate the crown was found to limit the impact of hydraulic stress at the expense of the accumulation of carbon reserves.\n\nWe discuss the convergences and divergences obtained between statistical and process-based approaches and we highlight the importance of combining them to characterize the different processes underlying mortality, and the factors modulating individual vulnerability to mortality.",

    "abstract": "Current clinical tests for prostate cancer (PCa), such as the PSA test, are not fully capable of discerning patients that are highly likely to develop metastatic prostate cancer (MPCa). Hence, more accurate prediction tools are needed to provide treatment strategies that are focused on the different risk groups. Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are expressed during embryonic development and present aberrant expression in cancer making them ideal tumor specific biomarkers. Here, the potential use of a panel of CTAs as a biomarker for PCa detection as well as metastasis prediction is explored. We initially identified eight CTAs (CEP55, NUF2, PAGE4, PBK, RQCD1, SPAG4, SSX2 and TTK) that are differentially expressed in MPCa when compared to local disease and used this panel to compare the gene and protein expression profiles in paired PCa and normal adjacent prostate tissue. We identified differential expression of all eight CTAs at the protein level when comparing 80 paired samples of PCa and the adjacent non-cancer tissue. Using multiple logistic regression we also show that a panel of these CTAs present high accuracy to discriminate normal from tumor samples. In summary, this study provides evidence that a panel of CTAs, differentially expressed in aggressive PCa, is a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis to be used in combination with the current clinically available tools and is also a potential target for immunotherapy development.",
