    "abstract": "Long-term stable expression of transgenes in mammalian cells is a challenge in gene therapy, recombinant protein production, and mammalian synthetic biology due to epigenetic silencing and position effect variegation. While multiple classes of regulatory elements have been discovered and proposed to help stabilize expression, the most efficacious has been the Ubiquitous Chromatin Opening Element (UCOE), and in particular, the prototypical A2UCOE from the HNRPA2B1-CBX3 locus. We developed a feature-driven bioinformatics algorithm to discover other putative UCOEs from the human genome, and identified a novel UCOE (SRF-UCOE) that can resist transgene silencing in the methylation-prone P19 cell line. We demonstrate that a 767 bp core sequence of SRF-UCOE is modular to four common mammalian promoters. Notably, SRF-UCOE stabilizes gene expression in transduced P19 cells up to 2.4-fold better over 26 days than the existing A2UCOE by resisting constructs susceptibility to DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. Unlike existing UCOEs, SRF-UCOE lacks inherent transcriptional initiation activity, which can bolster its safe and predictable use in gene therapy constructs. We expect that expanding the set of UCOEs available will expand their utility to novel applications in gene therapy, synthetic biology, and biomanufacturing, as well as contribute to understanding their molecular mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression variability in mammalian systems plays an important role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This variability can come from differential regulation related to cell state (extrinsic) and allele-specific transcriptional bursting (intrinsic). Yet, the relative contribution of these two distinct sources is unknown. Here we exploit the qualitative difference in the patterns of covariance between these two sources to quantify their relative contributions to expression variance in mammalian cells. Using multiplexed error robust RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (MERFISH) we measured the multivariate gene expression distribution of 150 genes related to Ca2+ signaling coupled with the dynamic Ca2+ response of live cells to ATP. We show that after controlling for cellular phenotypic states such as size, cell cycle stage, and Ca2+ response to ATP, the remaining variability is effectively at the Poisson limit for most genes. These findings demonstrate that the majority of expression variability results from cell state differences and that the contribution of transcriptional bursting is relatively minimal.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and protein function is a long-standing problem in molecular biology with far-reaching scientific implications. Despite six decades of progress, state-of-the-art techniques cannot annotate 1/3 of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit sequences collected from diverse organisms. In this paper, we explore an alternative methodology based on deep learning that learns the relationship between unaligned amino acid sequences and their functional annotations across all 17929 families of the Pfam database. Using the Pfam seed sequences we establish rigorous benchmark assessments that use both random and clustered data splits to control for potentially confounding sequence similarities between train and test sequences. Using Pfam full, we report convolutional networks that are significantly more accurate and computationally efficient than BLASTp, while learning sequence features such as structural disorder and transmembrane helices. Our model co-locates sequences from unseen families in embedding space, allowing sequences from novel families to be accurately annotated. These results suggest deep learning models will be a core component of future protein function prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Increasing Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to ceftriaxone, the last antibiotic recommended for empiric gonorrhea treatment, poses an urgent public health threat. However, the genetic basis of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone is not completely understood: while most ceftriaxone resistance in clinical isolates is caused by target site mutations in penA, others lack these mutations. Here, we show that penA-independent ceftriaxone resistance has evolved multiple times through distinct mutations in rpoB and rpoD. We identify five mutations in these genes that each increase resistance to ceftriaxone, including one mutation that arose independently in two lineages, and show that clinical isolates from multiple lineages are a single nucleotide change from ceftriaxone resistance. These RNA polymerase mutations result in large-scale transcriptional changes without altering susceptibility to other antibiotics, reducing growth rate, or deranging cell morphology. These results underscore the unexpected diversity of pathways to resistance and the importance of continued surveillance for novel resistance mutations.",

    "abstract": "The function of migration is to allow exploitation of resources whose availability is heterogeneous in space and time. Much effort has been historically directed to studying migration as a response to seasonal, predictable fluctuations in resource availability in temperate species. A deeper understanding of how different migration patterns emerge in response to different patterns of resource variation requires focusing on species inhabiting less predictable environments, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. We provide the first individual-based, quantitative description of migratory patterns in a subtropical wading bird in the Southeastern U.S., the wood stork (Mycteria americana). Using GPS tracking data for 64 individuals tracked between 2004 and 2017, we classified migratory behavior at the individual-year level using information theory-based model selection on non-linear models of net squared displacement. We found that the wood stork population is partially migratory, with 59% of individuals seasonally commuting between winter ranges in Florida and summer ranges elsewhere in the population range (migrants), and 28% remaining in a single area in Florida year-round (residents). Additionally, 13% of storks act as facultative migrants, migrating in some years but not in others. Comparing the distribution of residents and migrants suggests that different migratory strategies might be associated with the use of different or differently distributed resources, possibly including food supplementation from human activities. The existence of facultative migrants shows the potential for plastic change of migratory patterns. Partial migration in wood storks may be an adaptation to high heterogeneity and unpredictability of food resources. We suggest that future research should focus on wading birds as model species for the study of partial migration as an adaptation to heterogeneous and unpredictable environments, by comparing populations of the same species across different wetland systems and sympatric populations of species that differ in their resource acquisition mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesDepression is the most common psychiatric disorder and the largest contributor to global disability. The Australian Genetics of Depression study was established to recruit a large cohort of individuals who have been diagnosed with depression, and to investigate genetic and environmental risk factors for depression and response to commonly prescribed antidepressants. This paper describes the recruitment and characteristics of the sample.\\n\\nMethodsParticipants completed an online questionnaire that consisted of a compulsory module that assessed self-reported psychiatric history, clinical depression using the Composite Interview Diagnostic Interview Short Form, and experiences of using commonly prescribed antidepressants. Further voluntary modules assessed a wide range of traits of relevance to psychopathology. Participants who reported they were willing to provide a DNA sample were sent a saliva kit in the mail.\\n\\nResultsA total of 20,689 participants, 75% of whom were female, enrolled in the study. The average age of participants was 43 years {+/-} 15 years. 15,807 participants (76% of the participant group) returned saliva kits. The overwhelming majority of participants reported being given a diagnosis of depression by a medical practitioner and 88% met the criteria for a depressive episode. Rates of comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders were high. Two-thirds of the sample reported having taken more than one type of antidepressant during treatment for their depression.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study was effective in recruiting a large community sample of people with a history of clinical depression, highlighting the willingness of Australians to engage with medical research. A combination of recruitment through health records and media as well as use of an online questionnaire made it feasible to recruit the large sample needed for investigating the genetics of common diseases. It will be a valuable resource for investigating risk factors for depression, treatment response to antidepressants and susceptibility to side effects.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is involved in a variety of muscular and neurodegenerative disorders. For many of these disorders, current models suggest a prion-like molecular mechanism of disease, whereby proteins aggregate and spread to neighboring cells in an infectious manner. A variety of proteins with prion-like domains (PrLDs) have recently been linked to these disorders. The development of prion prediction algorithms has facilitated the large-scale identification of PrLDs among \\\"reference\\\" proteomes for various organisms. However, the degree to which intraspecies protein sequence diversity influences predicted aggregation propensity for PrLDs has not been systematically examined. Here, we explore protein sequence variation introduced at genetic, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels, and its influence on predicted aggregation propensity for human PrLDs. We find that sequence variation is relatively common among PrLDs and in some cases can result in relatively large differences in predicted aggregation propensity. Analysis of a database of sequence variants associated with human disease reveals a number of mutations within PrLDs that are predicted to increase aggregation propensity. Our analyses expand the list of candidate human PrLDs, estimate the effects of sequence variation on the aggregation propensity of PrLDs, and suggest the involvement of prion-like mechanisms in additional human diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobiome composition is frequently studied by the amplification and high-throughput sequencing of specific molecular markers (metabarcoding). Various hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene are classically used to estimate bacterial diversity, but other universal bacterial markers with a finer taxonomic resolution could be employed. We compared specificity and sensitivity between a portion of the rpoB gene and the V3V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene.\\n\\nResultsWe first designed universal primers for rpoB suitable for use with Illumina sequencing-based technology and constructed a reference rpoB database of 45,000 sequences. The rpoB and V3V4 markers were amplified and sequenced from (i) a mock community of 19 bacterial strains from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive lineages; (ii) bacterial assemblages associated with entomopathogenic nematodes. In metabarcoding analyses of mock communities with two analytical pipelines (FROGS and DADA2), the estimated diversity captured with the rpoB marker resembled the expected composition of these mock communities more closely than that captured with V3V4. The rpoB marker had a higher level of taxonomic affiliation, a higher sensitivity (detection of all the species present in the mock communities), and a higher specificity (low rates of spurious OTU detection) than V3V4. We applied both primers to infective juveniles of the nematode Steinernema glaseri. Both markers showed the bacterial community associated with this nematode to be of low diversity (< 50 OTUs), but only rpoB reliably detected the symbiotic bacterium Xenorhabdus poinarii.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results confirm that different microbiota composition data may be obtained with different markers. We found that rpoB was a highly appropriate marker for assessing the taxonomic structure of mock communities and the nematode microbiota. Further studies on other ecosystems should be considered to evaluate the universal usefulness of the rpoB marker. Our data highlight two crucial elements that should be taken into account to ensure more reliable and accurate descriptions of microbial diversity in high-throughput amplicon sequencing analyses: i) the need to include mock communities as controls; ii) the advantages of using a multigenic approach including at least one housekeeping gene (rpoB is a good candidate) and one variable region of the 16S rRNA gene.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecules that respond to different external stimuli enable the remote control of genetically modified cells. Chemogenetics and optogenetics, two tools that can control cellular activities via synthetic chemicals or photons, respectively, have been widely used to elucidate underlying physiological processes. These methods are, however, very invasive, have poor penetrability, or low spatiotemporal precision, attributes that hinder their use in therapeutic applications. We report herein a sonogenetic approach that can manipulate target cell activities by focused ultrasound stimulation. This system requires an ultrasound-responsive protein derived from an engineered auditory-sensing protein prestin. Heterogeneous expression of mouse prestin containing two parallel amino acid substitutions, N7T and N308S, that frequently exist in prestins from echolocating species endowed transfected mammalian cells with the ability to sense ultrasound. An ultrasound pulse of low frequency and low pressure efficiently evoked cellular calcium responses after transfecting with prestin(N7T, N308S). Moreover, pulsed ultrasound can also non-invasively stimulate target neurons expressing prestin(N7T, N308S) in deep regions of mice brains. Our study delineates how an engineered auditory-sensing protein can cause mammalian cells to sense ultrasound stimulation. Moreover, owing to the great penetration of low-frequency ultrasound ([~]400 mm in depth), our sonogenetic tools will serve as new strategies for non-invasive therapy in deep tissues of large animals like primates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundComputation and visualization of connectivity among the brain regions is vital for tasks such as disease identification and drug discovery. An effective visualization can aid clinicians and biologists to perform these tasks addressing a genuine research and industrial need. In this paper, we present SMT-Neurophysiology, a web-based tool in a form of an approximation to the Steiner Minimal Tree (SMT) algorithm to search neurophysiology partonomy and connectivity graph in order to find biomedically-meaningful paths that could explain, to neurologists and neuroscientists, the mechanistic relationship, for example, among specific neurophysiological examinations. We also present SMT-Genetic, a web-based tool in a form of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find better paths than SMT-Neurophysiology.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce an approximation to the SMT algorithm to identify the most parsimonious connectivity among the brain regions of interest. We have implemented our algorithm as a highly interactive web application called SMT-Neurophysiology that enables such computation and visualization. It operates on brain region connectivity dataset curated from the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) for four species - human, monkey, rat and bird. We present two case studies on finding the most biomedically-meaningful solutions that identifies connections among a set of brain regions over a specific route. The case studies demonstrate that SMT-Neurophysiology is able to find connection among brain regions of interest. Furthermore, SMT-Neurophysiology is modular and generic in nature allowing the underlying connectivity graph to model any data on which the tool can operate. In order to find better connections among a set of brain regions than SMT-Neurophysiology, we have implemented a web-based tool in a form of a GA called SMT-Genetic. We present further three case studies where SMT-Genetic finds better connections among a set of brain regions than SMT-Neurophysiology. SMT-Genetic gives better connections because SMT-Genetic finds global optimum whereas SMT-Neurophysiology finds local optimum although execution time of SMT-Genetic is higher than SMT-Neurophysiology.\\n\\nConclusionOur analysis would provide key insights to clinical investigators about potential mechanisms underlying a particular neurological disease.

    "abstract": "Cognitive reserve is a concept that explains individual differences in vulnerability to cognitive impairment due to age and dementia-related brain changes. Mechanisms underlying the cognitive reserve effect are poorly understood. We investigated associations between a comprehensive cognitive reserve proxy (Lifetime Experiences Questionnaire/LEQ) and functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex across the whole scalp, covarying for the level of current cognitive functioning (Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination Revised/ACE-R), using multiblock parallel and orthogonalized partial least squares regression. EEG data were collected from 34 healthy older adults (63 to 83 years) in eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-states, and during 0-back and 1-back tasks. Functional connectivity was estimated using imaginary coherence in the theta and alpha frequency bands, as these bands have been heavily implicated in cognitive ageing, attention and executive function. We found three clusters of electrodes where the absolute values of the regression coefficient were above threshold when covarying for ACE-R: (1) a cluster approximating the right frontocentral region during the eyes-open condition in the theta band with seed electrodes approximating the left prefrontal cortex with positive associations of medium effect size; (2) a cluster approximating the right parietotemporal region during the 0-back task in the theta band with seed electrodes approximating the right prefrontal cortex with negative associations of medium to large effect sizes; and (3) a cluster approximating the occipitoparietal region in the eyes-closed condition in the alpha band with seed electrodes approximating the left prefrontal cortex with negative associations of medium effect size. These relationships between a cognitive reserve proxy and functional connectivity, within key networks and frequency bands associated with attention and executive function, may reflect greater neural capacity and efficiency.",

While investigating an intriguing putative population stratification within the Japanese population, we identified a previously unreported batch effect leading to spurious mutation calls in the 1kGP data and to the apparent population stratification. Because the 1kGP data is used extensively, we find that the batch effects also lead to incorrect imputation by leading imputation servers and a small number of suspicious GWAS associations.
