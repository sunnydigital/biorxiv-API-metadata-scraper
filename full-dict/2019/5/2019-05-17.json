    "abstract": "Premise of the studyThe Climate Reconstruction Analysis using Coexistence Likelihood Estimation (CRACLE) method for the estimation of climate from vegetation is a robust set of modeling tools for estimating climate and paleoclimate that makes use of large repositories of biodiversity data and open-access R software.\n\nMethodsHere we implement a new R library for the estimation of climate from vegetation. The  cRacle library implements functions for data access, aggregation, and models to estimate climate from plant community composition.  cRacle is modular and features many best-practice features.\n\nResultsPerformance tests using modern vegetation survey data from North and South America shows that CRACLE outperforms alternative methods. CRACLE estimates of mean annual temperature (MAT) are usually within 1{degrees}C of the actual when optimal model parameters are used. Generalized Boosted Regression (GBR) model correction is also shown here to improve on CRACLE models by reducing bias.\n\nDiscussionCRACLE provides accurate estimates of climate from modern plant communities. Non-parametric CRACLE modeling coupled to GBR model correction produces the most accurate results to date. The  cRacle R library streamlines the estimation of climate from plant community data, and will make this modeling more accessible to a wider range of users.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic combinations are increasingly used to combat bacterial infections. Multidrug therapies are a particularly important treatment option for E. faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen that contributes to high-inoculum infections such as infective endocarditis. While numerous synergistic drug combinations for E. faecalis have been identified, much less is known about how different combinations impact the rate of resistance evolution. In this work, we use high-throughput laboratory evolution experiments to quantify adaptation in growth rate and drug resistance of E. faecalis exposed to drug combinations exhibiting different classes of interactions, ranging from synergistic to suppressive. We identify a wide range of evolutionary behavior, including both increased and decreased rates of growth adaptation, depending on the specific interplay between drug interaction and cross resistance. For example, selection in a dual-lactam combination leads to accelerated growth adaptation compared to selection with the individual drugs, even though the resulting resistance profiles are nearly identical. On the other hand, populations evolved in an aminoglycoside and -lactam combination exhibit decreased growth adaptation and resistant profiles that depend on the specific drug concentrations. We show that the main qualitative features of these evolutionary trajectories can be explained by simple rescaling arguments that correspond to geometric transformations of the two-drug growth response surfaces measured in ancestral cells. The analysis also reveals multiple examples where resistance profiles selected by drug combinations correspond to (nearly) optimized linear combinations of those selected by the component drugs. Our results highlight trade-offs between drug interactions and collateral effects during the evolution of multi-drug resistance and emphasize evolutionary benefits and disadvantages of particular drug pairs targeting enterococci.",

    "abstract": "Missense variant interpretation is challenging. Essential regions for protein function are conserved among gene family members, and genetic variants within these regions are potentially more likely to confer risk to disease. Here, we generated 2,871 gene family protein sequence alignments involving 9,990 genes and performed missense variant burden analyses to identify novel essential protein regions. We mapped 2,219,811 variants from the general population into these alignments and compared their distribution with 65,034 missense variants from patients. With this gene family approach, we identified 398 regions enriched for patient variants spanning 33,887 amino acids in 1,058 genes. As a comparison, testing the same genes individually we identified less patient variant enriched regions involving only 2,167 amino acids and 180 genes. Next, we selected de novo variants from 6,753 patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and 1,911 unaffected siblings, and observed a 5.56-fold enrichment of patient variants in our identified regions (95% C.I. =2.76-Inf, p-value = 6.66x10-8). Using an independent ClinVar variant set, we found missense variants inside the identified regions are 111-fold more likely to be classified as pathogenic in comparison to benign classification (OR = 111.48, 95% C.I = 68.09-195.58, p-value < 2.2e-16). All patient variant enriched regions identified (PERs) are available online through a user-friendly platform for interactive data mining, visualization and download at http://per.broadinstitute.org. In summary, our gene family burden analysis approach identified novel patient variant enriched regions in protein sequences. This annotation can empower variant interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Genomic databases are substantially biased towards European ancestry populations, and this bias contributes to health disparities. Here, we quantify how well 66,971 experimentally characterized human protein 3D structures represent the diversity of protein sequences observed across the 1000 Genomes Project. More than 85% of available structures do not match a sequence observed in at least one individual, and on average structures match the sequence of 74% of individuals. Nearly 23% of human structures do not match any observed sequences; however, after masking engineered/known mutations, this decreases to ~4%. African ancestry sequences are modestly, but significantly, less likely to be represented by structures (73.5% vs. 74.0%). These differences are mainly driven by the greater genetic diversity of African populations. We identify thousands of variants unrepresented in available structures that influence protein structure and function. Thus, the use of a single structure as representative of \\\"the wild type\\\" protein will often bias results against many individuals. The diversity of protein sequence and structure must be considered to enable accurate, reproducible, and generalizable conclusions from structural analyses.",

However, forensic identification of vertebrate tissue relies on the sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI)  barcode genes, which remains costly for purposes of screening large numbers of unknown samples during routine surveillance. Here, we adopted a rapid, low-cost approach to differentiate 10 domestic and 24 wildlife species that are common in the East African illegal wildlife products trade based on their unique high-resolution melting profiles from COI, cytochrome b, and 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR products. Using the approach, we identified (i) giraffe among covertly sampled meat from Kenyan butcheries, and (ii) forest elephant mitochondrial sequences among savannah elephant reference samples. This approach is being adopted for high-throughput pre-screening of potential bushmeat samples in East African forensic science pipelines.",

Rtf1 bound to nucleosomes through its histone modification domain, supporting its role as a cofactor in H2B K123 ubiquitylation.

One important PD subgroup is defined by postural instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD), which is associated with disability, lower quality of life, and cognitive deterioration. In this study, we evaluate what clinical factors at baseline are associated with early development of postural instability in PD.\\n\\nMethodsData was downloaded from the Parkinsons Progressive Markers Initiative (PPMI). Several clinical features predict development of postural instability. We provisionally term the associated phenotype the emerging gait disorder (eGD) phenotype. We evaluate validity of the phenotype in two held-out populations.\\n\\nResultsIndividuals with the proposed eGD phenotype have a significantly higher risk of developing postural instability in both validation sets (p < 0.00001 in both sets). The proposed eGD phenotype occurred before development of postural instability (HY stage [&ge;] 3) in 289 of 301 paired comparisons (Fischer Exact Test, p < 0.000001), with a median progression time from development of eGD phenotype to postural instability of 972 days. Individuals with the proposed eGD phenotype at baseline had more rapid cognitive decline as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (p = 0.002) and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (Total Recall, p = 0.008).\\n\\nInterpretationWe describe a clinical phenotype, detectable at baseline in a subset of individuals with PD, that is associated with accelerated development of postural instability. Within the sample, development of the eGD phenotype reliably precedes development of disability, and is a harbinger of more rapid cognitive progression.",

A major issue for preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutics for NASH is the limited number of appropriate animal models, i.e., models that do not require long-term dietary intervention and adequately mimic disease progression in humans. The present study aimed to evaluate a 3-week dietary mouse model of NASH and to validate it by studying the effects of liraglutide, a compound in advanced clinical development for NASH.\\n\\nMethodsC57BL6/J mice were fed a diet high in fat (60%), cholesterol (1.25%) and cholic acid (0.5%) along with 2% hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin in drinking water (HFCC-CDX diet). Histological and biological parameters were measured at 1 and 3 weeks. Following 1-week diet induction, liraglutide was administrated daily for 2 weeks, and then NASH-associated phenotypic aspects were evaluated in comparison with control mice.\\n\\nResultsPrior to treatment with liraglutide, mice fed the HFCC-CDX diet for 1 week developed liver steatosis and had increased levels of oxidative-stress markers and hepatic and systemic inflammation. For mice not treated with liraglutide, these aspects were even more pronounced after 3 weeks of the dietary period, with additional liver insulin resistance and fibrosis. Liraglutide treatment corrected the diet-induced alterations in glucose metabolism and significantly reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation.\\n\\nConclusionThis study provides a novel 3-week dietary model of mice that rapidly develop NASH features, and this model will be suitable for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of compounds in preclinical drug development for NASH.",

Therefore, we set out to evaluate [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-duramycin as a positron emission tomography (PET)-tracer of cell death for detecting chemotherapy-induced organ toxicity.\\n\\nMethodsNODAGA-duramycin was radiolabeled with 68Ga, and quality control was done by thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Tracer specificity was determined in vitro by performing competitive binding experiments on ethanol treated cells. To optimize the timing of the PET/CT-based tracer evaluation, kinetic studies were performed in untreated and cisplatin-treated (20 mg/kg BW, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) BALB/cAnNRj mice. Organ uptake was analyzed in doxorubicin (4 mg/kg BW, i.p.)-, busulfan (18.8 mg/kg KG, i.p.)-, and cisplatin-treated (20 mg/kg BW, i.p.) mice, and in untreated control mice 2 hours after intravenous injection of 5-10 MBq [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-duramycin. For immunofluorescence validation, tissue sections were stained with anti-active caspase-3 antibody. Blood and serum samples were collected to determine platelet count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, urea, creatinine, and creatine kinase values.\\n\\nResultsIn vitro experiments confirmed specific binding of [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-duramycin to dying cells. The biodistribution analysis revealed a blood half-life of 10-17 minutes and a predominantly urinary excretion of the radiotracer. Doxorubicin-, busulfan-, and cisplatin-induced organ toxicities were detected successfully using [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-duramycin PET/CT and confirmed by immunohistochemistry as well as blood parameter analysis. Busulfan-related spleno-, cardio-, and pneumotoxicity as well as cisplatin-induced cardio- and pneumotoxicity were detected even earlier by [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-duramycin PET/CT than by blood parameters and histological stainings. In livers and kidneys, differences between treated and untreated animals tended to occur in PET/CT at later time points than in histology due to the relatively high background in these organs. However, trends over time were comparable.\\n\\nConclusion[68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-duramycin PET/CT was successfully applied to non-invasively detect chemotherapy-induced organ toxicity with high sensitivity in preclinical studies. It even depicted some toxic effects prior to immunohistochemistry and blood parameter analysis and represents a promising alternative or complementary method to standard toxicological analyses. Furthermore, the tracer has a high translational potential and may provide a valuable link between preclinical and clinical research.",

Here, we present a new ensemble bi-layered machine learning architecture, that directly builds on ten existing pipelines providing rapid, high accuracy, 3-State secondary structure prediction of proteins.\\n\\nResultsAfter training on 1348 solved protein structures, we evaluated the model with four independent datasets: JPRED4 - compiled by the authors of the successful predictor with the same name, and CASP11, CASP12 & CASP13 - assembled by the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction consortium who run biannual experiments focused on objective testing of predictors. These rigorous, pre-established protocols included 7-fold cross-validation and blind testing. This led to a mean Hermes accuracy of 95.5%, significantly (p<0.05) better than the ten previously published models analysed in this paper. Furthermore, Hermes yielded a reduction in standard deviation, lower boundary outliers, and reduced dependency on solved structures of homologous proteins, as measured by NEFF score. This architecture provides advantages over other pipelines, while remaining accessible to users at any level of bioinformatics experience.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationThe source code for Hermes is freely available at: https://github.com/HermesPrediction/Hermes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundT cells exhibit heterogeneous functional states in the tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can reinvigorate only the stem cell-like progenitor exhausted T cells, which suggests that inhibiting the exhaustion progress will improve the efficacy of immunotherapy. Thus, regulatory factors promoting T-cell exhaustion could serve as potential targets for delaying the process and improving ICI efficacy.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed the single-cell transcriptome data derived from human melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples and classified the tumor-infiltrating (TI) CD8+ T-cell population based on PDCD1 (PD-1) levels, i.e. PDCD1-high and PDCD1-low cells. Additionally, we identified differentially expressed genes as candidate factors regulating intra-tumoral T-cell exhaustion. The co-expression of candidate genes with immune checkpoint (IC) molecules in the TI CD8+ T cells was confirmed by single-cell trajectory and flow-cytometry analyses. The loss-of-function effect of the candidate regulator was examined by a cell-based knockdown assay. The clinical effect of the candidate regulator was evaluated based on the overall survival and anti-PD-1 responses.\n\nResultsWe retrieved many known factors for regulating T-cell exhaustion among the differentially expressed genes between PDCD1-high and PDCD1-low subsets of the TI CD8+ T cells in human melanoma and NSCLC. TOX was the only transcription factor (TF) predicted in both tumor types. TOX levels tend to increase as CD8+ T cells become more exhausted. Flow-cytometry analysis revealed a correlation between TOX expression and severity of intra-tumoral T-cell exhaustion. TOX knockdown in the human TI CD8+ T cells resulted in downregulation of PD-1, TIM-3, TIGIT, and CTLA-4, which suggests that TOX promotes intra-tumoral T-cell exhaustion by upregulating IC proteins in cancer. Finally, the TOX level in the TI T cells was found to be highly predictive of overall survival and anti-PD-1 efficacy in melanoma and NSCLC.\n\nConclusionsWe predicted the regulatory factors involved in T-cell exhaustion using single-cell transcriptome profiles of human TI lymphocytes. TOX promoted intra-tumoral CD8+ T-cell exhaustion via upregulation of IC molecules. This suggested that TOX inhibition can potentially impede T-cell exhaustion and improve ICI efficacy. Additionally, TOX expression in the TI T cells can be used for patient stratification during anti-tumor treatments, including anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.",

The precise regulation of neuron subtype-specific morphogenesis and differentiation observed in during the formation of this minimal connectome offers a unique opportunity to dissect gene regulatory networks underlying chordate neurodevelopment. Here we compare the transcriptomes of two very distinct neuron types in the hindbrain/spinal cord homolog of Ciona, the Motor Ganglion (MG): the Descending decussating neuron (ddN, proposed homolog of Mauthner Cells in vertebrates) and the MG Interneuron 2 (MGIN2). Both types are invariantly represented by a single bilaterally symmetric left/right pair of cells in every larva. Supernumerary ddNs and MGIN2s were generated in synchronized embryos and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed ddN- and MGIN2-specific enrichment of a wide range of genes, including many encoding potential \\\"effectors\\\" of subtype-specific morphological and functional traits. More specifically, we identified the upregulation of centrosome-associated, microtubule-stabilizing/bundling proteins and extracellular matrix proteins and axon guidance cues as part of a single intrinsic regulatory program that might underlie the unique polarization of the ddNs, the only descending MG neurons that cross the midline.",

    "abstract": "The recycling of particulate organic matter (POM) by microbes is a key part of the global carbon cycle, one which is mediated by the extracellular hydrolysis of polysaccharides and the production of public goods that can trigger social behaviors in bacteria. Despite the potential importance of these microbial interactions, their role in regulating of ecosystem function remains unclear. In this study, we developed a computational and experimental model system to address this challenge and studied how POM depolymerization rate and its uptake efficiency -two main ecosystem function parameters- depended on social interactions and spatial self-organization on particle surfaces. We found an emergent trade-off between rate and efficiency resulting from the competition between oligosaccharide diffusion and cellular uptake, with low rate and high efficiency being achieved through cell-to-cell cooperation between degraders. Bacteria cooperated by aggregating in cell-clusters of ~10-20m, where cells were able to share public goods. This phenomenon, which was independent of any explicit group-level regulation, led to the emergence of critical cell concentrations below which degradation did not occur, despite all resources being available in excess. By contrast, when particles were labile and turnover rates were high, aggregation promoted competition and decreased the efficiency of carbon utilization. Our study shows how social interactions and cell aggregation determine the rate and efficiency of particulate carbon turnover in environmentally relevant scenarios.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMicroorganisms can cooperate by secreting public goods that benefit local neighbors, however, the impact of cooperation on ecosystem functions remains poorly constrained. We here pair computation and experiment to show that bacterial cooperation mediates the degradation of polysaccharide particles recalcitrant to hydrolysis in aquatic environments. On particle surfaces, cooperation emerges through the self-organization of cells into ~10-20m clusters that promote cooperative uptake of hydrolysis products. The transition between cooperation and competition in aggregates is mitigated by individual cell behaviors such as motility and chemotaxis, that promote reorganization on the particle surface. When cooperation is required, the degradation of recalcitrant biopolymers can only take place when degraders exceed a critical cell concentration, underscoring the importance of microbial interactions for ecosystem function.",

    "abstract": "Morphological plasticity is an adaptive response to heterogenous environments when a fitness advantage is conferred. Larval sea urchins, for example, increase individual fitness in dilute feeding environments by elongating their feeding structure. Morphological plasticity for larval sea urchins is also coupled with significant shifts in the associated bacterial community, but whether this response occurs before, during, or following the expression of plasticity is unclear. Using the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus, we define the temporal pattern of the associated bacterial community throughout the expression of morphological plasticity. From prefeeding through plasticity, we observed that L. variegatus larvae exhibit a four-stage successional pattern and the relatedness of the larval-associated bacterial community directly reflects morphological plasticity and does so prior to expression of the environmental-specific morphology. Based on the structure of the larval-associated bacterial communities, the expression of morphological plasticity correlates short-arm larvae deviating from the microbial trajectory of pre-plastic siblings. Taken together, these data suggest that a holobiont may exhibit shifts in the associated bacterial community corresponding with the environmental variation in absence or anticipation of morphological plasticity.",

Our study aimed to determine the risk factors associated to different types of gallstone in patients diagnosed in Khartoum State Ibnsina Gastroenterology Center.\n\nMethodsA facility-based prospective cross-sectional study was implemented on a convenient sample of 47 participants diagnosed with gallstone through ultrasonography in Ibnsina Gastroenterology center and who underwent surgical interventions for gallstone removal. A standardized interviewer-administrated research tool comprising three parts was used to collect data related to the characteristics of the participants, their medical presentation and examination as well as information on types of gallstone, surgical interventions and outcomes. The data were computerized through Epi-info7 and analyzed through SPSS 23. Descriptive statistics were firstly performed and association was tested through Chi square tests and ANOVA. A multinomial regression analysis established the relationship between types of gallstone and their associated risk factors. All statistical tests were considered as significant when p < 0.05.\n\nResultsThe risk factors statistically associated to gallstone types were family history (p = 0.011) and duration of living in the residence area (p= 0.043) in pigment-cholesterol gallstone model vs mixed-cholesterol gallstone model. Other four risk factors contributing to the pathogenesis of gallstone were parity (OR = 1.623 [95% CI: 0.795-3.315]) vs (OR = 1.426, [95% CI: 0.729- 2.790]), waist circumference (OR= 1.014 [95% CI: 0.948-1.085]) vs (OR = 1.001 [95% CI: 0.942- 1.065]), chronic disease (OR = 0.698, [95% CI: 0.028 - 17.445]) vs (OR = 0.354, [95% CI: 0.021- 6.087]) and serum triglyceride (OR = 0.985, [95% CI: 0.950- 1.022]) vs (OR= 0.980, [95% CI: 0.949- 1.012]).\n\nConclusionOur finding indicated six risk factors related to types of gallstone.

    "abstract": "Following its introduction over thirty years ago, the Markov state-transition cohort model has been used extensively to model population trajectories over time in decision modeling and cost-effectiveness studies. We recently showed that a cohort model represents the average of a continuous-time stochastic process on a multidimensional integer lattice governed by a master equation (ME), which represents the time-evolution of the probability function of a integer-valued random vector. From this theoretical connection, this study introduces an alternative modeling method, stochastic differential equation (SDE), which captures not only the mean behavior but also the variance. We first derive the continuous approximation to the master equation by relaxing integrality constraint of the state space in the form of Fokker Planck equation (FPE), which represents the time-evolution of the probability function of a real-valued random vector. Instead of working with the FPE, the SDE method constitutes time-evolution of the random vector of population counts. We derive the SDE from first principles and describe an algorithm to construct an SDE and solve the SDE via simulation for use in practice. We show the applications of SDE in two case studies. The first example demonstrates that the population trajectories, the mean and the variance, from the SDE and other commonly-used methods match. The second examples shows that users can readily apply the SDE method in their existing works without the need for additional inputs. In addition, in both examples, the SDE is superior to microsimulation in terms of computational speed. In summary, the SDE provides an alternative modeling framework and is less computationally expensive that microsimulation for a typical modeling problem in decision analyses.",

Proper DR can allow for effective noise removal and facilitate many downstream analyses that include cell clustering and lineage reconstruction. Unfortunately, despite the critical importance of DR in scRNAseq analysis and the vast number of DR methods developed for scRNAseq studies, however, few comprehensive comparison studies have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of different DR methods in scRNAseq.\\n\\nResultsHere, we aim to fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a comparative evaluation of a variety of commonly used DR methods for scRNAseq studies. Specifically, we compared 18 different DR methods on 30 publicly available scRNAseq data sets that cover a range of sequencing techniques and sample sizes. We evaluated the performance of different DR methods for neighborhood preserving in terms of their ability to recover features of the original expression matrix, and for cell clustering and lineage reconstruction in terms of their accuracy and robustness. We also evaluated the computational scalability of different DR methods by recording their computational cost.\\n\\nConclusionsBased on the comprehensive evaluation results, we provide important guidelines for choosing DR methods for scRNAseq data analysis. We also provide all analysis scripts used in the present study at www.xzlab.org/reproduce.html.

Promoter regions display a distinct UV signature with reduced TCG>TTG transitions, and genome-wide mapping of UVB-induced DNA photoproducts (pyrimidine dimers) showed that this may be explained by decreased damage formation at hypomethylated promoter CpG sites. Further, an extended signature model encompassing additional information from longer patterns improves modeling of UV mutation rate, which may enhance discrimination between drivers and passenger events. Our study presents a refined picture of the UV signature and underscores that the characteristics of a single mutational process may vary across the genome.",

    "abstract": "Salt marshes play an important role in the global nutrient cycle. The sediments in these systems harbor diverse and complex bacterial communities possessing metabolic capacities that provide ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and removal. On the East Coast of the United States, salt marshes have been experiencing degradation due to anthropogenic stressors. Salt marsh islands within Jamaica Bay, New York City (USA), are surrounded by a large highly urbanized watershed and have declined in area. Restoration efforts have been enacted to reduce further loss, but little is known about how microbial communities develop following restoration activities, or how processes such as nitrogen cycling are impacted. Sediment samples were collected at two sampling depths from five salt marsh islands to characterize the bacterial communities found in marsh sediment including a post-restoration chronosequence of 3-12 years. We used 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing to define alpha and beta diversity, taxonomic composition, and predicted metabolic profile of each sediment sample. We found significant differences in alpha diversity between sampling depths, and significant differences in beta diversity, taxonomic composition, and predicted metabolic capacity among the five sampling locations. The youngest restored site and the degraded natural sampling site exhibited the most distinct communities among the five sites. Our findings suggest that while the salt marsh islands are located in close proximity to each other, they harbor distinct bacterial communities that can be correlated with the post-restoration age, marsh health, and other environmental factors such as availability of organic carbon.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESalt marshes play a critical role in the global nutrient cycle due to sediment bacteria and their metabolic capacities. Many East Coast salt marshes have experienced significant degradation over recent decades, thought largely to be due to anthropogenic stressors such as nitrogen loading, urban development, and sea-level rise. Salt marsh islands in Jamaica Bay (Queens/Brooklyn NY) are exposed to high water column nitrogen due to wastewater effluent. Several receding marsh islands have been subjected to restoration efforts to mitigate this loss. Little is known about the effect marsh restoration has on bacterial communities, their metabolic capacity, or how they develop post-restoration. Here we describe the bacterial communities found in marsh islands including a post-restoration chronosequence of 3-12 years and one degraded marsh island that remains unrestored.",

We monitored root-associated microbial communities in Arabidopsis thaliana and co-occurring grasses at 17 European sites across three years. Analysis of 5,625 microbial community profiles demonstrated strong geographic structuring of the soil biome, but not of the root microbiota. Remarkable similarity in bacterial community composition in roots of A. thaliana and grasses was explained by the presence of a few diverse and geographically widespread taxa that disproportionately colonize roots across sites. In a reciprocal transplant between two A. thaliana populations in Sweden and Italy, we uncoupled soil from location effects and tested their respective contributions to root microbiota variation and plant adaptation. The composition of the root microbiota was affected by location and soil origin, and to a lesser degree by host genotype. The filamentous eukaryotes were particularly strongly affected by location. Strong local adaptation between the two A. thaliana populations was observed, with difference in soil properties and microbes of little importance for the observed magnitude of adaptive differentiation. Our results suggest that, across large spatial scales, climate is more important than are soil conditions for plant adaptation and variation in root-associated filamentous eukaryotic communities.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes an ER-resident glycoprotein, UL148, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) but is fully dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. Hence, its previously ascribed roles in immune evasion and modulation of viral cell tropism are hypothesized to cause ER stress. Here, we show that UL148 is necessary and sufficient to drive the formation of large ER-derived structures that occupy up to 7% of the infected cell cytosol. The structures are found to be sites where UL148 coalesces with cellular proteins involved in ER quality control, such as Hrd1 and EDEM1. Transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal the structures to be comprised of tortuous, densely packed and apparently collapsed ER membranes that connect to distended cisternae. During induced ectopic expression of UL148-GFP fusion protein, punctate signals traffic to accumulate at prominent structures that exhibit poor recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching. Small molecule blockade of the integrated stress response (ISR) prevents the formation of puncta, leading to a uniform reticular fluorescent signal. Accordingly, ISR inhibition during HCMV infection abolishes the coalescence of UL148 and Hrd1 into discrete structures, which argues that UL148 requires the ISR to cause ER reorganization. Given that UL148 stabilizes immature forms of a receptor binding subunit for a viral envelope glycoprotein complex important for HCMV infectivity, our results imply that stress-dependent ER remodeling contributes to viral cell tropism.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPerturbations to ER morphology occur during infection with various intracellular pathogens and in certain genetic disorders. We identify that an HCMV gene product, UL148, profoundly reorganizes the ER during infection, and is sufficient to do so when expressed on its own. Our results reveal that UL148-dependent reorganization of the ER is a prominent feature of HCMV infected cells. Moreover, we find that this example of virally induced organelle remodeling requires the integrated stress response (ISR), a stress adaptation pathway that contributes to a number of disease states. Since ER reorganization accompanies the roles of UL148 in HCMV cell tropism and intracellular retention of the immune cell co-stimulatory ligand CD58, our results may have implications for understanding the mechanisms involved. Furthermore, our findings provide a basis to utilize UL148 as a tool to investigate organelle responses to stress and to identify novel drugs targeting the ISR.",

We found that stimulating sensory and cognitive areas yielded fundamentally heterogeneous effects. Stimulation of occipital cortex enhanced brain-wide functional connectivity and biophysical modeling identified increased local inhibition and enhanced forward-signaling after TMS. Conversely, frontal stimulation decreased functional connectivity, associated with local disinhibition and disruptions of both feedforward and feedback connections.

    "abstract": "A rapidly growing number of studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have used resting-state fMRI to identify alterations of functional connectivity, with the hope of identifying clinical biomarkers or underlying neural mechanisms. However, results have been largely inconsistent across studies, and there is therefore a pressing need to determine the primary factors influencing replicability. Here, we used resting-state fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange to investigate two potential factors: denoising strategy and data site (which differ in terms of sample, data acquisition, etc.). We examined the similarity of both group-average functional connectomes and group-level differences (ASD vs. control) across 33 denoising pipelines and four independently-acquired datasets. The group-average connectomes were highly consistent across pipelines (r = 0.92{+/-}0.06) and sites (r = 0.88{+/-}0.02). However, the group differences, while still consistent within site across pipelines (r = 0.76{+/-}0.12), were highly inconsistent across sites regardless of choice of denoising strategies (r = 0.07{+/-}0.04), suggesting lack of replication may be strongly influenced by site and/or cohort differences. Across-site similarity remained low even when considering the data at a large-scale network level or when considering only the most significant edges. We further show through an extensive literature survey that the parameters chosen in the current study (i.e., sample size, age range, preprocessing methods) are quite representative of the published literature. These results highlight the importance of examining replicability in future studies of ASD, and, more generally, call for extra caution when interpreting alterations in functional connectivity across groups of individuals.",

In the colorectum, activation of colonic afferents by low pH contributes to visceral hypersensitivity and abdominal pain in human disease including during inflammatory bowel disease. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber; NMR) shows no pain-related behaviour to subcutaneous acid injection and cutaneous afferents are insensitive to acid, an adaptation thought to be a consequence of the subterranean, likely hypercapnic, environment in which it lives. As such we sought to investigate NMR interoception within the gastrointestinal tract and how this differed from the mouse (Mus Musculus). Here we show the presence of calcitonin gene regulated peptide (CGRP) expressing extrinsic nerve fibres innervating both mesenteric blood vessels and the myenteric plexi of the smooth muscle layers of the NMR colorectum. Using ex vivo colonic-nerve electrophysiological recordings we show differential sensitivity of NMR, compared to mouse, colonic afferents to acid and the prototypic inflammatory mediator bradykinin, but not direct mechanical stimuli. In NMR, but not mouse, we observed mechanical hypersensitivity to acid, whilst both species sensitised to bradykinin. Collectively, these findings suggest that NMR colonic afferents are capable of detecting acidic stimuli, however, their intracellular coupling to downstream molecular effectors of neuronal excitability and mechanotransduction likely differs between species.",

    "abstract": "Motor stereotypies occurring in early-onset neuropsychiatric diseases are associated with dysregulated basal ganglia direct-pathway activity. Disruptions in network connectivity through impaired neuronal structure have been implicated in both rodents and humans. However, the neurobiological mechanisms leading to direct-pathway neuron disconnectivity in stereotypy remain poorly understood. We have a mouse line with Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor deletion from D1-expressing cells (D1-Cre-flTrkB) in which a subset of animals shows repetitive rotations and head tics with juvenile onset. Here we demonstrate these behaviors may be associated with abnormal direct-pathway activity by reducing rotations using chemogenetic inhibition of dorsal striatum D1-medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in both juvenile and young adult mice. Taking advantage of phenotypical differences in animals with similar genotype, we then interrogated the D1-MSN specific translatome associated with repetitive behavior by using RNA-sequencing of ribosome-associated mRNA. Detailed translatome analysis followed by multiplexed gene expression assessment revealed profound alterations in neuronal projection and synaptic structure related genes in stereotypy mice. Examination of neuronal morphology demonstrated dendritic atrophy and dendritic spine loss in dorsal striatum D1-MSNs from mice with repetitive behavior. Together, our results uncover phenotype-specific molecular alterations in D1-MSNs that relate to morphological adaptations in mice displaying stereotypy behavior.",

    "abstract": "The important role of microglia, the brains resident immune cells, in Alzheimers disease (AD) is now well recognized, however their molecular and functional diversity and underlying mechanisms still remain controversial. To transcriptionally and functionally characterize the diversity of microglia in AD and aging, we isolated the amyloid plaque-containing (XO4+) and non-containing (XO4-) microglia from an AD mouse model. Transcriptomics analysis unveiled independent transcriptional trajectories in ageing and AD. XO4+ microglial transcriptomes linked plaque phagocytosis to altered [Formula] expression of bona fide late onset AD genetic risk factors. We further revealed that the XO4+ transcriptional program is present in a subset of human microglia from AD patients and is a direct and reversible consequence of A{beta} plaque phagocytosis. Conversely, XO4- microglia in AD displayed an accelerated ageing signature and contained more intracellular post synaptic material than plaque-containing microglia, despite reduced active synaptosome phagocytosis. Mechanistically, we predicted HIF1 as a core regulator of the XO4-/XO4+ axis, and further validated the mechanism in vitro using human stem cell-derived microglia like cells and primary human microglia. Together these findings unveiled the molecular mechanism underpinning the functional diversity of microglia in AD, providing opportunities to develop treatments targeted at subset specific manipulation of the microglial niche.",

Despite major progress in neurorehabilitative and pharmacological approaches, no curative treatment for spasticity exists. Here, we show in a mouse model of chronic SCI that treatment with nimodipine -- an FDA-approved L-type calcium channel blocker -- starting in the acute phase of SCI completely prevents the development of spasticity measured as increased muscle tone and spontaneous spasms. The aberrant muscle activities are permanently blocked even after termination of the treatment. Constitutive and conditional silencing in neuronal subtypes of CaV 1.3 channels shows that preventive effect of nimodipine on spasticity after SCI is mediated by the neuronal CaV 1.3 channels.

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryPatients with Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) display intellectual impairment, hyperphagia, and various behavioral problems during childhood that converge on a neurologic deficit. The majority of PWS patients have genetic deletions of the paternal 15q11-q13 chromosomal region, with their maternal PWS locus intact but epigenetically silenced by hypermethylation and repressive histone modulation of the PWS imprinting center (PWS-IC). Inhibition of the euchromatin histone methyltransferase G9a by small molecules has been recently reported to reactivate PWS genes in patient fibroblasts and a mouse model. However, it is unknown if inhibition of G9a could have similar effect in human PWS neural cells, the cell types that have direct pathophysiological relevance to PWS. Here, we use neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and cortical excitatory neurons derived from a patient iPSC to model PWS, and quantitatively profile the expression of PWS genes using a NanoString panel. We demonstrated that the methylation of the PWS-IC is stable during neuronal lineage conversion, and that the maternal PWS genes remain silenced in PWS NPCs and neurons. Multiple small molecule inhibitors of G9a activate maternal PWS genes in a dose dependent manner in both NPCs and neurons. In addition, G9a inhibitors induce GNRH1 and HTR2C, two neuronal specific genes that contribute to PWS pathology in neurons. Interestingly, distinct from 5-Azacytidine, G9a inhibition does not induce methylation changes of the maternal PWS-IC, indicating that disruption of the histone repressive complex alone is sufficient to drive an open chromatin state at the PWS-IC that leads to partial reactivation of PWS genes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIModeling PWS disease in a dish using patient derived NPCs and neurons\nC_LIO_LIG9a inhibition activates maternal PWS genes in patient-derived neural cells\nC_LIO_LIG9a inhibition activates maternal SNORD116 and other PWS genes in patient-derived neurons\nC_LIO_LIInhibition of G9a induces PWS downstream genes GNRH1 and HTR2C in PWS neurons\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The improved representation of inland aquatic (freshwater) and estuarine ecosystems and associated data was a key component of the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment, and is an essential step in enhancing defensible land use planning and decision making. This paper reports on this enhancement of the National Wetland Map version 5 (NWM5) for South Africa and other data layers associated with the South African Inventory of Inland Aquatic Ecosystems. Detail is provided on (i) the extent of wetlands mapped in NWM5, compared to previous versions of the NWMs; (ii) the improved extent of inland wetlands mapped in focus areas in NWM5 relative to NWM4; (iii) the type of cover associated with the wetlands (inundated, vegetated or arid); (iv) the ecotone between rivers or inland wetlands and estuaries mapped as freshwater--estuarine transition zones; and (v) level of confidence for the inland wetlands in terms of how well the extent and hydrogeomorphic units were captured for each sub-quaternary catchment of South Africa. A total of 4 698 824 ha (3.9% of South Africa) of inland aquatic ecosystems and artificial wetlands have now been mapped, with NWM5 delineating 123% more inland wetlands (2 635 809 ha or 2.2% of SA) compared with NWM4. The estuarine functional zone, which encapsulates all estuarine processes, associated habitats and biota, was refined for 292 systems totalling 188 944 ha, with the addition of 42 micro-estuaries totalling 246 ha. Nearly 600 000 ha (0.5% of SA) of artificial wetlands were mapped in SA. Inland wetlands are predominantly palustrine (55%), some arid (34%) and few inundated systems (11%). Transition zones between freshwater ecosystems and estuaries formed a small fraction (<1.5%) of river total extent (164 018 km), indicating an ecotone where biota and processes continuously vary from freshwater to estuarine. The majority of inland wetlands (~70%) had a low confidence ranking for designation of extent and typing. Future improvements of the map should be focussed on catchment-based improvements particularly in strategic water-source areas, areas of high development pressure and those with low confidence designation of wetland type.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) promoted the idea that species richness within sites depends on site connectivity, i.e. its connection with surrounding potential sources of immigrants. TIB has been extended to a wide array of fragmented ecosystems, beyond archipelagoes, surfing on the analogy between habitat patches and islands and on the patch-matrix framework. However, patch connectivity often little contributes to explaining species richness in empirical studies. Before interpreting this trend as questioning the broad applicability of TIB principles, one first needs a clear identification of methods and contexts where strong effects of patch structural connectivity are likely to occur. Here, we use spatially explicit simulations of neutral metacommunities to show that patch connectivity effect on local species richness is maximized under a set of specific conditions: (i) patch delineation should be fine enough to ensure that no dispersal limitation occurs within patches, (ii) patch connectivity indices should be scaled according to target organisms dispersal distance and (iii) the habitat amount around sampled sites (within a distance adapted to organisms dispersal) should be highly variable. When those three criteria are met, the absence of an effect of connectivity on species richness should be interpreted as contradicting TIB hypotheses",

    "abstract": "Infectious disease eradication programs often pursue spatially targeted interventions, but how well they perform might depend on the underlying spatial epidemiology and the specific goal of the program. We use a stochastic compartmental metapopulation model of yaws transmission to investigate how total targeted treatment (TTT) performs compared to mass drug administration (MDA) in different settings. While TTT can efficiently control the prevalence of active yaws disease, we consistently found that multiple rounds of TTT are required to match the impact of 1 round of MDA on the prevalence of latent yaws infection. When complete eradication of yaws is the goal, MDA can achieve the same result as TTT more quickly and probably at lower cost. We found that the performance of TTT is improved when there is little mixing between subpopulations and when there is spatial heterogeneity in transmissibility, but even in these settings, our model suggests that MDA will still outperform TTT.\\n\\nSignificance StatementYaws is a neglected tropical disease that causes skin lesions. Eradicating yaws is challenging because people can be infected but not show any signs or symptoms for years. Using simulations, we found that targeting antibiotics to people with active yaws and to their neighbors is a good way to combat active yaws, but treating entire populations is a better way to get rid of all infections, including the hidden ones. Also, targeted treatment works better in populations in which people do not move around much and in which how easily the disease is transmitted varies from place to place. Overall, a targeted treatment strategy uses fewer antibiotics but takes longer than mass treatment to achieve results.",

Using multiple RNA-seq methods for differential expression and variant analysis, we found clusters of sperm mutations in each donor that are indicative of the sperm being produced by different stem cell pools. Moreover, by comparing the two groups, we have found expression changes that can separate out the two sets of donors. Finally, through our novel variant calling from single-cell RNA-seq methods, we have shown that we can detect mutation rates in sperm from ASD donors that is distinct from the controls, highlighting this method as a new means to characterize ASD risk.",

To understand the mechanistic details of the effect of ligand binding on interdomain structure and dynamics, we generated conformational ensembles using experimentally determined NOE interatomic distances and S2 order parameters, available from the literature. In our approach no explicit restraints between the two domains were used and their fast dynamics was also treated independently. We found that intradomain structural changes induced by ligand binding have a profound effect on the interfaces where interdomain contacts can be formed, modulating the probability of the occurrence of specific domain-domain orientations. Our results suggest that the {beta}2-{beta}3 loop in the PDZ domains is a key regulatory region that, through interacting with the upstream residues of the C-terminal peptide ligand, influences both intradomain motions and supramodular rearrangement.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe present study presents results of entomological surveys conducted to address the malaria vectors bionomic, insecticide resistance and transmission prior to the implementation of new strategies complement long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in the framework of a randomized control trial in southwest Burkina Faso.\n\nMethodsWe conducted entomological surveys in 27 villages during the dry cold season (January 2017), dry hot season (March 2017) and rainy season (June 2017). We carried out hourly catches (from 17:00 to 09:00) inside and outside 4 houses in each village using the Human Landing Catch technique. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological taxonomic keys. Specimens belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex and Funestus Group were identified using molecular techniques as well as detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection and insecticide resistance target-site mutations.\n\nResultsEight Anopheles species were detected in the area. Anopheles funestus s.s was the main vector during the dry cold season. It was replaced by Anopheles coluzzii during the dry hot season whereas An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were the dominant species during the rainy season. Species composition of the Anopheles population varied significantly among surveys. All researched target site mutation of insecticide resistance (kdr-w, kdr-e and ace-1) were detected in all members of the An. gambiae complex of the area but at different frequencies. We observed early and late biting phenotypes in the main malaria vector species. Entomological inoculation rates were 0.087, 0.089 and 0.375 infected bites per human per night during dry cold season, dry hot season and rainy season, respectively.\n\nConclusionThe intensity of malaria transmission was high despite the universal coverage with LLINs. We detected early and late biting phenotypes in the main malaria vector species as well as physiological insecticide resistance mechanisms. These vectors might mediate residual transmission. These data highlight the need to develop complementary tools in addition to LLINs in order to better control resistant malaria vectors and to monitor insecticide resistance.",

Inverse probability of treatment weighted multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of the intervention on patient outcomes.\\n\\nOutcomes: In-hospital 30-day mortality (all inpatients), prolonged hospital stay ([&ge;]7 days) and timely antibiotics ([&le;]60 minutes of the alert) for patients who alerted in the Emergency Department.\\n\\nResultsThe introduction of the alert was associated with lower odds of death (OR:0.76; 95%CI:(0.70, 0.84) n=21,183); lower odds of prolonged hospital stay [&ge;]7 days (OR:0.93; 95%CI:(0.88, 0.99) n=9988); and in patients who required antibiotics, an increased odds of receiving timely antibiotics (OR:1.71; 95%CI:(1.57,1.87) n=4622).\\n\\nDiscussionCurrent evidence that digital sepsis alerts are effective is mixed. In this large UK study a digital sepsis alert has been shown to be associated with improved outcomes, including timely antibiotics, which may suggest a causal pathway. It is not known whether the presence of alerting is responsible for improved outcomes, or whether the alert acted as a useful driver for quality improvement initiatives.\\n\\nConclusionsThese findings strongly suggest that the the introduction of a network-wide digital sepsis alert is associated with improvements in patient outcomes, demonstrating that digital based interventions can be successfully introduced and readily evaluated.\\n\\nFundingImperial NIHR Biomedical Research Centre: NIHR-BRC-P68711.",

    "abstract": "Apicomplexans are a diverse group of globally important parasites, that include pathogens like Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria. Despite their current obligate parasitic nature, apicomplexans evolved from photosynthetic algae and retain a remnant plastid (chloroplast). Such a complex evolutionary transition was unexpected, but here we show that it occurred at least three times independently. Using single-cell genomics and transcriptomics from diverse uncultivated parasites, we find that two genera previously classified within the Apicomplexa, Piridium and Platyproteum, form separately branching lineages in phylogenomic analyses. Both retain cryptic plastids with genomic and metabolic features convergent with apicomplexans. These findings suggest a predilection in this lineage for both the loss of photosynthesis and the transition to a morphologically similar parasitic lifestyle, resulting in multiple lineages of highly convergent animal parasites.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene. It is diagnosed following a standardized exam of motor control and often presents with cognitive decline and psychiatric symptoms. Recent studies have detected genetic loci modifying the age at onset of motor symptoms in HD, but genetic factors influencing cognitive and psychiatric presentations are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in HD are influenced by the same common genetic variation as in the general population by constructing polygenic risk scores from large genome-wide association studies of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, and of intelligence, and testing for correlation with the presence of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in a large sample (n=5160) of HD patients. Polygenic risk score for major depression was associated specifically with increased risk of depression in HD, as was schizophrenia risk score with psychosis and irritability. Cognitive impairment and apathy were associated with reduced polygenic risk score for intelligence. In general, polygenic risk scores for psychiatric disorders, particularly depression and schizophrenia, are associated with increased risk of the corresponding psychiatric symptoms in HD, suggesting a common genetic liability. However, the genetic liability to cognitive impairment and apathy appears to be distinct from other psychiatric symptoms in HD. No associations were observed between HD symptoms and risk scores for other neurodegenerative disorders. These data provide a rationale for treatments effective in depression and schizophrenia to be used to treat depression and psychotic symptoms in HD.",

Oscillatory coupling provides one mechanism for cortical and subcortical neurons to synchronize their activity. However, it remains unknown how neurons from different nodes in the social brain network interact when making social decisions. We investigated neuronal coupling between the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus of the medial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala while monkeys expressed context-dependent positive other-regarding preference (ORP) or negative ORP impacting the reward of another monkey. We found an enhanced synchronization between the two nodes for positive ORP, but a suppressed synchronization for negative ORP. These interactions occurred in dedicated frequency channels depending on the area contributing spikes, exhibited a specific directionality of information flow associated with expressing positive ORP, and could be used to decode social decisions. These findings support that specialized coordination in the medial prefrontal-amygdala network underlies social decision preference.",

    "abstract": "In hypoxic stress conditions, glycolysis enzymes assemble into singular cytoplasmic granules called glycolytic (G) bodies. Formation of G bodies in yeast is correlated with increased glucose consumption and cell survival. However, the physical properties and organizing principles that define G body formation are unclear. We demonstrate that glycolysis enzymes are non-canonical RNA binding proteins, sharing many common mRNA substrates that are also integral constituents of G bodies. Tethering a G body component, the beta subunit of the yeast phosphofructokinase, Pfk2, to nonspecific endoribonucleases reveals that RNA nucleates G body formation and subsequent maintenance of G body structural integrity. Consistent with a phase separation mechanism of G body formation, recruitment of glycolysis enzymes to G bodies relies on multivalent homotypic and heterotypic interactions. Furthermore, G bodies can fuse in live cells and are largely insensitive to 1,6-hexanediol treatment, consistent with a hydrogel-like state in its composition. Taken together, our results elucidate the biophysical nature of G bodies and demonstrate that RNA nucleates phase separation of the glycolysis machinery in response to hypoxic stress.",

Here we describe Toxoplasma gondii infection converts NK cells into cells resembling steady-state ILC1s that are heterogeneous and distinct from both steady-state NK cells and ILC1s in uninfected mice. Most toxoplasma-induced ILC1s were Eomes-dependent, indicating that NK cells can give rise to Eomes- Tbet-dependent ILC1-like cells that circulate widely and persist independent of ongoing infection. Moreover, these changes appear permanent, as supported by epigenetic analyses. Thus, these studies markedly expand current concepts of NK cells, ILCs, and their potential conversion.",

In the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, inhibiting neutrophil adhesion using an antibody against the neutrophil specific protein Ly6G was recently shown to drive rapid improvements in cerebral blood flow that was accompanied by an improvement in performance on short-term memory tasks. Here, in a longitudinal aging study, we assessed how far into disease development a single injection of anti-Ly6G can acutely improve memory function. We found that APP/PS1 mice as old as 15-16 months had improved performance on the object replacement and Y-maze tests of short-term memory, measured at one day after anti-Ly6G treatment. APP/PS1 mice 17-18 months of age or older did not show acute improvements in cognitive performance, although we did find that cerebral blood flow was still increased by 17% in 21-22 months old APP/PS1 mice given anti-Ly6G. These data add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that cerebral blood flow reductions are an important contributing factor to the cognitive dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disease.",

Although S. viridis has been studied extensively in the last decade, its defense responses, in particular the chemical defensive metabolites that protect it against insect herbivory, are unstudied. To characterize S. viridis defense responses, we conducted transcriptomic and metabolomic assays of plants infested with aphids and caterpillars. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated massive transcriptomic changes that involve genes from amino acid biosynthesis and degradation, secondary metabolites and phytohormone biosynthesis. The Trp-derived metabolite serotonin was notably induced by insect feeding. Through comparisons with known rice serotonin biosynthetic genes, we identified several predicted S. viridis Trp decarboxylases and cytochrome P450 genes that were up-regulated in response to insect feeding. The function of one Trp decarboxylase was validated by ectopic expression and detection of tryptamine accumulation in Nicotiana tabacum. To validate the defensive properties of serotonin, we used an artificial diet assay to show reduced Rhopalosiphum padi aphid survival with increasing serotonin concentrations. This demonstrated that serotonin is a defensive metabolite in S. viridis and is fundamental for understanding the adaptation of it to biotic stresses.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTA combined transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of Setaria viridis leaves response to aphid and caterpillar infestation identifies the genes related to the biosynthesis of serotonin and their function in defense.",

    "abstract": "AimThe Pakaraima Mountains are an ancient mountain range along the borders of Guyana, Brazil, and Venezuela. The high plateau is drained by multiple river systems in all directions. Although hypotheses have been presented for the biogeographic relationships of lowland rivers, the interconnectivity of rivers on the top of the plateau is unknown. With multiple complex rivers in a small, upland area we predicted a high level of endemism for stream fishes and complex biogeographic relationships. We explore this with the incredibly diverse pencil catfish genus Trichomycterus. Only two species are known from the region. In this study, we 1) confirm the discovery of multiple endemic Trichomycterus species in the region, 2) determine the phylogenetic placement of our samples to posit biogeographical scenarios, and 3) provide clarification for the identification of T. guianensis based on morphology.\\n\\nLocationPakaraima Mountains, a part of the Guiana Shield in Guyana, South America\\n\\nTaxonPencil catfish genus Trichomycterus\\n\\nMethodsUsing collections from recent expeditions to the Pakaraima Mountains of Guyana, we amplified three mitochondrial (16S, COI, and cytb) and two nuclear markers (myh6 and RAG2).

We find two species occupying multiple basins, suggesting that Pakaraima streams either maintain or had some degree of recent connectivity. We identify six endemic lineages of Trichomycterus from the highlands of the Pakaraima Mountains. The upper portions of the study rivers have been connected either through surface flow or by stream capture. Both processes have occurred on multiple time scales and are independent of the patterns seen in the lowlands.",

    "abstract": "Genetic clustering is a popular method for characterizing variation in transmission rates for rapidly-evolving viruses, and could potentially be used to detect outbreaks in  near real time. However, the statistical properties of clustering are poorly understood in this context, and there are no objective guidelines for setting clustering criteria. Here we develop a new statistical framework to optimize a genetic clustering method based on the ability to forecast new cases. We analyzed the pairwise Tamura-Nei (TN93) genetic distances for anonymized HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences from Seattle (n = 1, 653) and Middle Tennessee, USA (n = 2, 779), and northern Alberta, Canada (n = 809). Under varying TN93 thresholds, we fit two models to the distributions of new cases relative to clusters of known cases: (1) a null model that assumes cluster growth is strictly proportional to cluster size, i.e., no variation in transmission rates among individuals; and (2) a weighted model that incorporates individual-level covariates, such as recency of diagnosis. The optimal threshold maximizes the difference in information loss between models, where covariates are used most effectively. Optimal TN93 thresholds varied substantially between data sets, e.g., 0.0104 in Alberta and 0.016 in Seattle and Tennessee, such that the optimum for one population will potentially mis-direct prevention efforts in another. The range of thresholds where the weighted model conferred greater predictive accuracy tended to be narrow ({+/-}0.005 units), but the optimal threshold for a given population also tended to be stable over time. We also extended our method to demonstrate that variation in recency of HIV diagnosis among clusters was significantly more predictive of new cases than sample collection dates ({Delta}AIC> 50). These results demonstrate that one cannot rely on historical precedence or convention to configure genetic clustering methods for public health applications. Our framework not only provides an objective procedure to optimize a clustering method, but can also be used for variable selection in forecasting new cases.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionBreast cancer is a foremost cause of death worldwide, ranks fifth among causes of death from all types of cancers; this is the most common cause of cancer death in women among both developing and developed countries. Breast cancer ranks first among most frequent cancers in women of Ethiopia. In spite of the high incidence, mortality rate, and survival status among breast cancer patients was not determined in Ethiopia.\\n\\nObjectiveThe main aim of the study is to assess the survival status and predictor the mortality among Breast Cancer patients in Adult Oncology Unit at Black Lion Specialized Hospital in 2018.\\n\\nMethodsAn institution based retrospective follow up study was conducted in Adult Oncology Unit at Black Lion Specialized Hospital. All cases of breast cancer registered from 1st January 2012 to 31th December,2014 were followed for the six-year survival (until 31th December, 2017). Kaplan-Meier survival curve together with log rank test was deployed to test for variations in the survival among predictor variables. Cox regression was used at 5% level of significance to determine the net effect of each independent variable on time to death of breast cancer clients.\\n\\nResultsThe results indicate that the incidence rate of mortality was 9.8 per 100 person/ years (95% CI: 8.49-11.47).The overall median survival time was 56.5(95% CI (53.46 - 60.83)) months. The overall estimated survival rate was recorded 27% (95% CI, 17.09 to 36.67 %) at 72 months of follow up, whereas at odd years (1, 3, and 5 years) were, 97.2%, 80.8%, and 46.2% respectively. Predictors of mortality were assessed at clinical stage (III&IV),(AHR =1.86), poorly differentiated histology (AHR: 3.1) & positive lymph node status (AHR:3.13),Whereas adjuvant hormone therapy (AHR: 0.67) and chemotherapy (AHR:0.72) were protective.\\n\\nConclusionThe overall probability of survival in Ethiopia was inferior when compared with other high and middle-income countries. Predictors of mortality were at advanced clinical stage, poorly differentiated histology grade, surgical margin involvement and positive lymph node status. In contrary, adjuvant hormone therapy, modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy were protective factors. Hence, special emphasis could be given to early screening, stage diagnosis and initiation of treatment.",

A total of 164 Gb raw DNA reads were obtained from Vitis riparia resulting in a 225X depth of coverage. We generated a genome assembly of the V. riparia grape de novo using the PacBio long-reads that was phased with the 10x Genomics Chromium linked-reads. At the chromosome level, a 500 Mb genome was generated with a scaffold N50 size of 1 Mb. More than 34% of the whole genome were identified as repeat sequences, and 37,207 protein-coding genes were predicted. This genome assembly sets the stage for comparative genomic analysis of the diversification and adaptation of grapevine and will provide a solid resource for further genetic analysis and breeding of this economically important species.",

    "abstract": "Under stressful conditions some microorganisms adopt a reversible non or slow proliferative quiescent stage that allows their survival. Although quiescence has been described broadly in bacteria, this phenotype has been only recently discovered in Leishmania. In the present work we developed a biosensor of quiescence that allows to monitor the physiological stage of the parasite at population and single cell levels. We inserted a GFP gene into the ribosomal DNA locus and followed the expression of this reporter gene, driven by the ribosomal promotor (rGFP expression). We showed that rGFP expression decreased significantly and rapidly during the in vitro transition from extracellular promastigotes to intracellular amastigotes of L. mexicana an L. braziliensis and that the decrease in rGFP expression was coupled in vitro with a decrease in replication as measured by BrdU incorporation. Quiescence was not only observed in reference laboratory strains, but also among clinical isolates. We found that quiescence was reversible as the parasites could rapidly resume their metabolically active and proliferative stage when they were put back in an optimal environment for growth. We demonstrated for the first time in live cells that amastigotes are a heterogeneous population in which shallow and deep quiescent stages may coexist. Finally, we showed that rGFP expression could be monitored in vivo and that quiescent amastigotes could reside in tissues of animals with latent infections of L. braziliensis or L. mexicana. We propose rGFP expression as a simple parameter to define quiescent cells and further characterize them.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEQuiescence is a physiological diversification that allows pathogens to overcome chemotherapy without the development of drug resistance and to be invisible to the immune system of their host. Quiescent pathogens can cause latent infections and (re-) emerge in an unpredictable time during the lifetime of the individual. The phenomenon was recently described in Leishmania in which it could explain several clinical and sub-clinical features, like therapeutic failure, reactivation of the disease and asymptomatic infections. However, a simple biosensor of quiescence for Leishmania is not yet available. We show for the first time that the integration of GFP within the rDNA locus and the subsequent quantification of its expression can be used as a biosensor to distinguish quiescent subpopulations among live amastigotes. Moreover, we show quiescence is quickly reversible both in vivo and in vitro. We offer a tool that will allow the further molecular characterization of quiescent parasites.",

    "abstract": "The question whether and how we are able to monitor our own cognitive states (metacognition) has been a matter of debate for decades. Do we have direct access to our cognitive processes or can we only infer them indirectly based on their consequences? In the current study, we wanted to investigate the brain circuits that underlie the metacognitive experience of fluency in action selection. To manipulate action-selection fluency we used a subliminal response priming paradigm. On each trial, both male and female human participants additionally engaged in the metacognitive process of rating how hard they felt it was to respond to the target stimulus. Despite having no conscious awareness of the prime, results showed that participants rated incompatible trials (during which subliminal primes interfered with the required response) to be more difficult than compatible trials (where primes facilitated the required response) reflecting metacognitive awareness of difficulty. This increased sense of subjective difficulty was mirrored by increased activity in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and the anterior insula, two regions that are functionally closely connected. Importantly, this reflected activations that were unique to subjective difficulty ratings and were not explained by reaction times or prime-response compatibility. We interpret these findings in light of a possible grounding of the metacognitive judgement of fluency in action selection in interoceptive signals resulting from increased effort.",

    "abstract": "Some animals have evolved task differentiation among their eyes. A particular example is spiders, where most species have eight eyes, of which two (the principal eyes) are used for object discrimination, whereas the other three pairs (secondary eyes) detect movement. In the spider species Cupiennius salei these two eye types correspond to two visual pathways in the brain. Each eye is associated with its own first and second order visual neuropil. The second order neuropils of the principal eyes are connected to the arcuate body, whereas the second order neuropils of the secondary eyes are linked to the mushroom body. However, eye size and visual fields are considerably different in jumping spiders. We explored the principal- and secondary eye visual pathways of the jumping spider Marpissa muscosa. We found that the connectivity of the principal eye pathway is the same as in C. salei, while there are differences in the secondary eye pathways. In M. muscosa, all secondary eyes are connected to their own first order visual neuropils. The first order visual neuropils of the anterior lateral and posterior lateral eyes are further connected with two second order visual neuropils, whereas the posterior median eyes lack second order visual neuropils and their axons project only to the arcuate body. This suggests that the posterior median eyes probably do not serve movement detection in M. muscosa. Furthermore, the second order visual neuropil (L2) in Marpissa muscosa potentially integrates information from the secondary eyes and might thus enable faster movement decisions.",

    "abstract": "Sensory stimuli arrive in a continuous stream. By learning statistical regularities in the sequence of stimuli, the brain can predict future stimuli (Xu et al. 2012; Gavornik and Bear 2014; Maniscalco et al. 2018; J. Fiser and Aslin 2002). Such learning requires associating immediate sensory information with the memory of recently encountered stimuli (Ostojic and Fusi 2013; Kiyonaga et al. 2017). However, new sensory information can also interfere with short-term memories (Parthasarathy et al. 2017). How the brain prevents such interference is unknown. Here, we show that sensory representations rotate in neural space over time, to form an independent memory representation, thus reducing interference with future sensory inputs. We used an implicit learning paradigm in mice to study how statistical regularities in a sequence of stimuli are learned and represented in primary auditory cortex. Mice experienced both common sequences of stimuli (e.g. ABCD) and uncommon sequences (e.g. XYCD). Over four days of learning, the neural population representation of commonly associated stimuli (e.g. A and C) converged. This facilitated the prediction of upcoming stimuli, but also led unexpected sensory inputs to overwrite the sensory representation of previous stimuli (postdiction). Surprisingly, we found the memory of previous stimuli persisted in a second, orthogonal dimension. Unsupervised clustering of functional cell types revealed that the emergence of this second memory dimension is supported by two separate types of neurons; a  stable population that maintained its selectivity throughout the sequence and a  switching population that dynamically inverted its selectivity. This combination of sustained and dynamic representations produces a rotation of the encoding dimension in the neural population. This rotational dynamic may be a general principle, by which the cortex protects memories of prior events from interference by incoming stimuli.",

Treatment is costly and current methods to model response can only account for up to 60% of the variance. The aim of this work was to take a novel genomic approach to growth prediction. GHD (n=71) and TS patients (n=43) were recruited in a study on the long term response to r-hGH over five years of therapy. Pharmacogenomic analysis was performed using 1219 genetic markers and baseline blood transcriptome. Random forest was used to determine predictive value of transcriptomic data associated with growth response. No genetic marker passed the stringency criteria required for predictive value. However, we demonstrated that transcriptomic data can be used to predict growth with a high accuracy (AUC > 0.9) for short and long term therapeutic response in GHD and TS. Network models identified an identical core set of genes in both GHD and TS at each year of therapy whose expression can be used to classify therapeutic response to r-hGH. Combining transcriptomic markers with clinical phenotype was shown to significantly reduce predictive error. We have characterised the utility of baseline transcriptome for the prediction of growth response including the identification of a set of common genes in GHD and TS.

    "abstract": "Salmonella invasion is mediated by a concerted action of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 4 (SPI4)-encoded type one secretion system (T1SS) and the SPIl-encoded type three secretion system (T3SS-1). The SPI4-encoded T1SS establishes the first contact to the host membrane. It consists of five proteins (SiiABCDF) that secrete the giant adhesin SiiE. The exact mechanism by which the T1SS enables host cell recognition remains unclear. Here, we investigated structure-function relationships in SiiA, a non-canonical T1SS subunit located at the inner membrane (IM). We observe that SiiA consists of a membrane domain, an intrinsically disordered periplasmic linker region and a folded globular periplasmic domain (SiiA-PD). The crystal structure of SiiA-PD shows homology to that of MotB-PD and other peptidoglycan (PG)-binding domains. Indeed, SiiA-PD binds PG in vitro albeit at an acidic pH, only, whereas MotB-PD binds PG from pH 5.8 to 8. Mutation of Arg162 in SiiA impedes PG binding and reduces Salmonella invasion efficacy of polarized epithelial cells. SiiA forms a complex with SiiB at the IM, and the SiiA-MotB homology is likely paralleled by a SiiB-MotA homology. We show that, in addition to PG binding, the SiiAB complex translocates protons across the IM. Substituting Asp13 in SiiA impairs proton translocation. Overall, SiiA displays many properties previously observed in MotB.

    "abstract": "RNA-protein interactions mediate a host of cellular processes, underscoring the need for methods to quantify their occurrence in living cells. RNA interaction frequencies for the average cellular protein are undefined, however, and there is no quantitative threshold to define a protein as an RNA-binding protein (RBP). Ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-sequencing, an effective and widely used means of characterizing RNA-protein interactions, would particularly benefit from the capacity to quantitate the number of RNA cross-links per protein per cell. In addition, CLIP-seq methods are difficult, have high experimental failure rates and many ambiguous analytical decisions. To address these issues, the easyCLIP method was developed and used to quantify RNA-protein interactions for a panel of known RBPs as well as a spectrum of random non-RBP proteins. easyCLIP provides the advantages of good efficiency compared to current standards, a simple protocol with a very low failure rate, troubleshooting information that includes direct visualization of prepared libraries without amplification, and a new form of analysis. easyCLIP, which uses sequential on-bead ligation of 5 and 3 adapters tagged with different infrared dyes, classified non-RBPs as those with a per protein RNA cross-link rate of <0.1%, with most RBPs substantially above this threshold, including Rbfox1 (18%), hnRNPC (22%), CELF1 (11%), FBL (2%), and STAU1 (1%). easyCLIP with the PCBP1L100 RBP mutant recurrently seen in cancer quantified increased RNA binding compared to wild-type PCBP1 and suggested a potential mechanism for this RBP mutant in cancer. easyCLIP provides a simple, efficient and robust method to both obtain both traditional CLIP-seq information and to define actual RNA interaction frequencies for a given protein, enabling quantitative cross-RBP comparisons as well as insight into RBP mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Up to 50% of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors demonstrate persisting affective symptoms indicative of limbic system dysregulation, yet the pathophysiology underlying the symptoms is unclear. We hypothesize that TBI-induced pathophysiologic changes within distinct amygdala nuclei contribute to the expression of late-onset anxiety-like behavior. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent midline fluid percussion injury or sham surgery. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed at 7 and 28 days post-injury (DPI) followed by assessment of real-time glutamate neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) using glutamate-selective microelectrode arrays. In separate animal cohorts, the presence of neuropathology, astrocytosis, and microglial activation were assessed at 1, 7, and 28DPI. Protein levels of glutamatergic transporters (Glt-1, GLAST) and presynaptic modulators of glutamate release (mGluR2, TrkB, BDNF, and glucocorticoid receptors) were quantified using automated capillary western techniques at 28DPI. The expression of anxiety-like behavior at 28DPI coincided with decreased glutamate release and slower glutamate clearance in the CeA, not BLA. Changes in glutamate neurotransmission were independent of protein levels of glutamate transporters and mGluR2 receptors, neuropathology, and astrocytosis. At 1DPI, microglia in the CeA demonstrated a neuroinflammatory response. BDNF and TrkB were decreased at 28DPI in the amygdala. These data indicate that diffuse axonal injury instigates sequences of molecular, structural and functional changes in the amygdala that contribute to circuit dysregulation relevant to the expression of affective disorders. Translationally, diffuse axonal injury can influence severity and incidence of affective symptoms and should be addressed in the history of patients with affective disorders.",

Here, we introduce the ALFA-tag, a novel, rationally designed epitope tag that serves an exceptionally broad spectrum of applications in life sciences while outperforming established tags like the HA, FLAG or myc tags. The ALFA-tag forms a small and stable -helix that is functional irrespective of its position on the target protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. We developed a nanobody (NbALFA) binding ALFA-tagged proteins from native or fixed specimen with low picomolar affinity. It is ideally suited for super-resolution microscopy, immunoprecipitations and Western blotting, and also allows in-vivo detection of proteins. By solving the crystal structure of the complex we were able to design a nanobody mutant (NbALFAPE) that permits efficient one-step purifications of native ALFA-tagged proteins, complexes and even entire living cells using peptide elution under physiological conditions.",

Renewed efforts to eliminate malaria has highlighted the potential to interrupt transmission from humans to mosquitoes which is mediated through the gametocytes. Reliable prediction of transmission requires an improved understanding of in vivo kinetics of gametocytes. Here we study the population dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes in human hosts by establishing a framework which incorporates improved measurements of parasitaemia in humans, a novel mathematical model of gametocyte dynamics, and model validation using a Bayesian hierarchical inference method. We found that the novel mathematical model provides an excellent fit to the available clinical data from 17 volunteers infected with P. falciparum, and reliably predicts observed gametocyte levels. We estimated the P. falciparums sexual commitment rate and gametocyte sequestration time in humans to be 0.54% (95% credible interval: 0.30-1.00) per life cycle and 8.39 (6.54-10.59) days respectively. Furthermore, we used the data-calibrated model to predict the effects of those gametocyte dynamics parameters on human-to-mosquito transmissibility, providing a method to link within-human host kinetics of malaria infection to epidemiological-scale infection and transmission patterns.",

For longitudinal binary data, there remain significant challenges in gene mapping, including misspecification of the model for the phenotype distribution due to ascertainment. Here, we propose L-BRAT, a retrospective, generalized estimating equations-based method for genetic association analysis of longitudinal binary outcomes. We also develop RGMMAT, a retrospective, generalized linear mixed model-based association test. Both tests are retrospective score approaches in which genotypes are treated as random conditional on phenotype and covariates. They allow both static and time-varying covariates to be included in the analysis. Through simulations, we illustrated that retrospective association tests are robust to ascertainment and other types of phenotype model misspecification, and gain power over previous association methods. We applied L-BRAT and RGMMAT to a genome-wide association analysis of repeated measures of cocaine use in a longitudinal cohort. Pathway analysis implicated association with opioid signaling and axonal guidance signaling pathways. Lastly, we replicated important pathways in an independent cocaine dependence case-control GWAS. Our results illustrate that L-BRAT is able to detect important loci and pathways in a genome scan and to provide insights into genetic architecture of cocaine use.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA from environmental and host-associated samples (metagenomics and metatranscriptomics) is a powerful tool to assess which organisms are present in a sample. Taxonomic identification software usually align individual short sequence reads to a reference database, sometimes containing taxa with complete genomes only. This is a challenging task given that different species can share identical sequence regions and complete genome sequences are only available for a fraction of organisms. A recently developed approach to map sequence reads to reference databases involves weighing all high scoring read-mappings to the data base as a whole to produce better-informed alignments. We used this novel concept in read mapping to develop a highly accurate metagenomic classification pipeline named CCMetagen. Using simulated fungal and bacterial metagenomes, we demonstrate that CCMetagen substantially outperforms other commonly used metagenome classifiers, attaining a 3 - 1580 fold increase in precision and a 2 - 922 fold increase in F1 scores for species-level classifications when compared to Kraken2, Centrifuge and KrakenUniq. CCMetagen is sufficiently fast and memory efficient to use the entire NCBI nucleotide collection (nt) as reference, enabling the assessment of species with incomplete genome sequence data from all biological kingdoms. Our pipeline efficiently produced a comprehensive overview of the microbiome of two biological data sets, including both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. CCMetagen is user-friendly and the results can be easily integrated into microbial community analysis software for streamlined and automated microbiome studies.",

Agreement between different models is crucial for providing robust evidence for policy-makers because differences in model properties can influence their predictions. In this study, we compared models generated with two individual-based model simulators for HIV epidemiology in a population with HSV-2. For each model simulator, we constructed four models, starting from a simplified model and stepwise including more model complexity. For the resulting eight models, the predictions of the impact of behavioural interventions on the HIV epidemic in Yaounde (Cameroon) were compared. The results show that differences in model assumptions and model complexity can influence the size of the predicted impact of the intervention, as well as the predicted qualitative behaviour of the HIV epidemic after the intervention. Moreover, two models that agree in their predictions of the HIV epidemic in absence of an intervention can have different outputs when predicting the impact of interventions. These findings highlight the importance of making more data available for the calibration and validation of epidemiological models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMitochondria produce cellular energy in the form of ATP and are involved in various metabolic and signaling processes. However, the cellular requirements for mitochondria are different depending on cell type, cell state or organism. Information on the expression dynamics of genes with mitochondrial functions (mito-genes) is embedded in publicly available transcriptomic or proteomic studies and the variety of available datasets enables us to study the expression dynamics of mito-genes in many different cell types, conditions and organisms. Yet, we lack an easy way of extracting these data for gene groups such as mito-genes.\\n\\nResultsHere, we introduce the web-based visual data mining platform mitoXplorer, which systematically integrates expression and mutation data of mito-genes. The central part of mitoXplorer is a manually curated mitochondrial interactome containing [~]1200 genes, which we have annotated in 35 different mitochondrial processes. This mitochondrial interactome can be integrated with publicly available transcriptomic, proteomic or mutation data in a user-centric manner. A set of analysis and visualization tools allows the mining and exploration of mitochondrial expression dynamics and mutations across various datasets from different organisms and to quantify the adaptation of mitochondrial dynamics to different conditions. We apply mitoXplorer to quantify expression changes of mito-genes of a set of aneuploid cell lines that carry an extra copy of chromosome 21. mitoXplorer uncovers remarkable differences in the regulation of the mitochondrial transcriptome and proteome due to the dysregulation of the mitochondrial ribosome in retinal pigment epithelial trisomy 21 cells which results in severe defects in oxidative phosphorylation.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate the power of the visual data mining platform mitoXplorer to explore expression data in a focused and detailed way to uncover underlying potential mechanisms for further experimental studies. We validate the hypothesis-creating power of mitoXplorer by testing predicted phenotypes in trisomy 21 model systems. MitoXplorer is freely available at http://mitoxplorer.ibdm.univ-mrs.fr. MitoXplorer does not require installation nor programming knowledge and is web-based. Therefore, mitoXplorer is accessible to a wide audience of experimental experts studying mitochondrial dynamics.",

Here, we report on the evolution and spread of KEL1/PLA1 in subsequent years.\\n\\nMethodsWe analysed whole genome sequencing data from 1,673 P. falciparum clinical samples collected in 2008-2018 from northeast Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. By investigating genome-wide relatedness between parasites, we inferred patterns of shared ancestry in the KEL1/PLA1 population.\\n\\nFindingsKEL1/PLA1 spread rapidly from 2015 into all of the surveyed countries and now exceeds 80% of the P. falciparum population in several regions. These parasites maintained a high level of genetic relatedness reflecting their common origin. However, several genetic subgroups have recently emerged within this co-lineage with diverse geographical distributions. Some of these emerging KEL1/PLA1 subgroups carry recent mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter (crt) gene, which arise on a specific genetic background comprising multiple genomic regions.\\n\\nInterpretationAfter emerging and circulating for several years within Cambodia, the P. falciparum KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage diversified into multiple subgroups and acquired new genetic features including novel crt mutations. These subgroups have rapidly spread into neighbouring countries, suggesting enhanced fitness. These findings highlight the urgent need for elimination of this increasingly drug-resistant parasite co-lineage, and the importance of genetic surveillance in accelerating elimination efforts.\\n\\nFundingWellcome Trust, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, UK Medical Research Council, UK Department for International Development.\\n\\nResearch in context O_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyThis study updates our previous work describing the emergence and spread of a multidrug resistant P. falciparum co-lineage (KEL1/PLA1) within Cambodia up to 2013. Since then, a regional genetic surveillance project, GenRe-Mekong, has reported that markers of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) resistance have increased in frequency in neighbouring countries. A PubMed search (terms: \\\"artemisinin\\\", \\\"piperaquine\\\", \\\"resistance\\\", \\\"southeast asia\\\") for articles listed since our previous study (from 30/10/2017 to 05/01/2019) yielded 28 results, including reports of a recent sharp decline in DHA-PPQ clinical efficacy in Vietnam; the spread of genetic markers of DHA-PPQ resistance into neighbouring countries by Imwong and colleagues; and multiple reports associating mutations in the crt gene with piperaquine resistance, including newly emerging crt variants in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyWe analysed P. falciparum whole genomes collected up to early 2018 from Eastern Southeast Asia (Cambodia and surrounding regions), describing the fine-scale epidemiology of multiple KEL1/PLA1 genetic subgroups that have spread out from Cambodia since 2015 and taken over indigenous parasite populations in northeastern Thailand, southern and central Vietnam and parts of southern Laos. Several newly emerging crt mutations accompanied the spread and expansion of KEL1/PLA1 subgroups, suggesting an active proliferation of biologically fit, multidrug resistant parasites.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidenceThe problem of P. falciparum multidrug resistance has dramatically worsened in Eastern Southeast Asia since previous reports. KEL1/PLA1 has diversified and spread widely across Eastern Southeast Asia since 2015, becoming the predominant parasite group in several regions. This may have been fuelled by continued parasite exposure to DHA-PPQ, resulting in sustained selection after KEL1/PLA1 became established. Continued drug pressure enabled the acquisition of further mutations, resulting in higher levels of resistance. These data demonstrate the value of pathogen genetic surveillance and the urgent need to eliminate these dangerous parasites.\\n\\nC_TEXTBOX",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic organisms adapt to one another but the extent of co-adaptation commonly varies among pairs of the same symbiotic species drawn from different populations. Here we identify some ecological causes of such differences between populations. We analysed the extent of local co-adaptation between burying beetles Nicrophorus vespilloides and their phoretic mites Poecilochirus carabi in Gamlingay and Waresley Woods, in Cambridgeshire, UK. Burying beetles transport mites to small vertebrate carrion upon which they both reproduce. We conducted reciprocal transplant experiments to test for evidence of local co-adaptation during reproduction. We found variation in the extent of local co-adaptation that was explained by cryptic host specialisation within P. carabi mites. P. carabi is a species complex, within which races of mites are specialised to associate with different species of burying beetle. We found that N. vespilloides from Gamlingay Wood carries a mixture of mite races, from each of the four Nicrophorus species that inhabits this wood. This mixture of races makes P.carabi harmful to Gamlingay N. vespilloides: together, they reduce beetle reproductive success. Experimentally purifying mites, so that Gamlingay N. vespilloides is associated only with the vespilloides mite race, improves beetle reproductive success. Waresley N. vespilloides, by contrast, carry a near pure race of vespilloides mites, which cause negligible damage to Waresley N. vespilloides reproductive success. This is probably because Waresley Wood harbours only two burying beetle species, which differ markedly in their reproductive biology. Cryptic host specialisation with P. carabi mites, combined with differences in the Nicrophorus guild between Gamlingay and Waresley Woods, therefore explain population differences in the extent of local adaptation between N. vespilloides and P. carabi.",

Most of our understanding of spliced leader trans-splicing as it relates to operon gene expression comes from studies in C. elegans. In this organism, two distinct spliced leader trans-splicing events are recognised: SL1, which is used to replace the 5 ends of pre-mRNAs that have a nascent monomethyl guanosine cap; and SL2, which provides the 5 end to uncapped pre-mRNAs derived from polycistronic RNAs. Limited data on operons and spliced leader trans-splicing in other nematodes suggested that SL2-type trans-splicing is a relatively recent innovation, associated with increased efficiency of polycistronic processing, and confined to only one of the five major nematode clades, Clade V. We have conducted the first transcriptome-wide analysis of spliced leader trans-splicing in a nematode species, Trichinella spiralis, which belongs to a clade distantly related to Clade V. Our work identifies a set of T. spiralis SL2-type spliced leaders that are specifically used to process polycistronic RNAs, the first examples of specialised spliced leaders that have been found outside of Clade V. These T. spiralis spliced leader RNAs possess a perfectly conserved stem-loop motif previously shown to be essential for polycistronic RNA processing in C. elegans. We show that this motif is found in specific sets of spliced leader RNAs broadly distributed across the nematode phylum. This work substantially revises our understanding of the evolution of nematode spliced leader trans-splicing, showing that the machinery for SL2 trans-splicing evolved much earlier during nematode evolution than was previously appreciated, and has been conserved throughout the radiation of the nematode phylum.",

In this work, our goal was to identify genomic enhancers responsible for the regulation of genes implicated in the development of this brain region. From an initial collection of Vista elements showing specific enhancer activity in mouse hindbrain, we found an enhancer element located within the final intron of FOXP2, a gene expressed in cerebellum and implicated in vocal communication and speech and language disorders in humans. Analysis of this enhancer using various computational resources suggests that it is a strong candidate to account for FOXP2 expression during cerebellar development. Two blocks within this region are deeply conserved in vertebrates; they are separated by a microsatellite sequence present only in eutherian mammals, and expanded in human genomes.",

    "abstract": "Many cnidarians, including the reef-building corals, undergo symbiotic mutualisms with photosynthetic dinoflagellate algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae. These partnerships are sensitive to temperature extremes, which cause symbiont loss and increased coral mortality. Previous studies have implicated host immunity and specifically immunity transcription factor NF-{kappa}B as having a role in the maintenance of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Here we have further investigated a possible role for NF-{kappa}B in establishment and loss of symbiosis in various strains of the anemone Exaiptasia (Aiptasia) and in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results show that NF-{kappa}B expression is reduced in Aiptasia larvae and adults that host certain algae strains. Treatment of Aiptasia larvae with a known symbiosis-promoting cytokine, transforming growth factor {beta}, also led to decreased NF-{kappa}B expression. We also show that aposymbiotic Aiptasia (with high NF-{kappa}B expression) have increased survival following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens as compared to symbiotic Aiptasia (low NF-{kappa}B expression). Furthermore, a P. damicornis coral colony hosting Durusdinium spp. (formerly clade D) symbionts had higher basal NF-{kappa}B expression and decreased heat-induced bleaching as compared to two individuals hosting Cladocopium spp. (formerly clade C) symbionts. Lastly, genome-wide gene expression profiling and genomic promoter analysis identified putative NF-{kappa}B target genes that may be involved in thermal bleaching, symbiont maintenance, and/or immune protection in P. damicornis. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis that modulation of NF-{kappa}B and immunity plays a role in some, but perhaps not all, cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae partnerships as well as in resistance to pathogens and bleaching.",

    "abstract": "Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the most common method of functional magnetic resonance imaging for acquiring the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. One of the primary benefits of using EPI is that an entire volume of the brain can be acquired on the order of two seconds. However, this speed benefit comes with a cost. Because imaging protocols are limited by hardware (e.g., fast gradient switching), researchers are forced to compromise between spatial resolution, temporal resolution, or whole-brain coverage. Earlier attempts to circumvent this problem included developing protocols in which slices of a volume were acquired faster (i.e., slice (S) acceleration), while more recent protocols allow for multiple slices to be acquired simultaneously (i.e., multiband (MB) acceleration). However, applying such acceleration methods can lead to a reduction in the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), which is a critical measure of the stability of the signal over time. Here we show, in five healthy subjects, using a 20- and 64-channel receiver coil, that enabling S-acceleration consistently yielded, as expected, a substantial decrease in tSNR, regardless of the receiver coil employed, whereas tSNR decrease resulting from MB acceleration was less pronounced. Specifically, with the 20-channel coil, tSNR of upto 4-fold MB-acceleration is comparable to that of no acceleration, while up to 6-fold MB-acceleration with the 64-channel coil yields comparable tSNR to that of no acceleration. Moreover, observed tSNR losses tended to be localized to temporal, insular, and medial brain regions and were more noticeable in the 20-than in the 64-channel coil. Conversely, with the 64-channel coil, the tSNR in lateral frontoparietal regions remained relatively stable with increasing MB factors. Such methodological explorations can inform researchers and clinicians as to how they can optimize imaging protocols depending on the available hardware and the brain regions they want to investigate.",

    "abstract": "Sustained attention is defined as the ability to maintain attention over longer periods of time, which typically declines with time on task (i.e., the vigilance decrement). Previous studies have suggested an important role for the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in sustained attention. In two experiments, we aimed to enhance sustained attention by applying transcranial electrical current stimulation over the mPFC during a sustained attention task. In the first experiment, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a between-subject design (n=97): participants received either anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation. Contrary to our prediction, we found no effect of stimulation on the vigilance decrement. In the second experiment, participants received theta and alpha transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in two separate sessions (n=47, within-subject design). Here, we found a frequency-dependent effect on the vigilance decrement, such that contrary to our expectation, participants performance over time became worse after theta compared to alpha stimulation. However, this result needs to be interpreted with caution given that this effect could be driven by differential side effects between the two stimulation frequencies. To conclude, across two studies, we were not able to reduce the vigilant decrement using tDCS or theta tACS.",

    "abstract": "Securing food supply for a growing population is one of the current major challenges and heavily relies on the use of agrochemicals to maximize crop yield. Neonicotinoids are globally one of the most widely used insecticides. It is increasingly recognized, that neonicotinoids have a negative impact on non-target organisms, including important pollinators such as the European honey bee Apis mellifera. Toxicity of neonicotinoids may be enhanced through simultaneous exposure with additional pesticides, which could help explain, in part, the global decline of honey bee colonies. Here we examined whether exposure effects of the neonicotinoid Thiamethoxam are enhanced by the commonly used fungicide Carbendazim and the herbicide Glyphosate. For the first time, we also analysed alternative splicing changes upon pesticide exposure in the honey bee. In particular, we examined transcripts of three genes: i) the stress sensor gene X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1), ii) the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene and iii) the embryonic lethal/abnormal visual system (elav) gene, both important genes for neuronal function. Our results indicate that neonicotinoid toxicity applied at sub-lethal doses is not enhanced by Carbendazim nor Glyphosate. Likewise, toxicity of these compounds did not impact on the complex process of spliceosomal-directed joining of exons and non-spliceosomal intron excision in the analysed mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "A broad spectrum of human diseases are caused by mutations in the NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR). Cytochrome P450 proteins perform several reactions, including the metabolism of steroids, drugs, and other xenobiotics. In 2004 the first human patients with defects in POR were reported, and over 250 variations in POR are known. Information about the effects of POR variants on drug metabolizing enzymes is limited and has not received much attention. By analyzing the POR sequences from genomics databases, we identified potentially disease-causing variations and characterized these by in vitro functional studies using recombinant proteins. Proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified for activity assays. Activities of cytochrome P450 enzymes were tested in vitro using liposomes prepared with lipids into which P450 and P450 reductase proteins were embedded. Here we are reporting the effect of POR variants on drug metabolizing enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5 which are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs. POR Variants A115V, T142A, A281T, P284L, A287P, and Y607C inhibited activities of all P450 proteins tested. Interestingly, the POR variant Q153R showed a reduction of 20-50% activities with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 but had a 400% increased activity with CYP3A5. The A287P is most common POR mutation found in patients of European origin, and significantly inhibited drug metabolism activities which has important consequences for monitoring and treatment of patients. In vitro, functional assays using recombinant proteins provide a useful model for establishing the metabolic effect of genetic mutations. Our results indicate that detailed knowledge about POR variants is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment options for persons with POR deficiency and the role of changes in drug metabolism and toxicology due to variations in POR needs to be addressed.",

To understand how each histone variant is targeted to the genome, we developed a new method, in which epitope-tagged histone complexes are introduced into permeabilized cells and incorporated into their chromatin. We found that the incorporation of histones H2A and H2A.Z mainly occurred at less condensed chromatin (open), suggesting that the condensed chromatin (closed) is a barrier for histone incorporation. To overcome this barrier, H2A, but not H2A.Z, uses a replication-coupled deposition mechanism. This led to the recapitulation of the pre-existing chromatin structure: the genome-wide even distribution of H2A and the exclusion of H2A.Z from the closed chromatin. Intriguingly, an H2A.Z mutant with mutations in the developmentally essential region was incorporated into closed chromatin. Our study revealed that the combination of chromatin structure and DNA replication dictates the differential histone deposition for maintaining the epigenetic chromatin states.",

Each of these tools, however, comes with some limitations, mainly due to low processing speed and issues with handling large databases. Furthermore, the number of spectral data formats supported is typically limited, which also creates a threshold to adoption. We have therefore developed COSS (CompOmics Spectral Searching), a new and user-friendly spectral library search tool that relies on a probabilistic scoring function, and that includes decoy spectra generation for result validation. We have benchmarked COSS on three different spectral libraries and compared the results with established spectral search and sequence database search tools. Our comparison showed that COSS identifies more peptides, and is faster than other tools.

In this study, we assess the consistency of the impacts of semi-natural areas and host crop fields in the landscape on bioagressor abundance in cultivated fields. Our approach relied on the analysis of systematic French epidemiosurveillance data spanning 9 years of observations over two third of the French territory. 30 majors bioagressors of arable crops (wheat, barley, maize, potato, oilseed rape and sugar beet) were jointly studied with landscape composition as described by official CAP data and woody vegetation maps. Beyond the simple correlation between landscape composition and bioagressors abundance, we controlled for the presence of the host crop the former years in the plot and for bioagressors former prevalence. Our findings highlighted that landscape simplification around a same crop does not in general favor epidemic outbreaks during the current growing season, but rather that its harmful effect lie in the season ahead. The effects of semi-natural areas were, however, very contrasted between organisms. This study used available tools and data to quantify automatically in an interpretable way the general impact of landscape components. Such findings have relevant implications for the design of bioagressor management strategies at the landscape scale.\n\nResumeLe paysage agricole est reconnu comme une echelle pertinente pour la gestion des bioagresseurs, insectes arthropodes et maladies cryptogamiques.

Recent work on freezing tolerance and local adaptation in ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana from Sweden and Italy provides the essential foundation for uncovering the genotype-phenotype-fitness map for an adaptive response to a key environmental stress.\\n\\nMethodsHere we examine the consequences of a naturally occurring loss of function (LOF) mutation in an Italian allele of the gene that encodes the transcription factor CBF2, which underlies a major freezing tolerance locus. We used four lines with a Swedish genetic background, each containing a LOF CBF2 allele. Two lines had introgression segments containing of the Italian CBF2 allele, and two were created using CRISPR-Cas9. We used a growth chamber experiment to quantify freezing tolerance and gene expression both before and after cold acclimation.\\n\\nKey resultsFreezing tolerance was greater in the Swedish (72%) compared to the Italian (11%) ecotype, and all four experimental CBF2 LOF lines had reduced freezing tolerance compared to the Swedish ecotype. Differential expression analyses identified ten genes for which all CBF2 LOF lines and the IT ecotype showed similar patterns of reduced cold responsive expression compared to the SW ecotype.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified ten genes that are at least partially regulated by CBF2 that may contribute to the differences in cold acclimated freezing tolerance between the Italian and Swedish ecotypes. These results provide novel insight into the molecular and physiological mechanisms connecting a naturally occurring sequence polymorphism to an adaptive response to freezing conditions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding endogenous regulation of stress resistance and homeostasis maintenance is critical to developing neuroprotective therapies. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is a conserved essential enzyme that confers extraordinary protection and stress resistance in many neurodegenerative disease models. Drosophila Nmnat is alternatively spliced to two mRNA variants, RA and RB. RB translates to protein isoform PD with robust protective activity and is upregulated upon stress to confer enhanced neuroprotection. The mechanisms regulating alternative splicing and stress response of NMNAT remain unclear. We have discovered a Drosophila microRNA, dme-miR-1002, which promotes the splicing of NMNAT pre-mRNA to RB by disrupting a pre-mRNA stem-loop structure. While NMNAT pre-mRNA is preferentially spliced to RA in basal conditions, miR-1002 enhances NMNAT PD-mediated stress protection by binding via RISC component Argonaute1 to the pre-mRNA, facilitating the splicing switch to RB. These results outline a new process for microRNAs in regulating alternative splicing and modulating stress resistance.",

    "abstract": "While most ecological theories have historically invoked niche differences as the primary mechanism allowing species coexistence, we now know that species coexistence in competitive communities actually depends on the balance of two opposing forces: niche differences (ND) that determine how species limit their own growth rate versus that of their competitor, and relative fitness differences (RFD) that establish competitive hierarchies among species. Several different empirical methods have been proposed for measuring ND and RFD in order to make predictions about coexistence of species, yet it remains unclear which method(s) are appropriate for a given empirical study and whether or not those methods actually yield the same information. Here we summarize and compare five different empirical methods, with the aim of providing a practical guide for empiricists who want to predict coexistence among species. These include two phenomenological methods that estimate ND and RFD based on observing competitive interactions among species; two mechanistic methods that estimate ND and RFD based solely on information about species resource requirements; and a fifth method that does not yield ND and RFD but describes the impacts of those forces within communities. Based on the specific requirements, limitations, and assumptions of each approach, we offer a series of decision steps that can be used to determine which method(s) are best for a given study system. In particular, we show there are important tradeoffs between mechanistic methods, which require detailed understanding of species niches and physiology but are more tractable experimentally, and phenomenological methods which do not require this detailed information but can be impractical for some study designs. Importantly, we show that although each method can be used to estimate ND and RFD, the methods do not always yield the same values. Therefore we caution against future syntheses that compile these estimates from different empirical studies. Finally, we highlight several areas where modern coexistence theory could benefit from additional empirical work.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health threat, including in low TB incidence countries, through a combination of imported infection and onward transmission. Using data from the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Netherlands (NL) Tuberculosis Register, we developed a mathematical model of TB importation and transmission in low-incidence settings. We apply this method to compare the effective reproduction number for TB, the contribution of importation and the role of superspreaders in the UK and the NL. We estimate that on average, between 2010 and 2015, a TB case generated 0{middle dot}41(0{middle dot}30,0{middle dot}60) secondary cases in the UK, and 0{middle dot}24(0{middle dot}14,0{middle dot}48) secondary cases in the NL. A majority of cases did not generate any secondary cases. Recent transmission accounted for 26% (21%,36%) of UK cases and 19%(11%,31%) of NL cases. We predict that reducing UK transmission rates to those observed in NL would result in 538(266,818) fewer cases annually in the UK. This methodology reveals common transmission mechanisms across two low-incidence countries and can be applied to other settings. Control policies aimed at limiting spread have a role to play in eliminating TB in low incidence countries.",

    "abstract": "Network excitability is governed by synaptic efficacy, intrinsic excitability, and the circuitry in which these factors are expressed. The complex interplay between these factors determines how circuits function, and at the extreme, their susceptibility to seizure. We have developed a novel optogenetic intensity response procedure that provides a sensitive, quantitative estimate of network excitability. By combining optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampus with chronic multi-site recordings in peri-hippocampal structures of awake behaving mice, we induced abnormal network-wide epileptiform population discharges (PD) that were nearly indistinguishable from spontaneously occurring interictal spikes. By systematically varying light intensity, and therefore the magnitude of the optogenetically-mediated current, we generated intensity-response curves using the probability of PD as the dependent variable. This probability curve was well fit by a Boltzmann function, from which we calculated the intensity that produces a half-maximal probability of discharge (I50). This novel metric, the I50, is correlated with the optogenetic after-discharge threshold (oADT) in the same mice. Manipulations known to increase excitability, such as sub-convulsive doses (20 mg/kg) of the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), produced a leftward shift in the curve compared to baseline. The anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (40 mk/kg), in combination with PTZ, produced a rightward shift. Optogenetically-induced population discharge threshold (oPDT) baselines were stable over time, suggesting the metric is appropriate for within-subject experimental designs with multiple pharmacological manipulations. The oPDT is a sensitive measure of subconvulsive network excitability, with broad applicability to a number of areas of investigation.\n\nSignificance StatementNetwork excitability is carefully regulated by homeostatic mechanisms in the brain in order to maintain optimal functional conditions. Abnormal excitability is associated with a number of neurological disorders including epilepsy. Excitability can be measured in single cells in vitro, but it is difficult to extrapolate from these values to the functional impact on the network as a whole. Epileptiform discharges are network wide events that represent a distinct transition from normal to abnormal functional modes. We developed a new technique that uses light intensity-response curves to precisely determine the threshold for this transition as a surrogate measure of network excitability and seizure susceptibility.",
