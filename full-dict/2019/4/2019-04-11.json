    "abstract": "Adherent Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) is a non-diarrhoeagenic intestinal E. coli pathotype associated with Crohns Disease. AIEC pathogenesis is characterised by biofilm formation, adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells, and intracellular replication within epithelial cells and macrophages. Here, we identify and characterise a protein in the prototypical AIEC strain LF82 which is required for efficient biofilm formation and dispersal - LF82_p314. LF82 {Delta}LF82_314 have defective swimming and swarming motility, indicating LF82_p314 is important for flagellar-mediated motility, and thus surface colonisation and biofilm dispersal. Flagellar morphology and chemotaxis in liquid appear unaffected by deletion of LF82_314, suggesting LF82_p314 does not elicit an effect on flagella biogenesis or environmental sensing. Flagellar motility has been implicated in AIEC virulence, therefore we assessed the role of LF82_p314 in host colonisation using a Caenorhabditis elegans model. We found that LF82 {Delta}LF82_314 have an impaired ability to colonise the C. elegans compared to wild-type LF82. Phylogenetic analysis showed that LF82_314 is conserved in several major enterobacterial pathogens, and suggests the gene may have been acquired horizontally in several genera. Our data suggests LF82_p314 may be a novel component in the flagellar motility pathway and is a novel determinant of AIEC colonisation. Our findings have potential implications not only for the pathogenesis of Crohns Disease, but also for the course of infection in several major bacterial pathogens. We propose a new designation for LF82_314, biofilm coupled to motility A, or bcmA.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAdherent Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are a group of bacteria implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohns Disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with no cure. Critical to the process of many bacterial infections is the ability of bacteria to swim towards and colonise the host surface using specialised, propeller-like appendages called flagella. In this paper, we describe a novel protein - LF82_p314 (BcmA) - which is required for efficient flagella-mediated motility and surface colonisation in AIEC. Using a nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) infection model, we show that LF82_p314 enables effective colonisation of the C. elegans gut, suggesting a role for the protein during human infection. These findings indicate BcmA is significant for initial colonisation of the human gut by AIEC, and therefore the onset of Crohns Disease.",

    "abstract": "Tripartite motif-containing protein 5 (TRIM5) functions as a cellular antiviral restriction factor with exquisite specificity towards the capsid lattices of retroviruses. The relative avidity of TRIM5 binding to retrovirus capsids directly impacts primate species susceptibility to infection, but the antiviral role of TRIM5 is thought limited to retroviruses. In contrast to this current understanding, here we show that both human and rhesus TRIM5 possess potent antiviral function against specific flaviviruses through interaction with the viral protease (NS2B/3) to inhibit virus replication. Importantly, TRIM5 was essential for the antiviral function of IFN-I against sensitive flaviviruses in human cells. However, TRIM5 was ineffective against mosquito-borne flaviviruses (yellow fever, dengue, and Zika viruses) that establish transmission cycles in humans following emergence from non-human primates. Thus, TRIM5 is revealed to possess remarkable plasticity in recognition of diverse virus families, with potential to influence human susceptibility to emerging flaviviruses of global concern.",

    "abstract": "Neuropilin-1 plays important roles in axonal guidance in neurons, and in the growth of new blood vessels. There is also a growing appreciation for roles played by neuropilin-1 in the immune response. This molecule is important for the function of regulatory T cells, however roles in other T cell populations have not been identified. Here we show that neuropilin-1 is expressed during the peak of the antiviral CD8 T cell response during murine gammaherpesvirus infection. Using a conditional knockout model, we deleted Nrp1 either before infection, or after CD8 T cell memory had been established. We found deletion of Nrp1 skewed the acute CD8 T cell response toward a memory precursor-like phenotype, however the ensuing resting memory response was similar regardless of Nrp1 expression. Interestingly Nrp1 deletion had differing effects on the recall response depending on the timing of deletion. When deleted before infection, Nrp1 deficiency inhibited the secondary response. Deletion just prior to re-exposure to virus lead to an enhanced secondary response. Interestingly these effects were observed only in mice infected with a persistent strain of murine gammaherpesvirus, and not a non-persistent mutant strain. These data highlight a multifaceted role for neuropilin-1 in memory CD8 T cell differentiation, dependent upon the stage of the T cell response and characteristics of the infectious agent. Several therapeutic anti-cancer therapies focus on inhibition of Nrp1 to restrict tumor growth, so knowledge of how Nrp1 blockade may affect the CD8 T cell response will provide a better understanding of treatment consequences.\\n\\nImportanceCD8 T cell responses are critical to control both virus infections and tumors. The ability of these cells to persist for long periods of time can result in lifelong immunity, as relatively small populations of cell can expand rapidly to counter re-exposure to the same insult. Understanding the molecules necessary for this rapid secondary expansion is critical if we are to develop therapies that can provide lifelong protection. This report shows an important and complex role for the molecule neuropilin-1 in the secondary response. Several cancer therapies targeting neuropilin-1 are in development, and this work will lead to better understanding of the effect these therapies could have upon the protective CD8 T cell response.",

    "abstract": "Negativicutes are Gram-Negative bacteria characterized by two cell membranes, but they are phylogenetically a side-branch of Gram-Positive Firmicutes that contain only a single membrane. We asked whether viruses (phages) infecting Negativicutes were horizontally acquired from Gram-Negative Proteobacteria, given the shared outer cell structure of their bacterial hosts, or if Negativicute phages co-evolved vertically with their hosts and thus resemble Gram-Positive Firmicute prophages. We predicted and characterised 485 prophages from Gram-Negative Firmicute genomes plus 2,977 prophages from other bacterial clades, and we used virome sequence data from 183 human stool samples to provide independent evidence for our predictions. The majority of the identified Negativicute prophages were lambdoids closer related to prophages from other Firmicutes than Proteobacteria by sequence relationship and genome organization (position of the lysis module). Only a single Mu-like candidate prophage and no clear P2-like prophages were identified in Negativicutes, both commonly found in Proteobacteria. Therefore, it is unlikely that Negativicute phages were acquired from Proteobacteria. Sequence-related prophages were identified in two distinct Negativicute orders (Veillonellales and Acidaminococcales) possibly suggesting horizontal cross-order phage infection between human gut commensals. Phages infecting these Negativicute orders occasionally harboured putative antibiotic resistance genes.",

Their sulfur-oxidizing (SOX) symbionts were recently shown to encode abundant toxin-related genes (TRGs) in their genomes, which may play a role in beneficial host-microbe interactions. Here, we compared TRGs in the genomes of SOX symbionts from 10 bathymodioline mussel and two sponge species to better understand their potential functions and evolutionary origins. Despite the close phylogenetic relatedness of these symbionts, the number and classes of encoded toxins varied greatly between host species. One of the TRG classes, YDs, has experienced gene expansions multiple times, suggesting that these genes are under adaptive selection. Some symbiont genomes contained secretion systems, which can play a role in host-microbe interactions. Both TRGs and secretion systems had a heterogeneous distribution, suggesting that these closely related bacteria have acquired different molecular mechanisms for interacting with the same family of animal hosts, possibly through convergent evolution.",

To study the dynamics and heterogeneity of hematopoietic progenitor cells generated in vitro from hPSCs, we performed RNA sequencing of over 10000 CD235a-CD43+single cells. We identified the transcriptome of naive progenitors and those primed toward erythroid, megakaryocyte and leukocyte lineages, and revealed their markers by clustering, trajectory analyses and functional assays. CD44 marks naive clonogenic progenitors that express the transcription factor, LMO4 and can be expanded upon BMP4 stimulation.

    "abstract": "To attract pollinators many angiosperms secrete stigma exudate and nectar in their flowers. As these nutritious fluids are ideal infection points for pathogens, both secretions contain various antimicrobial compounds. Erwinia amylovora, the causing bacterium of the devastating fire blight apple disease, is the model pathogen that multiplies in flower secretions and infects through the nectaries. Although Erwinia resistant apples are not available, certain cultivars are tolerant. It was reported that in stigma infection assay, the  Freedom cultivar was Erwinia tolerant while the  Jonagold was susceptible. We hypothesized that differences in the nectar protein compositions lead to different susceptibility. Indeed we found that an acidic chitinase III protein (Machi3-1) selectively accumulates in the nectar and stigma of the  Freedom cultivar. We demonstrate that MYB binding site containing repeats of the  Freedom Machi3-1 promoter are responsible for the strong nectar- and stigma-specific expression. As we found that in vitro the Machi3-1 protein impairs growth and biofilm formation of Erwinia at physiological concentration, we propose that the Machi3-1 contribute to the tolerance by inhibiting Erwinia multiplication in the stigma exudate and in the nectar. We show that the Machi3-1 allele was introgressed from Malus floribunda 821 into different apple cultivars including the  Freedom.\\n\\nHighlightCertain apple cultivars accumulate to high levels in their nectar and stigma an acidic chitinase III protein that can protect against pathogens including fire blight disease causing Erwinia amylovora",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing technology can rapidly and directly interrogate native DNA molecules. Often we are interested only in interrogating specific areas at high depth, but conventional enrichment methods have thus far proved unsuitable for long reads1. Existing strategies are currently limited by high input DNA requirements, low yield, short (<5kb) reads, time-intensive protocols, and/or amplification or cloning (losing base modification information). In this paper, we describe a technique utilizing the ability of Cas9 to introduce cuts at specific locations and ligating nanopore sequencing adaptors directly to those sites, a method we term  nanopore Cas9 Targeted-Sequencing (nCATS).\\n\\nWe have demonstrated this using an Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cell (Capacity >10Gb+) to generate a median 165X coverage at 10 genomic loci with a median length of 18kb, representing a several hundred-fold improvement over the 2-3X coverage achieved without enrichment. We performed a pilot run on the smaller Flongle flow cell (Capacity ~1Gb), generating a median coverage of 30X at 11 genomic loci with a median length of 18kb. Using panels of guide RNAs, we show that the high coverage data from this method enables us to (1) profile DNA methylation patterns at cancer driver genes, (2) detect structural variations at known hot spots, and (3) survey for the presence of single nucleotide mutations. Together, this provides a low-cost method that can be applied even in low resource settings to directly examine cellular DNA. This technique has extensive clinical applications for assessing medically relevant genes and has the versatility to be a rapid and comprehensive diagnostic tool.

    "abstract": "Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens require a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) to deliver effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. Contact of the tip complex of the T3SS with a target eukaryotic cell initiates the secretion of the two bacterial proteins that assemble into the translocon pore in the plasma membrane. The translocon pore functions to regulate effector protein secretion and is the conduit for effector protein translocation across the plasma membrane. To generate insights into how the translocon pore regulates effector protein secretion, we defined the topology of the Shigella translocon pore protein IpaC in the plasma membrane following its native delivery by the T3SS. Using single-cysteine substitution mutagenesis and site-directed labeling with a membrane-impermeant chemical probe, we mapped residues accessible from the extracellular surface of the cell. Our data support a model in which the N-terminus of IpaC is extracellular and the C-terminus of IpaC is intracellular. These findings resolve previously conflicting data on IpaC topology that were based on non-native delivery of IpaC to membranes. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium also requires the T3SS for effector protein delivery into eukaryotic cells. Although the sequence of IpaC is closely related to the Salmonella translocon pore protein SipC, the two proteins have unique functional attributes during infection. We showed a similar overall topology for SipC and IpaC and identified subtle topological differences between their transmembrane -helixes and C-terminal regions. Together, our data suggest that topological differences among distinct translocon pore proteins may dictate organism-specific functional differences of the T3SSs during infection.\\n\\nImportanceThe type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is a nanomachine required for virulence of many bacterial pathogens that infect humans. The system delivers bacterial virulence proteins into the cytosol of human cells, where the virulence proteins promote bacterial infection. The T3SS forms a translocon pore in the membrane of target cells. This pore is the portal through which bacterial virulence proteins are delivered by the T3SS into the eukaryotic cytosol. The pore also regulates the secretion of these virulence proteins. Our work defines the topology of translocon pore proteins in their native context during infection, resolves previously conflicting reports about the topology of the Shigella translocon pore protein IpaC, and provides new insights into how interactions of the pore with the T3SS likely produce signals that activate secretion of virulence proteins.",

    "abstract": "The arsenal of drugs used to treat leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania spp., is limited and beset by toxicity and emergent resistance. Furthermore, our understanding of drug mode-of-action and potential routes to resistance is limited. Forward genetic approaches have revolutionised our understanding of drug mode-of-action in the related kinetoplastid parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. Therefore, we screened our genome-scale T. brucei RNAi library in the current anti-leishmanial drugs, sodium stibogluconate (antimonial), paromomycin, miltefosine and amphotericin-B. Identification of T. brucei orthologues of the known Leishmania antimonial and miltefosine plasma membrane transporters effectively validated our approach, while a cohort of 42 novel drug efficacy determinants provides new insights and serves as a resource. Follow-up analyses revealed the antimonial selectivity of the aquaglyceroporin, TbAQP3. A lysosomal major facilitator superfamily transporter contributes to paromomycin/aminoglycoside efficacy. The vesicle-associated membrane protein, TbVAMP7B, and a flippase contribute to amphotericin-B and miltefosine action, and are potential cross-resistance determinants. Finally, multiple phospholipid-transporting flippases, including the T. brucei orthologue of the Leishmania miltefosine transporter, a putative {beta}-subunit/CDC50 co-factor, and additional membrane-associated hits, affect amphotericin-B efficacy, providing new insights into mechanisms of drug uptake and action. The findings from this orthology-based chemogenomic profiling approach substantially advance our understanding of anti-leishmanial drug action and potential resistance mechanisms, and should facilitate the development of improved therapies, as well as surveillance for drug-resistant parasites.\\n\\nImportanceLeishmaniasis is a devastating disease caused by the Leishmania parasites and is endemic to a wide swathe of the tropics and sub-tropics.

Here, we tested the effect of a sustained organic loading alteration (food-to-biomass ratio, F:M, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, C:N) on activated sludge bioreactors, focusing on the stability of nitrification and nitrifiers. Two sets of replicate 5-liter sequencing batch reactors were operated at different, low and high, F:M (0.19-0.36 mgCOD/mgTSS/d) and C:N (3.5-6.3 mgCOD/mgTKN) conditions for a period of 74 days, following 53 days of sludge acclimation. Recovery and resilience were tested during the last 14 days by operating all reactors at low F:M and C:N (henceforth termed F:M-C:N). Stable nitrite accumulation (77%) was achieved through high F:M-C:N loading with a concurrent reduction in the abundance of Nitrospira. Subsequently, only two of the three reactors experiencing a switch back from high to low F:M-C:N recovered the nitrite oxidation function, with an increase in Nitrobacter as the predominant NOB, without a recovery of Nitrospira. The AOB community was more diverse, resistant and resilient than the NOB community. We showed that functional recovery and resilience can vary across replicate reactors, and that nitrification recovery need not coincide with a return to the initial nitrifying community structure.",

In this work, we have characterized the transcriptomic response of the anti-inflammatory, gut-colonizing Gram-positive probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri to both H2O2 and HOCl. L. reuteri mounts distinct responses to each of these stressors, and both gene expression and survival were strongly affected by the presence or absence of oxygen. Oxidative stress response in L. reuteri required several factors not found in enterobacteria, including the small heat shock protein Lo18, polyphosphate kinase 2, and RsiR, an L. reuteri-specific regulator of anti-inflammatory mechanisms. These results raise the intriguing possibility of developing treatments for inflammatory gut diseases that could sensitize pro-inflammatory enterobacteria to killing by the immune system while sparing anti-inflammatory, health-associated species.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEIt is becoming increasingly clear that effective treatment of inflammatory gut diseases will require modulation of the gut microbiota. Preventing pro-inflammatory bacteria from blooming while also preserving anti-inflammatory and commensal species is a considerable challenge, but our results suggest that it may be possible to take advantage of differences in the way different species of gut bacteria resist inflammatory oxidants to accomplish this goal.",

    "abstract": "Alternative ribosome subunit proteins are prevalent in the genomes of diverse bacterial species but their functional significance is controversial. Attempts to study microbial ribosomal heterogeneity have mostly relied on comparing wild-type strains with mutants in which subunits have been deleted, but this approach does not allow direct comparison of alternate ribosome isoforms isolated from identical cellular contexts. Here, by simultaneously purifying canonical and alternative RpsR ribosomes from Mycobacterium smegmatis, we show that alternative ribosomes have distinct translational features compared with their canonical counterparts. Both alternative and canonical ribosomes actively take part in gene translation, although they translate a subset of genes with differential efficiency as measured by ribosome profiling. We also show that alternative ribosomes have a relative defect in initiation complex formation. Our work convincingly confirms the distinct and non-redundant contribution of alternative bacterial ribosomes for adaptation to hostile environments.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany organisms, including most bacteria code for multiple paralogues of some ribosomal protein subunits. The relative contribution of these alternative subunits to ribosome function and gene translation is unknown and controversial. Furthermore, many studies on alternative ribosomes have been confounded by isolation of alternative and canonical ribosomes from different strains and/ or different growth conditions, potentially confounding results. Here, we show unequivocally that one form of alternative ribosome from Mycobacterium smegmatis actively engages in gene translation, but its translational profile from an identical cellular context is subtly different from canonical ribosomes. Given the prevalence of alternative ribosomal genes in diverse organisms, our study suggests that alternative ribosomes may represent a further layer of regulation of gene translation.",

    "abstract": "MotivationTranscription factors (TFs) can bind DNA in a cooperative manner, enabling a mutual increase in occupancy. Through this type of interaction, alternative binding sites can be preferentially bound in different tissues to regulate tissue-specific expression programmes. Recently, deep learning models have become state-of-the-art in various pattern analysis tasks, including applications in the field of genomics. We therefore investigate the application of convolutional neural network (CNN) models to the discovery of sequence features determining cooperative and differential TF binding across tissues.\n\nResultsWe analyse ChIP-seq data from MEIS, TFs which are broadly expressed across mouse branchial arches, and HOXA2, which is expressed in the second and more posterior branchial arches. By developing models predictive of MEIS differential binding in all three tissues we are able to accurately predict HOXA2 co-binding sites. We evaluate transfer-like and multitask approaches to regularising the high-dimensional classification task with a larger regression dataset, allowing for creation of deeper and more accurate models. We test the performance of perturbation and gradient-based attribution methods in identifying the HOXA2 sites from differential MEIS data. Our results show that deep regularised models significantly outperform shallow CNNs as well as k-mer methods in the discovery of tissue-specific sites bound in vivo.\n\nAvailabilityFor implementation and models please visit https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2635463.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is highly heritable, yet only a small fraction of its heritability has been attributed to specific genetic variants. These variants are traditionally ascertained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which utilize samples with tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals for whom a single summary measurement (e.g., BMI) is collected. An alternative approach is to focus on a smaller, more deeply characterized sample in conjunction with advanced statistical models that leverage detailed phenotypes. Here we use novel functional data analysis (FDA) techniques to capitalize on longitudinal growth information and construct a polygenic risk score (PRS) for obesity in children followed from birth to three years of age. This score, comprised of 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is significantly higher in children with (vs. without) rapid infant weight gain--a predictor of obesity later in life. Using two independent cohorts, we show that genetic variants identified in early childhood are also informative in older children and in adults, consistent with early childhood obesity being predictive of obesity later in life. In contrast, PRSs based on SNPs identified by adult obesity GWAS are not predictive of weight gain in our cohort of children. Our research provides an example of a successful application of FDA to GWAS. We demonstrate that a deep, statistically sophisticated characterization of a longitudinal phenotype can provide increased statistical power to studies with relatively small sample sizes. This study shows how FDA approaches can be used as an alternative to the traditional GWAS.\n\nAuthor SummaryFinding genetic variants that confer an increased risk of developing a particular disease has long been a focus of modern genetics. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have catalogued single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a variety of complex diseases in humans, including obesity, but by and large have done so using increasingly large samples-- tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals, whose phenotypes are thus often only superficially characterized. This, in turn, may hide the intricacies of the genetic influence on disease. GWAS findings are also usually study-population dependent. We found that genetic risk scores based on SNPs from large adult obesity studies are not predictive of the propensity to gain weight in very young children. However, using a small cohort of a few hundred children deeply characterized with growth trajectories between birth and two years, and leveraging such trajectories through novel functional data analysis (FDA) techniques, we were able to produce a strong childhood obesity genetic risk score.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are both positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses. They are packaged within the virion with a capsid (C) protein to form the nucleocapsid. Based on cryo-electron microscopy imaging, the nucleocapsid has been described as lacking symmetry, whilst there is distinguishable separation of the C proteins from the viral RNA (vRNA) genome. Here, to elucidate the architecture of the nucleocapsid of DENV serotype 2 and ZIKV, we used a nuclease digestion assay and next-generation sequencing to map the respective vRNA genome wide association with the C protein in vitro. The C protein exhibited non-uniform binding along the vRNA, and as C protein concentration increased, the normalized read counts also increased. A saturation point of 1:100 (vRNA:C protein monomers) was found, and binding regions showed variable saturation patterns. We also observed that C protein had a preference for G-rich sequences for both viruses. Taken together, we demonstrate that the DENV 2 and ZIKV C proteins bind vRNA in a non-uniform manner with distinct patterns of association.\\n\\nSingificance StatementOur study demonstrates that flavivirus capsid proteins associate with the viral genome at specific sites rather than in a uniform manner as commonly expected. We estimate the number of capsid proteins binding to a single genomic RNA. We proceed to locate the capsid binding sites along the viral genomes of Dengue and Zika viruses. We characterize the binding sites in terms of affinity and analyze the nucleotide composition and sequence motifs at binding sites. We cross-reference binding sites against SHAPE reactivity data corresponding to local RNA secondary structure, which allows us to identify structural motifs of capsid binding sites. As capsid proteins are essential for viral packaging, these interactions may form attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Adults with childhood-onset attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show altered whole-brain connectivity. However, the relationship between structural and functional brain abnormalities, the implications for the development of life-long debilitating symptoms, and the underlying mechanisms remain uncharted. We recruited a unique sample of 80 medication-naive adults with a clinical diagnosis of childhood-onset ADHD without psychiatric comorbidities, and 123 age-, sex-, and intelligence-matched healthy controls. Structural and functional connectivity matrices were derived from diffusion spectrum imaging and multi-echo resting-state functional MRI data. Hub, feeder, and local connections were defined using diffusion data. Individual-level measures of structural connectivity and structure-function coupling were used to contrast groups and link behavior to brain abnormalities. Computational modeling was used to test possible neural mechanisms underpinning observed group differences in the structure-function coupling. Structural connectivity did not significantly differ between groups but, relative to controls, ADHD showed a reduction in structure-function coupling in feeder connections linking hubs with peripheral regions. This abnormality involved connections linking fronto-parietal control systems with sensory networks. Crucially, lower structure-function coupling was associated with higher ADHD symptoms. Results from our computational model further suggest that the observed structure-function decoupling in ADHD is driven by heterogeneity in neural noise variability across brain regions. By highlighting a neural cause of a clinically meaningful breakdown in the structure-function relationship, our work provides novel information on the nature of chronic ADHD. The current results encourage future work assessing the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of neural noise in ADHD, particularly in brain regions encompassed by fronto-parietal systems.",

    "abstract": "Amino acid transport into the cell is often coupled to the proton electrochemical gradient, as found in the solute carrier (SLC) 36 family of proton coupled amino acid transporters (PATs). Although no structure of a human PAT exists, the crystal structure of a related homolog, GkApcT, from bacteria has recently been solved in an inward occluded state and allows an opportunity to examine how protons are coupled to amino acid transport. Our working hypothesis is that release of the amino acid substrate is facilitated by deprotonation of a key glutamate residue (E115), located at the bottom of the binding pocket and which forms part of the intracellular gate, allowing the protein to transition from an inward-occluded to an inward-open conformation. During unbiased molecular dynamics, we observed a transition from the inward-occluded state captured in the crystal structure, to a much more open state, which we consider likely to be representative of the inward-open substrate release state. To explore this and the role of protons in these transitions, we have used umbrella sampling to demonstrate that the transition from inward-occluded to inward-open is more energetically favourable when E115 is deprotonated. That E115 is likely to be protonated in the inward-occluded state and deprotonated in the inward-open state is further confirmed via the use of absolute binding free energies. Finally, we also show, via the use of absolute binding free energy calculations, that the affinity of the protein for alanine is very similar regardless of either the state or the protonation of E115, presumably reflecting key interactions deep within the binding cavity. Together, our results give a detailed picture of the role of protons in driving one of the major transitions in this transporter.\\n\\nSignificance StatementFor transporter proteins that utilize the proton gradient to drive the uptake of solutes, the precise mechanistic details of proton-coupling remain poorly understood. Structures can only infer the position of protons. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations however, are the ideal complementary tool. Here, we report extensive MD simulations on GkApcT, a proton-coupled transporter. We observe a spontaneous transition from the crystallographically derived inward-occluded state, to an inward-open state, which we then characterise with umbrella sampling and absolute binding free energy calculations. The results suggest that a conserved glutamate is protonated in the inward-occluded state and subsequent deprotonation of this glutamate allows the transporter to move into the inward-open state, thus facilitating substrate release into the cell.",

We also determined if LXB4/RvE1 treatments moderated the pro-inflammatory phenotype of tendon tear stromal cells. Incubation of IL-1{beta} treated patient derived tendon cells in LXB4/RvE1 upregulated concentrations of SPM. RvE1 treatment specifically increased 15-epi-LXB4 and regulated PGF2.

    "abstract": "Activation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO promoter is highly regulated, requiring the ordered recruitment of activators and coactivators and allowing production of only a few transcripts in mother cells within a short cell cycle window. We conducted genetic screens to identify the negative regulators of HO expression necessary to limit HO transcription. Known repressors of HO (Ash1 and Rpd3) were identified, as well as several additional chromatin-associated factors including the Hda1 histone deacetylase, the Isw2 chromatin remodeler, and the corepressor Tup1. We also identified clusters of HO promoter mutations that suggested roles for the Dot6/Tod6 (PAC site) and Ume6 repression pathways. We used ChIP assays with synchronized cells to validate the involvement of these factors and map the association of Ash1, Dot6, and Ume6 with the HO promoter to a brief window in the cell cycle between binding of the initial activating transcription factor and initiation of transcription. We found that Ash1 and Ume6 each recruit the Rpd3 histone deacetylase to HO, and their effects are additive. In contrast, Rpd3 was not recruited significantly to the PAC site, suggesting this site has a distinct mechanism for repression. Increases in HO expression and SWI/SNF recruitment were all additive upon loss of Ash1, Ume6, and PAC site factors, indicating the convergence of independent pathways for repression. Our results demonstrate that multiple protein complexes are important for limiting the spread of SWI/SNF mediated nucleosome eviction across the HO promoter, suggesting that regulation requires a delicate balance of activities that promote and repress transcription.",

While previous cross-sectional evidence has demonstrated increased stability and distinctiveness of the brain connectome during the course of childhood and adolescence, less is known regarding the longitudinal stability in middle and old age. Here we collected structural and resting state functional MRI data at two time-points separated by 2-3 years in 75 middle-aged and older adults (age 49-80, SD = {+/-} 6.91 years) which allowed us to assess the long-term stability of the functional connectome. We show that the connectome backbone generally remains stable over a 2-3 year time frame in middle- and old age. Independent of age, cortical volume was associated with the connectome stability of several canonical resting-state networks, suggesting that the connectome backbone relates to the structural integrity of the cortex. Moreover, individual longitudinal stability of subcortical and default mode networks were associated with differences in cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of episodic memory performance, supporting the functional relevance. The findings encourage the use of connectome stability analyses for understanding individual differences in cognitive aging. Furthermore, the observation that age-related changes in episodic memory performance relates to the stability of subcortical and default mode networks, provides new longitudinal evidence for the importance of these networks in maintaining mnemonic processing in old age.",

We found that TGF-{beta} alone was not sufficient to activate the TGF-{beta} pathway and to induce myofibroblast conversion in cells with high PPAR{gamma} expression. However, robust conversion was observed when an additional PPAR{gamma}-inhibiting stimulus, mechanical stress applied by increasing adhesion area on a stiff matrix, was applied simultaneously with TGF-{beta}. We show that the PPAR{gamma} downregulation in response to increased adhesion area required both fibronectin and a sufficiently stiff extracellular matrix (ECM) and was partially mediated by Rho. Our results show for the first time the order of the molecular processes driving fat tissue fibrosis and the requirement for signal convergence for the loss of adipocyte identity.",

We have carried out a 3D reconstruction of the switched-off form revealing for the first time multiple interactions between the tail and the two heads that trap ATP hydrolysis products, block actin binding, obstruct head phosphorylation, and prevent filament formation. Blocking these essential features of myosin function can explain the high degree of inhibition of the folded form of myosin, serving its energy-conserving, storage function in cells.

    "abstract": "Mutations in SPG11, leading to loss of spatacsin function, impair the formation of membrane tubules in lysosomes and cause the accumulation of lipids in lysosome compartment. However, the full nature of lipids accumulating in lysosomes and the physiological consequences of such accumulation are not known. Here we show that loss of spatacsin, but also downregulation of clathrin, inhibited the formation of tubules on late endosomes/lysosomes and prevented the clearance of cholesterol from this subcellular compartment. Using spatacsin-deficient cells, we evaluated the consequences of impaired cholesterol clearance from late endosomes/lysosomes. The accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes led to lower cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane, enhancing the entry of extracellular calcium by store-operated calcium entry and increasing resting cytosolic calcium levels. Higher cytosolic calcium levels promoted the nuclear translocation of the master regulator of lysosomes TFEB. Downregulation of TFEB or decrease in resting calcium levels in absence of spatacsin partially corrected the formation of tubules and the accumulation of cholesterol in lysosomes, suggesting that spatacsin could be indirectly implicated in the formation of tubules. Our work reveals a homeostatic balance between cholesterol trafficking and cytosolic calcium levels and shows that loss of spatacsin impairs this homeostatic equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Control of skeletal muscle fat metabolism is regulated acutely through Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) {delta} activation and its downstream intracellular targets. The purpose of this study was to determine whether fatty acids with high binding affinity for PPAR{delta} can elevate the expression of genes related to fatty acid oxidation and indicators of mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured human skeletal myotubes. Myotubes were treated for 72 hours with one of four conditions: (i) Control (CON); (ii) Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 250M); (iii) {gamma}-linolenic acid ({gamma}-LA 250M); (iv) PPAR{delta} Agonist (GW501516 10nM). Incubation with {gamma}-LA induced increases in the gene expression of CD36 (p= 0.005), HADHA (p= 0.022) and PDK4 (p=0.025) in comparison with CON, with no further differences observed between conditions. Furthermore, intensity of MitoTracker(R) Red immunostaining in myotubes increased following incubation with {gamma}-LA (p[&le;] 0.001) and EPA (p= 0.005) however these trends were not mirrored in the expression of PGC-1 as might be expected. Overall, {gamma}-LA elevates levels the transcription of key intracellular regulators of lipid metabolism and transport in human myotubes, which may be clinically beneficial in the control of metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The disruption of protein folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in an accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins and activates a network of signaling events collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). While UPR activation upon ER stress is well characterized, how other signaling pathways integrate into the ER proteostasis network is unclear. Here, we sought to investigate how the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) signaling cascade acts in parallel with the UPR to regulate ER stress sensitivity. Using S. cerevisiae, we found that TORC1 signaling is attenuated during ER stress and constitutive activation of TORC1 increases sensitivity to ER stressors such as tunicamycin and inositol deprivation. This phenotype is independent of the UPR. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TORC1 hyperactivation results in cell wall remodelling. Conversely, hyperactive TORC1 sensitizes cells to cell wall stressors, including the antifungal caspofungin. Elucidating the crosstalk between the UPR, cell wall integrity, and TORC1 signaling may uncover new paradigms through which the response to protein misfolding is regulated, and thus have crucial implications for the development of novel therapeutics against pathogenic fungal infections.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe prevalence of pathogenic fungal infections, coupled with the emergence of new fungal pathogens, has brought these diseases to the forefront of global health problems. While antifungal treatments have advanced over the last decade, patient outcomes have not substantially improved. These shortcomings are largely attributed to the evolutionary similarity between fungi and humans, which limits the scope of drug development. As such, there is a pressing need to understand the unique cellular mechanisms that govern fungal viability. Given that Saccharomyces cerevisiae is evolutionarily related to a number of pathogenic fungi, and in particular to the Candida species, most genes from S. cerevisiae are highly conserved in pathogenic fungal strains. Here we show that hyperactivation of TORC1 signaling sensitizes S. cerevisiae cells to both endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell wall stressors by compromising cell wall integrity. Therefore, targeting TORC1 signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways may be useful in developing novel targets for antifungal drugs.",

    "abstract": "Adherens junctions are a defining feature of all epithelial cells, providing cell-cell adhesion and being essential for cell and tissue morphology. In Drosophila, adherens junctions are concentrated between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains, but whether they contribute to apical-basal polarisation itself has been unclear. Here we show that, in the absence of adherens junctions, apical-basal polarity determinants can still segregate into complementary domains, but control of apical versus basolateral domain size is lost. Manipulation of the level of apical or basal polarity determinants in experiments and in computer simulations suggests that junctions provide a moveable diffusion barrier, or fence, that restricts the diffusion of polarity determinants to enable precise domain size control. Movement of adherens junctions in response to mechanical forces during morphogenetic change thus enables spontaneous adjustment of apical versus basolateral domain size as an emergent property of the polarising system.",

    "abstract": "Elevated cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with reduced dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA), but the impact of exercise training per se on dCA remains equivocal. In addition, resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and dCA after high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in individuals with already high CRF is unknown. We examined to what extent 6 weeks of HIIT affect resting CBF and dCA in cardiorespiratory fit men and explored if potential changes are intensity-dependent. Endurance-trained men were assigned to group HIIT85 (85% of maximal aerobic power, 1 to 7 min effort bouts, n = 8) and HIIT115 (115% of maximal aerobic power, 30 s to 1 min effort bouts, n = 9). Training sessions were completed until exhaustion 3 times/week over 6 weeks. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity (MCAvmean) were measured continuously at rest and during repeated squat-stands (0.05 and 0.10 Hz). Transfer function analysis (TFA) was used to characterize dCA on driven blood pressure oscillations during repeated squat-stands. Neither training nor intensity had an effect on resting MAP and MCAvmean (both P > 0.05). TFA phase during 0.10 Hz squat-stands decreased after HIIT irrespective of intensity (HIIT85: 0.77 {+/-} 0.22 vs. 0.67 {+/-} 0.18 radians; HIIT115: pre: 0.62 {+/-} 0.19 vs. post: 0.59 {+/-} 0.13 radians, time effect P = 0.048). These results suggest that HIIT over 6 weeks have no apparent benefits on resting CBF, but a subtle attenuation in dCA is seen posttraining irrespective of intensity training in endurance-trained men.\\n\\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYThe novel findings of this study are that 6 weeks of submaximal and supramaximal high-intensity interval exercise to exhaustion reduce dynamic cerebral autoregulation irrespective of training intensity in endurance-trained men. However, these HIIT protocols do not influence resting cerebral blood flow in these individuals. The results indicate the cerebrovasculature of endurance-trained men has an attenuated ability to react to large and rapid changes in blood pressure following HIIT.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the origin of human cognitive traits typically relies on comparing behavioral or neuroanatomical features in human phylogeny. However, such studies rely on inferences from comparative relationships and do not incorporate neurogenetic information, as these approaches are restricted to experimentally accessible species. Here, we fused evolutionary genomics with human functional neuroanatomy to reconstruct the neurogenetic evolution of human brain functions more directly and comprehensively. Projecting genome-wide selection pressure (dN/dS ratios) in sets of chronologically ordered mammalian species onto the human brain reference space unmasked spatial patterns of cumulative neurogenetic selection and co-evolving brain networks from task-evoked functional MRI and functional neuroanatomy. Importantly, this evolutionary atlas allowed imputing functional features to archaic brains from extinct hominin genomes. These data suggest accelerated neurogenetic selection for language and verbal communication across all hominin lineages. In addition, the predictions identified strategic thought and decision making as the dominant traits that may have separated anatomically modern humans (AMH) from archaic hominins.",

However, genome-wide association (GWA) analyses in biobank samples such as the UK Biobank (UKB) often exceed the capability of most existing MLM-based tools especially if the number of traits is large. Here, we developed an MLM-based tool (called fastGWA) that controls for population stratification by principal components and relatedness by a sparse genetic relationship matrix for GWA analyses of biobank-scale data. We demonstrated by extensive simulations that fastGWA is reliable, robust and highly resource-efficient. We then applied fastGWA to 2,173 traits on 456,422 array-genotyped and imputed individuals and 2,048 traits on 46,191 whole-exome-sequenced individuals in the UKB.",

In Argentina, broad bean production was of 1,841 hectares and 16,500 tons during the 2017 growing season. Broad bean is commonly used in rotations; especially by farmers located in \\\"green belts\\\" that are peri-urban areas surrounding large cities that include horticultural family farms. Plants showing marked foliar mosaic symptoms, typical of viral infection, were collected during the 2015 growing season in the green belt of Cordoba city, Argentina. Preparations of symptomatic tissues were mechanically inoculated onto healthy broad bean plants in the greenhouse, which developed symptoms similar to those observed in the field. In addition, symptomatic samples were positive when tested by indirect ELISA with the anti-potyvirus group monoclonal antibody. Further, flexuous filamentous particles typical of potyviruses were observed under the electronic microscope on dip preparations. Lastly, total RNA was extracted from a symptomatic leaf and high-throughput sequenced, which allowed the assembly of a single virus sequence corresponding to a new highly divergent strain of Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV). Phylogenetic insights clustered this Argentinean broad bean isolate (BYMV-ARGbb) within group IX of BYMV. Given the economical importance of this virus and its associated disease, the results presented here are a pivotal first step oriented to explore the eventual incidence and epidemiological parameters of BYMV in broad bean in Argentina.",

    "abstract": "The concept of interdisciplinarity lacks theoretical understanding, and consequently, the number of indicators for interdisciplinarity is booming: out of field citations, betweenness centrality, or the set coherence, diversity, mediation, to mention a few. However, these indicators focus on characteristics of papers and journals, without referring clearly to the processes of knowledge production, communication and stabilization. Without understanding of the nature of interdisciplinarity and its various forms, the choice of indicators seems rather arbitrary. In this paper we argue that interdisciplinarity is one of the forms of development of research fields. We will show that interdisciplinarity is a temporary phase in knowledge dynamics. New fields emerge at the boundaries of existing fields as multidisciplinary research activities, and either develop through an interdisciplinary phase into a  new discipline, or remain multidisciplinary for a while and generally disappear.\\n\\nWe use the analysis of journal-journal citation relations to map the identity and development of disciplinary, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research fields. A comparison results in three types of identities: (1) disciplinary fields, (2) interdisciplinarity as a developmental phase from multidisciplinary to disciplinary fields, and (3) unstable temporal multidisciplinary research topics at the boundaries between research fields. We conclude that the main difference between a mature interdisciplinary field and  normal disciplinary fields is that the former is newer than the latter. We propose to focus on change in the research landscape, instead of on indicators for what is only one (early or long term unstable) stage of interdisciplinarity. The mapping approach can be used to identify the nature of cognitive change in general, such as the emergence, growth, differentiation, merger, and decline of research fields.",

In social insect colonies the concepts of integration and modularity apply to sets of traits both within and among functionally and phenotypically differentiated castes. On macroevolutionary timescales, patterns of integration and modularity within and across castes can be clues to the selective and ecological factors shaping their evolution and diversification. We develop a set of hypotheses describing contrasting patterns of worker integration and apply this framework in a broad (246 species) comparative analysis of major and minor worker evolution in the hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole. Using geometric morphometrics in a phylogenetic framework, we inferred fast and tightly integrated evolution of mesosoma shape between major and minor workers, but slower and more independent evolution of head shape between the two worker castes. Thus, Pheidole workers are evolving as a mixture of intra- and inter-caste integration and rate heterogeneity. The decoupling of homologous traits across worker castes may represent an important process facilitating the rise of social complexity.",

The Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm offers a way to measure the effects of classically conditioned stimuli on behavior. In the current study, a novel PIT paradigm was developed for use in conjunction with an fMRI classical conditioning task. This could allow for a measurement of BOLD responses to anticipated rewards, unconfounded by operant responses, while providing a behavioral measure of conditioning effects. Twenty-four healthy young adults completed 1) instrumental training, 2) Pavlovian conditioning, and 3) Transfer test. During instrumental training, participants learned to apply force on a handgrip to win money from slot machines pictured on a computer screen. During Pavlovian conditioning, slot machines appeared with one of two abstract symbols (cues), one symbol was predictive of monetary reward. During the Transfer test, participants again applied force on a handgrip to win more money. This time, slot machines were presented with the Pavlovian cues, but with the outcomes hidden. The results indicated increased effort on the instrumental task, i.e., higher response frequency and greater force, in the presence of a reward-predicting cue. Our findings add to a growing number of studies demonstrating PIT effects in humans.

Non displaceable binding potential (BPND) was quantified using the simplified reference tissue model. Quetiapine dosing was associated with decrease in [11C]raclopride BPND in temporal cortex (18{+/-}17% occupancy) and thalamus (20{+/-}17%), but not in frontal cortex. Extrastriatal occupancy was lower than in putamen (51{+/-}4%). The mean absolute variation was 4-7% in the striatal regions, 17% in thalamus, and 13-59% in cortical regions. Our data indicate that [11C]raclopride PET is not a suitable tool for D2/3R binding quantification in extrastriatal regions.",

Pathology affects neuronal populations that are anatomically connected although the contribution of neuronal connectivity remains to be quantitatively explored. Herein, we simulate the contribution of the connectome alone to the spread of arbitrary aggregates using a computational model of temporal spread within an abstract representation of the mouse mesoscale connectome. Our simulations are compared with the neuron-to-neuron spread of alpha-synuclein that has been observed with in vivo spreading experiments in rats. We find that neuronal connectivity appears to be compatible with the spreading pattern of alpha-synuclein pathology however, it may be per se insufficient to determine the anatomical pattern of protein spreading observed in experimental animals, suggesting a role of selective vulnerability of neuronal pathways to alpha-synuclein diffusion, accumulation and pathology.\\n\\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Memorizing encountered objects is fundamental for normal life, but the underlying natural brain activity remains poorly understood. The hypothalamus is historically implicated in memory disorders, but whether and how its endogenous real-time activity affects object memorization remains unknown. We found that upon self-initiated object encounters, hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons emit dynamic, object-encounter-associated signals encoding object novelty. Optosilencing of these signals, performed in closed-loop with object encounters selectively during object memory acquisition, prevented the ability to recognize the previously encountered objects. Optogenetic and chemogenetic connectivity analyses demonstrated that local GAD65 neurons form an inhibitory GAD65[-&gt;]MCH microcircuit that controls the object-encounter-associated MCH cell signals. GAD65 cell optosilencing during object memory acquisition enhanced future object recognition through MCH-receptor-dependent pathways. These results provide causal evidence that natural, object-associated signals in genetically-distinct but interacting hypothalamic neurons differentially control whether the brain forms object memories.",

Here, we provide evidence that their three-dimensional geometry is governed by microtubule alignment along mechanical stress patterns in internal walls. Depending on the primary shape of the primordium, this process has the potential to amplify an initial degree of flatness, or promote the formation of nearly axisymmetric, mostly elongating organs, such as stems and roots.

Although nucleoside analogues are generally known to function by inhibiting DNA synthesis in rapidly proliferating cells, the identity of their in vivo targets and mechanism of action are often not known in molecular detail. Here we provide a structural basis for inhibition by arabinose nucleotides of human primase, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for initiation of DNA synthesis in DNA replication.

    "abstract": "Competition between microbes is extremely common, with many investing in a wide range of mechanisms to harm other strains and species. Yet positive interactions between species have also been documented. What makes species help or harm each other is currently unclear. Here, we studied the interactions between four bacterial species capable of degrading Metal-Working Fluids (MWF), an industrial coolant and lubricant, which contains growth substrates as well as toxic biocides. We were surprised to find only positive or neutral interactions between the four species. Using mathematical modeling and further experiments, we show that positive interactions in this community are likely due to the toxicity of MWF, whereby each species detoxification benefited the others by facilitating their survival, such that they could grow and degrade MWF better when together. The addition of nutrients, the reduction of toxicity or the addition of more species instead resulted in competitive behavior. Our work provides support to the stress gradient hypothesis by showing how harsh, toxic environments can strongly favor facilitation between microbial species and mask underlying competitive interactions.",

I present a simulation model to examine the potential evolutionary trajectories of EA under current selective pressure in western populations. With the assumption that EA is negatively correlated with fitness and has both a genetic component and a cultural component, I show that when prestige-biased transmission of the EA (i.e. people with more education are more likely to be copied) is present, the phenotype of EA is likely to keep increasing in the short term, yet the genetic component of EA may be undergoing a constant decline and eventually lead to an overall decrease in the phenotype.\\n\\nSignificance statementContemporary humans live in very different environments from our ancestors and are subject to very different selective forces. The future evolutionary trajectory of current human populations is thus of both intellectual and pragmatic importance. The present simulation model sheds light on the short-term evolutionary dynamics of educational attainment, and demonstrates the significant contribution of systematically transmitted human culture in shaping the evolutionary paths and producing non-intuitive evolutionary outcomes.",

RICOPILI, an open sourced Perl-based pipeline was developed to address the challenges of rapidly processing large scale multi-cohort GWAS studies including quality control, imputation and downstream analyses. The pipeline is computationally efficient with portability to a wide range of high-performance computing (HPC) environments.\\n\\nSummaryRICOPILI was created as the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) pipeline for GWAS and has been adopted by other users. The pipeline features i) technical and genomic quality control in case-control and trio cohorts ii) genome-wide phasing and imputation iv) association analysis v) meta-analysis vi) polygenic risk scoring and vii) replication analysis. Notably, a major differentiator from other GWAS pipelines, RICOPILI leverages on automated parallelization and cluster job management approaches for rapid production of imputed genome-wide data. A comprehensive meta-analysis of simulated GWAS data has been incorporated demonstrating each step of the pipeline. This includes all of the associated visualization plots, to allow ease of data interpretation and manuscript preparation. Simulated GWAS datasets are also packaged with the pipeline for user training tutorials and developer work.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationRICOPILI has a flexible architecture to allow for ongoing development and incorporation of newer available algorithms and is adaptable to various HPC environments (QSUB, BSUB, SLURM and others).

    "abstract": "Most known cancer driver mutations are within protein coding regions of the genome, however, there are several important examples of oncogenic non-coding regulatory mutations. We developed a method to identify insertions and deletions (indels) in regulatory regions using aligned reads from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) or the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq). Our method, which we call BreakCA for Breaks in Chromatin Accessible regions, allows non-coding indels to be discovered in the absence of whole genome sequencing data, out-performs popular variant callers such as the GATK-HaplotypeCaller and VarScan2, and detects known oncogenic regulatory mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. We apply BreakCA to identify indels in H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in 23 neuroblastoma cell lines and, after removing common germline variants, we identify 23 rare germline or somatic indels that occur in multiple neuroblastoma cell lines. Among them, 4 indels are candidate oncogenic drivers that are present in 4 or 5 cell lines, absent from the genome aggregation database of over 15,000 whole genome sequences, and within the promoters or first introns of known genes (PHF21A, ADAMTS19, GPR85 and RALGDS). In addition, we observe a rare 7bp germline deletion in two cell lines, which is associated with high expression of the histone demethylase KDM5B. Overexpression of KDM5B is prognostic for many cancers and further characterization of this indel as a potential oncogenic risk factor is therefore warranted.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac regeneration and stem cell therapies depend critically on the ability to locally resolve the contractile properties of heart tissue1,2. Current regeneration approaches explore the growth of cardiac tissue in vitro and the injection of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes3-6 (CMs) but scientists struggle with low engraftment rates and marginal mechanical improvements, leaving the estimated 26 million patients suffering from heart failure worldwide without effective therapy7-9. One impediment to further progress is the limited ability to functionally monitor injected cells as currently available techniques and probes lack speed and sensitivity as well as single cell specificity. Here, we introduce microscopic whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasers into beating cardiomyocytes to realize all-optical recording of transient cardiac contraction profiles with cellular resolution. The brilliant emission and high spectral sensitivity of microlasers to local changes in refractive index enable long-term tracking of individual cardiac cells, monitoring of drug administration, and accurate measurements of organ scale contractility in live zebrafish. Our study reveals changes in sarcomeric protein density as underlying factor to cardiac contraction which is of fundamental importance for understanding the mechano-biology of cardiac muscle activation. The ability to non-invasively assess functional properties of transplanted cells and engineered cardiac tissue will stimulate the development of novel translational approaches and the in vivo monitoring of physiological parameters more broadly. Likewise, the use of implanted microlasers as cardiac sensors is poised to inspire the adaptation of the most advanced optical tools known to the microresonator community, like quantum-enhanced single-molecule biosensing or frequency comb spectroscopy10.",

There is also a gap in life-expectancy between males and females. DNA methylation differences have been shown to be associated with both age and sex. Here, we investigate age-by-sex differences in DNA methylation in an unrelated cohort of 2,586 individuals between the ages of 18 and 87 years.\\n\\nMethodsGenome-wide DNA methylation was measured on the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC beadchip in a subset of unrelated individuals from the Generation Scotland cohort. Mixed linear model-based analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and an interaction term between age and sex, as well as chronological age.\\n\\nResultsAt a genome-wide significance level of P < 3.6 x 10-8, 14 loci were associated with the age-by-sex interaction term, the majority of which were X-linked (n = 12). Seven of these loci were annotated to genes. The site with the greatest difference mapped to GAGE10, an X-linked gene. Here, DNA methylation levels remained stable across the male adult age range (DNA methylation x age r = 0.02), but decreased across female adult age range (DNA methylation x age r = -0.61). The seven age-by-sex-associated genes were enriched among differentially-expressed genes in lung, liver, testis and blood.\\n\\nConclusionThe majority of differences in age-associated DNA methylation trajectories between sexes are present on the X-chromosome.

    "abstract": "Determination of blue carbon sequestration in seagrass sediments over climatic time scales relies on several assumptions, such as no loss of particulate organic carbon (POC) after one or two years, tight coupling between POC loss and CO2 emissions, no dissolution of carbonates and removal of the stable black carbon (BC) contribution. We tested these assumptions via 500-day anoxic decomposition/mineralisation experiments to capture centennial parameter decay dynamics from two sediment horizons robustly dated as 2 and 18 years old. No loss of BC was detected, and decay of POC was best described for both horizons by near-identical reactivity continuum models. The models predicted average losses of 49% and 51% after 100 years of burial and 20-22 cm horizons, respectively. However, the loss rate of POC was far greater than the release rate of CO2, both before and after accounting for CO2 from anoxic particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) production, possibly as siderite. The deficit could not be attributed to dissolved organic carbon or dark CO2 fixation. Instead, evidence based on {delta}13CO2, acidity and lack of sulphate reduction suggested methanogenesis. The results indicate the importance of centennial losses of POC and PIC precipitation and possibly methanogenesis in estimating carbon sequestration rates.",

Here, we describe Macromolecular Analysis Toolkit (MAT) that parses .pdb, .mmcif and .mmtf files; and builds data structures from the input. This original program is written in C++ programming language to ensure efficiency and consistency to organize structural information in an integral way. The novelty of the program lies in the addition of new structure-based biological algorithms and applications. This package also stands out from other similar libraries by being 1) faster and 2) accurate. We also provide detailed comparison of available parsers on the whole PDB database. The parser of MAT is designed in such a way that it allows quick extraction and organized loading of the core data structure. The same data structure is extended to accommodate information from the .mmcif and .mmtf file parsers. Tokenization of the data allows the extraction of information from disordered text, making it compatible for accurate identification of the entities present in the .pdb file. Additionally, we add a new approach of performance optimization by creating a few derived data structures, namely kD-Tree, Octree and graphs, for certain applications that need spatial coordinate calculations. MAT provides advanced data structure which is time efficient and is designed to avail reusability and consistency in a systematic framework.

In order to understand the biological importance of CMT2-casuative genes, we have studied the behavioural, cellular and molecular consequences of mutating nine different genes associated with CMT2 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (lin-41/TRIM2, dyn-1/DMN2, unc-116/KIF5A, fzo-1/MFN2, osm-9/TRPV4, cua-1/ATP7A, hsp-25/HSPB1, hint-1/HINT1, nep-2/MME). We show that C. elegans defective for these genes display debilitated movement in crawling and swimming assays. Severe morphological defects in cholinergic motors neurons are also evident in two of the mutants (dyn-1 and unc-116). Furthermore, we establish novel methods for quantifying muscle morphology and use these to demonstrate striking loss of muscle structure across the mutants that correspond with reductions in muscle function. Finally, using electrophysiological recordings of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) activity, we uncover reductions in spontaneous postsynaptic current frequency in lin-41, dyn-1, unc-116 and fzo-1 mutants. By comparing the consequences of mutating numerous CMT2-related genes, this study reveals common deficits in muscle structure and function, as well as NMJ signalling when these genes are disrupted.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress creates an allostatic overload that may lead to mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. Modern causes of chronic stress in humans are mostly social in nature, relating to work and relationship stress. Research into neural and molecular mechanisms of vulnerability and resilience following chronic social stress (CSS) is ongoing and uses animal models to discover efficient prevention strategies and treatments. To date, most CSS studies have neglected the female sex and used male-focused aggression-based animal models such as chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Accumulating evidence on sex differences suggests differences in the stress response, the prevalence of stress-related illness and the treatment response, indicating that researchers should expand CSS investigation to include female-focused protocols alongside the popular CSDS protocols. Here, we describe a novel female mouse model of CSS and a parallel modified male mouse model of CSDS in C57BL/6 mice. These new models enable the investigation of vulnerability, coping and downstream effectors mediating long-term consequences of CSS in both sexes. Our data demonstrate sex differences during CSS and for many weeks following CSS. Female mice are more prone to body weight loss during CSS and hyperactive anxious behavior following CSS. Both sexes show disturbances in social interaction, but only stressed male mice show long-term changes in neuroendocrine function and memory performance after fear conditioning. We discuss future avenues of research using these models to investigate mechanisms pertaining to sensitivity to CSS as well as treatment response profiles, in a sex-suitable manner.",

Action representations remained largely stable during exploration, but there was an abrupt, coordinated and differential change in the representation of rewarded and nonrewarded levers by ACC neurons at the point where the rat realized which lever was rewarded and began to exploit it.

    "abstract": "Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria are less proficient in homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). All existing genomic editing methods for Escherichia coli rely on exogenous HR or NHEJ systems to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Although an E. coli native end-joining (ENEJ) system has been reported, its potential in chromosomal engineering has not yet been explored. Here, we present a CRISPR-Cas9-assisted native end-joining editing and show that ENEJ-dependent DNA repair can be used to conduct rapid and efficient knocking-out of E. coli genomic sequence of up to 83 kb. Moreover, the positive rate and editing efficiency is independent of high-efficiency competent cells. The method requires neither exogenous DNA repair systems nor introduced editing template. The Cas9 complex is the only foreign element in this method. This study is the first successful engineering effort to utilize ENEJ mechanism in genomic editing and provides an effective strategy for genetic engineering in bacteria that are inefficient in HR and NHEJ.\\n\\nSignificanceThe application in prokaryotes is difficult because of the weak homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining systems. E. coli, as the most-used prokaryote in metabolic engineering, has no NHEJ system. All existing genomic editing methods for E. coli rely on exogenous HR or NHEJ systems to repair double-strand breaks introduced by CRISPR/Cas9. In this report, we firstly demonstrate that the weak and previously ignored end-joining mechanism in E. coli can be used for efficient large-scale genetic engineering assisted by CRISPR/Cas9. Our efforts greatly simplify the genomic editing procedure of E. coli and provide an effective strategy for genetic engineering in bacteria that are inefficient in HR and NHEJ.",

Autophagy receptors, including p62, target invading intracellular pathogens to the autophagy pathway for degradation. Staphylococcus aureus is a significant pathogen of humans and often life-threatening in the immunocompromised. Increasing evidence demonstrates that S. aureus is an intracellular pathogen of immune cells and may use neutrophils as proliferative niche but the intracellular fate of S. aureus following phagocytosis by neutrophils has not previously been analysed in vivo. In vitro, p62 is able to co-localise with intracellular Staphylococcus aureus, but whether p62 is beneficial or detrimental in host defence against S. aureus in vivo had not been determined.\n\nHere we use zebrafish to determine the fate and location of S. aureus within neutrophils throughout infection. We show that Lc3 and p62 recruitment to phagocytosed S. aureus is altered depending on the bacterial location within the neutrophil. We also show rapid Lc3 marking of bacterial phagosomes within neutrophils which may be associated with subsequent bacterial degradation. Finally, we find that p62 is important for controlling cytosolic bacteria demonstrating for the first time a key role of p62 in autophagic control of S. aureus in neutrophils.",

    "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a commonly used agent for induction of neuroinflammation in preclinical studies. Upon injection, LPS causes activation of microglia and astrocytes, whose metabolism alters to favor glycolysis. Assessing in vivo neuroinflammation and its modulation following therapy remains challenging, and new non-invasive methods allowing for longitudinal monitoring would be greatly valuable. Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a promising technique for assessing in vivo metabolism. In addition to applications in oncology, the most commonly used probe of [1-13C] pyruvate has shown potential in assessing neuroinflammation-linked metabolism in mouse models of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Here, we wished to investigate LPS-induced neuroinflammatory changes using HP [1-13C] pyruvate and HP 13C urea.\\n\\n2D chemical shift imaging following simultaneous intravenous injection of HP [1-13C] pyruvate and HP 13C urea was performed at baseline (day 0), day 3 and day 7 post intracranial injection of LPS (n=6) or saline (n=5). Immunofluorescence (IF) analyses were performed for Iba1 (resting and activated microglia/macrophages), GFAP (resting and reactive astrocytes) and CD68 (activated microglia/macrophages).\\n\\nA significant increase in HP [1-13C] lactate production was observed in the injected (ipsilateral) side at 3 and 7 days of the LPS-treated mouse brain, but not in either the contralateral side or saline-injected animals. HP 13C lactate/pyruvate ratio, without and with normalization to urea, was also significantly increased in the ipsilateral LPS-injected brain at 7 days compared to baseline. IF analyses showed a significant increase in CD68 and GFAP at 3 days, followed by increased numbers of Iba1 and GFAP positive cells at 7 days post-LPS injection.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we can detect LPS-induced changes in the mouse brain using HP 13C MRS, in alignment with increased numbers of microglia/macrophages and astrocytes. This study demonstrates that HP 13C spectroscopy holds much potential for providing non-invasive information on neuroinflammation.",

The current study addressed the effect of training on ERP components related to and independent of attentional feature selection. Participants learned to categorize cartoon animals over six training sessions (8,800 trials) after which ERPs were recorded during a target detection task performed on trained and untrained stimulus sets. The onset of the selection negativity, an ERP component indexing attentional modulation, was about 60 ms earlier for trained than untrained stimuli. Trained stimuli also elicited centro-parietal N200 and N320 components that were insensitive to attentional feature selection. The scalp distribution and timecourse of these components were better matched by studies of orthography than object expertise. Source localization using eLORETA suggested that the strongest neural sources of the selection negativity were in right ventral temporal cortex whereas the strongest sources of the N200/N320 components were in left ventral temporal cortex, again consistent with the hypothesis that training recruited orthography related areas. Overall, training altered neural processes related to attentional selection, but also affected neural processes that were independent of feature selection.",

Although some ecological and biological characteristics of this predator have been studied, the only molecular data for the ladybird beetle at the NCBI website has been submitted by us. To yield gene sequences of the ladybird beetle, paired-end sequencing was used to sequence its transcriptome. Real-time PCR was used to validate differences in the quantity of RNA expressed by the Krueppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) gene in summer versus winter samples. To find the effective molecular barcode, the annotated cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COX1) gene fragments were amplified from several ladybird beetle populations. Analysis yielded 191,246 assembled unigenes, of which 127,016 (66.4%) were annotated. The differential expression of Kr-h1 in summer versus winter suggests that S. japonicum can successfully overwinter because the adults enter diapause. The annotated COX1 gene can be used to distinguish S. japonicum from other ladybird species. These gene sequences are currently available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and will facilitate the study of molecular mechanism in S. japonicum.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are major risk factors for obesity. However, the mechanisms accounting for this susceptibility remain unclear. Animal models have proved to be useful tools for understanding the role of emotional functioning in the development and maintenance of metabolic alterations implicated in obesity. Here we sought to determine the predictive value of behavioral indices of anxiety for hormonal and metabolic imbalances in rats. Adult Lewis rats were screened on the elevated plus maze (EPM). K-means clustering was used to divide the rats into two groups based on their anxiety index in the EPM: low (LA) and high anxiety (HA) rats. This proxy of anxiety combines individual EPM parameters and accepted ratios into a single score. Four weeks later, we measured markers of endocrine and metabolic function. We found that relative LA rats, the HA rats exhibited reduced latencies to exit a modified light-dark conflict test. Our results show that the HA rats displayed increased corticosterone levels when compared to LA rats. Furthermore, the HA rats weighted more and exhibited an enhanced glycemic response to exogenously administered glucose during the glucose tolerance test, indicating glucose intolerance. Notably, when compared to LA rats, the HA rats showed higher circulating levels of the endogenous cannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG). Together, these data indicate that patterns of emotional reactivity associated with anxiety may share common pathological pathways with metabolic complications implicated in obesity. Uncovering metabolic risk factors for anxiety disorders have the potential to strongly impact how we treat mental illnesses.\\n\\nObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that indices of anxiety in the elevated plus maze have predictive value for alterations implicated in obesity, which include heightened emotional reactivity, and dysregulated corticosterone, glucose metabolism, and circulating endocannabinoid levels.",

Lake Baikal is the worlds most ancient, deep, voluminous, and biodiverse lake, holding 20 percent of unfrozen fresh water that is undergoing rapid warming. Despite its global importance, little is known about Baikals bacterioplankton communities and their drivers. In this extensive survey, we show that temperature, along with stratification, nutrients, and dissolved oxygen, but not geographic distance, define major microbial habitats and community similarity. Mixed layer and deep water communities exhibited contrasting patterns of richness, diversity and evenness, and comprised different cohesive modules in the whole Baikal OTU co-occurrence network. The networks small-world properties indicated likely resistance to perturbations but sensitivity to abundance changes of central, most connected OTUs. Previous studies showed Baikal water temperature rising by over 1.2{degrees}C since 1946, and this trend is predicted to accelerate. Because temperature emerged as the most significant predictor of the mixed layer community structure, we hypothesize that it is most likely to drive future community changes. Understanding how temperature and other abiotic factors structure microbial communities in this and other rapidly changing ecosystems will allow better predictions of ecosystem responses to anthropogenic stressors.",

We show that GC-rich exons have predicted RNA secondary structures at 5-ss, and are dependent on U1 snRNP-associated proteins. In contrast, AT-rich exons have a large number of branchpoints and SF1-or U2AF2-binding sites and are dependent on U2 snRNP-associated proteins. Nucleotide composition bias also influences local chromatin organization, with consequences for exon recognition during splicing. As the GC content of exons correlates with that of their hosting genes, isochores and topologically-associated domains, we propose that regional nucleotide composition bias leaves a local footprint at the exon level and induces constraints during splicing that can be alleviated by local chromatin organization and recruitment of specific splicing factors. Therefore, nucleotide composition bias establishes a direct link between genome organization and local regulatory processes, like alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobiome research is providing important new insights into the metabolic interactions of complex microbial ecosystems involved in fields as diverse as the pathogenesis of human diseases, agriculture and climate change. Poor correlations typically observed between RNA and protein expression datasets make it hard to accurately infer microbial protein synthesis from metagenomic data. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analyses typically rely on focussed search libraries based on prior knowledge for protein identification that may not represent all the proteins present in a set of samples. Metagenomic 16S rRNA sequencing will only target the bacterial component, while whole genome sequencing is at best an indirect measure of expressed proteomes. We describe a novel approach, MetaNovo, that combines existing open-source software tools to perform scalable de novo sequence tag matching with a novel algorithm for probabilistic optimization of the entire UniProt knowledgebase to create tailored databases for target-decoy searches directly at the proteome level, enabling analyses without prior expectation of sample composition or metagenomic data generation, and compatible with standard downstream analysis pipelines.\n\nResultsWe compared MetaNovo to published results from the MetaPro-IQ pipeline on 8 human mucosal-luminal interface samples, with comparable numbers of peptide and protein identifications, many shared peptide sequences and a similar bacterial taxonomic distribution compared to that found using a matched metagenome database - but simultaneously identified many more non-bacterial peptides than the previous approaches. MetaNovo was also benchmarked on samples of known microbial composition against matched metagenomic and whole genomic database workflows, yielding many more MS/MS identifications for the expected taxa, with improved taxonomic representation, while also highlighting previously described genome sequencing quality concerns for one of the organisms, and identifying a known sample contaminant without prior expectation.\n\nConclusionsBy estimating taxonomic and peptide level information directly on microbiome samples from tandem mass spectrometry data, MetaNovo enables the simultaneous identification of peptides from all domains of life in metaproteome samples, bypassing the need for curated sequence search databases. We show that the MetaNovo approach to mass spectrometry metaproteomics is more accurate than current gold standard approaches of tailored or matched genomic database searches, can identify sample contaminants without prior expectation and yields insights into previously unidentified metaproteomic signals, building on the potential for complex mass spectrometry metaproteomic data to speak for itself. The pipeline source code is available on GitHub1 and documentation is provided to run the software as a singularity-compatible docker image available from the Docker Hub2.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome distribution at anaphase of mitosis and meiosis is triggered by separase, an evolutionarily conserved protease. Separase must be tightly regulated to prevent the untimely release of chromatid cohesion and disastrous chromosome distribution defects. Securin is the key inhibitor of separase in animals and fungi, but has not been identified in other eukaryotic lineages. Here, we identified PATRONUS1 and PATRONUS2 (PANS1 and PANS2) as the Arabidopsis homologues of securin. Disruption of PANS1 is known to lead to the premature separation of chromosomes at meiosis, and the simultaneous disruption of PANS1 and PANS2 is lethal. Here, we show that PANS1 targeting by the anaphase-promoting-complex is required to trigger chromosome separation, mirroring the regulation of securin. We showed that PANS1 acts independently from Shugosins. In a genetic screen for pans1 suppressors, we identified SEPARASE mutants, showing that PANS1 and SEPARASE have antagonistic functions in vivo. Finally, we showed that the PANS1 and PANS2 proteins interact directly with SEPARASE. Altogether, our results show that PANS1 and PANS2 act as a plant securin. Remote sequence similarity was identified between the plant patronus family and animal securins, suggesting that they indeed derive from a common ancestor. Identification of patronus as the elusive plant securin illustrates the extreme sequence divergence of this central regulator of mitosis and meiosis.",

    "abstract": "Aversive memories are at the heart of psychiatric disorders such as phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, we present a new behavioral approach in rats that robustly attenuates aversive memories. This method consists of \\\"deconditioning\\\" animals previously trained to associate a tone with a strong footshock by replacing it with a much weaker one during memory retrieval. Our results indicate that deconditioning-update is more effective than traditional extinction in reducing fear responses; moreover, such effects are long lasting and resistant to renewal and spontaneous recovery. Remarkably, this strategy overcame important boundary conditions for memory updating, such as remote or very strong traumatic memories. The same beneficial effect was found in other types of fear-related memories. Deconditioning was mediated by L-type voltage-gated calcium channels and is consistent with computational accounts of mismatch-induced memory updating. Our results suggest that shifting from fear to safety through deconditioning-update is a promising approach to attenuate traumatic memories.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntegrating genome-wide gene expression patient profiles with regulatory knowledge is a challenging task because of the inherent heterogeneity, noise and incompleteness of biological data. From the computational side, several solvers for logic programs are able to perform extremely well in decision problems for combinatorial search domains. The challenge then is how to process the biological knowledge in order to feed these solvers to gain insights in a biological study. It requires formalizing the biological knowledge to give a precise interpretation of this information; currently, very few pathway databases offer this possibility.\\n\\nResultsThe presented work proposes an automatic pipeline to extract automatically regulatory knowledge from pathway databases and generate novel computational predictions related to the state of expression or activity of biological molecules. We applied it in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression, and evaluate the precision and the stability of these computational predictions. Our working base is a graph of 3,383 nodes and 13,771 edges extracted from the KEGG database, in which we integrate 209 differentially expressed genes between low and high aggressive HCC across 294 patients. Our computational model predicts the shifts of expression of 146 initially non-observed biological components. Our predictions were validated at 88% using a larger experimental dataset and cross-validation techniques. In particular, we focus on the protein complexes predictions and show for the first time that NFKB1/BCL-3 complexes are activated in aggressive HCC. In spite of the large dimension of the reconstructed models, our analyses over the computational predictions discover a well constrained region where KEGG regulatory knowledge constrains gene expression of several biomolecules. These regions can offer interesting windows to perturb experimentally such complex systems.\\n\\nConclusionThis new pipeline allows biologists to develop their own predictive models based on a list of genes. It facilitates the identification of new regulatory biomolecules using knowledge graphs and predictive computational methods. Our workflow is implemented in an automatic python pipeline which is publicly available at https://github.com/LokmaneChebouba/key-pipe and contains as testing data all the data used in this paper.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating gene expression and are involved in developmental processes in animals, plants and fungi. To understand the role of miRNAs in a biological system, it is important to optimise the extraction procedures to obtain high quality and quantity nucleic acid that enable high throughput sequencing and expression analysis. Numerous kit-based miRNA extraction protocols have been optimised generally to single cell or tissue cultures. Fungi, however, often occupy physically and chemically complex environments which miRNA make extraction challenging, such as fungal pathogens interacting within plant or animal host tissue. We used a Galleria mellonella (wax moth) larvae and entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum ARSEF 4556 host/pathogen model to compare commercially available miRNA extraction kits (Invitrogen PureLink miRNA Isolation Kit, Ambion mirVanamiRNA Isolation Kit and Norgen microRNA purification Kit). Our results showed reproducible and significant differences in miRNAs extraction between the kits, with the Invitrogen PureLink miRNA Isolation protocol demonstrating the best performance in terms of miRNA quantity, quality and integrity isolated from fungus-infected insect tissue.",
