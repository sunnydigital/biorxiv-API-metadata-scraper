    "abstract": "One of the most powerful excitatory synapses in the entire brain is formed by cerebellar climbing fibers, originating from neurons in the inferior olive, that wrap around the proximal dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells. The activation of a single olivary neuron is capable of generating a large electrical event, called \"complex spike\", at the level of the postsynaptic Purkinje cell, comprising of a fast initial spike of large amplitude followed by a slow polyphasic tail of small amplitude spikelets. Several ideas discussing the role of the cerebellum in motor control are centered on these complex spike events. However, these events are extremely rare, only occurring 1-2 times per second. As a result, drawing conclusions about their functional role has been very challenging, as even few errors in their detection may change the result. Since standard spike sorting approaches cannot fully handle the polyphasic shape of complex spike waveforms, the only safe way to avoid omissions and false detections has been to rely on visual inspection of long traces of Purkinje cell recordings by experts. Here we present a supervised deep learning algorithm for rapidly and reliably detecting complex spikes as an alternative to tedious visual inspection. Our algorithm, utilizing both action potential and local field potential signals, not only detects complex spike events much faster than human experts, but it also excavates key features of complex spike morphology with a performance comparable to that of such experts.\n\nSignificance statementClimbing fiber driven \"complex spikes\", fired at perplexingly low rates, are known to play a crucial role in cerebellum-based motor control. Careful interpretations of these spikes require researchers to manually detect them, since conventional online or offline spike sorting algorithms (optimized for analyzing the much more frequent \"simple spikes\") cannot be fully trusted. Here, we present a deep learning approach for identifying complex spikes, which is trained on local field and action potential recordings from cerebellar Purkinje cells. Our algorithm successfully identifies complex spikes, along with additional relevant neurophysiological features, with an accuracy level matching that of human experts, yet with very little time expenditure.",

    "abstract": "In order to understand how organisms cope with ongoing changes in environmental variability it is important to consider all types of adaptations to environmental uncertainty on different time-scales. Conservative bet-hedging represents a long-term genotype-level strategy that maximizes lineage geometric mean fitness in stochastic environments by decreasing individual fitness variance, despite also lowering arithmetic mean fitness. Meanwhile, variance-prone (aka risk-prone) strategies produce greater variance in short-term payoffs because this increases expected arithmetic mean fitness if the relationship between payoffs and fitness is accelerating. Using two evolutionary simulation models, we investigate whether selection for such variance-prone strategies are counteracted by selection for bet-hedging that works to adaptively reduce fitness variance. We predict that variance-prone strategies will be favored in scenarios with more decision events per lifetime and when fitness accumulates additively rather than multiplicatively. In our model variance-proneness evolved in fine-grained environments (with lower correlations among individuals in energetic state and/or in payoffs when choosing the variable decision), and with larger numbers of independent decision events over which resources accumulate prior to selection. In contrast, geometric fitness accumulation caused by coarser environmental grain and fewer decision events prior to selection favors conservative bet-hedging via greater variance-aversion. We discuss examples of variance-sensitive strategies in optimal foraging, migration, life histories and cooperative breeding in light of these results concerning bet-hedging. By linking disparate fields of research studying adaptations to variable environments we should be more able to understand the effects in nature of human-induced rapid environmental change.\n\nData depositionR code is available upon request.",

PBS3 catalyzes the conjugation of glutamate to isochorismate. The reaction product isochorismate-9-glutamate spontaneously decomposes into enolpyruvyl-N-glutamate and SA.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe growth of DNA biobanks linked to data from electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled the discovery of numerous associations between genomic variants and clinical phenotypes. Nonetheless, although clinical data are generally longitudinal, standard approaches for detecting genotype-phenotype associations in such linked data, notably logistic regression, do not naturally account for the times at which events occur. Here we explored the advantages of quantifying associations using Cox proportional hazards regression, which can account for the age at which a patient first visited the healthcare system (left truncation) and the age at which a patient either last visited the healthcare system or acquired a particular phenotype (right censoring).\\n\\nResultsUsing simulated data, we found that, compared to logistic regression, Cox regression had greater power at equivalent Type I error. We then scanned for genotype-phenotype associations using logistic regression and Cox regression on 50 phenotypes derived from the electronic health records of 49 792 genotyped individuals. In terms of effect sizes, the hazard ratios estimated by Cox regression were nearly identical to the odds ratios estimated by logistic regression. Consistent with the findings from our simulations, Cox regression had approximately 10% greater relative sensitivity for detecting known associations from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog.\\n\\nConclusionsAs longitudinal health-related data continue to grow, Cox regression may improve our ability to identify the genetic basis for a wide range of human phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a chronic and morbid disease of poverty affecting approximately 200 million people worldwide. Mature schistosome flatworms wander in the hosts hepatic portal and mesenteric venous system where they encounter a range of blood flow conditions and geometrical confinement. However, the mechanisms that support schistosome locomotion and underlie the pathogens adaptation to its physical environment are largely unknown. By combining microfabrication and traction force microscopy, we developed various in vitro assays to quantify the mechanics of locomotion of adult male S. mansoni in different physiologically relevant conditions. We show that in unconfined settings, the parasite undergoes two-anchor marching mediated by the coordinated action of its oral and ventral suckers. This mode of locomotion is maintained when the worm faces an external flow, to which it responds by adjusting the strength of its suckers. In geometrically confined conditions, S. mansoni switches to a different crawling modality by generating retrograde peristaltic waves along its body, a mechanism shared with terrestrial and marine worms. But while the surface of most worms has backward-pointing bristles that rectify peristaltic waves and facilitate forward locomotion, S mansoni has isotropically oriented tubercles. This requires tight coordination between muscle contraction and substrate friction but confers S. mansoni the ability to reverse its direction of locomotion without turning its body, which is likely advantageous to maneuver in narrow bore vessels. We show that the parasite can also coordinate the action of its suckers with its peristaltic body contractions to increase crawling speed. Throughout this study, we report on a number of biomechanical parameters to quantify the motility of adult schistosomes (e.g. sucker grabbing strength, rate of detachment under flow, peristaltic wave properties and traction stresses). The new series of in vitro assays make it possible to quantify key phenotypical aspects of S. mansoni motility that could guide the discovery of new drugs to treat schistosomiasis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn bacterial cells, inhibition of ribosomes by sublethal concentrations of antibiotics leads to a decrease in growth rate despite an increase in ribosome content. The limitation of ribosomal activity results in an increase in the level of expression from ribosomal promoters; this can deplete the pool of RNA polymerase (RNAP) that is available for the expression of non-ribosomal genes. However, the magnitude of this effect remains to be quantified. Here, we use the change in the activity of constitutive promoters with different affinities for RNAP to quantify the change in the concentration of free RNAP. The data are consistent with a significant decrease in the amount of RNAP available for transcription of both ribosomal and non ribosomal genes. Results obtained with different reporter genes reveal an mRNA length dependence on the amount of full-length translated protein, consistent with the decrease in ribosome processivity affecting more strongly the translation of longer genes. The genes coding for the {beta} and {beta} subunits of RNAP are amongst the longest genes in the E. coli genome, while the genes coding for ribosomal proteins are among the shortest genes. This can explain the observed decrease in transcription capacity that favors the expression of genes whose promoters have a high affinity for RNAP, such as ribosomal promoters.\\n\\nImportanceExposure of bacteria to sublethal concentrations of antibiotics can lead to bacterial adaptation and survival at higher doses of inhibitors, which in turn can lead to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The presence of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics targeting translation results in an increase in the amount of ribosomes per cell and a decrease in the cells growth rate. In this work, we have found that inhibition of ribosome activity can result in a decrease in the amount of free RNA polymerase available for transcription, thus limiting the protein expression rate via a different pathway than what was expected. This result can be explained by our observation that long genes, such as those coding for RNA polymerase subunits, have a higher probability of premature translation termination in the presence of ribosome inhibitors, while expression of short ribosomal genes is affected less, consistent with their increased concentration.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium belonging to the oral streptococcus species, mitis group. This pathogen is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, which often evades host immunity and causes systemic diseases, such as sepsis and meningitis. Previously, we reported that PfbA is a {beta}-helical cell surface protein contributing to pneumococcal adhesion to and invasion of human epithelial cells in addition to its survival in blood. In the present study, we investigated the role of PfbA in pneumococcal pathogenesis. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the pfbA gene is specific to S. pneumoniae within the mitis group. Our in vitro assays showed that PfbA inhibits neutrophil phagocytosis, leading to pneumococcal survival. We found that PfbA activates NF-{kappa}B through TLR2, but not TLR4. In addition, TLR2/4 inhibitor peptide treatment of neutrophils enhanced the survival of the S. pneumoniae {Delta}pfbA strain as compared to a control peptide treatment, whereas the treatment did not affect survival of a wild-type strain. In a mouse pneumonia model, the host mortality and level of TNF- in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were comparable between wild-type and {Delta}pfbA-infected mice, while deletion of pfbA increased the bacterial burden in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In a mouse sepsis model, the {Delta}pfbA strain demonstrated significantly increased host mortality and TNF- levels in plasma, but showed reduced bacterial burden in lung and liver. These results indicate that PfbA may contribute to the success of S. pneumoniae species by inhibiting host cell phagocytosis, excess inflammation, and mortality.\\n\\nImportanceStreptococcus pneumoniae is often isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy children, but the bacterium is also a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis. In this study, we focused on the role of a cell wall anchoring protein, PfbA, in the pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae-related disease. We found that PfbA is a pneumococcus-specific anti-phagocytic factor that functions as a TLR2 ligand, indicating that PfbA may represent a pneumococcal-specific therapeutic target. However, a mouse pneumonia model revealed that PfbA deficiency reduced the bacterial burden, but did not decrease host mortality. Furthermore, in a mouse sepsis model, PfbA deficiency increased host mortality. These results suggest that S. pneumoniae optimizes reproduction by regulating host mortality through PfbA; therefore, PfbA inhibition would not be an effective strategy for combatting pneumococcal infection. Our findings underscore the challenges involved in drug development for a bacterium harboring both commensal and pathogenic states.",

    "abstract": "Cell survival requires the control of biomolecule concentration, i.e. biomolecules should approach homeostasis. With information-carrying macromolecules, the particular concentration variation ranges depend on each type: DNA is not buffered, but mRNA and protein concentrations are homeostatically controlled, which leads to the ribostasis and proteostasis concepts. In recent years, we have studied the particular features of mRNA ribostasis and proteostasis in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Here we extend this study by comparing published data from three other model organisms: E. coli, S. pombe and cultured human cells. We describe how mRNA ribostasis is less strict than proteostasis. A constant ratio appears between the average decay and dilution rates during cell growth for mRNA, but not for proteins. We postulate that this is due to a trade-off between the cost of synthesis and the response capacity. This compromise takes place at the transcription level, but is not possible at the translation level as the high stability of proteins, versus that of mRNAs, precludes it. We hypothesize that the middle-place role of mRNA in the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and its chemical instability make it more suitable than proteins for the fast changes needed for gene regulation.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/599050v2_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (24K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@95419aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10612e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c29081org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d21c0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract C_FIG",

Unfortunately, there is no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus until now. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of PPIs from multiple sources. Thirty-two swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as AIPs. They were found to play a central role in the swine PPI network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of AIPs also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted AIPs and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on AIPs were identified, such as Polaprezinc. This work could not only deepen our understanding towards the ASFV-swine interactions, but also help for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the ASFVs.",

    "abstract": "The M segment of the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) has been implicated in its emergence into human populations. To elucidate the genetic contributions of the M segment to host adaptation, and the underlying mechanisms, we examined a panel of isogenic viruses that carry avian- or human-derived M segments. Avian, but not human, M segments restricted viral growth and transmission in mammalian model systems, and the restricted growth correlated with increased expression of M2 relative to M1. M2 overexpression was associated with intracellular accumulation of autophagosomes, which was alleviated by interference of the viral proton channel activity by amantadine treatment. As M1 and M2 are expressed from the M mRNA through alternative splicing, we separated synonymous and non-synonymous changes that differentiate human and avian M segments and found that dysregulation of gene expression leading to M2 overexpression diminished replication, irrespective of amino acid composition of M1 or M2. Moreover, in spite of efficient replication, virus possessing a human M segment that expressed avian M2 protein at low level did not transmit efficiently. We conclude that (i) determinants of transmission reside in the IAV M2 protein, and that (ii) control of M segment gene expression is a critical aspect of IAV host adaptation needed to prevent M2-mediated dysregulation of vesicular homeostasis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryInfluenza A virus (IAV) pandemics arise when a virus adapted to a non-human host overcomes species barriers to successfully infect humans and sustain human-to-human transmission. To gauge the adaptive potential and therefore pandemic risk posed by a particular IAV, it is critical to understand the mechanisms underlying viral adaptation to human hosts. Here, we focused on the role of one of IAVs eight gene segments, the M segment, in host adaptation. Comparing the growth of IAVs with avian- and human-derived M segments in avian and mammalian systems revealed that the avian M segment restricts viral growth specifically in mammalian cells. We show that the mechanism underlying this host range phenotype is a dysregulation of viral gene expression when the avian IAV M segment is transcribed in mammalian cells. In particular, excess production of the M2 protein results in viral interference with cellular functions on which the virus relies. Our results therefore reveal that the use of cellular machinery to control viral gene expression leaves the virus vulnerable to over- or under-production of critical viral gene products in a new host species.",

Most importantly, significant activation of lobules Crus I and VI was also present during the unexpected omission of the US in unreinforced CS+ acquisition trials.

    "abstract": "Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1) is a Mendelian disorder of the epigenetic machinery caused by mutations in the gene encoding KMT2D, which methylates lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4). KS1 is characterized by intellectual disability, postnatal growth retardation, and distinct craniofacial dysmorphisms. A mouse model (Kmt2d+/ {beta} Geo) exhibits features of the human disorder and has provided insight into other phenotypes; however, the mechanistic basis of skeletal abnormalities and growth retardation remains elusive. Using high-resolution micro-computed tomography we show that Kmt2d+/{beta}Geo mice have shortened long bones and ventral bowing of skulls. In vivo expansion of growth plates within both the skull and long bones suggests disrupted endochondral ossification as a common disease mechanism. Stable chondrocyte cell lines harboring inactivating mutations in Kmt2d exhibit increased proliferation and differentiation, which further supports this mechanism. A known inducer of chondrogenesis, SOX9, and its targets show markedly increased expression in Kmt2d-/- chondrocytes. By transcriptome profiling, we identify Shox2 as a putative KMT2D target. We propose that decreased KMT2D-mediated H3K4me3 at Shox2 releases Sox9 inhibition and thereby leads to enhanced chondrogenesis, providing a novel and plausible explanation for precocious chondrocyte differentiation. Our findings not only provide insight into the pathogenesis of growth retardation in KS1, but also suggest novel therapeutic targets to rescue growth retardation in KS1 and related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Biofilms are communities of bacteria embedded in an extracellular matrix of self-produced polymeric substances. This polymer matrix lends the bacteria protection against a wide array of chemical and mechanical stresses that they may experience in their environment, which might be a location in the human body in the case of a biofilm infection, or a surface immersed in fluid in an industrial setting. Breaking down the matrix network renders biofilms more susceptible to physical disruption and to treatments. Different species of bacteria, and different strains within the same species, produce different types of matrix polymers - this suggests that targeting specific polymers for disruption may be more effective than non-specific approaches to disrupting biofilm matrices. In this study, we treated Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with enzymes that are specific to different matrix polymers. We used bulk rheology to measure the resulting alteration in biofilm mechanics, and scanning electron microscopy to visualize the alteration in the matrix network upon treatment. Different lab strains of P. aeruginosa form biofilms that can be dominated by one of three main extracellular polysaccharides: Psl, alginate, and Pel, which binds electrostatically to extracellular DNA in the matrix. We applied enzymes to biofilms dominated by different extracellular polysaccharides and found that, for biofilms grown in vitro, the effect of enzymatic treatment is maximized when the enzyme is specific to a dominant matrix polymer - for such a case, specifically-matched enzymatic treatment tends to: reduce yield strain and yield stress; reduce or eliminate long-range structure and shorten or eliminate connecting network fibers in the biofilm as seen under scanning electron microscopy; and increase the rate of biofilm drying, most likely due to increased diffusivity as a result of network compromise. However, for ex vivo biofilms grown in murine wounds, we find that generic glycoside hydrolases have more profound disruptive effects than specifically-matched enzymes, even though they had no measurable effect for biofilms grown in vitro. This highlights the importance of the environment in which the biofilms are grown, the need to take this into account when developing treatments for biofilms, and the possibility that effective approaches to eradicating biofilms in environmental or industrial settings may need to be very different from effective treatments of infection.",

Expression of AcrB-R717Q in E. coli and Typhi strains increased its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for azithromycin by 11- and 3-fold respectively. The azithromycin-resistant Paratyphi A strain also contained a mutation at R717 (R717L), whose introduction in E. coli and Paratyphi A strains increased MIC by 7- and 3-fold respectively, confirming the role of R717 mutations in conferring azithromycin resistance.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWrist-worn accelerometry is the commonest objective method for measuring physical activity in large-scale epidemiological studies. Research-grade devices capture raw triaxial acceleration which, in addition to quantifying movement, facilitates assessment of orientation relative to gravity. No population-based study has yet described the interrelationship and variation of these features by time and personal characteristics.\n\nMethods2043 UK adults (35-65years) wore an accelerometer on the non-dominant wrist and a chest-mounted combined heart-rate-and-movement sensor for 7days free-living. From raw (60Hz) wrist acceleration, we derived movement (non-gravity acceleration) and pitch and roll (arm) angles relative to gravity. We inferred physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) from combined sensing and sedentary time from approximate horizontal arm-angle coupled with low movement.\n\nResultsMovement differences by time-of-day and day-of-week were associated with arm-angles; more movement in downward arm-positions. Mean(SD) movement was similar between sexes [~]31(42)mg, despite higher PAEE in men, 53(22) vs 48(19)J{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}kg-1. Women spent longer with the arm pitched >0{degrees} (53% vs 36%) and less time at <0{degrees} (37% vs 53%). Diurnal pitch was 2.5-5{degrees} above and 0-7.5{degrees} below horizontal during night and daytime, respectively; corresponding roll angles were [~]0{degrees} and [~]20{degrees} (thumb-up). Differences were more pronounced in younger participants. All diurnal profiles indicated later wake-times on weekends. Daytime pitch was closer to horizontal on weekdays; roll was similar. Sedentary time was higher (17 vs 15hours/day) in obese vs normal-weight individuals.\n\nConclusionsMore movement occurred in arm positions below horizontal, commensurate with activities including walking. Findings suggest time-specific population differences in behaviours by age, sex, and BMI.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity is commonly believed to reduce risk of vector-borne zoonoses. However, researchers already showed that the effect of biodiversity on disease transmission is not that straightforward. This study focuses on the effect of biodiversity, specifically on the effect of the decoy process (additional hosts distracting vectors from their focal host), on reducing infections of vector-borne diseases in humans. Here, we consider the specific case of Chagas disease and use mathematical population models to observe the impact on human infection of the proximity of chickens, which are incompetent hosts for the parasite but serve as a preferred food source for vectors. We consider three cases as the distance between the two host populations varies: short (when farmers bring chickens inside the home to protect them from predators), intermediate (close enough for vectors with one host to detect the presence of the other host type), and far (separate enclosed buildings such as a home and hen-house). Our analysis shows that the presence of chickens reduces parasite prevalence in humans only at an intermediate distance under the condition that the vector birth rate from feeding on chickens is sufficiently low.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIxodes ricinus is the predominant tick species in Europe and the primary pathogen vector for both humans and animals. These ticks are frequently involved in the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis. While much more is known about I. ricinus tick-borne pathogen composition, information about temporal tick-borne pathogen patterns remain scarce. These data are crucial for predicting seasonal/annual patterns which could improve understanding and prevent tick-borne diseases.\n\nMethodsWe examined tick-borne pathogen (TBPs) dynamics in I. ricinus collected monthly in a peri-urban forest over three consecutive years. In total, 998 nymphs were screened for 31 pathogenic species using high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR.\n\nResultsWe detected DNA from Anaplasma phagocytophilum (5.3%), Rickettsia helvetica (4.5%), Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (3.7%), Borrelia miyamotoi (1.2%), Babesia venatorum (1.5%) and Rickettsia felis (0.1%). Among all analysed ticks, 15.9% were infected by at least one of these microorganisms, and 1.3% were co-infected. Co-infections with B. afzeli/B. garinii and B. garinii/B. spielmanii were significantly over-represented. Moreover, significant variations in seasonal and/or inter-annual prevalence were observed for several pathogens (R. helvetica, B. burgdorferi s.l., B. miyamotoi, and A. phagocytophilum).\n\nConclusionsAnalysing TBPs prevalence in monthly sampled tick over three years allowed us to assess seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations of the prevalence of TBPs known to circulate in the sampled area, but also to punctually detect less common species. All these data emphasize that sporadic tick samplings are not sufficient to determine TBPs prevalence and that regular monitoring is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Higher health literacy is associated with higher cognitive function and better health. Despite its wide use in medical research, no study has investigated the genetic contributions to health literacy. Using 5,783 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) participants (mean age=65.49, SD=9.55) who had genotyping data and had completed a health literacy test at wave 2 (2004-2005), we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of health literacy. We estimated the proportion of variance in health literacy explained by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Polygenic profile scores were calculated using summary statistics from GWAS of 21 cognitive and health measures. Logistic regression was used to test whether polygenic scores for cognitive and health-related traits were associated with having adequate, compared to limited, health literacy. No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance for association with health literacy. The proportion of variance in health literacy accounted for by common SNPs was 8.5% (SE=7.2%). Greater odds of having adequate health literacy were associated with a 1SD higher polygenic score for general cognitive ability (OR=1.34, 95% CI 1.26-1.42), verbal-numerical reasoning (OR=1.30, 1.23-1.39), and years of schooling (OR=1.29, 1.21-1.36). Reduced odds of having adequate health literacy were associated with higher polygenic profiles for poorer self-rated health (OR=0.92, 0.87-0.98) and schizophrenia (OR=0.91, 0.85-0.96). The well-documented associations between health literacy, cognitive function and health may partly be due to shared genetic aetiology. Larger studies are required to obtain accurate estimates of SNP-based heritability, and to discover specific health literacy-associated genetic variants.",

However, sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) has been proposed to be a better marker of intra-abdominal obesity compared to WC and might better associate with metabolic disturbances in high-risk populations. The objective of this study was to compare SAD, WC, and BMI as determinants of an adverse metabolic phenotype.\\n\\nMethodAnthropometric and metabolic measures of 1516 overweight or obese individuals with features of the metabolic syndrome were included to examine differences between SAD, WC and BMI as measures of an adverse metabolic phenotype. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between SAD, WC, and BMI and markers of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, blood lipids, and low grade inflammation.\\n\\nResultsBoth SAD and WC correlated with BMI, but as BMI increased, SAD proportionately estimated higher abdominal adiposity compared to WC (slope = 0.0037 (0.0029; 0.0046), p<0.0001). We did not find major differences between SAD, WC and BMI in explained variance in models with the different markers of metabolic risk. Furthermore, we did not find differences between SAD and WC in the ability to identify individuals with metabolic syndrome according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) cut-offs, but a few differences from BMI were indicated but mostly before adjustments. Moreover, the differences between SAD and WC associations were not modified by sex or degree of adiposity, but identification of individuals with a metabolic phenotype was generally better in women.\\n\\nConclusionThese data indicate that SAD and WC are equally good indicators of an adverse metabolic phenotype.

Using a bounding analysis, we show that despite additional testing costs, this approach can improve the economic viability of CYD-TDV: effective testing reduces unnecessary vaccination costs while increasing the health benefit for vaccine recipients. When testing is cheap enough, those trends outweigh additional screening costs and make test-then-vaccinate strategies net-beneficial in many settings.\\n\\nWe derived these results using a general approach for determining price thresholds for testing and vaccination, as well as indicating optimal start and end ages of routine test-then-vaccinate programs. This approach only requires age-specific seroprevalence and a cost estimate for second infections. We demonstrate this approach across settings commonly used to evaluate CYD-TDV economics, and highlight implications of our simple model for more detailed studies. We found trends showing test-then-vaccinate strategies are generally more beneficial starting at younger ages, and that in some settings multiple years of testing can be more beneficial than only testing once, despite increased investment in testing.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin (ART) combination therapies were introduced on malaria endemic Bioko Island in 2004 through Bioko Island Malaria Control Project. Recently, ART-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strain with Kelch13 (K13) propeller M579I mutation originating from Equatorial Guinea was observed as an increased parasite clearance time on day 3 after dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DHA-PIP) treatment (D3 positivity). Here, we surveyed DHA-PIP effectiveness and molecular markers of drug resistance at D3 after DHA-PIP treatment on Bioko Island from 2014 to 2017. Among the 371 uncomplicated P. falciparum patients, 86.3% (320/471) were successfully followed up at D3. 5.9% (19/320) of patients showed D3 positivity. K13 and MDR1 gene were successfully sequenced from 46 patients collected at D0 (baseline population) and 19 D3-positivity patients. Five non-synonymous K13 mutations (H136N; K189N; K248N; K326E; K332N) were found. There was no statistical difference in the frequency of these K13 mutations between baseline population and D3-positivity samples (p>0.05). Additionally, none of the K13 propeller polymorphisms known to be involved in ART-resistance in Asia or Africa were detected. For MDR1 gene, 38.5% (25/65) carried N86Y mutation; 73.8% (48/65) the Y184F mutation. Parasites surviving DHA-PIP at D3 post-treatment were significantly more likely than the baseline population to carry the N86Y (p <0.05). These results suggest that K13 is not the best predictive molecular marker for ART resistance in Africa. More isolates from cases with delayed parasite clearance after DHA-PIP treatment indicated that in vitro and in vivo monitoring for ART derivatives and ACT partner drugs should be regularly performed on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.",

The comparison between the susceptible and resistant assemblies revealed two dominant repeat types. We discovered a FHY3/FAR1-like mobile genetic element that is associated with the duplicated EPSPS gene copies in the resistant line. We present a hypothetical model based on unequal crossing over that implicates this mobile element as responsible for the origin of the EPSPS gene duplication event and the evolution of herbicide resistance in this system.

    "abstract": "The trillions of microorganisms (microbiota) found within the human gut play a critical role in shaping the immune system, yet these complex microbial communities are also highly sensitive to numerous environmental factors. While much of the focus to date has been on dietary intake, emerging data has begun to suggest that the use of pharmaceutical drugs, even those that are not considered to be antibiotics, can alter the human gut microbiota with unknown consequences for treatment outcomes. Here, we use a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo methods to demonstrate that the first-line therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), methotrexate (MTX), has off-target effects on the human gut microbiota, resulting in a significant growth advantage for drug-resistant Firmicutes over the Bacteroidetes, which tend to be more sensitive. Longitudinal analyses of the gut microbiotas of RA patients revealed that MTX-induced shifts in bacterial relative abundance are associated with improved drug response and transplant experiments in gnotobiotic mice show that these shifts lead to reduced inflammation. Together, these results suggest that the mechanism-of-action of non-antibiotic drugs may be due in part to off-target effects on the gut microbiota, while providing a critical first step towards explaining long-standing differences in drug response between patients.",

    "abstract": "Thymus function depends on the epithelial compartment of the thymic stroma. Cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) regulate T cell lineage commitment and positive selection, while medullary (m) TECs impose central tolerance on the T cell repertoire. During thymus organogenesis, these functionally distinct sub-lineages are thought to arise from a common thymic epithelial progenitor cell (TEPC). The mechanisms controlling cTEC and mTEC production from the common TEPC are not however understood. Here, we show that emergence of the earliest mTEC lineage-restricted progenitors requires active NOTCH signaling in progenitor TEC and that, once specified, further mTEC development is NOTCH-independent. In addition, we demonstrate that persistent NOTCH activity favors maintenance of undifferentiated TEPC at the expense of cTEC differentiation. Finally, we uncover a direct interaction between NOTCH and FOXN1, the master regulator of TEC differentiation. These data establish NOTCH as a potent regulator of TEPC and mTEC fate during fetal thymus development and are thus of high relevance to strategies aimed at generating/regenerating functional thymic tissue in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometry is a powerful tool for high dimensional single cell characterization. Since the introduction of the first commercial CyTOF mass cytometer by DVS Sciences in 2009, mass cytometry technology has matured and become more widely utilized, with sequential platform upgrades designed to address specific limitations and to expand the capabilities of the platform. Fluidigms 3rd-generation Helios mass cytometer introduced a number of upgrades over the previous CyTOF2. One of these new features is a modified narrow bore sample injector that generates smaller ion clouds, which is expected to improve sensitivity and throughput. However, following rigorous testing we find that the narrow-bore sample injector may have unintended negative consequences on data quality and result in lower median signal intensities and higher coefficients of variation in antibody expression. We describe an alternative Helios acquisition protocol using a wider bore injector, which largely mitigates these data quality issues. We directly compare these two protocols in a multi-site study of 10 Helios instruments across 7 institutions and show that the modified protocol improves data quality and reduces inter-instrument variability. These findings highlight and address an important source of technical variability in mass cytometry experiments that is of particular relevance in the setting of multi-center studies.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase, which maintains telomere length, is comprised of an RNA component, TLC1, the reverse transcriptase, Est2, and regulatory subunits, including Est1. The Yku70/Yku80 (Ku) heterodimer, a DNA end binding (DEB) protein, also contributes to telomere length maintenance. Ku binds TLC1 and telomere ends in a mutually exclusive fashion, and is required to maintain levels and nuclear localization of TLC1. Ku also interacts with Sir4, which localizes to telomeres. Here we sought to determine the role of Kus DEB activity in telomere length maintenance by utilizing yku70-R456E mutant strains, in which Ku has reduced DEB and telomere association but proficiency in TLC1 and Sir4 binding, and TLC1 nuclear retention. Telomere lengths in a yku70-R456E strain were nearly as short as those in yku{Delta} strains and shorter than in strains lacking either Sir4, Ku:Sir4 interaction, or Ku:TLC1 interaction. TLC1 levels were decreased in the yku70-R456E mutant, yet overexpression of TLC1 failed to restore telomere length. Reduced DEB activity did not impact Est1s ability to associate with telomerase but did result in decreased association of Est1 with the telomere. These findings suggest Kus DEB activity maintains telomere length homeostasis by preserving Est1s interaction at the telomere rather than altering TLC1 levels.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with various human phenotypes and many of these loci are thought to act at a molecular level by regulating gene expression. Detection of allele specific expression (ASE), namely preferential usage of an allele at a transcribed locus, is an increasingly important means of studying the genetic regulation of gene expression. However, there are currently a paucity of tools available to link ASE sites with GWAS risk loci. Existing integration methods first use ASE sites to infer cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and then apply eQTL-based approaches. ERASE is a method that assesses the enrichment of risk loci amongst ASE sites directly. Furthermore, ERASE enables additional biological insights to be made through the addition of other SNP level annotations. ERASE is based on a randomization approach and controls for read depth, a significant confounder in ASE analyses. In this paper, we demonstrate that ERASE can efficiently detect the enrichment of eQTLs and risk loci within ASE data and that it remains sensitive even when used with underpowered GWAS datasets. Finally, using ERASE in combination with GWAS data for Parkinsons disease and data on the splicing potential of individual SNPs, we provide evidence to suggest that risk loci for Parkinsons disease are enriched amongst ASEs likely to affect splicing. Thus, we show that ERASE is an important new tool for the integration of ASE and GWAS data, capable of providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of complex diseases.",

Identification of similar binding sites can help guide efforts for hit finding, understanding polypharmacology and characterization of protein function. The design of pocket matching methods has traditionally involved much intuition, and has employed a broad variety of algorithms and representations of the input protein structures. We regard the high heterogeneity of past work and the recent availability of large-scale benchmarks as an indicator that a data-driven approach may provide a new perspective.\\n\\nResultsWe propose DeeplyTough, a convolutional neural network that encodes a three-dimensional representation of protein binding sites into descriptor vectors that may be compared efficiently in an alignment-free manner by computing pairwise Euclidean distances. The network is trained with supervision: (i) to provide similar pockets with similar descriptors, (ii) to separate the descriptors of dissimilar pockets by a minimum margin, and (iii) to achieve robustness to nuisance variations. We evaluate our method using three large-scale benchmark datasets, on which it demonstrates excellent performance for held-out data coming from the training distribution and competitive performance when the trained network is required to generalize to datasets constructed independently.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/BenevolentAI/DeeplyTough\\n\\nContactmartin.simonovsky@enpc.fr, joshua.meyers@benevolent.ai",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCells are powered by a large set of macromolecular complexes, which work together in a crowded environment. The in situ mechanisms of these complexes are unclear because their 3-D distribution, organization, and interactions are largely unknown. Electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) is a key tool to address these knowledge gaps because it produces cryotomograms -- 3-D images that reveal biological structure at approximately 4-nm resolution. Cryo-ET does not involve any fixation, dehydration, staining, or plastic embedment, meaning that cellular features are visualized in a life-like, frozen-hydrated state. To study chromatin and mitotic machinery in situ, we have subjected yeast cells to a variety of genetic and/or chemical perturbations, cryosectioned them, and then imaged the cells by cryo-ET.\\n\\nFindingsEvery study from our group has generated more cryo-ET data than needed. Only the small subset of data that contributed to figures in these studies have been publicly shared. Here we share more than 1,000 cryo-ET raw datasets of cryosectioned budding yeast S. cerevisiae. This data will be valuable to cell biologists who are interested in the nanoscale organization of yeasts and of eukaryotic cells in general. To facilitate access, all the unpublished tilt series and a subset of corresponding cryotomograms have been deposited in the EMPIAR resource for the cell-biology community to use freely. To improve tilt series discoverability, we have uploaded metadata and preliminary notes to publicly accessible google spreadsheets.\\n\\nConclusionsCellular cryo-ET data can be mined to obtain new cell-biological, structural, and 3-D statistical insights in situ. Because these data capture cells in a life-like state, they contain some structures that are either absent or not visible in traditional EM data. Template matching and subtomogram averaging of known macromolecular complexes can reveal their 3-D distributions and low-resolution structures. Furthermore, these data can serve as testbeds for high-throughput image-analysis pipelines, as training sets for feature-recognition software, for feasibility analysis when planning new structural cell-biology projects, and as practice data for students who are learning cellular cryo-ET.",

    "abstract": "The co-occurrence of abuse of multiple substances is thought to stem from a common liability that is partly genetic in origin. Genetic risk may indirectly contribute to a common liability through genetically influenced individual vulnerabilities and traits. To disentangle the aetiology of common versus specific liabilities to substance abuse, polygenic scores can be used as genetic proxies indexing such risk and protective individual vulnerabilities or traits. In this study, we used genomic data from a UK birth cohort study (ALSPAC, N=4218) to generate 18 polygenic scores indexing mental health vulnerabilities, personality traits, cognition, physical traits, and substance abuse. Common and substance-specific factors were identified based on four classes of substance abuse (alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, other illicit substances) assessed over time (age 17, 20, and 22). In multivariable regressions, we then tested the independent contribution of selected polygenic scores to the common and substance-specific factors. Our findings implicated several genetically influenced traits and vulnerabilities in the common liability to substance abuse, most notably risk taking (bstandardized=0.14; 95%CI: 0.10,0.17), followed by extraversion (bstandardized =-0.10; 95%CI: -0.13,-0.06), and schizophrenia risk (bstandardized=0.06; 95%CI: 0.02;0.09). Educational attainment (EA) and body mass index (BMI) had opposite effects on substance-specific liabilities such as cigarettes (bstandardized-EA= -0.15; 95%CI: -0.19,-0.12; bstandardized-BMI=0.05; 95%CI: 0.02,0.09), alcohol (bstandardized-EA=0.07; 95%CI: 0.03,0.11; bstandardized-BMI= -0.06; 95%CI: -0.10, -0.02), and other illicit substances (bstandardized-EA=0.12; 95%CI: 0.07,0.17; bstandardized-BMI= -0.08; 95%CI:-0.13,-0.04).

    "abstract": "IntroductionIn patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the perception of dyspnea is related to quality of life, and is a better predictor of mortality than the severity of airway obstruction. The purpose of the current study was to use population-level data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to identify potential correlates of dyspnea in adults with obstructive lung disease.\\n\\nMethodsData from participants with a self-reported obstructive lung disease (asthma or COPD) were used for analysis (n=2,854). Four outcome variables were assessed: self-reported dyspnea at 1) rest, 2) walking on a flat surface, 3) walking uphill/climbing stairs, 4) following strenuous activity. Potential sociodemographic, health, and health behaviour correlates were entered in to logistic regression models.\\n\\nResultsHigher body fat percentage, and worse forced expiratory volume in one second were associated with higher odds of reporting dyspnea. Females with an anxiety disorder (OR=1.91, CI: 1.29, 2.83) and males with a mood disorder (OR=2.67, CI: 1.53, 4.68) reported higher odds of experiencing dyspnea walking on a flat surface, independent of lung function and other correlates. Dyspnea while walking uphill/climbing stairs was associated with a slower timed up and go time in females (e.g. OR=1.18, CI: 1.10) and males (OR=1.19, CI: 1.09, 1.30).\\n\\nConclusionsIn addition to traditional predictors such as lung function and body composition, we found that anxiety and mood disorders, as well as functional fitness were correlates of dyspnea. Further research is needed to understand whether targeting these correlates leads to improvements in perceptions of dyspnea.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition--the suppression of prepotent behaviours when they are inappropriate-- has been thought to rely on executive control. Against this received wisdom, it has been argued that external cues repeatedly associated with response inhibition can come to trigger response inhibition automatically without top-down command. The current project endeavoured to provide evidence for associatively-mediated motor inhibition. We tested the hypothesis that stop-associated stimuli can, in a bottom-up fashion, directly activate inhibitory mechanisms in the motor cortex. Human subjects were first trained on a stop-signal task. Once trained, the subjects received transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over their primary motor cortex during passive observation of either the stop signal (i.e. without any need to stop a response) or an equally familiar control stimulus never associated with stopping. Analysis of motor-evoked potentials showed that corticospinal excitability was reduced during exposure to the stop signal, which likely involved stimulus-driven activation of intracortical GABAergic interneurons. This result offers evidence for the argument that, through associative learning, stop-associated stimuli can engage local inhibitory processes at the level of the motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "1The adaptation of biological organisms to fluctuating environments is one major determinant of their structural and dynamical complexity. Organisms have evolved devoted adaptations to ensure the robust performance of physiological functions under environmental fluctuations. To further our understanding of particular adaptation strategies to different environmental fluctuations, we perform laboratory evolution experiments of Escherichia coli under three temperature fluctuation regimes alternating between 15{degrees}C and 43{degrees}C. Two of these regimes are determined by the populations growth, while the third regime switches stochastically. To address evolutionary contingencies, the experiments are performed on two lineages departing from different genetic backgrounds. The two lineages display distinct evolutionary trajectories, demonstrating dependency on the starting strains genetic background. Several genes exhibit a high degree of parallelism, suggesting their potential adaptive nature. The growth increase of the representative clones from each final population relative to their ancestor at 15{degrees}C and 43{degrees}C demonstrated no correlation between both temperatures, insinuating an absence of a strong trade-off between these two temperatures. Some had a growth rate decrease at 15{degrees}C unless exposed to a 43{degrees}C epoch, indicating some degree of internalization of the structure of the environment fluctuations. The phenotypic response of the evolved clones at 15{degrees}C and 43{degrees}C was assessed by a phenotype array method. The resulting responses reveal a general tendency to move closer to the phenotypic response of our starting strains at the optimum of 37{degrees}C. This observation expands the documented restorative responses, even when facing complex environmental conditions.\\n\\n2 Author SummaryLaboratory evolution experiments have been widely employed to test hypotheses from evolutionary theory. To assess the dynamics of adaptation under environmental fluctuations, we evolved 24 Escherichia coli populations under different regimes of temperature switching between 15{degrees}C and 43{degrees}C for about 600 generations. At the final point of the evolution experiment, the evolved populations were genome sequenced and clones were isolated and sequenced for phenotypic characterization. Fitness measurements revealed adaptation to both environmental conditions and some strains internalized the environmental fluctuation. Array phenotypic measurements showed that the majority of evolved strains tended to restore the phenotypic signature of the perturbed environments to that of the optimal temperature condition. This observation expands the documented restorative responses, even when facing complex environmental conditions.",

However, the amount of heritable risk explained by these variants is limited, thus leaving most of cancer heritability unexplained.\n\nRecent studies have shown that genomic regions associated with specific biological functions explain a large proportion of the heritability of many traits. Since cancer is mostly triggered by aberrant genes function, we hypothesised that SNPs located in protein-coding genes could explain a significant proportion of cancer heritability.\n\nTo perform this analysis, we developed a new method, called Bayesian Gene HERitability Analysis (BAGHERA), to estimate the heritability explained by all the genotyped SNPs and by those located in protein coding genes directly from GWAS summary statistics.\n\nBy applying BAGHERA to the 38 cancers reported in the UK Biobank, we identified 1, 146 genes explaining a significant amount of cancer heritability. We found these genes to be tumour suppressors directly involved in the hallmark processes controlling the transformation from normal to cancer cell; moreover, these genes also harbour somatic driver mutation for many tumours, suggesting a two-hit model underpinning tumorigenesis.\n\nOur study provides new evidence for a functional role of SNPs in cancer and identifies new targets for risk assessment and patients stratification.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionWhile the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia such as Alzheimers disease (AD) increases, our knowledge on the underlying mechanisms, outcome predictors, or therapeutic targets is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how computational multi-scale brain modelling links phenomena of different scales and therefore identifies potential disease mechanisms leading the way to improved diagnostics and treatment.\n\nMethodsThe Virtual Brain (TVB; thevirtualbrain.org) neuroinformatics platform allows standardized large-scale structural connectivity-based simulations of whole brain dynamics. We provide proof of concept for a novel approach that quantitatively links the effects of altered molecular pathways onto neuronal population dynamics. As a novelty, we connect chemical compounds measured with positron emission tomography (PET) with neural function in TVB addressing the phenomenon of hyperexcitability in AD related to the protein amyloid beta (Abeta). We construct personalized virtual brains based on individual PET derived distributions of Abeta in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N=8) and Alzheimers Disease (AD, N=10) and in age-matched healthy controls (HC, N=15) using data from ADNI-3 data base (http://adni.lni.usc.edu). In the personalized virtual brains, individual Abeta burden modulates regional inhibition, leading to disinhibition and hyperexcitation with high Abeta loads. We analyze simulated regional neural activity and electroencephalograms (EEG).\n\nResultsKnown empirical alterations of EEG in patients with AD compared to HCs were reproduced by simulations. The virtual AD group showed slower frequencies in simulated local field potentials and EEG compared to MCI and HC groups. The heterogeneity of the Abeta load is crucial for the virtual EEG slowing which is absent for control models with homogeneous Abeta distributions. Slowing phenomena primarily affect the network hubs, independent of the spatial distribution of Abeta. Modeling the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism of memantine in local population models, reveals potential functional reversibility of the observed large-scale alterations (reflected by EEG slowing) in virtual AD brains.\n\nDiscussionWe demonstrate how TVB enables the simulation of systems effects caused by pathogenetic molecular candidate mechanisms in human virtual brains.",

We present a methodological framework to evaluate Confidence In the results from Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) when multiple interventions are compared. CINeMA considers six domains and we outline the methods used to form judgements about within-study bias, across-studies bias, indirectness, imprecision, heterogeneity and incoherence. Key to judgements about within-study bias and indirectness is the percentage contribution matrix, which shows how much information each study contributes to the results from network meta-analysis. The use of contribution matrix allows the semi-automation of the process, implemented in a freely available web application (cinema.ispm.ch). In evaluating imprecision, heterogeneity and inconsistency we consider the impact of these components of variability in forming clinical decisions. Via three examples, we show that CINeMA improves transparency and avoids the selective use of evidence when forming judgements, thus limiting subjectivity in the process. CINeMA is easy to apply even in large and complicated networks, like a network involving 18 different antidepressant drugs.",

We developed a microbial-based immunotherapeutic concept for selective delivery of a highly immunogenic tetanus toxoid protein (TT856-1313), into tumor cells by attenuated Listeria monocytogenes, and reactivation of pre-existing TT-specific memory T cells (generated during childhood) to kill infected tumor cells. Thus, TT here functions as an alternative for neoantigens. Treatment of KPC mice with Listeria-TT resulted in TT accumulation in tumors and inside tumor cells, and attraction of predominantly TT-specific memory CD4 T cells. Moreover, gemcitabine (GEM) combined with Listeria-TT significantly improved the migration of CD4 T cells into tumors and the production of perforin and granzyme B, turning cold tumors into immunological hot tumors. In vivo depletion of T cells in Listeria-TT+GEM-treated mice demonstrated CD4 T cell-mediated eradication of tumors and metastases (Mann-Whitney p<0.05). In addition, peritumoral lymph node like structures (LNS) were observed in close contact with the pancreatic tumors displaying CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells of KPC mice treated with Listeria-TT or Listeria-TT+GEM. The production of perforin and granzyme B was observed in LNS of KPC mice that received Listeria-TT+GEM. This combination not only reduced tumor burden (80%) and metastases (87%) significantly (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney), but also improved the survival time of KPC mice with advanced pancreatic cancer substantially (Mantel-Cox p<0.0001).

    "abstract": "G3BP-1 and -2 (hereafter referred to as G3BP) are multifunctional RNA-binding proteins involved in stress granule (SG) assembly. Viruses from diverse families target G3BP for recruitment to replication or transcription complexes in order to block SG assembly but also to acquire pro-viral effects via other unknown functions of G3BP. The Old World alphaviruses, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) recruit G3BP into viral replication complexes, via an interaction between FGDF motifs in the C-terminus of the viral non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) and the NTF2-like domain of G3BP. To study potential proviral roles of G3BP, we used human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cell lines lacking endogenous G3BP generated using CRISPR-Cas9 and reconstituted with a panel of G3BP1 mutants and truncation variants. While SFV replicated with varying efficiency in all cell lines, CHIKV could only replicate in cells expressing G3BP1 variants containing both the NTF2-like and the RGG domains. The ability of SFV to replicate in the absence of G3BP allowed us to study effects of different domains of the protein. We used immunoprecipitation to demonstrate that that both NTF2- like and RGG domains are necessary for the formation a complex between nsP3, G3BP1 and the 40S ribosomal subunit. Electron microscopy of SFV-infected cells revealed that formation of nsP3:G3BP1 complexes via the NTF2-like domain was necessary for clustering of cytopathic vacuoles (CPVs) and that the presence of the RGG domain was necessary for accumulation of electron dense material containing G3BP1 and nsP3 surrounding the CPV clusters. Clustered CPVs also exhibited localised high levels of translation of viral mRNAs as detected by ribopuromycylation staining. These data confirm that G3BP is a ribosomal binding protein and reveal that alphaviral nsP3 uses G3BP to concentrate viral replication complexes and to recruit the translation initiation machinery, promoting the efficient translation of viral mRNAs.",

Deletion of Notch1 in TECs resulted in depletion of mTEC progenitors and dramatic reductions in mTECs during fetal stages, consistent with defects in mTEC specification and progenitor expansion. Conversely, forced Notch signaling in all TEC resulted in widespread expression of mTEC progenitor markers and profound defects in TEC differentiation. In addition, lineage-tracing analysis indicated that all mTECs have a history of receiving a Notch signal, consistent with Notch signaling occurring in mTEC progenitors. Interestingly, this lineage analysis also showed that cTECs are divided between Notch lineage-positive and lineage-negative populations, identifying a previously unknown complexity in the cTEC lineage.",

    "abstract": "Transposons are ubiquitous mobile elements with the potential to trigger genome instability and mutations linked to diseases1,2. Antisense piRNAs guide an adaptive genome immune system that silences established transposons during germline development3, but how the germline responds to new genome invaders is not understood. The KoRV retrovirus infects somatic and germline cells and is sweeping through wild koala populations by a combination of horizontal and vertical transfers, providing a unique opportunity to directly analyze the germline response to retroviral invasions of a mammalian genome4,5. We analyzed genome organization and long RNA and short RNA transcriptomes in testis, liver, and brain from two wild koalas infected with KoRV, while integrating our results with earlier genomic data. Consistent with data from other mammals6,7, koala piRNAs were detected in testis and mapped to both isolated transposon insertions and genic and intergenic piRNA clusters. Established transposon subfamilies produced roughly equal levels of antisense piRNAs, which are the effectors of trans-silencing, and sense piRNAs, which drive ping-pong amplification of these effectors8,9. KoRV piRNAs, in striking contrast, were strongly sense biased in both animals analyzed. These two koalas each carried 60 germline KoRV-A insertions, but only 14 of the insertions were shared, and none of the insertions mapped to piRNA clusters. The sense piRNAs thus appear to be produced by direct processing of the transcripts from isolated proviral insertions. A typical gammaretrovirus, KoRV produces spliced Env mRNAs and unspliced transcripts encoding Gag, Pol, and the viral genome. KoRV Env mRNAs were 5-fold more abundant than the unspliced pre-mRNAs, but 92% of piRNAs were derived from the unspliced pre-mRNAs. We show that this biased piRNA production from unspliced retrotransposon transcripts is conserved from flies to mice. Retroviruses must bypass splicing to replicate; thus, we propose that failed splicing produces a \\\"molecular pattern\\\" on transcripts from retroviral invaders that is recognized by an innate genome immune system, which silences transposons in cis by processing their transcripts into piRNAs. This innate immune response defends the germline until antisense piRNA production--from clusters or isolated insertions--is established to provide sequence-specific adaptive immunity and memory of the genome invader.",

    "abstract": "How we engage with a set of options (e.g., items on a menu) is affected both by the rewards they promise and our goal in choosing between them. Typically, our goal is to maximize potential reward and minimize potential punishment. Previous research on value-based decision-making has characterized how people make decisions with this goal in mind, identifying consistent behavioral and neural signatures associated with how rewarding a set of choice options are, overall and relative to one another. However, these studies suffer from a common confound: in each case, more rewarding options were also more congruent with ones goal of choosing the best option. Previous findings can therefore be accounted for by the reward value or the goal congruency of ones options. To compare these accounts directly, we had participants make choices while their goal varied between choosing the best or the worst option, resulting in situations where either high-reward or low-reward options were most goal-congruent. We found that goal congruency uniquely accounts for past observations that decision speed varies with the overall value of ones options. Within brain regions commonly associated with choice value, fMRI activity was associated with both relative and overall goal congruency. These goal congruency correlates were dissociable from separate correlates of the overall reward associated with a choice set (independent of ones goal). Our findings call for a reinterpretation of previous research on value-based choice, and offer an approach moving forward for disentangling the roles of rewards and goals in how we evaluate our options.\n\nSignificance StatementWhether it is between restaurants or career paths, to make adaptive decisions we must evaluate our options and identify those that are most conducive to our current goal. Dysfunctional decision-making can therefore result from aberrant reward processing (e.g., impulse disorders) or from aberrant goal processing (e.g., OCD, ADHD). By focusing only on how people choose their favorite option in a choice set (when rewards and goals are aligned), past research has been unable to distinguish the degree to which behavior and neural activity are determined by reward versus goal processing. We disentangle these processes and show that behavior and fMRI activity are differentially influenced by the promised rewards versus the degree to which those rewards align with ones current goal.",

Masticatory and esophagus striated muscles (ESM) share a common cardiopharyngeal mesoderm (CPM) origin, however ESM are unusual among striated muscles as they are established in the absence of a primary skeletal muscle scaffold. Using mouse chimeras, we show that the transcription factors Tbx1 and Isl1 are required cell-autonomously for myogenic specification of ESM progenitors. Further, genetic loss-of-function and pharmacological studies point to Met/HGF signalling for antero-posterior migration of esophagus muscle progenitors, where HGF ligand is expressed in adjacent smooth muscle cells. These observations highlight the functional relevance of a smooth and striated muscle progenitor dialogue for ESM patterning. Our findings establish a Tbx1-Isl1-Met genetic hierarchy that uniquely regulate esophagus myogenesis and identify distinct genetic signatures that can be used as a framework to interpret pathologies arising within CPM derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Many germ cells (GCs) are eliminated during development, long before differentiating to egg or sperm, but it is not clear why. Here, we examined how GC composition in the mouse fetal testis is altered by scheduled apoptosis during sex differentiation. Multicolored-lineage tracing revealed that apoptosis affects clonally-related GCs, suggesting that this fate decision occurs autonomously based on shared intrinsic properties. We identified extensive transcriptional heterogeneity among fetal GCs including an apoptosis-susceptible subpopulation delineated by high Trp53 and deviant differentiation. Alternatively, the GC subpopulation most likely to survive was advanced in differentiation. These results indicate that GC developmental fate is based upon discrete and cell-heritable fitnesses and imply that a dichotomy between sex-differentiation and apoptosis coordinates the removal of developmentally incompetent cells to improve gamete quality. Evidence that GC subpopulations are in different epigenetic states suggests that errors in epigenetic reprogramming form the basis of aberrant differentiation and apoptotic selection.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryGerm cells undergo autonomous selection in the fetal testis to promote male differentiation",

    "abstract": "MAIT cells are an abundant innate-like T cell population which can be activated via either their T cell receptor (TCR), which recognizes MR1-bound pyrimidine antigens derived from microbial riboflavin biosynthesis, or via cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-18. In vivo, these two modes of activation may act in concert or independently depending upon the nature of the microbial or inflammatory stimuli. It is unknown, however, how the MAIT cell response differs to the different modes of activation. Here, we define the transcriptional and effector responses of human MAIT cells to TCR and cytokine stimulation. We report that MAIT cells rapidly respond to TCR stimulation through the production of multiple effector cytokines and chemokines, alteration of their cytotoxic granule content and transcription factor expression, and upregulation of co-stimulatory proteins CD40L and 4-1BB. In contrast, cytokine-mediated activation is slower and results in more limited production of cytokines, chemokines, and co-stimulatory proteins; differences in granule content and transcription factor expression are also evident. Therefore, we propose that in infections by riboflavin-synthesizing bacteria, MAIT cells play a key early role in effecting and coordinating the immune response, while in the absence of TCR stimulation (e.g. viral infection) their role is likely to differ.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of intestinal organoids, as a stem cell-based self-renewable model system, has led to many studies on intestinal development and cell-cell signaling. However, potential issues regarding the phenotypic stability and reproducibility of the methodology during culture still needs to be addressed for different organoids. Here we investigated the transcriptomes of intestinal organoids derived from the same pig as well as batch-to-batch variation of organoids derived from different pigs over long-term passage. The set of genes expressed in organoids closely resembled that of the tissue of origin, including location specific functions, for at least 17 passages. Minor differences in gene expression were observed between individual organoid cultures. In contrast, most tissue-specific genes were not expressed in the transformed jejunum cell line IPECJ2, which also showed gene expression consistent with cancer phenotypes. We conclude that intestinal organoids provide a robust and stable model for translational research with clear advantages over transformed cells.",

    "abstract": "Cell communication through extracellular vesicles is an emerging topic in biology, including communication between cells of the immune system. Planar supported lipid bilayers (PSLBs) presenting T cell receptor (TCR) ligands and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) induce budding of extracellular microvesicles enriched in functional TCR, defined here as synaptic ectosomes (SE), from helper T cells. SE bind peptide-MHC directly exporting TCR into the synaptic cleft, but their ability to incorporate other effectors is unknown. Here, we utilized bead supported lipid bilayers (BSLB) to capture SE from single immunological synapses (IS), determined SE composition by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and enriched SE for proteomic analysis by particle sorting. Our results demonstrate selective enrichment of CD40 ligand (CD40L) and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) in SE in response to addition of CD40 and ICOS ligand (ICOSL), respectively, to SLB presenting TCR ligands and ICAM-1. TCR triggering mobilized intracellular CD40L to the T cells surface at the IS, where it engaged CD40 to enable sorting into SE. SEs were enriched in tetraspanins and bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST-2) by immunofluorescence and TCR signalling and endosomal sorting complexes required for transport by proteomics. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrated that CD40L is present in microclusters within CD81 defined SE that are spatially segregated from TCR/ICOS/BST-2 microclusters. CD40L in SE retains the capacity to induce dendritic cell (DC) maturation and cytokine production. SE enabled helper T cells to release effectors physically linked to TCR.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTCR and CD40L microclusters can be linked in synaptic ectosomes (extracellular vesicles) that are released in the immunological synapse by helper T cells and induce dendritic cell maturation and cytokine production.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation and accumulation of microtubule associated protein tau in neurons is major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD) and related tauopathies. Attempts have been made to promote clearance of pathological tau (p-Tau) from neurons via autophagy. Over expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), has shown to clear pTau from neurons via autophagy. However, sustained TFEB activation and/or autophagy can create burden on cellular bioenergetics and can be deleterious. Thus, we engineered a minimally invasive optical system that could transiently alter autophagic flux. We optimized and tested an optogenetic gene expression system derived from a previously engineered bacterial transcription factor, EL222. For the first time, our group utilized this system not only to spatial-temporally control nuclear TFEB expression, we also show light-induced TFEB has the capacity to reduce p-Tau burden in AD patient-derived human iPSC-neurons. Together, these results suggest that optically-regulatable gene expression of TFEB unlocks opto-therapeutics to treat AD and other dementias.",

    "abstract": "Excitatory neurons in the primary motor cortex project bilaterally to the striatum. However, whether synaptic structure and function in ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-striatal pathways is identical or different remains largely unknown. Here, we describe that excitatory synapses in the contralateral pathway have higher levels of NMDA-type of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) than those in the ipsilateral pathway, although both synapses utilize the same presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter. We also show that NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit, but not GluN2A, contribute to this difference. The altered NMDAR subunit composition in these two pathways results in opposite synaptic plasticity: long-term depression in the ipsilateral pathway and long-term potentiation in the contralateral pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of D1 and D2 dopamine (DA) receptors by either selective pharmacological agonists or light-induced release of endogenous DA have no effect on NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission in either pathway. However, blocking basal DAergic tone with either D1 or D2 with selective antagonists revealed that GluN2B-containing NMDARs are modulated by D1 receptors in the contralateral pathway and by D2 receptors in the ipsilateral pathway. Such distinct modulatory actions seem to be permissive rather than sufficient for the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity. Altogether, our results provide novel and unexpected evidence for the lack of bilaterality of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission at cortico-striatal pathways due to differences in the expression of GluN2B subunits, which results in differences in bidirectional synaptic plasticity and modulation by dopaminergic inputs.",
