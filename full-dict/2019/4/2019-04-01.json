    "abstract": "Identifying driver mutations in cancer is notoriously difficult. To date, recurrence of a mutation in patients remains one of the most reliable markers of mutation driver status. However, some mutations are more likely to occur than others due to differences in background mutation rates arising from various forms of infidelity of DNA replication and repair machinery, endogenous, and exogenous mutagens.\\n\\nWe used cancer-type and mutagen-specific mutability to study the contribution of background processes of mutagenesis and DNA repair in shaping the observed mutational spectrum in cancer. We developed and tested probabilistic model that adjusts the number of mutation recurrences in patients by background mutability in order to find mutations which may be under selection in cancer.\\n\\nWe showed that observed recurrence frequency of cancer mutations scaled with the background mutability, especially for tumor suppressor genes. In oncogenes, however, highly recurring mutations were characterized by relatively low mutability, resulting in a U-shaped trend. Mutations not yet observed in any tumor had relatively low mutability values, indicating that background mutability might limit the mutation occurrence.\\n\\nWe compiled a dataset of missense mutations from 58 genes with experimentally validated functional and transforming impacts from different studies. We found that mutability of driver mutations was lower than the mutability of passengers and consequently adjusting mutation recurrence frequency by mutability significantly improved ranking of mutations and driver prediction. Even though no training on existing data was involved, our approach performed similar or better to the existing state-of-the-art methods.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/mutagene/gene",

    "abstract": "Current technologies for targeted characterization and manipulation of viral RNA either involve amplification or ultracentrifugation with isopycnic gradients of viral particles to decrease host RNA background. The former strategy is non-compatible for characterizing properties innate to RNA strands such as secondary structure, RNA-RNA interactions, and also for nanopore direct RNA sequencing involving the sequencing of native RNA strands. The latter strategy, ultracentrifugation, causes loss in genomic information due to its inability to retrieve unassembled viral RNA. We developed a novel nucleic acid manipulation technique involving the capture of whole viral native RNA genomes for downstream RNA assays using hybridization baits in solution to circumvent these problems. This technique involves hybridization of biotinylated baits at 500 nucleotides (nt) intervals, stringent washes and release of free native RNA strands using DNase I treatment, with a turnaround time of about 6 h 15 min. Proof of concept was primarily done using RT-qPCR with dengue virus infected Huh-7 cells. We report that this protocol was able to purify viral RNA (561-791 fold). We also describe a successful application of our capture-based purification method to direct RNA sequencing, with a 77.47% of reads mapping to the target viral genome. We observed a reduction in human host RNA background by 1580 fold, a 99.91% recovery of viral genome with at least 15x coverage, and a mean coverage across the genome of 120x. This report is, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of a capture-based purification method for whole viral RNA genomes. The fundamental advantages of using our capture-based purification method makes it a superior alternative to conventional viral purification methods and would potentially pave a new path for the direct characterization and sequencing of native RNA molecules.",

    "abstract": "Empirical knowledge of ecosystem stability and diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability of population and ecosystem properties. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin organization plays essential roles in cell identity and functions. Here, we demonstrated by hepatocyte-specific inactivation of the genes encoding the three Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1, {beta} and {gamma}) in mice (HP1-TKO) that these proteins are dispensable for hepatocyte activity and survival. Conversely, the chronic absence of these proteins led to a drastic increased incidence of liver tumor development. Molecular characterization of HP1-TKO hepatocytes revealed that HP1 proteins are required for maintenance of histone marks associated with heterochromatin, and for the appropriate expression of large number of genes involved in liver-specific functions as well as in genes encoding for transcriptional repressors of the KRAB-ZFP family. Moreover, several specific endogenous retrovirus families were upregulated in HP1-TKO hepatocytes, leading to the deregulated expression of genes in their vicinity. Our findings indicate that HP1 proteins act as guardians of liver homeostasis to prevent tumor development through the modulation of multiple chromatin-associated events.",

    "abstract": "Living cells proliferate by completing and coordinating two essential cycles, a division cycle that controls cell size, and a DNA replication cycle that controls the number of chromosomal copies in the cell. Despite lacking dedicated cell cycle control regulators such as cyclins in eukaryotes, bacteria such as E. coli manage to tightly coordinate those two cycles across a wide range of growth conditions, including situations where multiple nested rounds of replication progress simultaneously. Various cell cycle models have been proposed to explain this feat, but it has been impossible to validate them so far due to a lack of experimental tools for systematically testing their different predictions. Recently new insights have been gained on the division cycle through the study of the structure of fluctuations in growth, size, and division in individual cells. In particular, it was found that cell size appears to be controlled by an adder mechanism, i.e. the added volume between divisions is held approximately constant and fluctuates independently of growth rate and cell size at birth. However, how replication initiation is regulated and coupled to cell size control remains unclear, mainly due to scarcity of experimental measurements on replication initiation at the single-cell level. Here, we used time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics to directly measure growth, division and replication in thousands of single E. coli cells growing in both slow and fast growth conditions. In order to compare different phenomenological models of the cell cycle, we introduce a statistical framework which assess their ability to capture the correlation structure observed in the experimental data. Using this in combination with stochastic simulations, our data indicate that, instead of thinking of the cell cycle as running from birth to division, the cell cycle is controlled by two adder mechanisms starting at the initiation of replication: the added volume since the last initiation event controls the timing of both the next division event and the next replication initiation event. Interestingly the double-adder mechanism identified in this study has recently been found to explain the more complex cell cycle of mycobacteria, suggesting shared control strategies across species.",

    "abstract": "Desensitization is a canonical property of ligand-gated ion channels, causing progressive current decline in the continued presence of agonist. AMPA-type glutamate receptors, which mediate fast excitatory signaling throughout the brain, exhibit profound desensitization. Recent cryo-EM studies of AMPAR assemblies show their ion channels to be closed in the desensitized state. Here we report the surprising finding that homomeric Q/R edited AMPARs still allow ions to flow when the receptors are desensitized. GluA2(R) expressed alone, or with auxiliary subunits ({gamma}-2, {gamma}-8 or GSG1L), generates large steady-state currents and anomalous current-variance relationships. Using fluctuation analysis, single-channel recording, and kinetic modeling we demonstrate that the steady-state current is mediated predominantly by  conducting desensitized receptors. When combined with crystallography this unique functional readout of a hith-erto silent state enabled us to examine cross-linked cysteine mutants to probe the conformation of the desensitized ligand binding domain of functioning AMPAR complexes within the plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to form serpentine cords is intrinsically related to its virulence, but specifically how M. tuberculosis cording contributes to pathogenesis remains obscure. We show that several M. tuberculosis clinical isolates form intracellular cords in primary human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLEC) in vitro and also in the lymph nodes of patients with tuberculosis. We identified via RNA-seq a transcriptional programme in hLEC that activates cellular pro-survival and cytosolic surveillance of intracellular pathogens pathways. Consistent with this, cytosolic access of hLEC is required for intracellular M. tuberculosis cording; and cord formation is dependent on the M. tuberculosis ESX-1 type VII secretion system and the mycobacterial lipid PDIM. Finally, we show that M. tuberculosis cording is a novel size-dependent mechanism used by the pathogen to evade xenophagy in the cytosol of endothelial cells. These results provide a mechanism that explains the long-standing association between M. tuberculosis cording and virulence.",

Likewise, the effect of the antibody on the function of these inhibitors is also less studied. In this study, we present a thorough inspection of the mechanism of the conformational flexibility induced by a CD4-mimetic inhibitor, NBD-557, using Molecular Dynamics Simulations and free energy calculations. Our result shows a functional importance of Asn239 in substrate instigated conformational dynamics in gp120. The MD simulations of Asn239Gly mutant provide a less dynamic gp120 in the presence of NBD-557 without incapacitating the binding enthalpy of NBD-557. The MD simulations of complex with the antibody clearly shows the enhanced affinity of NBD-557 due to the presence of the antibody which is in good agreement with experimental Isothermal Titration Calorimetry results (Biochemistry 2006, 45, 10973-10980).",

    "abstract": "The bacterial Sec translocon is a multi-component protein complex responsible for translocating diverse proteins across the plasma membrane. For post-translational protein translocation, the Sec-channel - SecYEG - associates with the motor protein SecA to mediate the ATP-dependent transport of unfolded pre-proteins across the membrane. Based on the structure of the machinery, combined with ensemble and single molecule analysis, a diffusional based Brownian ratchet mechanism for protein secretion has been proposed [Allen et al. eLife 2016;5:e15598]. However, the conformational dynamics required to facilitate this mechanism have not yet been fully resolved. Here, we employ hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to reveal striking nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in the Sec protein-channel. In addition to the ATP-dependent opening of SecY, reported previously, we observe a counteracting, also ATP-dependent, constriction of SecA around the mature regions of the pre-protein. Thus, ATP binding causes SecY to open and SecA to close, while ATP hydrolysis has the opposite effect. This alternating behaviour could help impose the directionality of the Brownian ratchet for protein transport through the Sec machinery, and possibly in translocation systems elsewhere. The results highlight the power of HDX-MS for interrogating the dynamic mechanisms of diverse membrane proteins; including their interactions with small molecules such as nucleotides (ATPases and GTPases) and inhibitors (e.g. antibiotics).",

Here, we show that the Nix transgene alone was sufficient to convert females into fertile males, which continued to produce sex-converted progeny in subsequent generations. However, assisted mating with wild-type females was necessary, as the converted m/m males could not fly. Knockout of myo-sex, a myosin heavy chain gene and the only other protein-coding gene reported in the M locus, rendered wild-type males flightless. Thus, Nix alone converts female Ae. aegypti to fertile males and myo-sex is required for male flight. Only female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes bite and transmit disease-causing viruses. Nix-mediated female-to-male conversion is 100% penetrant and stable over many generations, indicating great potential for mosquito control.",

    "abstract": "The encoder/decoder paradigm suggests that signaling networks transform information about the extracellular environment into specific signaling patterns that are then read by downstream effectors to control cellular behavior. Previous work used information theoretical tools to analyze the fidelity of encoding using dynamic signaling patterns. However, as the overall fidelity depends on both encoding and decoding, it is important to consider information loss during signal decoding. Here we used NFkB signaling as a model to understand the accuracy of signal decoding. Using a detailed mathematical model we simulated realistic NFkB signaling patterns with different degrees of variability. The NFkB patterns were used as an input to a simple gene expression model. Analysis of information transmission between ligand and NFkB and ligand and gene expression allow us to determine information loss in both encoding and decoding steps. Information loss could occur due to biochemical noise or due to lack of specificity in decoding response. We found that noise free decoding has very little information loss suggesting that decoding through gene expression can preserve specificity in NFkB patterns. As expected, information transmission through a noisy decoder suffers from information loss. Interestingly, this effect can be mitigated by a specific choice of decoding parameters that can substantially reduce information loss due to biochemical noise during signal decoding. Overall our results show that optimal decoding of dynamic patterns can preserve ligand specificity to maximize the accuracy of cellular response to environmental cues.\\n\\nSynopsisThe fidelity of signal transduction depends on the accurate encoding of ligand information in specific signaling patterns and the reliable decoding of these patterns by downstream gene expression machinery.

    "abstract": "Bacterial speck, caused by the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, is one of the most common diseases in tomato production. Together with Pto kinase, the NLR (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing) protein Prf confers resistance against the bacterial speck pathogen by recognizing AvrPto and AvrPtoB, two Type III effector proteins secreted by P. syringae pv. tomato. This Prf/Pto pathway is part of a complex NLR network in solanaceous plants that mediates resistance to diverse pathogens through the helper NLR proteins NRCs (NLR required for cell death). We previously showed that, in Nicotiana benthamiana, the hypersensitive cell death elicited by expression of AvrPto and Pto, which activate immunity through the endogenous Prf ortholog NbPrf, requires functionally redundant NRC2 and NRC3. However, whether tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Prf (SlPrf) confers resistance to the bacterial speck pathogen through NRC2 and NRC3 has not been determined. In this study, we show that SlPrf requires NRC2 and NRC3 to trigger hypersensitive cell death and disease resistance in both N. benthamiana and tomato. We found that the hypersensitive cell death induced by AvrPtoB/Pto/SlPrf in N. benthamiana is compromised when NRC2 and NRC3 are silenced, indicating that SlPrf is an NRC2/3-dependent NLR. We validated this finding by showing that silencing NRC2 and NRC3 in the bacterial speck resistant tomato  Rio Grande 76R compromised Prf-mediated resistance. These results indicate that the NRC network extends beyond N. benthamiana to solanaceous crops.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in regulating bone formation and homeostasis. Genomic variations within miRNA target sites may therefore be important sources of genetic differences in osteoporosis risk. To investigate this possibility, we searched for miRNA recognition sites within genes using the TargetScan, miRNASNP and miRbase databases. In this study, we showed that miR-544a differentially regulated the allele variants of rs6932603 in the CCDC170 3 ' untranslated (3'-UTR). We also showed that miR-544a suppressed osteogenesis and promoted osteoclastogenesis by regulating the expressions of Runx2, Osterix, Alp, Col1a1, Osteopontin (OPN) ,Osteocalcin (OCN) and Osteoprotegerin (OPG). Our results suggest that allele-specific regulation of CCDC170 by miR-544a explains the observed disease risk, and provides a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis therapy.",

The current study was aimed mainly to evaluate the correlation between thyroid hormones and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance in Saudi obese women with metabolic syndrome.\\n\\nMethods100 obese women aged 25 to 55 years were clinically evaluated, from which 72 women were diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome and 28 without metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance was quantified using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance method and the resulting values were analyzed for association with demographic, clinical, and metabolic parameters.\\n\\nResultsThis analysis revealed that body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and biochemical parameters and fasting insulin showed statistically higher levels in the group with metabolic syndrome compared to the group without metabolic syndrome. Similarly, values of waist circumference, fat ratio, cholesterol, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance results were higher in the group with metabolic syndrome as compared to the group without metabolic syndrome. Correlation analysis revealed positive association of thyroid-stimulating hormone with waist circumference (P=0.01), total cholesterol (P=0.002), fasting insulin (P=0.03) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance results (P<0.01), and negatively associated with diastolic blood pressure (P=0.013) and age (P=0.05). Free thyroxine was positively associated with triglyceride level (P=0.003) and negatively associated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance values (P=0.035) and fasting insulin.

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of cellular pathways is a crucial mechanism of drug resistance and survival in refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. In the present study, we performed an unbiased gene expression analysis and identified a dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration program in drug-resistant ALL cells grown in a co-culture system with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). Specifically, the activity of the complexes within the electron transport chain was significantly downregulated, correlated with decreased mitochondrial mass and ATP production in drug-resistant ALL cells. To validate mitochondrial respiration as a druggable target, we utilized pyrvinium pamoate (PP), a known inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration and documented its anti-leukemic activity in several ALL cell lines grown alone or in co-culture with BMSC. To increase the bioavailability profile of PP, we successfully encapsulated PP in a nanoparticle drug delivery system and demonstrated that it retained its anti-leukemic activity in a hemosphere assay. PP anti-leukemic activity was decreased by the addition of sodium pyruvate, and furthermore, PP was found to have an additive anti-leukemic effect when used in combination with rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor with activity similar to PP on the mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, PPs cell death activity was found to be specific for leukemic cells as primary normal immune cells were resistant to PP-mediated cell death. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PP is a novel therapeutic lead compound that counteracts the respiratory reprogramming found in refractory ALL cells.",

    "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau is an important component of the global carbon cycle due to the large permafrost carbon pool and its vulnerability to climate warming. The Tibetan Plateau has experienced a noticeable warming over the past few decades and is projected to continue warming in the future. However, the direction and magnitude of carbon fluxes responses to climate change and elevated CO2 concentration under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios in the Tibetan Plateau grassland are poorly known. Here, we used a calibrated and validated biogeochemistry model, CENTURY, to quantify the contributions of climate change and elevated CO2 on the future carbon budget in the alpine grassland under three RCP scenarios. Though the Tibetan Plateau grassland was projected a net carbon sink of 16 ~ 25 Tg C yr-1 in the 21st century, the capacity of carbon sequestration was predicted to decrease gradually because climate-driven increases in heterotrophic respiration (Rh) (with linear slopes 0.49 ~ 1.62 g C m-2 yr-1) was greater than the net primary production (NPP) (0.35 ~ 1.52 g C m-2 yr-1). However, the elevated CO2 contributed more to plant growth (1.9% ~ 7.3%) than decomposition (1.7% ~ 6.1%), which could offset the warming-induced carbon loss. The interannual and decadal-scale dynamics of the carbon fluxes in the alpine grassland were primarily controlled by temperature, while the role of precipitation became increasingly important in modulating carbon cycle. The strengthened correlation between precipitation and carbon budget suggested that further research should consider the performance of precipitation in evaluating carbon dynamics in a warmer climate scenario.",

    "abstract": "Oral and fecal microbial biomarkers have previously been associated with cardiometabolic (CM) risk, however, no comprehensive attempt has been made to explore this association in minority populations or across different geographic regions. We characterized gut- and oral-associated microbiota and CM risk in 655 participants of African-origin, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, and the United States (US). CM risk was classified using the CM risk cut-points for elevated waist circumference, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasted blood glucose, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and elevated triglycerides. Gut-associated bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with elevated blood pressure and elevated fasted blood glucose. Similarly, gut bacterial beta diversity was also significantly differentiated by waist circumference, blood pressure, triglyceridemia and HDL-cholesterolemia. Notably, differences in inter- and intra-personal gut microbial diversity were geographic-region specific. Participants meeting the cut-points for 3 out of the 5 CM risk factors were significantly more enriched with Lachnospiraceae, and were significantly depleted of Clostridiaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Prevotella. The predicted relative proportions of the genes involved in the pathways for lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and butyrate synthesis were also significantly differentiated by the CM risk phenotype, whereby genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine, glutarate and 4-aminobutyrate/succinate pathways and LPS synthesis pathway were enriched in participants with greater CM risk. Furthermore, inter-individual oral microbiota diversity was also significantly associated with the CM risk factors, and oral-associated Streptococcus, Prevotella, and Veillonella were enriched in participants with 3 out of the 5 CM risk factors. We demonstrate that in a diverse cohort of African-origin adults, CM risk is significantly associated with reduced microbial diversity, and the enrichment of specific bacterial taxa and predicted functional traits in both gut and oral environments. As well as providing new insights into the associations between the gut and oral microbiota and CM risk, this study also highlights the potential for novel therapeutic discoveries which target the oral and gut microbiota in CM risk.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that higher-order interactions can increase the stability, promote the diversity, and better explain the dynamics of ecological communities. Yet, it remains unclear whether the perceived benefits of adding higher-order terms into population dynamics models come from fundamental principles or a simple mathematical advantage given by the nature of multivariate polynomials. Here, we develop a general method to quantify the mathematical advantage of adding higher-order interactions in ecological models based on the number of free-equilibrium points that can be engineered in a system (i.e., equilibria that can be feasible or unfeasible by tunning model parameters). We apply this method to calculate the number of free-equilibrium points in Lotka-Volterra dynamics. While it is known that Lotka-Volterra models without higher-order interactions only have one free-equilibrium point regardless of the number of parameters, we find that by adding higher-order terms this number increases exponentially with the dimension of the system. Our results suggest that while adding higher-order interactions in ecological models may be good for prediction purposes, they cannot provide additional explanatory power of ecological dynamics if model parameters are not ecologically restricted.",

    "abstract": "Inferring interactions between populations of different species is a challenging statistical endeavour, which requires a large amount of data. There is therefore some incentive to combine all available sources of data into a single analysis to do so. In demography and single-population studies, Integrated Population Models combine population counts, capture-recapture and reproduction data to fit matrix population models. Here, we extend this approach to the community level in a stage-structured predator-prey context. We develop Integrated Community Models (ICMs), implemented in a Bayesian framework, to fit multispecies nonlinear matrix models to multiple data sources. We assessed the value of the different sources of data using simulations of ICMs under different scenarios contrasting data availability. We found that combining all data types (capture-recapture, counts, and reproduction) allows the estimation of both demographic and interaction parameters, unlike count-only data which typically generate high bias and low precision in interaction parameter estimates for short time series. Moreover, reproduction surveys informed the estimation of interactions particularly well when compared to capture-recapture programs, and have the advantage of being less costly. Overall, ICMs offer an accurate representation of stage structure in community dynamics, and foster the development of efficient observational study designs to monitor communities in the field.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundShigella is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigella invades cells of the colonic mucosa owing to its virulence plasmid-encoded Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS), and multiplies in the target cell cytosol. Although the laboratory reference strain S. flexneri serotype 5a M90T has been extensively used to understand the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis, its complete genome sequence is not available, thereby greatly limiting studies employing high-throughput sequencing and systems biology approaches.\\n\\nResultsWe have sequenced, assembled, annotated and manually curated the full genome of S. flexneri 5a M90T. This yielded two complete circular contigs, the chromosome and the virulence plasmid (pWR100). To obtain the genome sequence, we have employed long-read PacBio DNA sequencing followed by polishing with Illumina RNA-seq data. This provides a new pipeline to prepare gapless, highly accurate genome sequences. Furthermore, we have performed genome-wide analysis of transcriptional start sites and determined the length of 5 untranslated regions (5-UTRs) at typical culture conditions for the inoculum of in vitro infection experiments. We identified 6,723 primary TSS (pTSS) and 7,328 secondary TSS (sTSS). The S. flexneri 5a M90T annotated genome sequence and the transcriptional start sites are integrated into RegulonDB (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx) and RSAT (http://embnet.ccg.unam.mx/rsat/) to use its analysis tools in S. flexneri 5a M90T genome.\\n\\nConclusionsWe provide the first complete genome for S. flexneri serotype 5a, specifically the laboratory reference strain M90T. Our work opens the possibility of employing S. flexneri M90T in high-quality systems biology studies such as transcriptomic and differential expression analyses or in genome evolution studies. Moreover, the catalogue of TSS that we report here can be used in molecular pathogenesis studies as a resource to know which genes are transcribed before infection of host cells. The genome sequence, together with the analysis of transcriptional start sites, is also a valuable tool for precise genetic manipulation of S. flexneri 5a M90T. The hybrid pipeline that we report here combining genome sequencing with long-reads technology and polishing with RNAseq data defines a powerful strategy for genome assembly, polishing and annotation in any type of organism.",

    "abstract": "The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as a human pathogen is due in part to its ability to survive stress conditions, such as hypoxia or nutrient deprivation, by entering non-growing states. In these low-metabolic states, Mtb can tolerate antibiotics and develop genetically encoded antibiotic resistance, making its metabolic adaptation to stress crucial for survival. Numerous bacteria, including Mtb, have been shown to reduce their rates of mRNA degradation under growth limitation and stress. While the existence of this response appears to be conserved across species, the underlying bacterial mRNA stabilization mechanisms remains unknown. To better understand the biology of non-growing mycobacteria, we sought to identify the mechanisms by which mRNA stabilization occurs using the non-pathogenic model Mycobacterium smegmatis. We found that mRNA half-life was responsive to energy stress, with carbon starvation and hypoxia causing global mRNA stabilization. This global mRNA stabilization was rapidly reversed when hypoxia-adapted cultures were re-exposed to oxygen, even in the absence of new transcription. The stringent response and RNase protein levels did not explain mRNA stabilization, nor did transcript abundance. This led us to hypothesize that metabolic changes during growth cessation impact the activity of degradation proteins, increasing mRNA stability. Indeed, bedaquiline and isoniazid, two drugs with opposing effects on cellular energy status, had opposite effects on mRNA half-lives in growth-arrested cells. Taken together, our results indicate that mRNA stability in mycobacteria is not directly regulated by growth status, but rather seems to be dependent on the status of energy metabolism.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe logistics of treating tuberculosis are difficult, requiring multiple drugs for at least six months. Mtb is able to survive within the human host in part by entering non-growing states in which it is metabolically less active, thus rendering it less susceptible to antibiotics. Basic knowledge on how Mtb survives during these low-metabolic states is incomplete, and we postulate that optimized energy resource management -such as transcriptome stabilization--is important for survival. Here we report that mRNA stabilization (increased mRNA half-lives) is a common feature of mycobacteria under stress (e.g. hypoxia and nutrient deprivation) but is not dependent on the mechanisms that have been most often postulated in the literature. Finally, we found that mRNA stability and growth status can be decoupled by a drug that causes growth arrest but increases metabolic activity, indicating that mRNA stability responds to metabolic status rather than to growth rate changes per se. Our findings suggest a need to re-orient the study of global mRNA stabilization to identify novel mechanisms that are presumably responsible.",

    "abstract": "Plant reproductive tissues (PRTs) can decrease (via reduced consumption) or increase (via numerical response) an omnivores consumption of animal prey. Although PRTs can increase predation pressure through numerical responses of omnivores, PRTs may also suppress predation by increasing omnivore interactions with conspecifics. Despite this potential, studies of the impacts of PRTs on predation by omnivores often overlook the effect of these tissues on intraspecific interactions between omnivores. We designed three studies to examine how PRTs and conspecific density impact prey consumption by ladybeetle omnivores. First, we assessed how PRTs impact scale insect consumption by isolated ladybeetles. Second, we measured how PRTs influence ladybeetle prey suppression when numerical responses were possible. Third, because initial experiments suggested the consumption rates of individual ladybeetles depended upon conspecific density, we compared per capita consumption rates of ladybeetles across ladybeetle density. PRTs did not influence prey consumption by isolated ladybeetles. When numerical responses were possible, PRTs did not influence total predation on prey despite increasing ladybeetle density, suggesting that PRTs decreased per capita prey consumption by ladybeetles. The discrepancy between our lab and field studies is likely a consequence of differences in ladybeetle density - the presence of only two other conspecifics decreased per capita prey consumption by 76%. Our findings suggest that PRTs may not alter the population level effects of omnivores on prey when omnivore numerical responses are offset by reductions in per capita predation rate.",

We found no support for strong, discrete population structure, but found substantial support for isolation by geographic distance (IBD) in both species. Using generalised dissimilarity modelling, we identified additional isolation by environment (IBE). Eucalyptus albens showed moderate IBD, and environmental variables have a small but significant amount of additional predictive power (i.e., IBE). Eucalyptus sideroxylon showed much stronger IBD, and moderate IBE. These results highlight the vast adaptive potential of these species, and set the stage for testing evolutionary hypotheses of interspecific adaptive differentiation across environments.",

Here we aim at establishing a deeper understanding of the complex multilocus dynamics underlying such speciation transitions under resource competition. In reality, a single populations resource utilization can never exactly match a resource distribution, making residual selection pressures inevitable. We find that this commonly leads to three-phase transitions to reproductive isolation. First, partial assortativity emerges, quickly adjusting a populations variance to the resource distributions variance. Second, allelic variance slowly erodes across loci, allowing an increasingly bimodal phenotype distribution to emerge. Third, a fast transition occurs toward full bimodality in conjunction with practically complete reproductive isolation of the emerging two species. The first phase is driven by frequency-dependent divergent ecological selection. The second phase is driven by self-accelerating residual ecological selection: the more loci code for the selected phenotype, the slower is this intermediate phase. The third phase is driven by self-accelerating sexual selection. We study three types of mismatch-driven speciation, resulting from (i) incongruences between the shapes of resource distributions and competition kernels, (ii) low numbers of loci, and (iii) premature cessations of the first phases variance expansion. Our results suggest that the incomplete separation of incipient species, a characteristic of the second phase, is common in nature, which is likely resulting in detectable genetic footprints of three-phase transitions to reproductive isolation occurring in nature.",

    "abstract": "Cells in largely non-mitotic tissues such as the brain are prone to stochastic (epi-)genetic alterations that may cause increased variability between cells and individuals over time. Although increased inter-individual heterogeneity in gene expression was previously reported, whether this process starts during development or if it is restricted to the aging period has not yet been studied. The regulatory dynamics and functional significance of putative aging-related heterogeneity are also unknown. Here we address these by a meta-analysis of 19 transcriptome datasets from diverse human brain regions. We observed a significant increase in inter-individual heterogeneity during aging (20+ years) compared to postnatal development (0 to 20 years). Increased heterogeneity during aging was consistent among different brain regions at the gene level and associated with lifespan regulation and neuronal functions. Overall, our results show that increased expression heterogeneity is a characteristic of aging human brain, and may influence aging-related changes in brain functions.",

    "abstract": "Zymoseptoria tritici is a filamentous fungus causing Septoria tritici blotch in wheat. The pathogen has a narrow host range and infections of grasses other than susceptible wheat are blocked early after stomatal penetration. During these abortive infections the fungus shows a markedly different expression pattern. However, the underlying mechanisms causing differential gene expression during host and non-host interaction are largely unknown, but likely include transcriptional regulators responsible for the onset of an infection program in compatible hosts. In the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, MoCOD1, a member of the fungal Zn(II)2Cys6 transcription factor family, has been shown to directly affect pathogenicity. Here, we analyse the role of the putative transcription factor Zt107320, a homolog of MoCOD1, during infection of compatible and incompatible hosts by Z. tritici. We show for the first time that Zt107320 is differentially expressed in host versus non-host infections and that lower expression corresponds to an incompatible infection of non-hosts. Applying reverse genetics approaches we further show that Zt107320 regulates the dimorphic switch as well as the growth rate of Z. tritici and affects fungal cell wall composition in vitro. Moreover, {Delta}Zt107320 mutants showed reduced virulence during compatible infections of wheat. We conclude that Zt107320 directly influences pathogen fitness and propose that Zt107320 regulates growth processes and pathogenicity during infection. Our results suggest that this putative transcription factor is involved in discriminating compatible and non-compatible infections.",

    "abstract": "Gait analysis is used widely in clinical practice for the evaluation of abnormal gait caused by disease. Conventionally, medical professionals use motion capture systems or make visual observations to evaluate a patients gait. Recent biomedical engineering studies have proposed easy-to-use gait analysis methods involving wearable sensors with inertial measurement units (IMUs). IMUs placed on the shanks just above the ankles allow for the long-term monitoring of gait because the participant can walk with or without shoes during the analysis. As far as the authors know, there is no report of the gait analysis method that estimates stride length, gait speed, stride duration, stance duration, and swing duration at the same time. In this study, we tested a proposed gait analysis method that uses IMUs attached on the shanks to estimate foot trajectory and temporal gait parameters. We evaluated this proposed method by analyzing the gait of 10 able-bodied participants (mean age 23.1 years, nine men and one woman). Wearable sensors were attached to the participants shanks, and we measured three-axis acceleration and three-axis angular velocity with the sensors to estimate foot trajectory during walking. We compared gait parameters estimated from the foot trajectory obtained with the proposed method and those measured with a motion capture system. Mean accuracy (mean {+/-} standard deviation) was -0.046 {+/-} 0.026 m for stride length, -0.036 {+/-} 0.026 m/s for gait speed, -0.002 {+/-} 0.019 s for stride duration, -0.000 {+/-} 0.016 s for stance duration, and -0.002 {+/-} 0.022 s for swing duration.

    "abstract": "The availability of renewable energy technologies is increasing dramatically across the globe thanks to their growing maturity. However, large scale electrical energy storage and retrieval will almost certainly be a required in order to raise the penetration of renewable sources into the grid. No present energy storage technology has the perfect combination of high power and energy density, low financial and environmental cost, lack of site restrictions, long cycle and calendar lifespan, easy materials availability, and fast response time. Engineered electroactive microbes could address many of the limitations of current energy storage technologies by enabling rewired carbon fixation, a process that spatially separates reactions that are normally carried out together in a photosynthetic cell and replaces the least efficient with non-biological equivalents. If successful, this could allow storage of renewable electricity through electrochemical or enzymatic fixation of carbon dioxide and subsequent storage as carbon-based energy storage molecules including hydrocarbon and non-volatile polymers at high efficiency. In this article we compile performance data on biological and non-biological component choices for rewired carbon fixation systems and identify pressing research and engineering challenges.",

    "abstract": "Diverse algorithms can integrate transcriptomics with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to build context-specific metabolic models. These algorithms require identification of a list of high confidence (core) reactions from transcriptomics, but parameters related to identification of core reactions, such as thresholding of expression profiles, can significantly change model content. Importantly, current thresholding approaches are burdened with setting singular arbitrary thresholds for all genes; thus, resulting in removal of enzymes needed in small amounts and even many housekeeping genes. Here, we describe StanDep, a novel heuristic method for using transcriptomics to identify core reactions prior to building context-specific metabolic models. StanDep clusters gene expression data based on their expression pattern across different contexts and determines thresholds for each cluster using data-dependent statistics, specifically standard deviation and mean. To demonstrate the use of StanDep, we built hundreds of models for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. These models successfully increased the inclusion of housekeeping reactions, which are often lost in models built using standard thresholding approaches. Further, StanDep also provided a transcriptomic explanation for inclusion of lowly expressed reactions that were otherwise only supported by model extraction methods. Our study also provides novel insights into how cells may deal with context-specific and ubiquitous functions. StanDep, as a MATLAB toolbox, is available at https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/StanDep",

    "abstract": "The Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) comprises a large monophyletic group of bacterial lineages known almost exclusively based on genomes obtained using cultivation-independent methods. Within the CPR, Gracilibacteria (BD1-5) are particularly poorly understood due to undersampling and the inherent fragmented nature of available genomes. Here, we report the first closed, curated genome of a Gracilibacteria from an enrichment experiment inoculated from the Gulf of Mexico and designed to investigate hydrocarbon degradation. The gracilibacterium rose in abundance after the community switched to dominance by Colwellia. Notably, we predict that this gracilibacterium completely lacks glycolysis, the pentose phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways. It appears to acquire pyruvate, acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate via degradation of externally derived citrate, malate and amino acids and may use compound interconversion and oxidoreductases to generate and recycle reductive power. The initial genome assembly was fragmented in an unusual gene that is hypervariable within a repeat region. Such extreme local variation is rare, but characteristic of genes that confer traits under pressure to diversify within a population. Notably, the four major repeated 9-mer nucleotide sequences all generate a proline-threonine-aspartic acid (PTD) repeat. The genome of an abundant Colwellia psychrerythraea population has a large extracellular protein that also contains the repeated PTD motif. Although we do not know the host for the BD1-5 cell, the high relative abundance of the C. psychrerythraea population and the shared surface protein repeat may indicate an association between these bacteria.\\n\\nImportanceCPR bacteria are generally predicted to be symbionts due to their extensive biosynthetic deficits. Although monophyletic, they are not monolithic in terms of their lifestyles. The organism described here appears to have evolved an unusual metabolic platform not reliant on glucose or pentose sugars. Its biology appears to be centered around bacterial host-derived compounds and/or cell detritus. Amino acids likely provide building blocks for nucleic acids, peptidoglycan and protein synthesis. We resolved an unusual repeat region that would be invisible without genome curation. The nucleotide sequence is apparently under strong diversifying selection but the amino acid sequence is under stabilizing selection. The amino acid repeat also occurs in a surface protein of a coexisting bacterium, suggesting co-location and possibly interdependence.",

    "abstract": "Divergent accounts of how choices are represented by neural populations have led to conflicting explanations of the underlying mechanisms of decision-making, ranging from persistent, attractor-based dynamics to transient, sequence-based dynamics. To evaluate these mechanisms, we characterize the spatial and temporal structure of choice representations in large neural populations in prefrontal cortex. We find that the pronounced diversity of choice responses across neurons reflects only a few, mostly persistent population patterns recruited at progressively later times before and after a choice. Brief sequential activity occurs during a saccadic choice, but is entirely absent in a delay preceding it. The diversity of choice responses, which could result from almost-random connectivity in the underlying circuits, instead largely reflects the topographical arrangement of response-field properties across the cortical surface. This spatial organization appears to form a fixed scaffold upon which the context-dependent representations of task-specific variables often observed in prefrontal cortex can be learned.",

    "abstract": "It is common to consider a data-intensive strategy to be an appropriate way to develop systemic analyses in biology and physiology. Therefore, options for data collection, sampling, standardization, visualization, and interpretation determine how causes are identified in time series to build mathematical models. However, there are often biases in the collected data that can affect the validity of the model: while collecting enough large datasets seems to be a good strategy for reducing the bias of the collected data, persistent and dynamical anomalies in the data structure can affect the overall validity of the model. In this work we present a methodology based on the definition of homological groups to evaluate persistent anomalies in the structure of the sampled time series. In this evaluation relevant patterns in the combination of different time series are clustered and grouped to customize the identification of causal relationships between parameters. We test this methodology on data collected from patients using mobile sensors to test the response to physical exercise in real-world conditions and outside the lab. With this methodology we plan to obtain a patient stratification of the time series to customize models in medicine.",

Here we move from identifying sex-specific optimal diets to understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie male and female responses to dietary variation. We examine male and female gene expression on male-optimal (carbohydrate-rich) and female-optimal (protein-rich) diets. We find that the sexes share a large core of metabolic genes that are concordantly regulated in response to dietary composition. However, we also observe smaller sets of genes with divergent and opposing regulation, most notably in reproductive genes which are over-expressed on each sexs optimal diet. Our results suggest that nutrient sensing output emanating from a shared metabolic machinery are reversed in males and females, leading to opposing diet-dependent regulation of reproduction in males and females.

    "abstract": "Incorporating measurements on correlated traits into genomic prediction models can increase prediction accuracy and selection gain. However, multi-trait genomic prediction models are complex and prone to overfitting which may result in a loss of prediction accuracy relative to single-trait genomic prediction. Cross-validation is considered the gold standard method for selecting and tuning models for genomic prediction in both plant and animal breeding. When used appropriately, cross-validation gives an accurate estimate of the prediction accuracy of a genomic prediction model, and can effectively choose among disparate models based on their expected performance in real data. However, we show that a naive cross-validation strategy applied to the multi-trait prediction problem can be severely biased and lead to sub-optimal choices between single and multi-trait models when secondary traits are used to aid in the prediction of focal traits and these secondary traits are measured on the individuals to be tested. We use simulations to demonstrate the extent of the problem and propose three partial solutions: 1) a parametric solution from selection index theory, 2) a semi-parametric method for correcting the cross-validation estimates of prediction accuracy, and 3) a fully non-parametric method which we call CV2*: validating model predictions against focal trait measurements from genetically related individuals. The current excitement over high-throughput phenotyping suggests that more comprehensive phenotype measurements will be useful for accelerating breeding programs. Using an appropriate cross-validation strategy should more reliably determine if and when combining information across multiple traits is useful.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between NOD2 and TLR2 following recognition of components of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan is well established, however their role in redirecting metabolic pathways in myeloid cells to degrade pathogens and mount antigen presentation remains unclear. We show NOD2 and TLR2 mediate phosphorylation of the deubiquitinase ataxin-3 via RIPK2 and TBK1. In myeloid cells ataxin-3 associates with the mitochondrial cristae protein MIC60, and is required for oxidative phosphorylation. Depletion of ataxin-3 leads to impaired induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) and defective bacterial killing. A mass spectrometry analysis of NOD2/TLR2 triggered ataxin-3 deubiquitination targets revealed immunometabolic regulators, including HIF-1 and LAMTOR1 that may contribute to these effects. Thus, we define how ataxin-3 plays an essential role in NOD2 and TLR2 sensing and effector functions in myeloid cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementIn recent years it has become clear that cross-talk between metabolic and immune pathways is central to the regulation of host defence. This interplay appears of particular importance in myeloid cells including dendritic cells and macrophages, but it is unclear how two of their key bacterial sensors NOD2 and TLR2 influence metabolism. Here, we define how NOD2/TLR2 signal in myeloid cells to drive optimal mitochondrial functioning required for bacterial destruction. We uncover a new role for Ataxin-3, a deubiquitinase required for non-selective autophagy, in this pathway. We provide a non-biased analysis of Ataxin-3 targets generating evidence for a role in deubiquitination of metabolic mediators during myeloid cell differentiation that will provide an important basis for further study.",

The results show that global and local measures of brain activity did not differ between chronic pain patients and a healthy control group. However, we observed significantly increased connectivity at theta (4 - 8 Hz) and gamma (> 60 Hz) frequencies in frontal brain areas as well as global network reorganization at gamma frequencies in chronic pain patients. Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm could differentiate between patients and healthy controls with an above-chance accuracy of 57%, mostly based on frontal connectivity. These results implicate increased theta and gamma synchrony in frontal brain areas in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. While substantial challenges concerning accuracy, specificity and validity of potential EEG-based disease markers remain to be overcome, our study identifies abnormal frontal synchrony at theta and gamma frequencies as promising targets for non-invasive brain stimulation and/or neurofeedback approaches.",

    "abstract": "Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in CTNS, encoding a cystine transporter, and in its severest form is characterized by cystine accumulation, renal proximal tubule dysfunction and kidney failure. Cystinosis is treated with the cystine-depleting drug cysteamine, however this only slows progression of the disease and there is an urgent need for better treatments. Here, we have generated and characterized the first human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and kidney organoid models of cystinosis. These models exhibit elevated cystine and cysteine levels, enlarged lysosomes and a block in basal autophagy flux. Cysteamine treatment ameliorates this phenotype except for the basal autophagy flux defect. We found that treatment with Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, reduces the number of large lysosomes and activates autophagy but does not rescue the cystine/cysteine loading defect. However, dual treatment of cystinotic iPSCs or kidney organoids with cysteamine and Everolimus corrects all of the observed phenotypes indicating that a combination therapy has therapeutic potential to improve the treatment of cystinosis.",

Of all cancer-related deaths, 15 to 20% are associated with inflammation, where proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the tumorigenesis process. The current study investigated the effects of the polyphenolic compound butein (2',3,4,4'-tetrahydroxychalcone) in cell proliferation and survival, as well as its modulatory effect on the release of proinflammatory cytokines in MDA-MB-231 (Caucasian) and MDA-MB-468 (African American) TNBC cell. Results showed that butein decreased cell viability in a time and dose-dependent manner and after 72-h of treatment, cell proliferation rate was reduced in both cell lines. In addition, butein presented higher potency in MDA-MB-468, exhibiting anti-proliferative effects in lower concentrations. Apoptosis assays demonstrated that butein increased apoptotic cells in MDA MB-468, showing 90% of the analyzed cells in the apoptotic phase, compared to 54% in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, butein downregulated both, protein and mRNA expression of CCL2 proinflammatory cytokine and IKBKE in Caucasian cells, but not in African Americans. This study demonstrates butein potential in cancer suppression showing a higher cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects in African Americans, compared to Caucasians TNBC cells. It also reveals the butein inhibitory effect on CCL2 expression with a possible association with IKBKE downregulation in MDA-MB-231 cells only, indicating that Caucasians and African Americans TNBC cells respond differently to butein treatment. The obtained findings may provide an explanation regarding the poor response to therapy in African American patients with advance TNBC.",

    "abstract": "The Mask family of multiple ankyrin repeat and KH domain proteins were discovered in Drosophila to promote the activity of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki), the sole fly homolog of mammalian YAP (YAP1) and TAZ (WWTR1). The molecular function of Mask, or its mammalian homologs Mask1 (ANKHD1) and Mask2 (ANKRD17), remains unclear. Mask family proteins contain two Ankyrin repeat domains that bind Yki/YAP as well as a conserved nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and nuclear export sequence (NES), suggesting a role in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Here we show that Mask acts to promote nuclear import of Yki, and that addition of an ectopic NLS to Yki is sufficient to bypass the requirement for Mask in Yki-driven tissue growth. Mammalian Mask1/2 proteins also promote nuclear import of YAP, as well as stabilising YAP and driving colloidal phase separation into large liquid droplets. Mask1/2 and YAP normally colocalise in a granular fashion in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and are co-regulated during mechanotransduction. Our results suggest that Mask family proteins promote YAP nuclear import and phase separation to regulate YAP stability and transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAedes aegypti is a vector mosquito of major public health importance, transmitting arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Wild mosquito populations are persistently infected at high prevalence with insect-specific viruses that do not replicate in vertebrate hosts. In experimental settings, acute infections with insect-specific viruses have been shown to modulate arbovirus infection and transmission in Ae. aegypti and other vector mosquitoes. However, the impact of persistent insect-specific virus infections that more closely mimic the situation in nature has not been investigated extensively. Cell lines are useful models for studying virus-host interactions, however the available Ae. aegypti cell lines are poorly defined and heterogenous cultures.\\n\\nMethodology/Principle FindingsWe generated single cell-derived clonal cell lines from the commonly used Ae. aegypti cell line Aag2. Two of the fourteen Aag2-derived clonal cell lines generated harboured markedly and consistently reduced levels of the insect-specific bunyavirus Phasi Charoen-like virus (PCLV) known to persistently infect Aag2 cells. In contrast to studies with acute insect-specific virus infections in cell culture and in vivo, we found that pre-existing persistent PCLV infection had no major impact on the replication of the flaviviruses dengue virus and Zika virus, the alphavirus Sindbis virus, or the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus. We also performed a detailed characterisation of the morphology, transfection efficiency and immune status of our Aag2-derived clonal cell lines, and have made a clone that we term Aag2-AF5 available to the research community as a well-defined cell culture model for arbovirus-vector interaction studies.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceOur findings highlight the need for further in vivo studies that more closely recapitulate natural arbovirus transmission settings in which arboviruses encounter mosquitoes harbouring persistent rather than acute insect-specific virus infections. Furthermore, we provide the well-characterised Aag2-derived clonal cell line as a valuable resource to the arbovirus research community.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMosquito-borne viruses usually only infect humans through the bite of a mosquito that carries the virus. Viruses transmitted by the  yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, including dengue virus, Zika virus, yellow fever virus and chikungunya virus, are causing an ever-increasing number of human disease cases globally. Mosquito-borne viruses have to infect and replicate inside the mosquito before they are transmitted to humans, and the presence of other infectious agents can change the efficiency of virus transmission. Mosquitoes are known to be infected with  insect-specific viruses that only infect mosquitoes and cannot cause human disease. We have shown here that in laboratory cell cultures derived from the Aedes aegypti mosquito, pre-existing infection with an insect-specific virus called Phasi Charoen-like virus does not affect the infection and growth of the mosquito-borne viruses dengue virus, Zika virus, Sindbis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus. Compared to previous research, our research is more reflective of conditions that mosquito-borne viruses encounter in nature, and our results provide important new insights into whether and how insect-specific viruses affect mosquito-borne virus transmission. Ultimately, this information could inform ongoing research into whether insect-specific viruses could be used to prevent the transmission of mosquito-borne viruses to reduce global disease burdens.",

    "abstract": "The physical basis for fish schooling is examined using three-dimensional numerical simulations of a pair of swimming fish, with kinematics and geometry obtained from experimental data. Energy expenditure and efficiency are evaluated using a cost of transport function, while the effect of schooling on the stability of each swimmer is examined by probing the lateral force and the lateral and longitudinal force fluctuations. We construct full maps of the aforementioned quantities as functions of the spatial pattern of the swimming fish pair and show that both energy expenditure and stability can be invoked as possible reasons for the swimming patterns and tail-beat synchronization observed in real fish. Our results suggest that high cost of transport zones should be avoided by the fish. Wake capture may be energetically unfavorable in the absence of kinematic adjustment. We hereby hypothesize that fish may restrain from wake capturing and, instead, adopt side-to-side configuration as a conservative strategy, when the conditions of wake energy harvesting are not satisfied. To maintain a stable school configuration, compromise between propulsive efficiency and stability, as well as between school members, ought to be considered.",

    "abstract": "The Elongator complex promotes formation of 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5) and 5-carbamoylmethyl (ncm5) side-chains on uridines at the wobble position of cytosolic eukaryotic tRNAs. In all eukaryotic organisms tested to date, the inactivation of Elongator not only leads to the lack of mcm5/ncm5 groups in tRNAs, but also a wide variety of phenotypes. Although the phenotypes are most likely caused by a translational defect induced by reduced functionality of the hypomodified tRNAs, the mechanism(s) underlying individual phenotypes are poorly understood. In this study, we show that the genetic background modulates the phenotypes induced by the lack of mcm5/ncm5 groups in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that the stress-induced growth defects of Elongator mutants are stronger in the W303 than in the closely related S288C genetic background and that the phenotypic differences are caused by the known polymorphism at the locus for the mRNA binding protein Ssd1. Moreover, the mutant ssd1 allele found in W303 cells is required for the reported histone H3 acetylation and telomeric gene silencing defects of Elongator mutants. The difference at the SSD1 locus also partially explains why the simultaneous lack of mcm5 and 2-thio groups at wobble uridines is lethal in the W303 but not in the S288C background. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the SSD1 locus modulates phenotypes induced by the lack of Elongator-dependent tRNA modifications.\n\nAuthor SummaryModified nucleosides in the anticodon region of tRNAs are important for the efficiency and fidelity of translation. The Elongator complex promotes formation of several related modified uridine residues at the wobble position of eukaryotic tRNAs. In yeast, plants, worms, mice and humans, mutations in genes for Elongator subunits lead to a wide variety of different phenotypes. Here, we show that the genetic background modulates the phenotypic consequences of the inactivation of budding yeast Elongator. This background effect is largely a consequence of a polymorphism at the SSD1 locus, encoding a RNA binding protein that influences translation, stability and/or localization of mRNAs. We show that several phenotypes reported for yeast Elongator mutants are either significantly stronger or only detectable in strains harboring a mutant ssd1 allele. Thus, SSD1 is a suppressor of the phenotypes induced by the hypomodification of tRNAs.",

    "abstract": "A basic feature of infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme borreliosis, is that persistent infection is the rule, not the norm, in its many hosts. The ability to persist and evade host immune clearance poses a challenge to effective antimicrobial treatment. A link between therapy failure and the presence of persister cells has started to emerge. There is growing experimental evidence that viable, but non-cultivable spirochetes persist following treatment with several different antimicrobial agents, then resurge after 12 months. The current study utilized the mouse model to evaluate if persistence and resurgence occur following antimicrobial treatment in a disease-susceptible (C3H/HeN) and disease-resistant (C57BL/6) mouse strain infected with B. burgdorferi strains N40 and B31, to confirm the generality of these phenomena. The status of infection was evaluated at 12 and 18-months after treatment. The results demonstrated that persistent spirochetes remain viable for up to 18 months following treatment, but divide slowly, thereby being tolerant to the effects of antimicrobial agents, as well as being non-cultivable. The phenomenon of persistence and resurgence in disease-susceptible C3H mice is equally evident in disease-resistant B6 mice, and not unique to any particular B. burgdorferi strain. The results also demonstrate that following antimicrobial treatment, both strains of B. burgdorferi, N40 and B31, lose one or more small plasmids, resulting in attenuation. The biological relevance of attenuated B. burgdorferi spirochetes is probably inconsequential. The study demonstrated that non-cultivable spirochetes can persist in a host following antimicrobial treatment for a long time but did not demonstrate their clinical relevance in a mouse model of chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "Motor behaviors are continually shaped by a variety of processes such as environmental influences, development, and learning1,2. The resulting behavioral changes are commonly quantified based on hand-picked features3-10 (e.g. syllable pitch11) and assuming discrete classes of behaviors (e.g. distinct syllables)3-5,9,10,12-17. Such methods may generalize poorly across behaviors and species and are necessarily biased. Here we present an account of behavioral change based on nearest-neighbor statistics18-23 that avoids such biases and apply it to song development in the juvenile zebra finch3. First, we introduce the concept of repertoire dating, whereby each syllable rendition is dated with a \\\"pseudo\\\" production-day corresponding to the day when similar renditions were typical in the behavioral repertoire. Differences in pseudo production-day across renditions isolate the components of vocal variability congruent with the long-term changes due to vocal learning and development. This variability is large, as about 10% of renditions have pseudo production-days falling more than 10 days into the future (anticipations) or into the past (regressions) relative to their actual production time. Second, we obtain a holistic, yet low-dimensional, description of vocal change in terms of a behavioral trajectory, which reproduces the pairwise similarities between renditions grouped by production time and pseudo production-day24. The behavioral trajectory reveals multiple, previously unrecognized components of behavioral change operating at distinct time-scales. These components interact differently across the behavioral repertoire--diurnal change in regressions undergoes only weak overnight consolidation4,5, whereas anticipations and typical renditions consolidate fully2,6,25. Our nearest-neighbor methods yield model-free descriptions of how behavior evolves relative to itself, rather than relative to a potentially arbitrary, experimenter-defined, goal3-5,11. Because of their generality, our methods appear well-suited to comparing learning across behaviors and species1,26-32, and between biological and artificial systems.",

We find that randomness in the task-free state closely follows the predictions of Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. However, the randomness decreases when the brain is engaged in attending to painful inputs in patients suffering with early stages of back pain.

    "abstract": "Therapies currently in preclinical development for prion disease seek to lower prion protein (PrP) expression in the brain. Trials of such therapies are likely to rely on quantification of PrP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a pharmacodynamic biomarker and possibly as a trial endpoint. Studies using PrP ELISA kits have reproducibly shown that CSF PrP is lowered in the symptomatic phase of disease, a potential confounder for reading out the effect of PrP-lowering drugs in symptomatic patients. To date it has been unclear whether the reduced abundance of PrP in CSF results from its incorporation into plaques, retention in intracellular compartments, downregulation as a function of the disease process, or other factors. Because misfolding or proteolytic cleavage could potentially render PrP invisible to ELISA even if its concentration were constant or increasing in disease, we sought to establish an orthogonal method for CSF PrP quantification. We developed a targeted mass spectrometry method based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of nine PrP tryptic peptides quantified relative to known concentrations of isotopically labeled standards. Analytical validation experiments showed process replicate coefficients of variation below 15%, good dilution linearity and recovery, and suitable performance for both CSF and brain homogenate and across humans as well as preclinical species of interest. In N=55 CSF samples from individuals referred to prion surveillance centers with rapidly progressive dementia, all six human PrP peptides, spanning the N- and C-terminal domains of PrP, were uniformly reduced in prion disease cases compared to individuals with non-prion diagnoses. This confirms the findings from ELISA studies, demonstrating that lowered CSF PrP concentration in prion disease is a genuine result of the disease process and not merely an artifact of ELISA-based measurement. We provide a targeted mass spectrometry-based method suitable for preclinical and clinical quantification of CSF PrP as a tool for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Both mating system variation and the propensity of many seaweeds to reproduce both sexually and asexually, leave a strong imprint in the genetic structure of species. In this respect, we study the population genetic structure of Dictyota dichotoma, a common haplodiplont brown subtidal seaweed. This benthic species is widespread in the NE-Atlantic, from the Canary Islands and Mediterranean Sea to southern Norway, but lately populations have been reported from Argentina and South Africa. Phenology and reproduction of D. dichotoma was monitored year-round in four populations to investigate how the species has adapted to the steep thermal gradient in southern and northern ranges of its distribution. Thirteen microsatellites are developed in order to assess patterns of population diversity and structure across the biogeographic range, as shaped by past and present processes. Last, we assess the genetic structure of South African and South American populations and their relationship to the northern hemisphere populations.\\n\\nThroughout its range, D. dichotoma shows a varying reproductive effort, with sexual reproduction being more abundant in the northern range. In contrast, the Mediterranean populations show a clear sporophyte dominance, suggesting that sexual reproduction is not the prime mode of reproduction, and indicating that the species potentially resorts to other modes of propagation as for instance fragmentation or apospory.\\n\\nGenetic diversity is highest in the southern population decreasing gradually northward, indicative for a recolonization pattern after the demise of the last glacial maximum where these areas served as glacial refugia. European mainland populations show an isolation by distance pattern, while the population in the Canary Islands has its own genetic identity, being significantly diverged from the mainland population. Populations in South Africa and Argentina are seemingly introduced from mainland Europe, but no conclusion can be made on the exact timing of these introductions.",

However, relatively little is known about population genetic patterns within the basin, except for in a few commercially caught species and some primary producers thought to be ecosystem engineers. Here, we investigate the population genetic structure of the ecologically important crustacean Idotea balthica throughout the Baltic Sea using an array of 33,774 genome-wide SNP markers derived from 2b-RAD sequencing. We also generate a biophysical connectivity matrix, with which we compare the genomic data. We find strong population structure on small scales across the Baltic Sea, and that genomic patterns in most cases closely match biophysical connectivity, suggesting that current patterns are important for dispersal of this species. We also find a strong signal of multiple bottlenecks during the initial range expansion, in the form of reduced heterozygosity along the historical expansion front. The lack of gene flow among sampling sites in the Baltic Sea environmental gradient potentiates local adaptation, while at the same time also increasing genetic drift in low-diversity areas.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the precise cortical location underlying the physiological and behavioral stimulation effects are still only coarsely known. So far, mapping strategies rely on center of gravity approaches and therefore localize the stimulated cortical site only approximately and indirectly. Focusing on the motor cortex, we present a novel method to reliably determine the effectively stimulated cortical site at the individual subject level. The approach combines measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at different coil positions and orientations with numerical modeling of induced electric fields. We identify sharply bounded cortical areas around the gyral crowns and rims of the motor hand area as the origin of MEPs and show that the tangential component and the magnitude of the electric field is most relevant for the observed effect. To validate our approach, we determined motor thresholds for coil positions and orientations for the predicted cortical target. Our methods allows for the identification of optimal coil positions and orientations. Moreover, we used extensive uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of the method and identify the most critical model parameters. Our generic approach improves the localization of the cortex area stimulated by TMS and may be transferred to other modalities such as language mapping.",

While synaptic inhibition is important for synchronization across the gamma-frequency range, the role of distinct interneuronal subtypes in fast and slow gamma states remains unclear. Here, we used optogenetics to examine the involvement of parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SST+) expressing interneurons in gamma oscillations in the mouse hippocampal CA3 ex vivo. Disrupting either PV+ or STT+ interneuron activity, via either photo-inhibition or photo-excitation, led to a decrease in the power of cholinergically-induced slow gamma oscillations. Furthermore, photo-excitation of SST+ interneurons induced fast gamma oscillations, which depended on both synaptic excitation and inhibition. Our findings support a critical role for both PV+ and SST+ interneurons in slow hippocampal gamma oscillations, and further suggest that STT+ interneurons are capable of switching the network between slow and fast gamma states.",

Despite huge efforts in malaria control and eradication, highly effective vaccines are urgently needed, including vaccines that can block malaria transmission. Chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) have emerged as a promising strategy to develop new malaria vaccine candidates.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed yeast cell lines and processes for the expression of malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pfs230 as VLP and VLP were analyzed for purity, size, protein incorporation rate and expression of malaria antigens.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, a novel platform for the display of Plasmodium falciparum antigens on chimeric VLP is presented. Leading transmission-blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pfs230 were genetically fused to the small surface protein (dS) of the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). The resulting fusion proteins were co-expressed in recombinant Hansenula polymorpha (syn. Pichia angusta, Ogataea polymorpha) strains along with the wild-type dS as the VLP scaffold protein. Through this strategy, chimeric VLP containing Pfs25 or the Pfs230-derived fragments Pfs230c or Pfs230D1M were purified. Up to 100 mg chimeric VLP were isolated from 100 g dry cell weight with a maximum protein purity of 90 % on the protein level. Expression of the Pfs230D1M construct was more efficient than Pfs230c and enabled VLP with higher purity. VLP showed reactivity with transmission-blocking antibodies and supported the surface display of the malaria antigens on the native VLP.\\n\\nConclusionThe incorporation of leading Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking antigens into the dS-based VLP scaffold is a promising novel strategy for their display on nano-scaled particles. Competitive processes for efficient production and purification were established in this study.",

Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicate membrane depolarization, coupled with increased neuronal firing rate, following administration of the DREADD ligand, Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) to activate the Gq-coupled DREADD, hM3Dq. Although hM3Dq has been used to enhance neuronal firing in order to manipulate diverse behaviors, often within thirty minutes to an hour post-CNO administration, the physiological effects on excitatory neurotransmission remain poorly understood. We investigated the influence of CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation on distinct aspects of hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices derived from mice expressing hM3Dq in Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase  (CamKII)-positive excitatory neurons. Our results indicate a clear dose-dependent effect on fEPSP slope, with no change noted at the lower dose of CNO (1 {micro}M) and a significant, long-term decline in fEPSP slope observed at higher doses (5-20 {micro}M). Further, we noted a robust theta burst stimulus (TBS) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the presence of the lower CNO (1 {micro}M) dose, which was significantly attenuated at the higher CNO (20 {micro}M) dose. Whole-cell patch clamp recording revealed both complex dose-dependent regulation of excitability, and spontaneous and evoked activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in response to hM3Dq activation across CNO concentrations.

    "abstract": "Food technologies provide numerous benefits to society and are extensively vetted for safety. However, many technological innovations still face high levels of skepticism from consumers. To promote development and use of food technologies, it is critical to understand the psychological and neurobiological processes associated with consumer acceptability concerns. The current study uses a neuroscience-based approach to understand consumer attitudes and perceptions of risk associated with food technologies and investigate how such attitudes impact consumers processing of information related to food technologies. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activation while participants processed infographics related to food technology topics. For technology topics perceived as riskier (antibiotics and hormones), activation was higher in areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex that are associated with decisional uncertainty. In contrast, technology topics that were viewed more favorably (sustainability and animal welfare) tended to activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region that processes positive affect and subjective value. Moreover, for information about hormones, the lateral PFC activation was associated with individual differences in resistance to change in risk perception. These results reveal how attitudes and risk perception relate to how the brain processes information about food technologies and how people respond to information about such technologies.",

    "abstract": "Cancer precision medicine implies identification of tumor-specific vulnerabilities associated with defined oncogenic pathways. Desmoid tumors are soft-tissue neoplasms strictly driven by Wnt signaling network hyperactivation. Despite this clearly defined genetic etiology and the strict and unique implication of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway, no specific molecular targets for these tumors have been identified. To address this caveat, we developed fast and semi-high throughput genetic Xenopus tropicalis desmoid tumor models to identify and characterize novel drug targets. We used multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in these models to simultaneously target a tumor suppressor gene (apc) and candidate dependency genes. Our methodology CRISPR/Cas9 Selection mediated Identification of Dependencies (CRISPR-SID) uses calculated deviations between experimentally observed gene editing outcomes and deep-learning-predicted double strand break repair patterns, to identify genes under negative selection during tumorigenesis. This revealed EZH2 and SUZ12, both encoding polycomb repressive complex 2 components, and the transcription factor CREB3L1, as genetic dependencies for desmoid tumors. In vivo EZH2 inhibition by Tazemetostat induced partial regression of established autochthonous tumors. In vitro models of patient desmoid tumor cells revealed a direct effect of Tazemetostat on Wnt pathway activity. CRISPR-SID represents a potent novel approach for in vivo mapping of tumor vulnerabilities and drug target identification.\n\nSignificance StatementCRISPR-SID was established in the diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis for in vivo elucidation of cancer cell vulnerabilities. CRISPR-SID uses deep learning predictions and binomial theory to identify genes under positive or negative selection during autochthonous tumor development. Using CRISPR-SID in a genetic model for desmoid tumors, treatment-recalcitrant mesenchymal tumors driven by hyper-activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, we identified EZH2 and SUZ12, both encoding critical components of the polycomb repressive complex 2, as dependency genes for desmoid. Finally, we demonstrate the promise of EZH2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy for desmoid tumors. With the simplicity of CRISPR sgRNA multiplexing in Xenopus embryos the CRISPR-SID method may be applicable to reveal vulnerabilities in other tumor types.",

When people monitor a rapid stream of visual items for two targets, they can typically report the first, but not the second target, if these appear within 200-500 ms of each other, a phenomenon known as the attentional blink (AB). No work has determined the neural basis for the AB, partly because conventional neuroimaging approaches lack the temporal resolution to adequately characterise the neural activity elicited by each item in a rapid stream. Here we introduce a new approach that can identify the precise effect of the AB on behaviour and neural activity. Specifically, we employed a multivariate encoding approach to extract feature-selective information carried by randomly-oriented gratings within a rapid serial stream. We show that feature selectivity is enhanced for correctly reported targets and suppressed when the same items are missed. By contrast, no such effects were apparent for irrelevant distractor items. Our findings point to a new theoretical account that involves both short- and long-range temporal interactions between visual items competing for consciousness.",

    "abstract": "To be maximally useful for neuroscience research, neural simulators must make it possible to define original models. This is especially important because a computational experiment might not only need descriptions of neurons and synapses, but also models of interactions with the environment (e.g. muscles), or the environment itself. To preserve high performance when defining new models, current simulators offer two options: low-level programming, or mark-up languages (and other domain specific languages). The first option requires time and expertise, is prone to errors, and contributes to problems with reproducibility and replicability. The second option has limited scope, since it can only describe the range of neural models covered by the ontology. Other aspects of a computational experiment, such as the stimulation protocol, cannot be expressed within this framework. \\\"Brian\\\" 2 is a complete rewrite of Brian that addresses this issue by using runtime code generation with a procedural equation-oriented approach. Brian 2 enables scientists to write code that is particularly simple and concise, closely matching the way they conceptualise their models, while the technique of runtime code generation automatically transforms high level descriptions of models into efficient low level code tailored to different hardware (e.g. CPU or GPU). We illustrate it with several challenging examples: a plastic model of the pyloric network of crustaceans, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an auditory model with real-time input from a microphone.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based modelling is particularly adept at modelling complex features of cell signalling pathways, where heterogeneity, stochastic and spatial effects are important, thus increasing our understanding of decision processes in biology in such scenarios. However, agent-based modelling often is computationally prohibitive to implement. Parallel computing, either on central processing units (CPUs) or graphical processing units (GPUs), can provide a means to improve computational feasibility of agent-based applications but generally requires specialist coding knowledge and extensive optimisation. In this paper, we address these challenges through the development and implementation of the FLAME-accelerated signalling tool (FaST), a software that permits easy creation and parallelisation of agent-based models of cell signalling, on CPUs or GPUs. FaST incorporates validated new agent-based methods, for accurate modelling of reaction kinetics and, as proof of concept, successfully converted an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of apoptosis execution into an agent-based model. We finally parallelised this model through FaST on CPUs and GPUs resulting in an increase in performance of 5.8x (16 CPUs) and 53.9x respectively. The FaST takes advantage of the communicating X-machine approach used by FLAME and FLAME GPU to allow easy alteration or addition of functionality to parallel applications, but still includes inherent parallelisation optimisation. The FaST, therefore, represents a new and innovative tool to easily create and parallelise bespoke, robust, agent-based models of cell signalling.",

A SAGA-optimize package, solving a boundary-value inverse problem through a combined simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, was developed for model optimization. Additional optimization methods from the Python scipy library are utilized as well. Several forms of the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion are provided for selecting between moiety models. Moiety models and associated isotopologue data are defined in the JSON format.\\n\\nBy testing the moiety modeling framework on the timecourses of 13C isotopologue data for UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in human prostate cancer LnCaP-LN3 cells, we were able to confirm its robust performance in isotopologue deconvolution and moiety model selection.\\n\\nConclusionsSAGA-optimize is a useful Python package for solving boundary-value inverse problems, and the moiety_modeling package is an easy-to-use tool for mass spectroscopy isotopologue profile deconvolution involving single and multiple isotope tracers. Both packages are freely freely available on GitHub and via the Python Package Index.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that rather than using a single brain imaging modality to study its association with physiological or symptomatic features, the field is paying more attention to fusion of multimodal information. However, most current multimodal fusion approaches that incorporate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are restricted to second-level 3D features, rather than the original 4D fMRI data. This trade-off is that the valuable temporal information is not utilized during the fusion step. Here we are motivated to propose a novel approach called \\\"parallel group ICA+ICA\\\" that incorporates temporal fMRI information from GICA into a parallel ICA framework, aiming to enable direct fusion of first-level fMRI features with other modalities (e.g. structural MRI), which thus can detect linked functional network variability and structural covariations. Simulation results show that the proposed method yields accurate inter-modality linkage detection regardless of whether it is strong or weak. When applied to real data, we identified one pair of significantly associated fMRI-sMRI components that show group difference between schizophrenia and controls in both modalities. Finally, multiple cognitive domain scores can be predicted by the features identified in the linked component pair by our proposed method. We also show these multimodal brain features can predict multiple cognitive scores in an independent cohort. Overall, results demonstrate the ability of parallel GICA+ICA to estimate joint information from 4D and 3D data without discarding much of the available information up front, and the potential for using this approach to identify imaging biomarkers to study brain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abscesses and other periapical lesions are found in abundance in recent archeological samples, yet are scarce in the fossil hominin record. Periapical voids commonly develop after exposure of a tooth\u2019s pulp chamber and are commonly associated with heavy crown wear, trauma or caries. In this study, all available maxilla and mandible fragments from the South African fossil hominin collections were studied, including specimens assigned to Homo naledi, Paranthropus robustus, Australopithicus africanus, A. sediba and early Homo. Only one specimen displayed voids consistent with periapical lesions, and a differential diagnosis of these voids was undertaken. The specimen, SK 847, is described as early Homo and has been dated to 2.3-1.65MA. There is one definite abscess, and likely at least two more with postmortem damage, all on the anterior aspect of the maxilla and associated with the incisors. The abscesses originate from the apices of the incisor roots and are therefore unlikely to represent a systemic disease such as multiple myeloma. They best fit the description of an abscess rather than a cyst or granuloma, with one showing a rounded thickened rim around the lesion. The abscesses highlight that this individual used their anterior dentition extensively, to the point that the pulp chambers were exposed on multiple teeth. This is one of the earliest hominin examples of a dental abscess and shows that this individual was able to cope with several concurrent abscesses, clearly surviving for an extended period. Therefore, this finding adds additional information to the history of dental pathology in our genus.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental disorder precipitated by trauma exposure. However, only some persons exposed to trauma develop PTSD. There are sex differences in risk; twice as many women as men, develop a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD. Methylomic profiles derived from peripheral blood are well-suited for investigating PTSD because DNA methylation (DNAm) encodes individual response to trauma and may play a key role in the immune dysregulation characteristic of PTSD pathophysiology. In the current study, we leveraged recent methodological advances to investigate sex-specific shifts in DNAm-based leukocyte composition that are associated with lifetime PTSD. We estimated leukocyte composition on a combined methylation array dataset (483 participants, [~]450k CpG sites) consisting of two civilian cohorts, the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study and Grady Trauma Project. Sex-stratified Mann-Whitney U test and two-way ANCOVA revealed that lifetime PTSD was associated with a small but significant elevation in monocyte proportions in males, but not in females (Holm-adjusted p-val < 0.05). No difference in monocyte proportions was observed between current and remitted PTSD cases in males, suggesting that this sex-specific peak shift reflects a long-standing trait of lifetime history of PTSD, rather than current state of PTSD. Associations with lifetime PTSD or PTSD status were not observed in any other leukocyte subtype and our finding in monocytes was confirmed using cell estimates based on a different deconvolution algorithm, suggesting that our sex-specific findings are robust across cell estimation approaches. Overall, our main finding of elevated monocyte proportions in males, but not in females with lifetime history of PTSD provides evidence for a sex-specific shift in peripheral blood leukocyte composition that is detectable in methylomic profiles and that reflects long-standing changes associated with PTSD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Chemically inducible systems that provide both spatial and temporal control of gene expression are essential tools, with many applications in plant biology. Using Golden Gate modular cloning, we have created a monocot-optimized dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible pOp6/LhGR system and tested its efficacy in rice using the reporter enzyme {beta}-glucuronidase (GUS). The system is tightly regulated and highly sensitive to DEX application, with six hours of induction sufficient to induce high levels of GUS activity in transgenic callus. In seedlings, GUS activity was detectable in the root after in vitro application of just 0.01M DEX. However, transgenic plants manifested severe developmental perturbations when grown on higher concentrations of DEX. The direct cause of these growth defects is not known, but the rice genome contains sequences with high similarity to the LhGR target sequence lacO, suggesting non-specific activation of endogenous genes by DEX induction. These off-target effects can be minimized by quenching with isopropyl {beta}-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The system is thus suitable for general use in rice, when the method of DEX application and relevant controls are tailored appropriately for each specific application.",

We present a novel two-step method for including interface information into protein docking simulations within the LightDock framework. Prior to the simulation, irrelevant regions from the receptor are excluded for sampling (filter of initial swarms) and initial ligand poses are pre-oriented based on ligand input information. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on the new 55 cases of the Protein-Protein Docking Benchmark 5, using different amounts of information.

    "abstract": "Heart disease is associated with re-expression of key transcription factors normally active only during prenatal development of the heart. However, the impact of this reactivation on the genome-wide regulatory landscape in heart disease has remained obscure. Here we show that pervasive epigenomic changes occur in heart disease, with thousands of regulatory sequences reacquiring fetal-like chromatin signatures. We used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq targeting a histone modification associated with active transcriptional enhancers to generate genome-wide enhancer maps from left ventricle tissue from 18 healthy controls and 18 individuals with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Healthy individuals had a highly reproducible epigenomic landscape, consisting of more than 31,000 predicted heart enhancers. In contrast, we observed reproducible disease-associated gains or losses of activity at more than 7,500 predicted heart enhancers. Next, we profiled human fetal heart tissue by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. Comparison with adult tissues revealed that the heart disease epigenome and transcrip-tome both shift toward a fetal-like state, with 3,400 individual enhancers sharing fetal regulatory properties. Our results demonstrate widespread epigenomic changes in DCM, and we provide a comprehensive data resource (http://heart.lbl.gov) for the mechanistic exploration of heart disease etiology.",

    "abstract": "The activity of the retrotransposon LINE-1 has created a substantial portion of the human genome. Most of this sequence comprises fractured and debilitated LINE-1s. An accurate approximation of the number, location, and sequence of the LINE-1 elements present in any single genome has proven elusive due to the difficulty of assembling and phasing the repetitive and polymorphic regions of the human genome. Through an in-depth analysis of publicly-available, deep, long-read assemblies of nearly homozygous human genomes, we defined the location and sequence of all intact LINE-1s in these assemblies. We found 148 and 142 intact LINE-1s in two nearly homozygous assemblies. A combination of these assemblies suggests a diploid human genome contains at least 50% more intact LINE-1s than previous estimates - in this case, 290 intact LINE-1s at 194 loci. We think this is the best approximation, to date, of the number of intact LINE-1s in a single diploid human genome. In addition to counting intact LINE-1 elements, we resolved the sequence of each element, including some LINE-1 elements in unassembled, presumably centromeric regions of the genome. A comparison of the intact LINE-1s in each assembly shows the specific pattern of variation between these genomes, including LINE-1s that remain intact in only one genome, allelic variation in shared intact LINE-1s, and LINE-1s that are unique (presumably young) insertions in only one genome. We found that many old elements (> 6 million years old) remain intact, and comparison of the young and intact LINE-1s across assemblies reinforces the notion that only a small portion of all LINE-1 sequences that may be intact in the genomes of the human population has been uncovered. This dataset provides the first nearly comprehensive estimate of LINE-1 diversity within an individual, an important dataset in the quest to understand the functional consequences of sequence variation in LINE-1 and the complete set of LINE-1s in the human population.",

    "abstract": "AMPylation is an inactivating modification that matches the activity of the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone BiP to the burden of unfolded proteins. A single ER-localised Fic protein, FICD (HYPE), catalyses both AMPylation and deAMPylation of BiP. However, the basis for the switch in FICDs activity is unknown. We report on the transition of FICD from a dimeric enzyme, that deAMPylates BiP, to a monomer with potent AMPylation activity. Mutations in the dimer interface or in residues tracing an inhibitory relay from the dimer interface to the enzymes active site favour BiP AMPylation in vitro and in cells. Mechanistically, monomerisation relieves a repressive effect allosterically-propagated from the dimer interface to the inhibitory Glu234, thereby permitting AMPylation-competent binding of MgATP. Whereas, a reciprocal signal propagated from the nucleotide binding site, provides a mechanism for coupling the oligomeric-state and enzymatic activity of FICD to the energy status of the ER.\\n\\nImpact StatementUnique amongst known chaperones, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Hsp70, BiP, is subject to transient inactivation under conditions of low ER stress by reversible, covalent modification - AMPylation. The enzyme responsible for this modification, FICD, is in fact a bifunctional enzyme with a single active site capable of both AMPylation and deAMPylation. Here we elucidate, by biochemical, biophysical and structural means, the mechanism by which this enzyme is able to switch enzymatic modality: by regulation of its oligomeric state. The oligomeric state-dependent reciprocal regulation of FICD activity is, in turn, sensitive to the ATP/ADP ratio. This allosteric pathway potentially facilitates the sensing of unfolded protein load in the ER and permits the transduction of this signal into a post-translational buffering of ER chaperone activity.",

The mechanisms by which {beta}1 tubulin, the platelet and megakaryocyte (MK) lineage restricted tubulin isoform, drives platelet production and function remains poorly understood. We investigated the roles of two key post-translational polymodifications (polyglutamylation and polyglycylation) on these processes using a cohort of thrombocytopenic patients, human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived MKs, and healthy human donor platelets. We find distinct patterns of polymodification in MKs and platelets, mediated by the antagonistic activities of the cell specific expression of Tubulin Tyrosine Ligase Like (TTLLs) and Cytosolic Carboxypeptidae (CCP) enzymes. The resulting microtubule patterning spatially regulates motor proteins to drive proplatelet formation in megakaryocytes, and the cytoskeletal reorganisation required for thrombus formation.

A geometric symmetry in those boundaries allows the optimal strategy to be implemented by a simple neural circuit involving a normalization with fixed decision bounds and an urgency signal. The model captures several key features of the response of decision-making neurons as well as the increase in reaction time as a function of the number of alternatives, known as Hicks law. In addition, we show that, in the presence of divisive normalization and internal variability, our model can account for several so called  irrational behaviors such as the similarity effect as well as the violation of both the independent irrelevant alternative principle and the regularity principle.",

Although partly different processes support long-term memory over shorter vs. longer intervals, memory is usually assessed after less than an hour. The aim of the present study was to test whether there are unique developmental changes in extended memory, and whether these are related to structural maturation of sub-regions of the hippocampus. 650 children and adolescents from 4.1 to 24.8 years were assessed in total 962 times (mean interval {approx} 1.8 years). Memory was assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the Rey Complex Figure Test (CFT). In addition to 30 min recall, an extended delay recall condition was administered {approx} 10 days after encoding. We found unique developmental effects on extended delay memory independently of 30 min recall performance. For visuo-constructive memory, this could be accounted for by visuo-constructive ability levels. Performance was modestly related to anterior and posterior hippocampal volume and mean diffusion. The relationships did not show an anterior-posterior hippocampal axis difference. In conclusion, extended delay memory shows unique development, likely due to changes in encoding depth or efficacy, or improvements of long-term consolidation processes.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIUnique developmental effects on episodic memories over days rather than minutes\\nC_LIO_LIDevelopment of visuoconstructive recall explainable by visuoconstructive abilitity\\nC_LIO_LIDevelopment of verbal recall cannot be explained by verbal ability\\nC_LIO_LIModest relationships between memory and hippocampal structural features\\nC_LI",
