    "abstract": "ObjectiveNumerous attempts have been made to create a standardized  presenting problem or  chief complaint list to characterize the nature of an Emergency Department visit. Previous attempts have failed to gain widespread adoption as none were freely sharable and contained the right level of specificity, structure, and clinical relevance to gain acceptance by the larger emergency medicine community. Using real-world data, we constructed a presenting problem list that addresses these challenges.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe prospectively captured the presenting problems for 180,424 consecutive emergency department patient visits at an urban, academic, Level I trauma center in the Boston metro area. No patients were excluded. We used a consensus process to iteratively derive our system using real-world data. We used the first 70% of consecutive visits to derive our ontology; followed by a 6 month washout period, and the remaining 30% for validation. All concepts were mapped to SNOMED-CT.\\n\\nResultsOur system consists of a polyhierarchical ontology containing 692 unique concepts, 2,118 synonyms, and 30,613 non-visible descriptions to correct misspellings and non-standard terminology. Our ontology successfully captured structured data for 95.9% of visits in our validation dataset.\\n\\nDiscussion and ConclusionWe present the HierArchical Presenting Problem ontologY (HaPPy). This ontology was empirically derived then iteratively validated by an expert consensus panel. HaPPy contains 692 presenting problem concepts, each concept being mapped to SNOMED-CT. This freely sharable ontology can help to facilitate presenting problem based quality metrics, research, and patient care.",

    "abstract": "Neurons perform computations by integrating inputs from thousands of synapses - mostly in the dendritic tree - to drive action potential firing in the axon. One fruitful approach to understanding this process is to record from neurons using patch-clamp electrodes, fill the recorded neuron with a substance that allows subsequent staining, reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of the dendrites, and use the resulting functional and structural data to develop computer models of dendritic integration. Accurately producing quantitative reconstructions of dendrites is typically a tedious process taking many hours of manual inspection and measurement. Here we present ShuTu, a new software package that facilitates accurate and efficient reconstruction of dendrites imaged using bright-field microscopy. The program operates in two steps: (1) automated identification of dendritic process, and (2) manual correction of errors in the automated reconstruction. This approach allows neurons with complex dendritic morphologies to be reconstructed rapidly and efficiently, thus facilitating the use of computer models to study dendritic structure-function relationships and the computations performed by single neurons.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe developed a software package - ShuTu - that integrates automated reconstruction of stained neurons with manual error correction. This package facilitates rapid reconstruction of the three-dimensional geometry of neuronal dendritic trees, often needed for computational simulations of the functional properties of these structures.",

    "abstract": "Morphological transformations can be generated by evolutionary changes in the sequence of developmental events. In this study, we examined the evolutionary dynamics of the developmental sequence on a macroevolutionary scale using the teleost. Using the information from previous reports describing the development of 31 species, we extracted the developmental sequences of 19 landmark events involving the formation of phylogenetically conserved body parts; we then inferred ancestral developmental sequences by two different parsimony-based methods--event-pairing (Jeffery, Bininda-Emonds, Coates & Richardson, 2002a) and continuous analysis (Germain & Laurin, 2009). The phylogenetic comparisons of these sequences revealed event-dependent heterogeneity in the frequency of sequence changes. Most of the sequence changes occurred as exchanges of temporally neighboring events. The phylogenetic analyses suggested that the ancestral species had experienced frequent changes in developmental sequences. Although the analyses showed that these heterochronic changes accumulated along phylogenic time, the precise distribution of the changes over the teleost phylogeny remains unclear due to technical limitations. Finally, this first comprehensive analysis of teleost developmental sequences will provide solid ground on which to elucidate the significance of developmental timing in animal morphological diversification.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion decision models (DDMs) are immensely successful models for decision-making under uncertainty and time pressure. In the context of perceptual decision making, these models typically start with two input units, organized in a neuron-antineuron pair. In contrast, in the brain, sensory inputs are encoded through the activity of large neuronal populations. Moreover, while DDMs are wired by hand, the nervous system must learn the weights of the network through trial and error. There is currently no normative theory of learning in DDMs and therefore no theory of how decision makers could learn to make optimal decisions in this context. Here, we derive the first such rule for learning a near-optimal linear combination of DDM inputs based on trial-by-trial feedback. The rule is Bayesian in the sense that it learns not only the mean of the weights but also the uncertainty around this mean in the form of a covariance matrix. In this rule, the rate of learning is proportional (resp. inversely proportional) to confidence for incorrect (resp. correct) decisions. Furthermore, we show that, in volatile environments, the rule predicts a bias towards repeating the same choice after correct decisions, with a bias strength that is modulated by the previous choices difficulty. Finally, we extend our learning rule to cases for which one of the choices is more likely a priori, which provides new insights into how such biases modulate the mechanisms leading to optimal decisions in diffusion models.\\n\\nSignificance StatementPopular models for the tradeoff between speed and accuracy of everyday decisions usually assume fixed, low-dimensional sensory inputs. In contrast, in the brain, these inputs are distributed across larger populations of neurons, and their interpretation needs to be learned from feedback. We ask how such learning could occur and demonstrate that efficient learning is significantly modulated by decision confidence. This modulation predicts a particular dependency pattern between consecutive choices, and provides new insight into how a priori biases for particular choices modulate the mechanisms leading to efficient decisions in these models.",

However, current data analysis still utilizes approaches initially designed for ChIP-seq or DNase-seq, without taking into account the transposase digested DNA fragments that contain additional nucleosome positioning information. We present the first dedicated ATAC-seq analysis tool, a semi-supervised machine learning approach named HMMRATAC. HMMRATAC splits a single ATAC-seq dataset into nucleosome-free and nucleosome-enriched signals, learns the unique chromatin structure around accessible regions, and then predicts accessible regions across the entire genome.

These assemblies can be created in various ways, such as use of tissues that contain single-haplotype (haploid) genomes, or by co-sequencing of parental genomes, but these approaches can be impractical in many situations. We present FALCON-Phase, which integrates long-read sequencing data and ultra-long-range Hi-C chromatin interaction data of a diploid individual to create high-quality, phased diploid genome assemblies. The method was evaluated by application to three datasets, including human, cattle, and zebra finch, for which high-quality, fully haplotype resolved assemblies were available for benchmarking. Phasing algorithm accuracy was affected by heterozygosity of the individual sequenced, with higher accuracy for cattle and zebra finch (>97%) compared to human (82%). In addition, scaffolding with the same Hi-C chromatin contact data resulted in phased chromosome-scale scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLocalized functional domains within chromosomes, known as topologically associating domains (TADs), have been recently highlighted. In Drosophila, TADs are biochemically defined by epigenetic marks, this suggesting that the 3D arrangement may be the \\\"missing link\\\" between epigenetics and gene activity. Recent observations (Boettiger et al., Nature 2016) provide access to structural features of these domains with unprecedented resolution thanks to super-resolution experiments. In particular, they give access to the distribution of the radii of gyration for domains of different linear length and associated with different transcriptional activity states: active, inactive or repressed. Intriguingly, the observed scaling laws lack consistent interpretation in polymer physics.\\n\\nResultsWe develop a new methodology conceived to extract the best information from such super-resolution data by exploiting the whole distribution of gyration radii, and to place these experimental results on a theoretical framework. We show that the experimental data are compatible with the finite-size behavior of a self-attracting polymer. The same generic polymer model leads to quantitative differences between active, inactive and repressed domains. Active domains behave as pure polymer coils, while inactive and repressed domains both lie at the coil-globule crossover. For the first time, the \\\"colo-specificity\\\" of both the persistence length and the mean interaction energy are estimated, leading to important differences between epigenetic states.\\n\\nConclusionsThese results point toward a crucial role of criticality to enhance the system responsivity, resulting in both energy transitions and structural rearrangements. We get strong indications that epigenetically induced changes in nucleosome-nucleosome interaction can cause chromatin to shift between different activity states.",

Here, we apply a novel methodology to perform genome-wide association analysis of mean and variance in nine key brain features (accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, intracranial volume and cortical thickness), integrating genetic and neuroanatomical data from a large lifespan sample (n=25,575 individuals; 8 to 89 years, mean age 51.9 years). We identify genetic loci associated with phenotypic variability in cortical thickness, thalamus, pallidum, and intracranial volumes. The variance-controlling loci included genes with a documented role in brain and mental health and were not associated with the mean anatomical volumes. This proof-of-principle of the hypothesis of a genetic regulation of brain volume variability contributes to establishing the genetic basis of phenotypic variance (i.e., heritability), allows identifying different degrees of brain robustness across individuals, and opens new research avenues in the search for mechanisms controlling brain and mental health.",

    "abstract": "Copy-number variants (CNVs) are a major cause of several genetic disorders, making their detection an essential component of genetic analysis pipelines. Current methods for detecting CNVs from exome sequencing data are limited by high false positive rates and low concordance due to the inherent biases of individual algorithms. To overcome these issues, calls generated by two or more algorithms are often intersected using Venn-diagram approaches to identify \\\"high-confidence\\\" CNVs. However, this approach is inadequate, as it misses potentially true calls that do not have consensus from multiple callers. Here, we present CN-Learn, a machine-learning framework (https://github.com/girirajanlab/CN_Learn) that integrates calls from multiple CNV detection algorithms and learns to accurately identify true CNVs using caller-specific and genomic features from a small subset of validated CNVs. Using CNVs predicted by four exome-based CNV callers (CANOES, CODEX, XHMM and CLAMMS) from 503 samples, we demonstrate that CN-Learn identifies true CNVs at higher precision (~90%) and recall (~85%) rates while maintaining robust performance even when trained with minimal data (~30 samples). CN-Learn recovers twice as many CNVs compared to individual callers or Venn diagram-based approaches, with features such as exome capture probe count, caller concordance and GC content providing the most discriminatory power. In fact, about 58% of all true CNVs recovered by CN-Learn were either singletons or calls that lacked support from at least one caller. Our study underscores the limitations of current approaches for CNV identification and provides an effective method that yields high-quality CNVs for application in clinical diagnostics.",

Here we focused on flowering time, a trait of key importance for plant adaptation and life-cycle shifts. We undertook divergent selection experiments (Saclay DSEs) from two maize inbred lines. After 13 generations of selection, we obtained we obtained a time-lag of roughly two weeks between Early- and Late-populations. We used this material to characterize the genome-wide transcriptomic response to selection in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) before, during and after floral transition in realistic field conditions during two consecutive years. We validated the reliability of performing RNA-sequencing in uncontrolled conditions. We found that roughly half of maize genes were expressed in the SAM, 59.3% of which were differentially expressed. We detected a majority of genes with differential expression between inbreds and across meristem status, and retrieved a subset of 2,451 genes involved in the response to selection. Among these, we found a significant enrichment for genes with known function in maize flowering time. Furthermore, they were more often shared between inbreds than expected by chance, suggesting convergence of gene expression. We discuss new insights into the expression pattern of key players of the underlying gene regulatory network including ZCN8, RAP2.7, ZMM4, KN1, GA2ox1, as well as alternative scenarios for genetic convergence.",

    "abstract": "Many insects navigate by integrating the distances and directions travelled on an outward path, allowing direct return to the starting point. Fundamental to the reliability of this process is the use of a neural compass based on external celestial cues. Here we examine how such compass information could be reliably computed by the insect brain, given realistic constraints on the sky polarisation pattern and the insect eye sensor array. By processing the degree of polarisation in different directions for different parts of the sky, our model can directly estimate the solar azimuth and also infer the confidence of the estimate. We introduce a method to correct for tilting of the sensor array, as might be caused by travel over uneven terrain. We also show that the confidence can be used to approximate the change in sun position over time, allowing the compass to remain fixed with respect to  true north during long excursions. We demonstrate that the compass is robust to disturbances and can be effectively used as input to an existing neural model of insect path integration. We discuss the plausibility of our model to be mapped to known neural circuits, and to be implemented for robot navigation.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe propose a new hypothesis for how insects process polarised skylight to extract global orientation information that can be used for accurate path integration. Our model solves the problem of solar/anti-solar meridian ambiguity by using a biologically constrained sensor array, and includes methods to deal with tilt and time, providing a complete insect celestial compass output. We analyse the performance of the model using a realistic sky simulation and various forms of disturbances, and compare the results to both engineering approaches and biological data.",

    "abstract": "The activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) experiences periodically changing nutrient and oxygen availability. Tetrasphaera is the most abundant genus in Danish WWTP and represent up to 20-30% of the activated sludge community based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses, although it is in low abundance in the influent wastewater. Here we investigate how Tetrasphaera can successfully out-compete most other microorganisms in such highly dynamic ecosystems. To achive this, we analyze the physiological adaptations of the WWTP isolate T. elongata str. LP2 during an aerobic to anoxic shift by label-free quantitative proteomics and NMR-metabolomics. Escherichia coli was used as reference organism as it shares several metabolic capabilities and is regularly introduced to wastewater treatment plants, but without succeeding there. When compared to E. coli, only minor changes in the proteome of T. elongata were observed after the switch to anoxic conditions. This indicates that metabolic pathways for anaerobic energy harvest were already expressed during the aerobic growth. This allows continuous growth of Tetrasphaera immediately after the switch to anoxic conditions. Metabolomics furthermore revealed that the substrates provided were exploited far more efficiently by Tetrasphaera than by E. coli. These results suggest that T. elongata prosper in the dynamic WWTP environment due to adaptation to the changing environmental conditions.\n\nSignificance of the studyMembers of the genus Tetrasphaera are widely distributed and highly abundant in most well-operating WWTPs with EBPR configuration. However, despite their high abundance in situ, little is known about their physiology and ecological role. Although the importance of Tetrasphaera in engineered wastewater treatment systems is slowly being recognized, additional information is needed to understand the full extent of functions the microorganisms have in many of the essential biological processes in the WWTP. Such information may improve available process models and ultimately lead to better wastewater treatment as well as resource recovery. This study supplies proteomic and metabolomic data on the aerobic/anoxic adaptation of Tetrasphaera and provides a hypothesis on how Tetrasphaera might compete in dynamic engineered systems.",

Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) is key to prioritizing agricultural biosecurity efforts, but is hampered by incomplete knowledge of current crop pest and pathogen distributions. Here we develop predictive models of current pest distributions and test these models using new observations at sub-national resolution. We apply generalized linear models (GLM) to estimate presence probabilities for 1901 crop pests in the CABI pest distribution database. We test model predictions for 100 unobserved pests in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), against observations of these pests abstracted from the Chinese literature which has hitherto been omitted from databases on global pest distributions. Finally, we predict occurrences of all unobserved pests globally. Presence probability increases with host presence, presence in neighbouring regions, and global prevalence, and decreases with mean distance from coast, per capita GDP, and host number. The models are good predictors of pest presence in Provinces of the PRC, with AUC values of 0.76 - 0.80. Large numbers of currently unobserved, but probably present pests, are predicted in China, India, southern Brazil and some countries of the former USSR. GLMs can predict presences of pseudo-absent pests at sub-national resolution. Controlling for countries scientific capacity improves model fit. The Chinese scientific literature has been largely inaccessible to Western academia but contains important information that can support PRA.

    "abstract": "With seemingly little effort, humans can both identify an object across large changes in orientation and extend category membership to novel exemplars. Although researchers argue that object shape is crucial in these cases, there are open questions as to how shape is represented for object recognition. Here we tested whether the human visual system incorporates a three-dimensional skeletal descriptor of shape to determine an objects identity. Skeletal models not only provide a compact description of an objects global shape structure, but also provide a quantitative metric by which to compare the visual similarity between shapes. Our results showed that a model of skeletal similarity explained the greatest amount of variance in participants object dissimilarity judgments when compared with other computational models of visual similarity (Experiment 1). Moreover, parametric changes to an objects skeleton led to proportional changes in perceived similarity, even when controlling for another model of structure (Experiment 2). Importantly, participants preferentially categorized objects by their skeletons across changes to local shape contours and non-accidental properties (Experiment 3). Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal structure in vision, not only as a shape descriptor, but also as a diagnostic cue of object identity.",

    "abstract": "Broad spectrum antimicrobials, both in dental products and within the clinic, have been used in the suppression of cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans for over 40 years. One such antimicrobial is chlorhexidine (CHX), and serves as a standard in dental research against which other antimicrobial therapies are compared against for their efficacy. However, very little is known about the mode of action for CHX against Streptococci and whether tolerance can be developed from repeated exposures. Here, we begin to answer such questions by passaging S. mutans with increasing concentrations of CHX and isolating spontaneously-arising tolerant variants (CTVs) from separate lineages. We find that these CTVs display a higher minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) against CHX than the wild-type strain and have altered virulence properties such as acid tolerance and biofilm formation. We record higher MICs for the variants against both daptomycin and bacitracin, but find increased sensitivity to triclosan and sodium fluoride. Measurements of antagonistic capabilities against other health-associated oral streptococci show decreased bacteriocin production compared to wild-type and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Finally whole genome sequencing of the CTVs show common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a diacylglycerol kinase homolog and a glycolipid synthesis enzyme, altering LTA accumulation and potentially lipid profile of the cell wall. Together, these findings confirm that streptococci may develop tolerance to antimicrobial agents such as CHX but in the case of S. mutans, increased tolerance may come at a fitness cost for survival within oral biofilms that keeps variants suppressed within the population.",

    "abstract": "Functional ecology has increasingly focused on describing ecological communities based on their traits (measurable features affecting individuals fitness and performance). Analyzing trait distributions within and among forests could significantly improve understanding of community composition and ecosystem function. Historically, data on trait distributions are generated by (1) collecting a small number of leaves from a small number of trees, which suffers from limited sampling but produces information at the fundamental ecological unit (the individual); or (2) using remote sensing images to infer traits, producing information continuously across large regions, but as plots (containing multiple trees of different species) or pixels, not individuals. Remote sensing methods that identify individual trees and estimate their traits would provide the benefits of both approaches, producing continuous large-scale data linked to biological individuals. We used data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to develop a method to scale up functional traits from 160 trees to the millions of trees within the spatial extent of two NEON sites. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) image segmentation, to identify individual trees and estimate structural traits; 2) ensemble of models to infer leaf mass area (LMA), nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus content using hyperspectral signatures, and DBH from allometry; and 3) predictions for segmented crowns for the full remote sensing footprint at the NEON sites.\n\nThe R2 values on held out test data ranged from 0.41 to 0.75 on held out test data. The ensemble approach performed better than single partial least squares models. Carbon performed poorly compared to other traits (R2 of 0.41). The crown segmentation step contributed the most uncertainty in the pipeline, due to over-segmentation. The pipeline produced good estimates of DBH (R2 of 0.62 on held out data). Trait predictions for crowns performed significantly better than comparable predictions on pixels, resulting in improvement of R2 on test data of between to 0.26. We used the pipeline to produce individual level trait data for [~]5 million individual crowns, covering a total extent of [~]360 km2. This large dataset allows testing ecological questions on landscape scales, revealing that foliar traits are correlated with structural traits and environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin is part of the microtubule (MT)-binding motor protein superfamily, which exerts crucial functions in cell division and intracellular transport in different organelles. The heterotrimeric kinesin-II, consisting of the kinesin like protein KIF3A/3B heterodimer and kinesin-associated protein KAP3, is highly conserved across species between the green alga Chlamydomonas and humans. It plays diverse roles in cargo transport including anterograde (base to tip) trafficking in cilium. However, the molecular determinants mediating trafficking of heterotrimeric kinesin-II itself is poorly understood. Using the unicellular eukaryote Chlamydomonas and mammalian cells, we show that RanGTP regulates ciliary trafficking of KAP3. We found the armadillo repeat region 6-9 (ARM6-9) of KAP3, required for its nuclear translocation, is sufficient for its targeting to the ciliary base. Given that KAP3 is essential for cilia formation and the emerging roles of RanGTP/importin {beta} in ciliary protein targeting, we further investigate the effect of RanGTP in cilium length regulation in these two different systems. We demonstrate that precise control of RanGTP levels, revealed by different Ran mutants, is crucial for cilium formation and maintenance. Most importantly, we were able to segregate RanGTP regulation of ciliary protein incorporation from of its nuclear roles. Our work provides important support for the model that nuclear import mechanisms have been coopted for independent roles in ciliary import.",

    "abstract": "Maximal homology alignment is a new biologically-relevant approach to DNA sequence alignment that maps the internal dispersed microhomology of individual sequences onto two dimensions. It departs from the current method of gapped alignment, which uses a simplified binary state model of nucleotide position. In gapped alignment nucleotide positions have either no relationship (1-to-None) or else orthological relationship (1-to-1) with nucleotides in other sequences. Maximal homology alignment, however, allows additional states such as 1-to-Many and Many-to-Many, thus modeling both orthological and paralogical relationships, which together comprise the main homology types. Maximal homology alignment collects dispersed microparalogy into the same alignment columns on multiple rows, and thereby generates a two-dimensional representation of a single sequence. Sequence alignment then proceeds as the alignment of two-dimensional topological objects. The operations of producing and aligning two-dimensional auto-alignments motivate a need for tests of two-dimensional homological integrity. Here, I work out and implement basic principles for computationally testing the two dimensions of positional homology, which are inherent to biological sequences due to replication slippage and related errors. I then show that maximal homology alignment is more informative than gapped alignment in modeling the evolution of genetic sequences. In general, MHA is more suited when small insertions and deletions predominantly originate as local microparalogy. These results show that both conserved and non-conserved genomic sequences are enriched with a signature of replication slippage relative to their random permutations.",

However, these approaches have proven inefficient at identifying pathogenic repeat expansions. Here, we apply a collection of bioinformatics tools that can be utilized to identify either known or novel expanded repeat sequences in NGS data. We performed genetic studies of a cohort of 35 individuals from 22 families with a clinical diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Analysis of whole genome sequence (WGS) data with five independent algorithms identified a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion [(AAGGG)exp] in the gene encoding Replication Factor C1 (RFC1). This motif, not reported in the reference sequence, localized to an Alu element and replaced the reference (AAAAG)11 short tandem repeat. Genetic analyses confirmed the pathogenic expansion in 18 of 22 CANVAS families and identified a core ancestral haplotype, estimated to have arisen in Europe over twenty-five thousand years ago. WGS of the four RFC1 negative CANVAS families identified plausible variants in three, with genomic re-diagnosis of SCA3, spastic ataxia of the Charlevoix-Saguenay type and SCA45. This study identified the genetic basis of CANVAS and demonstrated that these improved bioinformatics tools increase the diagnostic utility of WGS to determine the genetic basis of a heterogeneous group of clinically overlapping neurogenetic disorders.",

Adult neurogenesis disrupts this balance through the continuous addition of new granule cells (GCs) that display high excitability while develop and connect within the preexisting host circuit. The dynamics of the connectivity map for developing GCs in the local inhibitory networks remains unknown. We used optogenetics to study afferent and efferent synaptogenesis between new GCs and GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV-INs) and somatostatin (SST-INs). Inputs from PV-INs targeted the soma and remained immature until they grew abruptly in >4-week-old GCs. This transition was accelerated by exposure to enriched environment. Inputs from SST-INs were dendritic and developed slowly until reaching maturity by 8 weeks. Synaptic outputs from GCs onto PV-INs matured faster than those onto SST-INs, but also required several weeks. In the mature dentate network, PV-INs exerted an efficient control of GC spiking and were involved in both feedforward and feedback loops, a mechanism that would favor lateral inhibition and sparse coding. Our results reveal a long-lasting transition where adult-born neurons remain poorly coupled to inhibition, which might enable a parallel streaming channel from the entorhinal cortex to CA3 pyramidal cells.",

PBS3 catalyzes the conjugation of glutamate to isochorismate. The reaction product isochorismate-9-glutamate spontaneously decomposes into enolpyruvyl-N-glutamate and SA.

    "abstract": "Humans actively sample their environment with saccadic eye movements to bring relevant information into high-acuity foveal vision. Despite being lower in resolution, peripheral information is also available prior to each saccade. How pre-saccadic extrafoveal preview of a visual object influences its post-saccadic processing is still an unanswered question. Here, we investigated this question by simultaneously recording behavior and fixation-related brain potentials while human subjects made saccades to face stimuli. We manipulated the relationship between pre-saccadic \\\"previews\\\" and post-saccadic images to explicitly isolate the influences of the former. Subjects performed a gender discrimination task on a newly foveated face under three preview conditions: phase-scrambled face, incongruent face (different identity from the foveated face), and congruent face (same identity). As expected, reaction times were faster after a congruent-face preview compared to the phase-scrambled and incongruent conditions. Importantly, a face preview (either incongruent or congruent) resulted in a strong reduction of post-saccadic neural responses. Specifically, we analyzed the classic face-selective N170 component at occipito-temporal EEG electrodes, which was still present in our experiments with active looking. We found that this component was strongly attenuated for face preview conditions compared to scrambled conditions. This large and long-lasting decrease in evoked activity is consistent with an active prediction mechanism influencing category-specific neural processing at the start of a new fixation. These findings constrain theories of visual stability and show that the extrafoveal preview methodology can be a useful tool to investigate its underlying mechanisms.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNeural correlates of object recognition have traditionally been studied by flashing stimuli to the central visual field. This procedure differs in fundamental ways from natural vision, where viewers actively sample the environment with eye movements and also obtain a low-resolution preview of soon-to-be-fixated objects. Here we show that the N170, a classic electrophysiological marker of the structural processing of faces, also occurs during a more natural viewing condition but is massively reduced due to extrafoveal preprocessing (preview benefit). Our results therefore highlight the importance of peripheral vision during trans-saccadic processing in building a coherent and stable representation of the world around us.",

The CA tissue concentration information was taken as the input in the data-driven OMT model. The OMT approach was tested on HNSCC DCE data that provides quantitative information for forward flux ({Phi}F) and backward flux ({Phi}B). OMT-derived {Phi}F was compared with the volume transfer constant for CA, Ktrans, derived from the Extended Tofts Model (ETM). The OMT-derived flows showed a consistent jump in the CA diffusive behavior across the images in accordance with the known CA dynamics. The mean forward flux was 0.0082 {+/-} 0.0091 (min-1) whereas the mean advective component was 0.0052{+/-}0.0086 (min-1) in the HNSCC patients. The diffusive percentages in forward and backward flux ranged from 8.67-18.76% and 12.76-30.36%, respectively. The OMT model accounts for intervoxel CA movement and results show that the forward flux ({Phi}F) is comparable with the ETM-derived Ktrans.

We have extended these tools for analysis of two-color images to resolve heteromeric interactions between molecules labeled with spectrally distinct chromophores. We call these new methods two-color SpIDA (2c-SpIDA) and two-color spatial cumulant analysis (2c-SpCA). To implement these techniques on a hyperspectral imaging system, we developed a spectral shift filtering (SSF) technique to remove artifacts due to intrinsic crosstalk between detector bins. We determined that 2c-SpCA provides better resolution from samples containing multiple fluorescent species, hence this technique was carried forward to study images of living cells. We used fluorescent heterodimers labeled with EGFP and mApple to quantify the effects of resonance energy transfer and incomplete maturation of mApple on brightness measurements. We show that 2c-SpCA can detect the interaction between two components of trimeric G-protein complexes. Thus 2c-SpCA presents a robust and computationally expedient means of measuring heteromeric interactions in cellular environments.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceFluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) techniques determine biophysical parameters from samples containing fluorescently labeled biomolecules by considering the statistical nature of fluorescent signals measured with photodetectors. The present study introduces two-color spatial cumulant analysis (2c-SpCA) to the canon of FFS techniques. 2c-SpCA analyzes pixel-value data of two-color images collected with laser scanning fluorescence microscopes. We show that 2c-SpCA can determine several biophysical parameters in living cells including Forster resonance energy transfer efficiency, the dark state fraction of fluorescent proteins, and heteromerization between distinctly labeled proteins. In comparison to existing techniques, 2c-SpCA requires very few image frames for analysis, minimal computations, and can be applied to images of fixed tissue samples.",

    "abstract": "Purple nonsulfur bacteria (PNSB) use light for energy and organic substrates for carbon and electrons when growing photoheterotrophically. This lifestyle generates more reduced electron carriers than are required for biosynthesis, even during consumption of some of the most oxidized organic substrates like malate and fumarate. Excess reduced electron carriers must be oxidized for photoheterotrophic growth to occur. Diverse PNSB commonly rely on the CO2-fixing Calvin cycle to oxidize excess reduced electron carriers. Some PNSB also produce H2 or reduce terminal electron acceptors as alternatives to the Calvin cycle. Rhodospirillum rubrum Calvin cycle mutants defy this trend by growing phototrophically on malate or fumarate without H2 production or access to terminal electron acceptors. We used 13C-tracer experiments to examine how a Rs. rubrum Calvin cycle mutant maintains electron balance under such conditions. We detected the reversal of some TCA cycle enzymes, which carried reductive flux from malate or fumarate to -ketoglutarate. This pathway and the reductive synthesis of amino acids derived from -ketoglutarate are likely important for electron balance, as supplementing the growth medium with -ketoglutarate-derived amino acids prevented Rs. rubrum Calvin cycle mutant growth unless a terminal electron acceptor was provided. Flux estimates also suggested that the Calvin cycle mutant preferentially synthesized isoleucine using the reductive threonine-dependent pathway instead of the less-reductive citramalate-dependent pathway. Collectively, our results suggest that alternative biosynthetic pathways can contribute to electron balance within the constraints of a relatively constant biomass composition.",

    "abstract": "Many metazoan genes express alternative long 3' UTR isoforms in the nervous system, but their functions remain largely unclear. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Dscam1 gene generates short and long (Dscam1-L) 3' UTR isoforms due to alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we found that the RNA-binding protein Embryonic Lethal Abnormal Visual System (Elav) impacts Dscam1 biogenesis at two levels, including regulation of long 3' UTR biogenesis and skipping of an upstream exon (exon 19). MinION long-read sequencing confirmed the connectivity of this alternative splicing event to the long 3' UTR. Knockdown or CRISPR deletion of Dscam1-L impaired axon growth in Drosophila. The Dscam1 long 3' UTR was found to be required for correct Elav-mediated skipping of exon 19. Elav thus co-regulates APA and alternative splicing to generate specific Dscam1 transcripts that are essential for neural development. This coupling of APA to alternative splicing might represent a new class of regulated RNA processing.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/613059_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (45K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a23558org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c3dddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e1808forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bf3888_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIElav regulates Dscam1 long 3' UTR (Dscam1-L) biogenesis\\nC_LIO_LILong-read sequencing reveals connectivity of long 3' UTR to skipping of upstream exon 19\\nC_LIO_LILoss of Dscam1-L impairs axon outgrowth\\nC_LIO_LIDscam1 long 3' UTR is required for correct splicing of exon 19\\nC_LI",

These \\\"lapses\\\" are treated as a nuisance arising from noise tangential to the decision, e.g. inattention or motor errors. Here, we use a multisensory decision task in rats to demonstrate that these explanations cannot account for lapses stimulus dependence. We propose a novel explanation: lapses reflect a strategic trade-off between exploiting known rewarding actions and exploring uncertain ones. We tested the models predictions by selectively manipulating one actions reward magnitude or probability. As uniquely predicted by this model, changes were restricted to lapses associated with that action. Finally, we show that lapses are a powerful tool for assigning decision-related computations to neural structures based on disruption experiments (here, posterior striatum and secondary motor cortex). These results suggest that lapses reflect an integral component of decision-making and are informative about action values in normal and disrupted brain states.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression plays an important role in developmental timing in plants and animals. FUSCA3 regulates the transition between different phases of development by acting as a link between different hormonal pathways in Arabidopsis. However, the mechanisms governing its spatiotemporal expression patterns are poorly understood. Here, we show that FUS3 is expressed in the chalaza and funiculus of the mature ovule and seed, but is repressed in the embryo sac, integuments and endosperm. FUS3 repression requires class I BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (BPC) proteins, which directly bind to the FUS3 locus and restrict its expression pattern. During vegetative and reproductive development, derepression of FUS3 in bpc1/2 or pML1:FUS3 misexpression lines results in dwarf plants carrying defective flowers and aborted ovules. Post-fertilization, ectopic FUS3 expression in the endosperm increases endosperm nuclei proliferation and seed size and delays or arrests embryo development. These phenotypes are rescued in bpc1/2 fus3-3. Lastly, class I BPCs interact with FIS-PRC2 (FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED-Polycomb Repressive Complex 2), which represses FUS3 in the endosperm. We propose that BPC1/2 promotes the transition from reproductive to seed development by repressing FUS3 in ovule integuments. After fertilization, BPC1/2 and FIS-PRC2 repress FUS3 in the endosperm to coordinate endosperm and embryo growth.",

Using bulk RNA-seq data from 53 GTEx tissues, we applied cell-type deconvolution algorithms to evaluate the immune landscape across the healthy human body. We first performed a differential expression analysis of inflamed versus non-inflamed samples to identify essential pathways and regulators of infiltration. Next, we found 21 of 73 infiltration-related phenotypes to be associated with either age or sex (FDR < 0.1). Through our genetic analysis, we discovered 13 infiltration-related phenotypes have genome-wide significant associations (iQTLs) (P < 5.0 x 10-8), with a significant enrichment of tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci in suggested iQTLs (P < 10-5). We highlight an association between neutrophil content in lung tissue and a variant near the CUX1 transcription factor gene (P = 9.7 x 10-11), which has been previously linked to neutrophil infiltration, inflammatory mechanisms, and the regulation of several immune response genes. Together, our results identify key factors influencing inter-individual variability of specific tissue infiltration patterns, which could provide insights on therapeutic targets for shifting infiltration profiles to a more favorable one.",

    "abstract": "Plants possess myriads of secondary metabolites with a broad spectrum of health-promoting benefits. Up to date, plant extraction is still the primary route to produce high-value natural products, which inherently suffers from economics and scalability issues. Heterologous production in microbial host is considered as a feasible approach to overcoming these limitations. Flavonoid and its hydroxylated derivatives represent a diversified family of bioactive compounds, most prominently known as antioxidant and anti-aging agents. Oleaginous yeast is rich in hydrophobic lipid bodies and spatially-organized organelles, which provides the ideal environment for the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of many plant-specific enzymes. In this report, we validated that Y. lipolytica is a superior platform for heterologous production of high-value flavonoids and hydroxylated flavonoids. By modular construction and characterization, we determined the rate-limiting steps for efficient flavonoids biosynthesis in Y. lipolytica. We evaluated various precursor pathways and unleashed the metabolic potential of Y. lipolytica to produce flavonoids, including the supply of acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and chorismate. Coupled with the optimized chalcone synthase module and the hydroxylation module, our engineered strain produced 252.4 mg/L naringenin, 134.2 mg/L eriodictyol and 110.5 mg/L taxifolin from glucose. Collectively, these findings demonstrate our ability to harness oleaginous yeast as microbial workhorse to expand natures biosynthetic potential, enabling us to bridge the gap between drug discovery and natural product manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "In epidemiological studies it is common practice to work with binary variables that reflect the presence of certain diseases, which in turn may be associated with another set of variables, that in general are assumed as risk factors of the former. In the field of epidemiological studies referred to oral health, it is common to inquire about the relationship between the presence of some pathologies and certain characteristics of the study participants through generalized linear models (GLM). However, this type of analysis is usually carried out for each variable of interest separately and at no time is a measure obtained that summarizes the status of each participant. The objective was to apply and compare two methodologies; one applying classical approach of explaining each oral disease separately from a set of explanatory variables and another using item response theory (IRT) models (specifically the Rasch model) since they allow the joint analysis of a set of variables obtaining an individual assessment as a by-product, which in this case is interpreted as \\\"sickness proneness\\\". On the other hand, the analysis presented here extends the Rasch model including a linear predictor that allows to investigate about the possible effect of several factors on the propensity of the individuals to suffer the different pathologies. Our results found evidence of an effect of gender, insufficient physical activity (IPhA) and age on general proneness to oral diseases.",

    "abstract": "The lagovirus Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) has been circulating in Australia since the mid-1990s when it was deliberately released to control overabundant rabbit populations. In recent years, the viral diversity of different RHDVs in Australia has increased, and currently four different types of RHDV are known to be circulating. To allow for ongoing epidemiological studies and impact assessments of these viruses on Australian wild rabbit populations, it is essential that serological tools are updated. To this end, Reference sera were produced against all four virulent RHDVs (including RHDV2) known to be present in Australia and tested in a series of available immunological assays originally developed for the prototype RHDV, to assess patterns of cross reactivity and the usefulness of these assays to detect lagovirus antibodies, either in a generic or specific manner. Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assays (ELISAs) developed to detect antibody isotypes IgM, IgA and IgG were sufficiently cross reactive to detect antibodies raised against all four virulent lagoviruses. For the more specific detection of antibodies to the antigenically more different RHDV2, a competition ELISA was adapted using RHDV2 specific monoclonal antibodies in combination with Australian viral antigen. Archival serum banks from a long term rabbit monitoring site where rabbits were sampled quarterly over a period of six years were re-screened using this assay, and revealed serological evidence for the arrival of RHDV2 in this population at least six months prior to its initial detection in Australia in a deceased rabbit in May 2015. The serological methods and reference reagents described here will provide valuable tools to study presence, prevalence and impact of RHDV2 on Australian rabbit populations; however the discrimination of different antigenic variants of RHDVs as well as mixed infections at the serological level remains challenging.",

Although inflammation is thought to partly explain this link, its relation with mental health is still unclear and largely unexplored.\\n\\nWe investigated three scales assessing psychological resilience (CD-RISC), depression symptoms (PHQ8) and mental wellbeing (SF36-MCS) in an Italian adult population cohort (Nmax=16,952). We performed stepwise generalized linear models to test the association between each scale and INFLA-score, a composite blood-based inflammation index. At each step, a class of potential mediators was included in the model, namely health conditions, lifestyle factors, or both (full model). Full model analysis was also conducted on single blood markers involved in the inflammatory process.\\n\\nIn the baseline model, we observed significant associations of PHQ8 (standardized {beta}=0.024, p=8.9x10-3) and SF36-MCS ({beta} = -0.021, p=7x10-3) with INFLA-score. These associations survived adjustment for health conditions but not for lifestyle factors, which explained 81% and 17% of the association with PHQ8 and SF36-MCS, respectively. Significant associations (p<4.2x10-3) after mediator adjustment were observed for single low-grade inflammation markers, including platelet distribution width (with PHQ8 and CD-RISC), granulocyte-and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios, monocyte and lymphocyte fractions (with SF36-MCS).\\n\\nThese findings suggest that the relationship between mental health and low-grade inflammation is largely influenced by lifestyle. However, the associations with specific biomarkers related to inflammation are partly independent and might be explained by biological factors. Interestingly, these associations are in line with recent blood transcriptomic analyses of depressed subjects, reporting up- and down-regulation of genes related to innate and adaptive immunity, respectively.",

However, the role of family and socioeconomic factors in these associations is often overlooked.\\n\\nMethods and findingsUsing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we assess associations of ACE between birth and 16 years (sexual, physical or emotional abuse, emotional neglect, parental substance abuse, parental mental illness or suicide attempt, violence between parents, parental separation, bullying, and parental criminal conviction) with educational attainment at 16 years (n=9,959) and health at age 17 years (depression, obesity, harmful alcohol use, smoking and illicit drug use, n=4,917). We explore the extent to which associations are robust to adjustment for family and socioeconomic factors, whether associations differ according to socioeconomic factors, and estimate the proportion of adverse educational and health outcomes attributable to ACE, family or socioeconomic measures.\\n\\nThere were strong associations of ACE with lower educational attainment and higher risk of depression, drug use and smoking. Associations with educational attainment attenuated after adjustment but remained strong. Associations with depression, drug use and smoking were not altered by adjustment. Associations of ACE with harmful alcohol use and obesity were weak. We found no evidence that associations differed by socioeconomic factors. Between 5-15% of the cases of adverse educational and health outcomes occur amongst people experiencing 4+ ACE, and between 1-19% occur in people whose mothers have a low level of education.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates strong associations between ACE and lower educational attainment and worse health that are independent of family and socioeconomic factors. Our findings imply that interventions that focus solely on ACE or solely on socioeconomic deprivation, whilst beneficial, would miss most cases of adverse educational and health outcomes. Intervention strategies should therefore target a wide range of relevant factors, including ACE, socioeconomic deprivation, parental substance use and mental health.",

    "abstract": "We present a solution method to the problem of choosing empirical treatments that minimize the cumulative infected patient-days in the long run in a health care facility. We rely on the stochastic version of a compartmental model to describe the spread of an infecting organism in the health care facility, and the emergence and spread of resistance to two drugs. We assume that the parameters of the model are known. Empirical treatments are chosen at the beginning of each period based on the count of patients with each health status. The same treatment is then administered to all patients, including uninfected patients, during the period and cannot be adjusted until the next period. Our solution method is a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. In our simulations, it allows to reduce the average cumulative infected patient-days over two years by 47.0% compared to the best standard therapy. We explain how our algorithm can be used either to perform online optimization, or to produce data for quantitative analysis.",

Participants consent to be followed-up every 6 months; for their details to be used to access their routinely-collected NHS records for research purposes; to be contacted about research projects in which they could participate; and to be informed about involvement or engagement opportunities. Data are collected using a web-based application, with new questionnaires added every six months. Data collection on socio-demographic and lifestyle factors is repeated at two-to-three year intervals. Recruitment is ongoing, with 21,779 active participants (alive and currently registered).\\n\\nFindings to date99% of participants have complete information on age and sex, and 64% have completed questionnaires on socio-demographic and lifestyle factors. These data can be linked with national health databases within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank, with 93% of participants matching a record in SAIL. HWW has facilitated recruitment of 43,826 participants to 15 different studies.\\n\\nFuture plansThe medium-term goal for the project is to enrol at least 50,000 adults. Recruitment strategies are being devised to achieve a study sample that closely models the population of Wales, with sufficient numbers in socio-demographic subgroups to allow for the selection of populations for research from those groups. Potential bio-sampling methods are also currently being explored.",

    "abstract": "The lack of effective vaccines for many endemic diseases often forces policymakers to enact control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, such as vector control, in order to reduce the massive burden of these diseases. It is well known that controls can have counterintuitive effects, such as the honeymoon effect, in which partially effective controls cause not only a greater initial reduction in infection than expected for an infection near its endemic equilibrium, but also large outbreaks during control as a result of accumulation of susceptibles. Unfortunately, many control measures cannot be maintained indefinitely, and the results of cessation are not well understood. Here, we examine the results of stopped or failed non-immunizing control measures in endemic settings. By using a mathematical model to compare the cumulative number of cases expected with and without the control measures, we show that deployment of control can lead to a larger total number of infections, counting from the time that control started, than without any control - the divorce effect. This result is directly related to the population-level loss of immunity resulting from non-immunizing controls and is seen in model results from a number of settings when non-immunizing controls are used against an infection that confers immunity. Finally, we also examine three control plans for minimizing the magnitude of the divorce effect in seasonal infections and show that they are incapable of eliminating the divorce effect. While we do not suggest stopping control programs that rely on non-immunizing controls, our results strongly argue that the accumulation of susceptibility should be considered before deploying such controls against endemic infections when indefinite use of the control is unlikely. We highlight that our results are particularly germane to endemic mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue virus, both for routine management involving vector control and for field trials of novel control approaches.\n\nAuthor SummaryMany common endemic infections lack effective, inexpensive vaccinations, and control relies instead on transmission reduction, e.g. mosquito population reduction for dengue. Often, these controls are used with the immediate goal of decreasing the current incidence with little importance placed on what will happen at later points in time, and much less what will happen once the control is stopped. Here, by looking at the cumulative incidence since the beginning of the control period, instead of the instantaneous incidence, we show that when controls are stopped, or fail, the resulting outbreaks can be large enough to completely eliminate any benefit of the control. We call this result the divorce effect. Further, we show that this result is not limited to specific transmission pathways or epidemiological parameters, but is instead tied directly to the reduction of herd immunity inherent in non-immunizing controls. Lastly, by evaluating programs to minimize the magnitude of the divorce effect, we show that without maintaining herd immunity, or successfully continuing control for decades, it is impossible to keep the costs of post-control outbreaks from outweighing the benefits of the control program.",

The most important geohelminths are; roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworms (Trichuris trichiura) and hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). The study aimed at investigating the current epidemiological status of soil-transmitted helminth infections among pregnant women in Kilifi County hospital (KCH) following the intervention of preventive chemotherapy.\\n\\nData collection and analysis involved evaluation of transmission trends of geohelminths from the previous surveys/ hospital records, use of direct fecal smears and Kato-Katz smears in estimation of prevalence and infection intensity and the use of structured questionnaires for the assessment of the predisposing factors associated with STH infections. Logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the risk factors associated with STH infections.\\n\\nA total of 191 stool samples were collected and analyzed. Three species of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) were identified with the overall prevalence of any STH infection being 16.75%. Trichuris trichiura was predominant (8.38 %), followed by A. lumbricoides (7.85%) then hookworms (6.29 %). About 10.99% of the participants had a single worm infection, 5.76 % had double co-infections and none of the participants had triple infection.\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy appears to give maximal returns in terms of reducing significantly the number of geohelminths reported since 2001. The study recommended the routine stool analysis in the antenatal profile, provision of alternative sources of iron to the pregnant women in order to reduce the tendency for soil consumption and the associated risk of STH infections, provision of safe water for domestic use, improved sanitation and proper personal hygiene (WASH).",

    "abstract": "Accurate, cost-effective measurement of the burden of co-endemic infections would enable public health managers to identify opportunities for implementation of integrated control programs. Dried blood spots (DBS) collected during a cross-sectional lymphatic filariasis sentinel site survey in the Kenyan coastal counties of Lamu, Tana River, Kilifi, Kwale, and Taita-Taveta were used for the integrated detection of serologic IgG antibodies against antigens from several parasitic infections (Wuchereria bancrofti, Schistosoma mansoni, Plasmodium spp, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis) as well as markers for immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases (measles, diphtheria, and tetanus) on a multiplex bead assay (MBA) platform. High heterogeneity was observed in antibody responses by pathogen and antigen across the sentinel sites. Antibody seroprevalence against Wb123, Bm14, and Bm33 recombinant filarial antigens were generally higher in Ndau Island (p<0.0001), which also had the highest prevalence of filarial antigenemia compared to other communities. Antibody responses to the Plasmodium species antigens CSP and MSP-119 were higher in Kilifi and Kwale counties, with Jaribuni community showing higher overall mean seroprevalence (p<0.0001). Kimorigo community in Taita-Taveta County was the only area where antibody responses against Schistosoma mansoni Sm25 recombinant antigen were detected. Seroprevalence rates to Strongyloides antigen NIE ranged between 3% and 26%, and there was high heterogeneity in immune responses against an Ascaris antigen among the study communities. Differences were observed between communities in terms of seroprevalence to vaccine-preventable diseases. Seroprotection to tetanus was lower in all 3 communities in Kwale County compared to the rest of the communities. This study has demonstrated that the MBA platform holds promise for rapid integrated monitoring of trends of infections of public health importance in endemic areas, and assessing the effectiveness of control and elimination programs.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEstablishment of successful private-public partnerships in the recent past has led to an increase in resources available for control and elimination of malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). Implementation of control and elimination programs and their subsequent monitoring and evaluation would be greatly facilitated by development of new tools and strategies for rapid identification of areas of transmission so that interventions could be prioritized to regions where they were most needed. Since development of antibody responses in a host depend on exposure to an infectious agent, assessment of such serologic markers provides a sensitive way to measure differences between populations in pathogen exposure. Our study applied a state-of-the-art multiplex bead assay platform to perform integrated measurement of antibody responses to multiple parasitic diseases and immunizing antigens for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) in ten lymphatic filariasis sentinel sites across the Kenyan coastal region. A community-level analysis of age-specific and overall mean seroprevalence fit using a flexible model ensemble provided an improved understanding about the distributions of the various parasitic infections and seroprotection to VPDs. This study provides an important proof of concept for how we could dramatically increase the value of existing surveillance activities using small volumes of blood collected on filter paper and analyzed using a single multiplex laboratory assay and novel data analysis techniques.",

    "abstract": "Acetyl-CoA is the central metabolic node connecting glycolysis, Krebs cycle and fatty acids synthase. Plant-derived polyketides, are assembled from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, represent a large family of biological compounds with diversified bioactivity. Harnessing microbial bioconversion is considered as a feasible approach to large-scale production of polyketides from renewable feedstocks. Most of the current polyketide production platform relied on the lengthy glycolytic steps to provide acetyl-CoA, which inherently suffers from complex regulation with metabolically-costly cofactor/ATP requirements. Using the simplest polyketide triacetic acid lactone (TAL) as a target molecule, we demonstrate that acetate uptake pathway in oleaginous yeast (Yarrowia lipolytica) could function as an acetyl-CoA shortcut to achieve metabolic optimality in producing polyketides. We identified the metabolic bottlenecks to rewire acetate utilization for efficient TAL production in Y. lipolytica, including generation of the driving force for acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. The engineered strain, with the overexpression of endogenous acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), malic enzyme (MAE1) and a bacteria-derived cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), affords robust TAL production with titer up to 4.76 g/L from industrial glacier acetic acid in shake flasks, representing 8.5-times improvement over the parental strain. The acetate-to-TAL conversion ratio (0.149 g/g) reaches 31.9% of the theoretical maximum yield. The carbon flux through this acetyl-CoA metabolic shortcut exceeds the carbon flux afforded by the native acetyl-CoA pathways. Potentially, acetic acid could be manufactured in large-quantity at low-cost from Syngas fermentation or heterogenous catalysis (methanol carbonylation). This alternative carbon sources present a metabolic advantage over glucose to unleash intrinsic pathway limitations and achieve high carbon conversion efficiency and cost-efficiency. This work also highlights that low-cost acetic acid could be sustainably upgraded to high-value polyketides by oleaginous yeast species in an eco-friendly and cost-efficient manner.",

However, the molecular basis underpinning NTHi transition from a commensal to a pathogen is not clearly understood. Here, we performed comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses of 12 paired, isogenic NTHi strains, isolated from the nasopharynx (NP) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of 11 children with chronic lung disease, to identify convergent molecular signatures associated with lung adaptation. Comparative genomic analyses of the 12 NP-BAL pairs demonstrated that five were genetically identical, with the remaining seven differing by only 1 to 3 mutations. Within-patient transcriptomic analyses identified between 2 and 58 differentially expressed genes in 8 of the 12 NP-BAL pairs, including pairs with no observable genomic changes. Whilst no convergence was observed at the gene level, functional enrichment analysis revealed significant under-representation of differentially expressed genes belonging to Coenzyme metabolism, Function unknown, Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis Cluster of Orthologous Groups categories. In contrast, Carbohydrate transport and metabolism, Cell motility and secretion, Intracellular trafficking and secretion, and Energy production categories were over-represented. This observed trend amongst genetically-unrelated NTHi strains provides evidence of convergent transcriptional adaptation of NTHi to paediatric airways that deserves further exploration. Understanding the pathoadaptative mechanisms that NTHi employs to infect and persist in the lower paediatric airways is essential for devising targeted diagnostics and treatments aimed at minimising disease severity, and ultimately, preventing NTHi lung infections and subsequent chronic lung disease in children.",

However, considering its wide-field detection mode, LTFM suffers from shallow penetration depth as a result of crosstalk induced by tissue scattering. In contrast to the spatial filtering based on confocal slit detection, we propose the extended detection LTFM (ED-LTFM), the first technique to extract signals from scattered photons and thus effectively extend the imaging depth.

    "abstract": "Our daily life is realized by the complex orchestrations of diverse brain functions including perception, decision, and action. One of the central issues in cognitive neuroscience is to reveal the complete representations underlying such diverse functions. Recent studies have revealed representations of natural perceptual experiences using encoding models1-5. However, there has been little attempt to build a quantitative model describing the cortical organization of multiple active, cognitive processes. Here, we measured brain activity using functional MRI while subjects performed over 100 cognitive tasks, and examined cortical representations with two voxel-wise encoding models6. A sparse task-type encoding model revealed a hierarchical organization of cognitive tasks, their representation in cognitive space, and their mapping onto the cortex. A cognitive factor encoding model utilizing continuous intermediate features by using metadata-based inferences7 predicted brain activation patterns for more than 80 % of the cerebral cortex and decoded more than 95 % of tasks, even under novel task conditions. This study demonstrates the usability of quantitative models of natural cognitive processes and provides a framework for the comprehensive cortical organization of human cognition.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression changes in brain microglia from mouse models of Alzheimers disease (AD) are highly characterized and reflect specific myeloid cell activation states that could modulate AD risk or progression. While some groups have produced valuable expression profiles for human brain cells1-4, the cellular clarity with which we now view transcriptional responses in mouse AD models has not yet been realized for human AD tissues due to limited availability of fresh tissue samples and technological hurdles of recovering transcriptomic data with cell-type resolution from frozen samples. We developed a novel method for isolating multiple cell types from frozen post-mortem specimens of superior frontal gyrus for RNA-Seq and identified 66 genes differentially expressed between AD and control subjects in the myeloid cell compartment. Myeloid cells sorted from fusiform gyrus of the same subjects showed similar changes, and whole tissue RNA analyses further corroborated our findings. The changes we observed did not resemble the \\\"damage-associated microglia\\\" (DAM) profile described in mouse AD models5, or other known activation states from other disease models. Instead, roughly half of the changes were consistent with an \\\"enhanced human aging\\\" phenotype, whereas the other half, including the AD risk gene APOE, were altered in AD myeloid cells but not differentially expressed with age. We refer to this novel profile in human Alzheimers microglia/myeloid cells as the HAM signature. These results, which can be browsed at research-pub.gene.com/BrainMyeloidLandscape/reviewVersion, highlight considerable differences between myeloid activation in mouse models and human disease, and provide a genome-wide picture of brain myeloid activation in human AD.",

    "abstract": "Factor XI deficiency is associated with mild to moderate bleeding upon injury. Treatment of bleeding in patients can be a challenge due to the limited availability of factor XI concentrates that may also have thrombotic side effects, and the volume overload as a result of plasma transfusion. In our in vitro study, we established that recombinant factor IX concentrate Benefix(R) (Pfizer) was able to potently enhance thrombin generation in factor XI depleted plasma when coagulation was initiated via the extrinsic pathway. This was due to the contamination of Benefix(R) with very low amounts of factor IXa that compensated for the lack of factor XI in plasma. Our data suggest that bleeding due to factor XI deficiency or antithrombotic therapy targeting factor XI may be treated with certain factor IX concentrates, which should be investigated in future clinical studies.",

A 3D numerical model of a white matter voxel was created that consists of an isotropic capillary bed and anisotropic vessels that run in parallel with white matter tracts and are surrounded by perivascular spaces. The signal within the voxel was simulated by solving the Bloch-Torrey equation. Experimental perfusion data were acquired with a gradient echo dynamic susceptibility contrast scan. White matter fibre orientation was mapped with diffusion tensor imaging. Our numerical model of the contrast agent induced increase in R2*, as a function of tissue orientation, was fit to dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI data from thirteen subjects by minimizing the bias-corrected Akaike information criterion. White matter blood volume fraction in both the isotropic and the anisotropic vessels was determined as a free parameter, and results were analyzed as a function of diffusivity and perivascular space size. Total white matter blood volume was found to be 2.57%, with one third of the blood residing in blood vessels that run parallel with white matter tracts. Gradient echo dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI strongly depended on white matter tissue orientation and, according to the numerical simulations, this effect is amplified by diffusion and perivascular spaces.",

    "abstract": "Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is a T=1 non-enveloped icosahedral virus that has a major impact on the swine industry as an agent of porcine circovirus associate disease. PCV2 capsid protein sequences have been employed by others to provide a temporal description of the emerging genotypes. PCV2a is believed to be the earliest genotype and responsible for giving rise to PCV2b, which gives rise to PCV2d. The underlying mechanism responsible for the emerging genotypes is not understood. To determine if a change in the PCV2d capsid accompanies the emergence of this genotype, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy image reconstruction of PCV2d VLP at 3.3 [A] resolution and compared it to the previously reported PCV2a and PCV2b structures. Differences between the CD and GH loops identify structural changes that accompany the emergence of PCV2b from PCV2a, and PCV2d from PCV2b. We also model additional amino acids for the N-terminus near the icosahedral 3-fold axes of symmetry and a tetranucleotide between the 5- and 2-fold axes of symmetry. To interpret the sequence diversity that defines the PCV2 genotypes on a structural platform we have performed structure-based sequence comparison. Our analysis demonstrates that each genotype possesses a unique set of amino acids located on the surface of the capsid that experience a high degree of substitution. These substitutions may be a response to the PCV2 vaccination program. The structural difference between PCV2a, b and d genotypes indicate that it is important to determine the PCV2 capsid structure as the virus evolves into different genotypes.\\n\\nImportancePCV2 is a significant epidemic agricultural pathogen that is the causative agent of a variety of swine illnesses. PCV2 infections have significant economic impact in the swine industry and must be controlled by vaccination. Outbreaks in farms vaccinated for PCV2 suggest that improvements to the current vaccination programs are needed. Better understanding of the assembly, structure, replication and evolution of these viruses is necessary for production of improved vaccines. The ability of PCV2 to rapidly shift genotypes suggests that expression systems capable of rapidly producing large quantities of virus-like particles should be pursued. To these ends we have established a mammalian cell-based virus-like particle expression system and performed high resolution structural studies of a new PCV2 genotype. Differences between the structure of this genotype and earlier genotypes demonstrate that it is important to study the PCV2 structure as it shifts genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Rab GTPases are responsible for a variety of membrane trafficking and vesicular transportation in fungi. But the role of Rab GTPases in Fusarium verticillioides, one of the key corn pathogens worldwide, remains elusive. These Small GTPases in fungi, particularly those homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sec4, are known to be associated with protein secretion, vesicular trafficking, secondary metabolism and pathogenicity. Here, we characterized the molecular functions of FvSec4 by generating a null mutant and learned that it is important for vegetative growth, hyphal branching, and conidiation. Interestingly, the mutation did not impair the expression of key conidiation-related genes. Meanwhile, the mutant did not show any defect in sexual development, including perithecia production. GFP-FvSec4 localized to growing hyphal tips, and raised the possibility that FvSec4 is involved in protein trafficking and endocytosis. The mutant exhibited defect in corn stalk rot virulence and also significant alteration of fumonisn B1 production. The mutation led to more sensitivity to oxidative and cell wall stress agents, and defects in carbon utilization. Gene complementation fully restored the defects in the mutant demonstrating that FvSec4 plays important role in these functions. Taken together, our data indicate that FvSec4 plays important roles in F. verticillioides hyphal development, virulence, mycotoxin production and stresses response. Further study is needed to characterize whether the mutation in FvSec4 leads to altered vesicle trafficking and protein secretion, which ultimately impact F. verticillioides physiology and virulence.",

This process, which is referred to as random integration (RI), requires a double stranded break (DSB) in the genome.

Here we report that non-lethal physiologically relevant doses of ionizing radiation (10-100 mGy), within the range produced by medical imaging equipment, stimulate RI of transfected and viral episomal DNA in human and mouse cells with an extremely high efficiency. Genetic analysis of stimulated RI (S-RI) revealed that it is distinct from the background RI, requires histone H2AX S139 phosphorylation ({gamma}H2AX) and is not reduced by DNA polymerase {theta} (Polq) inactivation. S-RI efficiency was unaffected by the main DSB repair pathway (homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining) disruptions, but double deficiency in MDC1 and 53BP1 phenocopies {gamma}H2AX inactivation. The robust responsiveness of S-RI to physiological amounts of DSBs has implications for radiation risk assessment and can be exploited for extremely sensitive, macroscopic and direct detection of DSB-induced mutations.",

    "abstract": "Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by the Fusarium graminearum species complex, is a serious disease of wheat in Brazil. A review of literature on fungicide efficacy for field trials evaluated in Brazil was conducted to obtain FHB-yield data and explore their relationship. Thirty-seven studies (9 years and 11 locations) met the criteria for inclusion (FHB index [&ge;] 5% and max-min range [&ge;] 4 percent points [p.p.]). Studies were group into two production situations: low (Yl [&le;] 3,631 kg ha-1) or high (Yh > 3,631 kg ha-1) yield, based on the median of maximum yields across trials. Population-average intercepts, but not the slopes, from fitting a random-coefficients model, differed significantly between Yl (2,883.6 kg ha-1) and Yh (4,419.5 kg ha-1). The calculated damage coefficient was 1.05 %-1 and 1.60 %-1 for Yh and Yl, respectively. A crop model simulated attainable wheat yields for 10 planting dates within each year during a 28-year period, including prior (1980-1989) and after (1990-2007) FHB resurgence. Simulated losses using disease predictions to penalize yield were in general agreement in magnitude with literature reports, for both periods. Economic analysis for scenarios of variable fungicide costs and wheat prices, and one versus two sprays of tebuconazole, showed that the probability of not-offsetting the costs was higher (> 0.75) prior to FHB resurgence than after the 1990. Our approach may be useful for designing of longlasting, yet profitable, contingency tactics to management FHB in wheat. Currently one spray of triazole fungicide during flowering is more likely a profitable decision than applying two sprays, for which there is greater uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOne common task in Computational Biology is the prediction of aspects of protein function and structure from their amino acid sequence. For 26 years, most state-of-the-art approaches toward this end have been marrying machine learning and evolutionary information. The retrieval of related proteins from ever growing sequence databases is becoming so time-consuming that the analysis of entire proteomes becomes challenging. On top, evolutionary information is less powerful for small families, e.g. for proteins from the Dark Proteome.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a novel way to represent protein sequences as continuous vectors (embeddings) by using the deep bi-directional model ELMo taken from natural language processing (NLP). The model has effectively captured the biophysical properties of protein sequences from unlabeled big data (UniRef50). After training, this knowledge is transferred to single protein sequences by predicting relevant sequence features. We refer to these new embeddings as SeqVec (Sequence-to-Vector) and demonstrate their effectiveness by training simple convolutional neural networks on existing data sets for two completely different prediction tasks. At the per-residue level, we significantly improved secondary structure (for NetSurfP-2.0 data set: Q3=79%{+/-}1, Q8=68%{+/-}1) and disorder predictions (MCC=0.59{+/-}0.03) over methods not using evolutionary information. At the per-protein level, we predicted subcellular localization in ten classes (for DeepLoc data set: Q10=68%{+/-}1) and distinguished membrane-bound from water-soluble proteins (Q2= 87%{+/-}1). All results built upon the embeddings gained from the new tool SeqVec neither explicitly nor implicitly using evolutionary information. Nevertheless, it improved over some methods using such information. Where the lightning-fast HHblits needed on average about two minutes to generate the evolutionary information for a target protein, SeqVec created the vector representation on average in 0.03 seconds.\\n\\nConclusionWe have shown that transfer learning can be used to capture biochemical or biophysical properties of protein sequences from large unlabeled sequence databases. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was showcased for different prediction tasks using only single protein sequences. SeqVec embeddings enable predictions that outperform even some methods using evolutionary information. Thus, they prove to condense the underlying principles of protein sequences. This might be the first step towards competitive predictions based only on single protein sequences.\\n\\nAvailabilitySeqVec: https://github.com/mheinzinger/SeqVec Prediction server: https://embed.protein.properties",

Current tools for DNA or RNA editing rely on introducing exogenous proteins into living organisms, which is subject to potential risks or technical barriers due to possible aberrant effector activity, delivery limits and immunogenicity. Here, we report a programmable approach that employs a short RNA to leverage endogenous ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA) proteins for targeted RNA editing. We engineered an RNA that is partially complementary to the target transcript to recruit native ADAR1 or ADAR2 to change adenosine to inosine at a specific site. We designated this new method as LEAPER (Leveraging Endogenous ADAR for Programmable Editing on RNA) and the ADAR-recruiting RNA as arRNA. arRNA, either expressed from plasmid or viral vector, or synthesized as an oligonucleotide, could achieve desirable editing. LEAPER has a manageable off-target rate on the targeted transcripts and rare global off-targets. We demonstrated that LEAPER could restore p53 function by repairing a specific cancer-relevant point mutation. Moreover, LEAPER could apply to a broad spectrum of cell types including multiple human primary cells, and it restored the -L-iduronidase catalytic activity in Hurler syndrome patient-derived primary fibroblasts without evoking innate immune responses. As a single molecule system akin to RNAi, LEAPER enables precise and efficient RNA editing, offering the transformative potential for basic research and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Betaine is known to act against various biological stresses and its levels were reported to be decreased in schizophrenia patients. Using Chdh (a gene for betaine synthesis)-deficient mice and betaine-supplemented inbred mice, we assessed the role of betaine in psychiatric pathophysiology, and its potential as a novel psychotherapeutic, by leveraging metabolomics, behavioral-, transcriptomics and DNA methylation analyses. The Chdh-deficient mice revealed remnants of psychiatric behaviors along with schizophrenia-related molecular perturbations. Betaine supplementation elicited genetic background-dependent improvement in cognitive performance, and suppressed methamphetamine (MAP)-induced behavioral sensitization. Furthermore, betaine rectified the altered antioxidative and proinflammatory responses induced by MAP and in vitro phencyclidine treatments. Notably, betaine levels were decreased in the postmortem brains from schizophrenia, and a coexisting elevated carbonyl stress, a form of oxidative stress, demarcated a subset of schizophrenia with \\\"betaine deficit-oxidative stress pathology\\\". We revealed the decrease of betaine levels in glyoxylase 1 (GLO1)-deficient hiPSCs, which shows elevated carbonyl stress, and the efficacy of betaine in alleviating it, thus supporting a causal link between betaine and oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, a CHDH variant, rs35518479, was identified as a cis-expression quantitative trait locus (QTL) for CHDH expression in postmortem brains from schizophrenia, allowing genotype-based stratification of schizophrenia patients for betaine efficacy. In conclusion, the present study underscores the potential benefit of betaine in a subset of schizophrenia.",

We describe a unique method by which spinal cord hiPSC-derived astrocytes (hiPSC-A) are cultured with spinal cord hiPSC-derived motor neurons (hiPSC-MN) in a multielectrode array (MEA) system to record electrophysiological activity over time. We show that hiPSC-A enhance hiPSC-MN electrophysiological maturation in a time-dependent fashion. The sequence of plating, density, and age in which hiPSC-As are co-cultured with MN, but not their respective hiPSC line origin, are factors that influence neuronal electrophysiology. When compared to co-culture with mouse primary spinal cord astrocytes, we observe an earlier and more robust electrophysiological maturation in the fully human cultures, suggesting that the human origin is relevant to the recapitulation of astrocyte/motor neuron cross-talk. Finally, we test pharmacological compounds on our MEA platform and observe changes in electrophysiological activity which confirm hiPSC-MN maturation. These findings are supported by immunocytochemistry and real time PCR studies in parallel cultures demonstrating human astrocyte mediated changes in the structural maturation and protein expression profiles of the neurons. Interestingly, this relationship is reciprocal and co-culture with neurons influences astrocyte maturation as well. Taken together these data indicate that in a human in vitro spinal cord culture system, astrocytes alter hiPSC-MN maturation in a time-dependent and species specific manner and suggest a closer approximation of in vivo conditions.\\n\\nMain PointsO_LIWe developed a method for the co-culture of human iPSC-A/MN for multielectrode array recordings.\\nC_LIO_LIThe morphological, molecular, pharmacological, and electrophysiological characterization of the co-cultures suggests bidirectional maturation.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The ATPase SecA is an essential component of the bacterial Sec machinery, which transports proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Most SecA proteins contain a long C-terminal tail (CTT). In Escherichia coli, the CTT contains a structurally flexible linker domain and a small metal-binding domain (MBD). The MBD coordinates zinc via a conserved cysteine-containing motif and binds to SecB and ribosomes. In this study, we screened a high-density transposon library for mutants that affect the susceptibility of E. coli to sodium azide, which inhibits SecA-mediated translocation. Results from sequencing this library suggested that mutations removing the CTT make E. coli less susceptible to sodium azide at subinhibitory concentrations. Copurification experiments suggested that the MBD binds to iron and that azide disrupts iron binding. Azide also disrupted binding of SecA to membranes. Two other E. coli proteins that contain SecA-like MBDs, YecA and YchJ, also copurified with iron, and NMR spectroscopy experiments indicated that YecA binds iron via its MBD. Competition experiments and equilibrium binding measurements indicated that the SecA MBD binds preferentially to iron and that a conserved serine is required for this specificity. Finally, structural modelling suggested a plausible model for the octahedral coordination of iron. Taken together, our results suggest that SecA-like MBDs likely bind to iron in vivo.",

    "abstract": "A key factor of actin cytoskeleton organization in cells is the interplay between the dynamical properties of actin filaments and cell geometry, which restricts, confines and directs their orientation. Crosslinking interactions among actin filaments, together with geometrical cues and regulatory proteins can give rise to contractile rings in dividing cells and actin rings in neurons. Motivated by recent in vitro experiments, in this work we performed computer simulations to study basic aspects of the interplay between confinement and attractive interactions between actin filaments. We used a spring-bead model and Brownian dynamics to simulate semiflexible actin filaments that polymerize in a confining sphere with a rate proportional to the monomer concentration. We model crosslinking, or attraction through the depletion interaction, implicitly as an attractive short-range potential between filament beads. In confining geometries smaller than the persistence length of actin filaments, we show rings can form by curving of filaments of length comparable to, or longer than the confinement diameter. Rings form for optimal ranges of attractive interactions that exist in between open bundles, irregular loops, aggregated and unbundled morphologies. The probability of ring formation is promoted by attraction to the confining sphere boundary and decreases for large radii and initial monomer concentrations, in agreement with prior experimental data. The model reproduces ring formation along the flat axis of oblate ellipsoids.",

    "abstract": "In light of climate change, the ability to predict evolutionary responses to temperature changes is of central importance for conservation efforts. Prior work has focused on exposing model organisms to different temperatures for just one or a few generations under laboratory conditions. Using a  natural experiment, we show that studying parallel evolution in wild populations from contrasting thermal environments presents a more powerful approach for understanding and predicting responses to climate change. More specifically, we used a unique study system in Iceland, where freshwater populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are found in waters warmed by geothermal activity, adjacent to populations in ambient-temperature water. We used three sympatric and three allopatric warm-cold population pairs to test for repeated patterns of morphological divergence in relation to thermal habitat. We found that thermal habitat explained over 50% of body shape variation: fish from warm habitats had a deeper mid-body, a shorter jaw, and smaller eyes. Our common garden experiment showed that most of these morphological differences between thermal habitats were heritable. Lastly, absence of gene flow seems to facilitate parallel divergence across thermal habitats: all three allopatric population pairs were on a common evolutionary trajectory, whereas sympatric pairs followed different trajectories. Our findings therefore suggest that morphological responses to rising temperatures can be predictable when there is limited gene flow. On the other hand, migration of individuals between different thermal habitats or microhabitats can exaggerate nonparallel evolution and reduce our ability to predict evolutionary responses.",

To further examine specific genetic factors driving this correlation, we present genomic analyses of the genetic overlap between intelligence and BV using genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. First, we conducted the largest BV GWAS meta-analysis to date (N=54,407 individuals), followed by functional annotation and gene-mapping. We identified 35 genomic loci (27 novel), implicating 362 genes (346 novel) and 23 biological pathways for BV. Second, we used an existing GWAS for intelligence (N=269,867 individuals2), and estimated the genetic correlation (rg) between BV and intelligence to be 0.23. We show that the rg is driven by physical overlap of GWAS hits in 5 genomic loci. We identified 67 shared genes between BV and intelligence, which are mainly involved in important signaling pathways regulating cell growth. Out of these 67 we prioritized 32 that are most likely to have functional impact. These results provide new information on the genetics of BV and provide biological insight into BVs shared genetic etiology with intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The mRNA of some, but not all, nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins localize to the periphery of mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that both the nascent polypeptide chain and an mRNA binding protein play a role in this phenomenon, and have noted a positive correlation between mRNA length and mitochondrial localization. Here, we report the first investigation into the relationship between mRNA translation initiation rate and mRNA mitochondrial localization. Our results indicate that translation initiation promoting factors such as Kozak sequences are associated with cytosolic localization, while inhibiting factors such as 5' UTR secondary structure correlate with mitochondrial localization. Moreover, the frequencies of nucleotides in various positions of the 5' UTR show higher correlation with localization than the 3' UTR. These results indicate that mitochondrial localization is associated with slow translation initiation. Interestingly this may help explain why short mRNAs, which are thought to initiate translation rapidly, seldom localize to mitochondria. We propose a model in which translating mRNA has reduced mobility and tends not to reach mitochondria. Finally, we explore this model with a simulation of mRNA diffusion using previously estimated translation initiation probabilities, confirming that our model can produce localization values similar to those measured in experimental studies.",

Tau is a client of Hsp90, though it is unclear whether and how the chaperone massages the structure of intrinsically disordered Tau. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we extract structural information from the very broad conformational ensemble of Tau: Tau in solution is highly dynamic and polymorphic, though  paper-clip-shaped by long-range contacts. Interaction with Hsp90 promotes an open Tau conformation, which we identify as the molecular basis for the formation of small Tau oligomers by exposure of the aggregation-prone repeat domain to other Tau molecules. At the same time, formation of Tau fibrils is inhibited. We therefore provide the nanometer-scale zoom into chaperoning an amyloid client, highlighting formation of oligomers as the consequence of this biologically relevant interaction.",

Although it can be intuitively imagined that bacteria will eventually develop resistance to this class of drugs as well, the concern has largely been ignored. Drawing upon the experimental data from the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to antimicrobial peptides, we theoretically model the membrane adaptation under drug pressure. Using our model, we simulate the serial passage experiments with and without the drug pressure, and use the comparisons with experiments to estimate the unknown kinetic parameters. While the development of resistance to enzyme or membrane targeting drugs are both driven by spontaneous mutations, an additional lysylation step required in the latter slows the development of resistance. By quantifying the tradeoff between the gain in fitness under drug pressure and a loss in growth due to membrane modification, our model shows a fast reversal of membrane composition in drug free conditions, re-sensitizing the bacterium to the drugs.",

    "abstract": "Tropical savannas are biomes of global importance that are under severe pressure from anthropogenic change, including land-cover and land-use change. Bats, the second-most diverse group of mammals, are critical to ecosystem functioning, but may be vulnerable to such anthropogenic stresses. However, there is little information on the response of savanna bats to land-cover and land-use change, especially in Africa. This limits our ability to develop conservation strategies for bats and maintain the ecosystem functions and services they provide in this biome. Using acoustic monitoring, we measured how guild-specific (aerial, edge, and clutter forager) bat activity responded to both fine-scale metrics of vegetation structure and landscape-scale metrics of land-cover composition and configuration across the wet and dry seasons in a savanna in southern Africa undergoing rapid land-cover and land-use change. We found that all three guilds responded more strongly to landscape metrics than fine-scale vegetation structure, although the specific metrics varied between guilds. Aerial and edge bats responded most strongly to the percent savanna cover and savanna fragmentation in both seasons while clutter bats responded to percent rural cover in the wet season and percent water cover in the dry. All three guilds responded more strongly to the landscape in the dry season than the wet season. Our results show it is possible to conserve bats, and the ecosystem services they can provide, in savannas undergoing anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change but strategies to do so must consider foraging guild, large spatial scales, and seasonal variation in bat activity.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIBats in savannas respond to land-cover and land-use change on large spatial scales\\nC_LIO_LILandscape had a greater influence on bat activity in the dry season than the wet\\nC_LIO_LIAerial and edge forager activity responded to savanna cover and fragmentation\\nC_LIO_LIClutter forager activity was best explained by rural and water cover\\nC_LIO_LIMinimizing fragmentation and maintaining water promotes bat activity in modified savannas\\nC_LI",

Morphometric analysis identified 4 different cell shapes. Live imaging revealed that macrophages successively adopt all four shapes as they migrate through ECM. Treatment with inhibitors of MMPs or Rac GTPase to abolish mesenchymal migration, suppresses both ECM degradation and HSPC mobilisation while differently affecting macrophage behaviour. This study depicts real time macrophage behaviour in a physiological context and reveals extreme reactivity of these cells constantly adapting and switching migratory shapes to achieve HSPCs proper mobilisation.",

    "abstract": "To investigate how unpredictable threat during goal pursuit impacts fronto-limbic activity and functional connectivity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we compared military veterans with PTSD (n=25) versus trauma-exposed Control (n=25). Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while engaged in a computerized chase-and-capture game task that involved optimizing monetary rewards obtained from capturing virtual prey while simultaneously avoiding capture by virtual predators. The game was played under two alternating contexts - one involving exposure to unpredictable, task-irrelevant threat by randomly occurring electrical shocks, and a nonthreat control condition. Activation in and functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was tested across threat and nonthreat task contexts with generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses. PTSD patients reported higher anxiety than controls across contexts. Better task performance represented by successfully avoiding capture by predators under threat than nonthreat contexts was associated with stronger left amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity in controls and greater vmPFC activation in PTSD patients. PTSD symptom severity was negatively correlated with vmPFC activation in trauma-exposed controls and with right amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity across all participants in the threat relative to nonthreat contexts. The findings showed that veterans with PTSD have disrupted amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity and greater localized vmPFC processing under threat-modulation of goal-directed behavior, specifically related to successful task performance while avoiding loss of monetary rewards. In contrast, trauma survivors without PTSD rely on stronger threat-modulated left amygdala-vmPFC functional connectivity during goal-directed behavior, which may represent a resilience-related functional adaptation.",

However, many of these particles are smaller than 200 nm in diameter, which places them at the limit of detection for many commercial flow cytometers. The use of reference particles of diameter, fluorescence, and light-scattering properties akin to those of the small biological particles being studied is therefore imperative for accurate and reproducible data acquisition and reporting across different instruments and analytical technologies. We show here that an engineered murine leukemia virus (MLV) can act as a fluorescence reference particle for other small particles such as retroviruses and EVs. More specifically, we show that engineered MLV is a highly monodisperse enveloped particle that can act as a surrogate to demonstrate the various effects of antibody labeling on the physical properties of small biological particles in a similar diameter range.",

In this study, we take a first step towards elucidating biomechanical photoageing effects by quantifying how exposure to different UV ranges and dosages impacts the mechanical and structural properties of human stratum corneum (SC), the most superficial skin layer. Mechanical testing reveals that irradiation of isolated human SC to UVA (365 nm), UVB (302 nm), or UVC (265 nm) light with dosages of up to 4000 J/cm2 notably alters the elastic modulus, fracture stress, fracture strain, and work of fracture. For equivalent incident dosages, UVC degrades SC the greatest. However, upon discounting reflected and transmitted components of the incident light, a generalized scaling law relating the photonic energy absorbed by the SC to the energy cost of tissue fracture emerges. This relationship indicates that no one UV range is more damaging than another. Rather, the magnitude of absorbed UV energy governs the degradation of tissue mechanical integrity. Subsequent structural studies are performed to elucidate the cause of this mechanical degradation. UV absorption scales with the spatial dispersion of desmoglein 1 (Dsg 1), a component of corneocyte cell-cell junctions, away from intercellular sites. Combining both scaling laws, we establish a mechanical-structural model capable of predicting UV induced tissue mechanical integrity from Dsg 1 dispersion.\\n\\nStatement of SignificancePhotoageing from the sun can produce early onset of skin wrinkles and an increase in tissue fragility that heightens the risk of rupture. While solar ultraviolet (UV) light is considered to have the most damaging effect, the UV range that is most harmful remains a topic of significant debate. In this study, we elucidate photoageing effects by quantifying how exposure to different UV ranges and dosages impacts the mechanical and structural properties of human stratum corneum (SC), the most superficial skin layer. Results establish a mechanical-structural model that relates the amount of UV energy absorbed by the tissue, irrespective of UV range, to the energy cost of tissue fracture and spatial dispersion of desmoglein 1.",

    "abstract": "Tip-link as force-sensor in the hearing conveys the mechanical force originating from sound to ion-channels while maintaining the integrity of the entire sensory assembly in inner-ear. This delicate balance between structure and function of tip-links is regulated by Ca2+-ions present in endolymph. Mutations at the Ca2+-binding sites of tip-links often lead to congenital deafness, sometimes syndromic defects impairing vision along with hearing. Although such mutations are already identified, it is still not clear how the mutants alter the structure-function properties of the force-sensors associated with diseases. With an aim to decipher the differences in force-conveying properties of the force-sensors in molecular details, we identified the conformational variability of mutant and wild-type tip-links at the single-molecule level using FRET at the endolymphatic Ca2+ concentrations and subsequently measured the force-responsive behavior using single-molecule force spectroscopy with an AFM. AFM allowed us to mimic the high and wide range of force ramps (103 - 106 pN.s-1) as experienced in the inner ear. We performed in silico network analyses to learn that alterations in the conformations of the mutants interrupt the natural force-propagation paths through the sensors and make the mutant tip-links vulnerable to input forces from sound stimuli. We also demonstrated that a Ca2+ rich environment can restore the force-response of the mutant tip-links which may eventually facilitate the designing of better therapeutic strategies to the hearing loss.\\n\\nSignificance StatementForce-sensors in inner ear are the key components in the hearing. Mutations in force-sensors often lead to congenital hearing loss. Loss of hearing has become a threat to humanity, with over 5% of world population suffering from deafness and 40% of which is congenital, primarily due to mutations in the sensory machinery in inner-ear. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of the underlined hearing loss due to mutations is, therefore, necessary for better therapeutics to deaf. Here with a zoomed region of the force-sensors, we pointed out the differences in the force-propagation properties of the mutant and wild-type force-sensors. Our observation on restoring of functions of mutants in Ca2+-rich buffer indicates methods of developing low-cost therapeutic strategies against deafness.",

    "abstract": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr) encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway is a candidate gene for essential hypertension (EH). However, the regulation of Hmgcr in rat models of hypertension (viz. Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats [SHR] and its normotensive control Wistar/Kyoto [WKY] strain) is unknown. Here, we show that Hmgcr transcript and protein levels are diminished in liver tissues of SHR as compared to WKY. Consistently, a number of other rat models of hypertension display diminished cholesterol levels as compared to corresponding control strains. Sequencing of the Hmgcr promoter in SHR/WKY reveals three variations: A-405G, C-62T and a 11 bp insertion (-393_-382insTGCGGTCCTCC) in SHR. Moreover, SHR-Hmgcr promoter displays higher activity than WKY-Hmgcr promoter in various cell lines. Transient transfections of Hmgcr-promoter mutants and in silico analysis suggest altered binding of Runx3 and Srebf1 across A-405G and -393_-382insTGCGGTCCTCC sites. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirm differential binding of Runx3/Srebf1 to Hmgcr promoter leading to diminished expression of Hmgcr in SHR as compared to WKY under basal/cholesterol-modulated conditions. Taken together, this study provides mechanistic insights for the altered Hmgcr expression in these models of EH, thereby unravelling the links of this gene to hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease states.",

    "abstract": "Actin has been shown to be essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast. However, actin polymerization alone is likely insufficient to produce enough force to deform the membrane against the huge turgor pressure of yeast cells. In this paper, we used Brownian dynamics simulations to demonstrate that crosslinking of a meshwork of non-polymerizing actin filaments is able to produce compressive forces. We show that the force can be up to thousands of piconewtons if the crosslinker has a high stiffness. The force decays over time as a result of crosslinker turnover, and is a result of converting chemical binding energy into elastic energy.",

    "abstract": "Generating cell polarity in anticipation of asymmetric cell division is required in many developmental contexts across a diverse range of species. Physical and genetic diversity among major multicellular taxa, however, demand different molecular solutions to this problem. The Arabidopsis stomatal lineage displays asymmetric, stem cell-like and oriented cell divisions, which require the activity of the polarly localized protein, BASL. Here we identify the plant-specific BREVIS RADIX (BRX) family as localization and activity partners of BASL. We show that members of the BRX family are polarly localized to peripheral domains in stomatal lineage cells and that their collective activity is required for asymmetric cell divisions. We further demonstrate a mechanism for these behaviors by uncovering mutual, yet unequal dependencies of BASL and the BRX family for each others localization and segregation at the periphery of stomatal lineage cells.",

    "abstract": "The normal development of neuronal circuits requires both hard-wired gene expression and experience. Sensory processing, such as vision, is especially sensitive to perturbations in experience. However, the exact contribution of experience to neuronal visual response properties and binocular vision remains unknown. To determine how visual response properties develop in vivo, we used single cell resolution two-photon calcium imaging of mouse binocular visual cortex at multiple time-points after eye opening. Few neurons are binocularly responsive immediately after eye opening and respond solely to either the contralateral or ipsilateral eye. Binocular neurons emerge during development, which requires visual experience, and show specific tuning of visual response properties. As binocular neurons emerge, activity between the two eyes becomes more correlated in the neuropil. Since experience-dependent plasticity requires the expression of activity-dependent genes, we determined whether the plasticity gene Arc mediates the development of normal visual response properties. Surprisingly, rather than mirroring the effects of visual deprivation, mice that lack Arc show increased numbers of binocular neurons during development. Strikingly, removing Arc in adult binocular visual cortex increases the numbers of binocular neurons and recapitulates the developmental phenotype, suggesting cortical circuits that mediate visual processing require ongoing experience-dependent plasticity. Thus, experience is critical for the normal development and maintenance of circuits required to process binocular vision.",
