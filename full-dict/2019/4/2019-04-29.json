    "abstract": "The nautiloid lineage extends back nearly 500 million years but today, is represented by only two living genera, Nautilus and Allonautilus. Behavioral observations of these living nautiluses have improved our understanding of how nautiloids, and ammonoids, behaved and interacted in their environment. These behaviors may also help to inform conservation practices. Here, we describe feeding and mating behaviors in wild nautiluses not reported from any other population. In Palau, Nautilus belauensis was observed actively preying on a large, living crab (Chaceon sp.) and performing courtship-like behaviors prior to mating. These behaviors occurred across multiple nights and from different nautiluses, suggesting that the behaviors are characteristic of at least a subset of the population, if not the entire population. Perhaps the behaviors exhibited by the Palauan nautiluses are an outlier and simply a localized characteristic of a far-removed population. Or, perhaps these apparent abnormal behaviors of Palauan nautiluses are what all nautiluses across the Indo-Pacific should be exhibiting. If the latter explanation is correct, we can start to address the potential causes of the behavioral differences, such as population size, habitat type, and prey availability. In either case, this apparent behavioral plasticity may have also been a reason that the nautiloid lineage has been able to survive throughout millions of years of environmental changes. Today, these behavioral observations could prove to be a valuable conservation tool to protect species and environments, especially in the deep-sea ecosystem the nautiluses inhabit.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) non-disclosure by adult patients to all household members is a setback to TB control efforts. It reduces the likelihood that household contacts will seek early TB screening, initiation on preventive or curative treatment, but also hinders the implementation of infection controls and home-based directly observed treatment. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the level of TB non-disclosure, its predictors and effects of disclosure to household members on adult patients at a large regional referral hospital in south-western Uganda.\\n\\nMethodsCross-sectional study. Questionnaires administered to collect patients sociodemographic and their TB disclosure data. Non-disclosure was considered if a patient did not reveal their TB diagnosis to all household members within 2 weeks post-treatment initiation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were fitted for predictors of non-disclosure.\\n\\nResultsEnrolled 62 patients, 74% males, mean age of 32 years, and median of five people per household. Non-disclosure rate was 30.6%. Post-disclosure experiences were positive in 98.3% of patients, while negative experiences suggestive of severe stigma occurred in 24.6% of patients. Being female (OR 6.5, 95% CI: 1.42-29.28) and belonging to Muslim faith (OR 12.4, 95% CI: 1.42-109.05) predicted TB non-disclosure to household members.\\n\\nConclusionsThere is a high rate of TB non-disclosure to household members by adult patients in rural Uganda, with the highest vulnerability seen among female and Muslim patients. Interventions enhancing TB disclosure at household level while minimizing negative effects of stigma should be developed and prioritized.",

    "abstract": "Imaging dense and diverse microbial communities has broad applications in basic microbiology and medicine, but remains a grand challenge due to the fact that many species adopt similar morphologies. While prior studies have relied on techniques involving spectral labeling, we have developed an expansion microscopy method (ExM) in which cells are physically expanded prior imaging and their expansion patterns depend on the structural and mechanical properties of their cell walls, which vary across species and conditions. We use this phenomenon as a quantitative and sensitive phenotypic imaging contrast orthogonal to spectral separation in order to resolve bacterial cells of different species or in distinct physiological states. Focusing on host-microbe interactions that are difficult to quantify through fluorescence alone, we demonstrate the ability of ExM to distinguish species within a dense community through in vivo imaging of a model gut microbiota, and to sensitively detect cell-envelope damage caused by antibiotics or previously unrecognized cell-to-cell phenotypic heterogeneity among pathogenic bacteria as they infect macrophages.",

    "abstract": "In oncological drug development, animal studies continue to play a central role in which the volume of subcutaneous tumours is monitored to assess the efficacy of new drugs. Tumour volume is currently estimated by measuring length and width with callipers and then estimating the volume of the tumour as if it were a regular spheroid. However, this method is subjective, insufficiently traceable, and is subject to error in the accuracy of volume estimates as tumours frequently are irregular.\\n\\nThis paper explores the extent of inconsistencies in calliper measurements by conducting a statistical review of a large dataset consisting of 2,500 tumour volume measurements from 1,600 mice by multiple operators across 6 mouse strains and 20 tumour models. We also explore the impact of six different tumour morphologies on volume estimation and the detection of treatment effects using a computational tumour growth model. Finally, we propose an alternative method to callipers for estimating volume - BioVolume, a 3D scanning technique. BioVolume simultaneously captures both stereo RGB (Red, Green and Blue) images from different light sources and infrared thermal images of the tumour. It detects the tumour region automatically and estimates the tumour volume in under a second. BioVolume has been tested on a dataset of 297 scans from over 120 mice collected by four different operators.\\n\\nThis work demonstrates that it is possible to record tumour measurements in a rapid, minimally invasive, morphology-independent way, and with less human-bias compared to callipers, whilst also improving data traceability. Furthermore, the images collected by BioVolume may be useful, for example, as a source of biomarkers for animal welfare and secondary drug toxicity / efficacy.",

In this study, we investigated the role of TAOK3 in the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel treatment. Protein expression of TAOK3 was evaluated among 121 patients by using immunohistochemical staining. TAOK3 expression was estimated by analyzing the genes expression and its correlation with the IC50 of paclitaxel in cells. The expression of TAOK3 in lung cancer was highly correlated with poor overall survival, progression-free survival, and recurrence rate in lung cancer patients. The expression level of TAOK3 was positively correlated with paclitaxel resistance in the lung cancer cell lines. The depletion of TAOK3 could enhance the sensitivity of paclitaxel in lung cancer and vice versa. TAOK3 expression is associated with paclitaxel-resistance and could be a clinical predictor for disease recurrence and a potential therapeutic target in lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Cells, including unicellulars, are highly sensitive to external constraints from their environment. Amoeboid cells change their cell shape during locomotion and in response to external stimuli. Physarum polycephalum is a large multinucleated amoeboid cell that extends and develops pseudopods. In this paper, changes in cell behavior and shape were measured during the exploration of homogenous and non-homogenous environments that presented neutral, and nutritive and/or adverse substances. In the first place, we developed a fully automated image analysis method to measure quantitatively changes in both migration and shape. Then we measured various metrics that describe the area covered, the exploration dynamics, the migration rate and the slime mold shape. Our results show that: 1) Not only the nature, but also the spatial distribution of chemical substances affect the exploration behavior of slime molds; 2) Nutritive and adverse substances both slow down the exploration and prevent the formation of pseudopods; and 3) Slime mold placed in an adverse environment preferentially occupies previously explored areas rather than unexplored areas using mucus secretion as a buffer. Our results also show that slime molds migrate at a rate governed by the substrate up until they get within a critical distance to chemical substances.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPhysarum polycephalum, also called slime mold, is a giant single-celled organism that can grow to cover several square meters, forming search fronts that are connected to a system of intersecting veins. An original experimental protocol allowed tracking the shape of slime mold placed in homogenous substrates containing an attractant (glucose) or a repellent (salt), or inhomogeneous substrates that contained an attractive spot (glucose), an eccentric slime mold and a repulsive spot (salt) in between. For the first time, the rate of exploration of unexplored areas (primary growth) and the rate of extension in previously explored areas (secondary growth) were rigorously measured, by means of a sophisticated image analysis program. This paper shows that the chemical composition of the substrate has more influence on the morphology and growth dynamics of slime mold than that of concentrated spots of chemicals. It was also found that on a repulsive substrate, slime mold exhibits a bias towards secondary growth, which suggests that the mucus produced during slime mold migration acts as a protective shell in adverse environments.",

To clarify the persistence of immunity against measles in young adult, this study explored the prevalence of IgG antibody titer against measles virus in 18-to 24-year-old young adult participants. Measles-specific IgG antibody titers determined by enzyme immunoassay in serum samples collected from 506 participants between 18 to 24 years were assessed through statistical analyses. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the distribution of measles IgG antibody titers was significantly correlated with medical history (P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference among the number of vaccinations related to measles IgG titers. Further, measles IgG titers were significantly different, which was determined by the temporal change that elapsed period after last vaccination (P < 0.05). These results indicate that periodic vaccination against measles is required for young and older adults to prevent even sporadic measles infection.",

    "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA)-mediated immunity plays important roles in combating virus in plants. Two plant stress associated protein (SAPs) containing dual A20/AN1 zinc-finger domain were found to play important roles in SA-mediated immunity; however, detailed mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, another orchid homolog gene of Pha13, Pha21, was analyzed. Pha21 confers antiviral immunity in both transgenic orchid and Arabidopsis overexpressing Pha21. Expression of Pha21 is early-induced by SA treatment, and is involved in the expression of the orchid homolog of the master regulator NPR1. Pha21 but not Pha13 is involved in the expression of key RNAi-related genes, Dicer-like nuclease 4 (DCL4) and Argonaut 1 (AGO1) in orchids. The involvement of SAPs in expression of orchid DCL4 and AGO1 is not limited to orchid, as AtSAP5 also plays essential role in the expression of Arabidopsis DCL4 and AGO1. However, unlike Pha13 and AtSAP5, Pha21 does not play positive role in the expression of orchid homolog gene of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 (RdR1), an important gene in RNAi pathway. Pha21 can be found localized in the nucleus, and confers self-E3 ligase and ubiquitin binding activities. Functional domain analysis revealed that both A20 and AN1 domains of Pha21 are required for decreasing virus accumulation, and the AN1 domain plays a more important role in the expression of orchid DCL4. Collectively, our data suggests SA regulated SAPs play important roles in antiviral immunity and is involved in delicate regulation of key genes in RNAi-mediated pathway.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESalicylic acid (SA)-mediated antiviral immunity plays an important role to protect plants from virus infection; however, the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. We previously demonstrated that two plant A20/AN1 proteins, orchid Pha13 and Arabidopsis AtSAP5, function similarly and serve as an important hub to regulate SA-mediated antiviral immunity. In this study, we identified another orchid A20/AN1 protein, Pha21, which is involved in SA-mediated antiviral immunity. In contrast to Pha13 and AtSAP5, Pha21 plays minor negative roles in the expression of PhaRdR1 (orchid homolog of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1). However, Pha21 and AtSAP5, but not Pha13, are involved in the expression of important players in RNAi pathway, Dicer-like nuclease 4 (DCL4) and Argonaut 1 (AGO1), in orchid and Arabidopsis. Our data demonstrates that plant A20/AN1 proteins are conserved players in SA-mediated antiviral resistance among plants, and provide links between the A20/AN1 proteins and the RNAi pathway.",

    "abstract": "CD71+ erythroid cells (CECs) have a wide range of immunomodulatory properties but their potential role in HIV has never been investigated before. Here, we demonstrate that CECs are abundant in the human cord blood, placental tissue and peripheral blood of pregnant mothers. We found that CECs exacerbate HIV-1 infection/replication when co-cultured with CD4+ T cells; and that pre-exposure of CD4+ T cells to CECs make them more permissible to HIV-infection. Our observations indicate how interactions of CECs with CD4+ T cells via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism results in the upregulation of NF-kB, which affects the cell cycle machinery to facilitate HIV-1 replication. We found the complement receptor-1 (CD35) and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) as potential HIV-target molecules are expressed significantly higher on CECs compared to mature red blood cells. However, blocking CD35 or DARC did not inhibit HIV-1 trans-infection to uninfected CD4+ T cells. We demonstrate that CECs bind to HIV-1 via CD235a and subsequently trans-infect the virus to uninfected CD4+ T cells. In addition, we found significant abundance of CECs in the blood of HIV-1 infected and anemic subjects, which enhanced HIV infection/replication in autologous CD4+ T cells similar to what we observed for the cord blood and placenta-derived CECs. In agreement, a positive correlation between the frequency of CECs with the plasma viral load in HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy naive individuals was observed. In addition, we found that CECs even in the presence of Tenofovir, can trans-infect HIV-1 to CD4+ T cells. Our studies provide a novel insight into the role of CECs in HIV pathogenesis as potential contributing cells for viral persistence in the presence of antiretroviral therapy.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDespite current antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1 persists in a small pool of infected cells. A better understanding of HIV-reservoirs and influence of other non-immune cells on HIV-1 replication and transmission is a pre-requisite to the development of HIV-eradication strategies. Immature red blood cells (CD71+ erythroid cells) are physiologically abundant in newborns, cord blood, placenta and blood of pregnant women, with a wide range of immunological properties. This study demonstrates that these cells not only enhance HIV-1 infection/replication by reactive oxygen species in HIV-target cells (CD4+ T cells) but also bind to HIV and trans-infect the virus to the target cells in the presence of Tenofovir, an HIV drug.\\n\\nWe found that these immature red blood cells are abundant in the blood of HIV-patients and anemic individuals. In addition, we observed a positive correlation between the levels of plasma viral load with the frequency of immature red blood cells in HIV-infected individuals. Therefore, our studies discover a novel role for these immature red blood in HIV pathogenesis, which encourages efforts to target these cells as adjuncts of current treatment strategies.",

About 300000 patients including children under 5 years old died from this disease every year. Even intravenous artesunate (Art) is employed as the most effictive drug in the treatment of CM, high incidence of death and neurological sequelae are still inevitable. Therefore, we assessed the combination of Art and tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), to treat experimental CM (ECM) in C57BL/6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). A non-biased whole brain quantitative proteomic analysis was also conducted to get some insight of the mechanism of the combinational treatment.\\n\\nResultsTreatment of (ECM)-C57BL/6 mice with the combination of Art and TMP increased the survival, improved clinical signs and prevented neurological manifestations. These effects were related to reduction of parasitised red blood cells (pRBC) adhesion, sequestration, maintaining brain microvascular integrity, increasing nerve growth factor, neurotrophin levels, and alleviating hippocampal neuronal damage and astrocyte activation. The pharmacological effects of Art-TMP combination therapy were analyzed by ECM mice brain proteomic function enrichment. Based on an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) fold-change of 1.2 (P-value < 0.05), 217 down-regulated and 177 up-regulated proteins were identified, presenting a significantly altered proteome profile of the combined Art and TMP group as compared to the group treated with Art or TMP alone. These results suggested that the Art-TMP combination could be used as a powerful solution for CM and its neurologic damage.\\n\\nConclusionsAn effictive therapy for CM with low mortality rate and protect against ECM-induced neurocognitive impairment has been proposed through the combination of Art and TMP, which can provide an effective adjuvant treatment in the clinic. iTRAQ proteomics provide a resource for further mechanistic studies to examine the synergistic effects of Art and TMP and their potential to serve as an adjunctive treatment method and intervention targets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCerebral malaria (CM) is the most serious neurological complication caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection. Even after antimalarial treatment, severe neurological sequelae still exist. We used tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), the main ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine Chuanxiong, and artesunate (Art) as a combination of drugs. We found that Art-TMP combination could improve the clinical symptoms of CM and protect the nervous system. At the same time, proteomics was used to analyze the protective mechanism of Art-TMP combination administration on ECM mice. This study suggests that the combination of Art and TMP may be used as an adjuvant therapy for clinical CM and iTRAQ proteomics provides resources for further study of Art-TMP combination and provides potential prognostic biomarkers for this therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Animals must often decide between exploiting safe options or risky options with a chance for large gains. While traditional optimal foraging theories assume rational energy maximisation, they fail to fully describe animal behaviour. A logarithmic rather than linear perception of stimuli may shape preference, causing animals to make suboptimal choices. Budget-based rules have also been used to explain risk-preference, and the relative importance of these theories is debated. Eusocial insects represent a special case of risk sensitivity, as they must often make collective decisions based on resource evaluations from many individuals. Previously, colonies of the ant Lasius niger were found to be risk-neutral, but the risk preference of individual foragers was unknown. Here, we tested individual L. niger in a risk sensitivity paradigm. Ants were trained to associate a scent with 0.55M sucrose solution and another scent with an equal chance of either 0.1 and 1.0M sucrose. Preference was tested in a Y-maze. Ants were extremely risk averse, with 91% choosing the safe option. Even when the risky option offered on average more sucrose (0.8M) than the fixed option, 75% preferred the latter. Based on the psychophysical Weber-Fechner law, we predicted that logarithmically balanced alternatives (0.3M vs 0.1M/0.9M) would be perceived as having equal value. Our prediction was supported, with ants having no preference for either feeder (53% chose the fixed option). Our results thus strongly support perceptual mechanisms driving risk-aversion in ants, and demonstrate that the behaviour of individual foragers can be a very poor predictor of colony-level behaviour.",

As a consequence, phage fitness depends intimately on the physiological state, i.e. growth rate, of the host. We include this dependence of critical phage traits on host growth rate in a mathematical model of a bacteria-phage interaction. This leads to a feedback loop between phage success, host population size, nutrient availability and host growth rate. We find that this feedback allows slow growing bacteria to have a competitive advantage in the presence of phage. Under certain conditions a slow growing host mutant can even drive the phage to extinction. Since in a phage-free environment slow growth is deleterious, the mutant subsequentely dies out as well, constituting a kind of altruistic scenario similar to abortive infections.",

    "abstract": "In developing countries, the sweetpotato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. (2n = 6x = 90), is an important autopolyploid species, both socially and economically. However, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping has remained limited due to its genetic complexity. Current fixed-effect models can only fit a single QTL and are generally hard to interpret. Here we report the use of a random-effect model approach to map multiple QTL based on score statistics in a sweetpotato bi-parental population ( Beauregard x  Tanzania) with 315 full-sibs. Phenotypic data were collected for eight yield component traits in six environments in Peru, and jointly predicted means were obtained using mixed-effect models. An integrated linkage map consisting of 30,684 markers distributed along 15 linkage groups (LGs) was used to obtain the genotype conditional probabilities of putative QTL at every cM position. Multiple interval mapping was performed using our R package QTLPOLY and detected a total of 41 QTL, ranging from one to ten QTL per trait. Some regions, such as those on LGs 3 and 15, were consistently detected among root number and yield traits and provided basis for candidate gene search. In addition, some QTL were found to affect commercial and noncommercial root traits distinctly. Further best linear unbiased predictions allowed us to characterize additive allele effects as well as to compute QTL-based breeding values for selection. Together with quantitative genotyping and its appropriate usage in linkage analyses, this QTL mapping methodology will facilitate the use of genomic tools in sweetpotato breeding as well as in other autopolyploids.",

    "abstract": "Impatiens downy mildew is a highly destructive disease of Impatiens walleriana, and economically important bedding ornamental crop. This disease is caused by a recently emerged pathogen Plasmopara obducens. Since both the host and pathogen are relatively less studied, there are only a few genomic resources available for both I. walleriana and P. obducens. In this study, we have analyzed transcriptional changes in I. walleriana in response to P. obducens infection during different stages of disease development. Our main goal was to identify candidate genes that may be involved in I. walleriana susceptibility to P. obducens. Since the genome of I. walleriana is not available publicly, we constructed and optimized a de novo transcriptome assembly consisting of 73,022 transcripts. Differential expression analysis based on this optimized de novo transcriptome assembly revealed 3,000 to 4,500 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) at 0 hr, 12 hr, 48 hr, 120 hr, and 240 hr time points after infection. Functional annotation of these DETs revealed that numerous plant stress responsive genes are activated and deactivated throughout the infection cycle. Genes in the calcium signaling pathways, receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including 10 disease resistance associated RLK transcripts, powdery mildew resistance genes (MLO), and many other plant stress related genes were predominantly differentially expressed in I. walleriana in response to P. obducens. Analyses reported here provides molecular insights into the disease susceptibility mechanism of the Impatiens downy mildew, and lays out a strong foundation for future studies aimed at improving downy mildew resistance in I. walleriana.",

A useful description of the TRN would decompose the transcriptome into targeted effects of individual transcriptional regulators. Here, we applied unsupervised learning to a compendium of high-quality Escherichia coli RNA-seq datasets to identify 70 statistically independent signals that modulate the expression of specific gene sets. We show that 50 of these transcriptomic signals represent the effects of currently characterized transcriptional regulators. Condition-specific activation of signals was validated by exposure of E. coli to new environmental conditions. The resulting decomposition of the transcriptome provided: (1) a mechanistic, systems-level, network-based explanation of responses to environmental and genetic perturbations, (2) a guide to gene and regulator function discovery, and (3) a basis for characterizing transcriptomic differences in multiple strains. Taken together, our results show that signal summation forms an underlying principle that describes the composition of a model prokaryotic transcriptome.",

This method exploits statistics derived from multiple samples in a dataset to reduce the under-clustering problem. Using a synthetic dataset from mouse gut microbiomes we show that this method has the potential to cluster almost all of the reads from genomes with sufficient sequencing coverage.

AVPC tumors may also express neuroendocrine markers, termed neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Recent evidence suggests kinase signaling may be an important driver of NEPC. To identify targetable kinases in NEPC, we performed global phosphoproteomics comparing AR-negative to AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines and identified multiple altered signaling pathways, including enrichment of RET kinase activity in the AR-negative cell lines. Clinical NEPC and NEPC patient derived xenografts displayed upregulated RET transcript and RET pathway activity. Pharmacologically inhibiting RET kinase in NEPC models dramatically reduced tumor growth and cell viability in mouse and human NEPC models. Our results suggest that targeting RET in NEPC tumors with high RET expression and may be a novel treatment option.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceThere are limited treatment options for patients with metastatic aggressive variant prostate cancer and none are curative.

Little is known about which components of immune pathways are responsible for this variation, but understanding these underlying processes could allow us to predict the outcome of infection for an individual, and to manage their health more effectively. In this study, we describe transcriptome-wide variation in immune response (to a standardised challenge) in a wild population of field voles (Microtus agrestis). We find that this variation can be categorised into three main types. We also identify markers, across these three categories, which display particularly strong individual variation in response. This work shows how a simple standardised challenge performed on a natural population can reveal complex patterns of natural variation in immune response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMore than 80% of all animal species remain unknown to science. Most of these species live in the tropics and belong to animal taxa that combine small body size with high specimen abundance and large species richness. For such clades, using morphology for species discovery is slow because large numbers of specimens must be sorted using detailed microscopic investigations. Fortunately, species discovery could be greatly accelerated if DNA sequences could be used for sorting specimens to species. Morphological verification of such \\\"molecular Operational Taxonomic Units\\\" (mOTUs) could then be based on dissection of a small subset of specimens. However, this approach requires cost-effective and low-tech DNA barcoding techniques because well equipped, well-funded molecular laboratories are not readily available in many biodiverse countries.\\n\\nResultsWe here document how MinION sequencing can be used for large-scale species discovery in a specimen- and species-rich taxon like the hyper-diverse fly family Phoridae (Diptera). We sequenced 7,059 specimens collected in a single Malaise trap in Kibale National Park, Uganda over the short period of eight weeks. We discovered >650 species which exceeded the number of phorid species currently described for the entire Afrotropical region. The barcodes were obtained using an improved low-cost MinION pipeline that increased the barcoding capacity sevenfold from 500 to 3,500 barcodes per flowcell. This was achieved by adopting 1D sequencing, re-sequencing weak amplicons on a used flowcell, and improving demultiplexing. Comparison with Illumina data revealed that the MinION barcodes were very accurate (99.99% accuracy, 0.46% Ns) and thus yielded very similar species units (match ratio: 0.991). Morphological examination of 100 mOTUs also confirmed good congruence with morphology (93% of mOTUs; >99% of specimens) and revealed that 90% of the putative species belong to a neglected, megadiverse genus (Megaselia). We demonstrate for one Megaselia species how the molecular data can guide the description of a new species (Megaselia sepsioides sp. nov.).\\n\\nConclusionsWe document that one field site in Africa can be home to an estimated 1000 species of phorids and speculate that the Afrotropical diversity could exceed 100,000 species. We furthermore conclude that low-cost MinION sequencers are very suitable for reliable, rapid, and large-scale species discovery in hyperdiverse taxa. MinION sequencing could quickly reveal the extent of the unknown diversity and is especially suitable for biodiverse countries with limited access to capital-intensive sequencing facilities.",

The impact of high Lp(a) levels on human longevity is however controversial. Our objectives were to determine whether genetically-determined Lp(a) levels are associated with parental lifespan and to assess the association between measured and genetically-determined Lp(a) levels and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.\\n\\nMethodsWe determined the association between a genetic risk score of 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms weighted for their impact on Lp(a) levels (wGRS) and parental lifespan (at least one long-lived parent; father still alive and older than 90 or fathers age of death [&ge;]90 or mother still alive and older than 93 or mothers age of death [&ge;]93) in 139,362 participants from the UK Biobank. A total of 17,686 participants were considered as having high parental lifespan. We also investigated the association between Lp(a) levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 18,720 participants from the EPIC-Norfolk study.\\n\\nResultsIn the UK Biobank, increases in the wGRS (weighted for a 50 mg/dL increase in Lp(a) levels) were inversely associated with a high parental lifespan (odds ratio=0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.89-0.94, p=2.7x10-8). During the 20-year follow-up of the EPIC-Norfolk study, 5686 participants died (2412 from CVD-related causes).

Compared to individuals with Lp(a) levels below the 50th percentile of the Lp(a) distribution (in whom event rates were 29.8% and 11.3%, respectively for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality), those with Lp(a) levels equal or above the 95th percentile of the population distribution ([&ge;]70 mg/dL) had HRs of 1.22 (95% CI=1.09-1.37, event rate 37.5%) and 1.71 (95% CI=1.46-2.00, event rate 20.0%), for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, respectively.\\n\\nConclusionsResults of this study suggest a potentially causal effect of Lp(a) on human longevity, support the use of parental lifespan as a tool to study the genetic determinants of human longevity, and provide a rationale for a trial of Lp(a)-lowering therapy in individuals with high Lp(a) levels.",

Strains are classified based on ompA genotypes, which are strongly linked with differential tissue tropism and disease outcomes. A lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) epidemics, characterized by ulcerative proctitis, has emerged in the last two decades (mainly L2b genotype), raising high concern especially due to its circulation among men who have sex with men (MSM). Here, we report an ongoing outbreak (mostly affecting HIV-positive MSM engaging in high-risk practices) caused by an L2b strain with a rather unique genome makeup that precluded the laboratory notification of this outbreak as LGV due to its non-LGV ompA signature. Homologous recombination mediated the transfer of a ~4.5Kbp fragment enrolling CT681/ompA and neighboring genes (CT677/rrf, CT678/pyrH, CT679/tsf, CT680/rpsB) from a serovar D/Da strain likely possessing the typical T1 clade genome backbone associated with most prevalent genotypes (E and F). The hybrid L2b/D-Da strain presents the adhesin and immunodominant antigen MOMP (coded by ompA) with an epitope repertoire typical of non-invasive genital strains, while keeping the genome-dispersed virulence fingerprint of a classical LGV (L2b) strain. As previously reported for inter-clade ompA exchange among non-LGV clades, this unprecedented C. trachomatis genomic mosaic involving a contemporary epidemiologically and clinically relevant LGV strain may have implications on its transmission, tissue tropism and pathogenic capabilities. The emergence of such variants with epidemic and pathogenic potential highlights the need of more oriented surveillance strategies focused on capturing the C. trachomatis evolution in action.",

Engaging in the task bidirectionally modulates neuronal responses to the auditory stimuli in both the attended and ignored conditions compared to passive hearing. Neuronal ensemble activity in response to stimuli under attended, ignored and passive conditions are readily distinguishable. Furthermore, ensemble activity under attended and ignored conditions are in closer states compared to passive condition, and they share a component of attentional modulation which drives them to the same direction in the population activity space.

Here we show that a majority of the disease-linked MLH1 variants we studied are present at reduced cellular levels. We show that destabilized MLH1 variants are targeted for chaperone-assisted proteasomal degradation, resulting also in degradation of co-factors PMS1 and PMS2. In silico saturation mutagenesis and computational predictions of thermodynamic stability of MLH1 missense variants revealed a correlation between structural destabilization, reduced steady-state levels and loss-of-function. Thus, we suggest that loss of stability and cellular degradation is an important mechanism underlying many MLH1 variants in Lynch syndrome.

    "abstract": "Ligand-receptor interactions, which are ubiquitous in physiology, are described by theoretical models of receptor pharmacology. Structural evidence for graded-efficacy receptor conformations predicted by receptor theory has been limited, but is critical to fully validate theoretical models. We applied quantitative structure-function approaches to characterize the effects of structurally similar and structurally diverse agonists on the conformational ensemble of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{gamma}). For all ligands, agonist efficacy is correlated to a shift in the conformational ensemble equilibrium from a ground state towards an active state, which is detected by NMR spectroscopy but not observed in crystal structures. For the structurally similar ligands, ligand potency is also correlated to efficacy and conformation, indicating ligand residence times among related analogs can influence receptor conformation and function. Our results derived from quantitative graded activity-conformation correlations provide new experimental evidence and a platform with which to extend and test theoretical models of receptor pharmacology to more accurately describe and predict ligand-dependent receptor activity.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres are defined by a unique self-propagating chromatin structure featuring nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. CENP-A turns over slower than general chromatin and a key question is whether this unusual stability is intrinsic to CENP-A nucleosomes or rather imposed by external factors. We designed a specific genetic screen to identify proteins involved in CENP-A stability based on SNAP-tag pulse chase labeling. Using a double pulse-labeling approach we simultaneously assay for factors with selective roles in CENP-A chromatin assembly. We discover a series of new proteins involved in CENP-A propagation, including proteins with known roles in DNA replication, repair and chromatin modification and transcription, revealing that a broad set of chromatin regulators impacts in CENP-A transmission through the cell cycle. The key factor we find to strongly affect CENP-A stability is SENP6. This SUMO-protease controls not only the levels of chromatin bound CENP-A but is required for the maintenance of virtually the entire centromere and kinetochore, with the exception of CENP-B. Acute depletion of SENP6 protein reveals its requirement for maintaining centromeric CENP-A levels throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that a dynamic SUMO cycle underlies a continuous surveillance of the centromere complex.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLight quality is a crucial physical factor driving coral distribution along depth gradients. Currently, a 30 m depth limit, based on SCUBA regulations, separates shallow and deep mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs). This definition, however, fails to explicitly accommodate environmental variation. Here, we posit a novel definition for a regional or reef-to-reef outlook of MCEs based on the light vs. coral community-structure relationship. A combination of physical and ecological methods enabled us to clarify the ambiguity in relation to that issue. To characterize coral community structure with respect to the light environment, we conducted wide-scale spatial studies at five sites along shallow and MCEs of the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba (0-100 m depth). Surveys were conducted by Tech-diving and drop-cameras, in addition to one year of light spectral measurements. We quantify two distinct coral assemblages: shallow (<40 m), and MCEs (40-100 m), exhibiting markedly different relationships with light. The depth ranges and morphology of 47 coral genera, was better explained by light than depth, mainly, due to the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) and Ultra Violet Radiation (1% at 76 m and 36 m, respectively). Branching coral species were found mainly at shallower depths i.e., down to 36 m. Among the abundant upper mesophotic specialist-corals, Leptoseris glabra, Euphyllia paradivisa and Alveopora spp., were found strictly between 36-76 m depth. The only lower mesophotic-specialist, Leptoseris fragilis, was found deeper than 80 m. We suggest that shallow coral genera are light-limited below a level of 1.25% surface PAR and that the optimal PAR for mesophotic communities is at 7.5%. This study contributes to moving MCEs ecology from a descriptive-phase into identifying key ecological and physiological processes structuring MCE coral communities. Moreover, it may serve as a model enabling the description of a coral zonation world-wide on the basis of light quality data.",

Sound information arrives at its input layer 4 from where activity propagates to associative layer 2/3. It is currently not known whether there is a particular organization of neuronal population activity that is stable across layers and sound levels during sound processing. We used in vivo 2-photon imaging of pyramidal neurons in cortical layers L4 and L2/3 of mouse A1 to characterize the populations of neurons that were active spontaneously, i.e. in the absence of a sound stimulus, and those recruited by single-frequency tonal stimuli at different sound levels. Single-frequency sounds recruited neurons of widely ranging frequency selectivity in both layers. We defined neural ensembles as neurons being active within or during successive temporal windows at the temporal resolution of our imaging. For both layers, neuronal ensembles were highly variable in size during spontaneous activity as well as during sound presentation. Ensemble sizes distributed according to power laws, the hallmark of neuronal avalanches, and were similar across sound levels. Avalanches activated by sound were composed of neurons with diverse tuning preference, yet with selectivity independent of avalanche size. Thus, spontaneous and evoked activity in both L4 and L2/3 of A1 are composed of neuronal avalanches with similar power law relationships. Our results demonstrate network principles linked to maximal dynamic range, optimal information transfer and matching complexity between L4 and L2/3 to shape population activity in auditory cortex.",

The analysis was divided in two parts: i) evaluation on perception of geometric characteristics, such as density, angular variation, distances and speeds, and ii) evaluation on personality and emotion perceptions.

The telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) N-terminal (TEN) domain is a peripheral, telomerase-specific, processivity-stimulatory addition to more conserved domains that encircle the active site cavity. Reports of ciliate, yeast, and mammalian telomerase TEN domain associations with the telomerase RNA subunit (TR) describe low affinity interactions of uncertain specificity. Unfortunately two cryo-EM structures of synthesis-paused telomerase holoenzymes lack sufficient resolution to discriminate molecular specificity of possible TR contact(s) with the TEN domain, and there is no assigned density for the TEN domain termini implicated in RNA binding. Furthermore, studies have revealed alternative secondary structures for TR regions that could interact with TERT prior to TR folding into active conformation. Informed by recent advances in knowledge of telomerase structure, we returned to the investigation of Tetrahymena thermophila TERT TEN domain interaction with TR. Instead of finding specificity for a particular TR sequence or structure, we discovered that the tagged TEN domain used in previous characterizations has trace contamination with a bacterial RNA-interacting protein not detectable by SDS-PAGE. By resolving this interference, we show that the TEN domain binds RNAs dependent on RNA length rather than sequence.",

Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human SLC1A5 and its complex with the substrate, L-glutamine in an outward-facing conformation. These structures reveal insights into the conformation of the critical ECL2a loop which connects the two domains, thus allowing rigid body movement of the transport domain throughout the transport cycle. Furthermore, the structures provide new insights into substrate recognition, which involves conformational changes in the HP2 loop. A putative cholesterol binding site was observed near the domain interface in the outward-facing state. Comparison with the previously determined inward-facing structure of SCL1A5 provides a basis for a more integrated understanding of substrate recognition and transport mechanism in the SLC1 family. Our structures are likely to aid the development of potent and selective SLC1A5 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders.",

    "abstract": "Coronary endothelial dysfunction is associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Vascular endothelial cells are referred to as small and polygonal mononuclear cells. However, multi-nucleated and large endothelial cells (named as multinucleated variant endothelial cells [MVECs]) have been reported in the aorta, wherein their abundance correlates with atherosclerosis severity. The role of MVECs in coronary endothelium remains obscure. We hypothesized that simulated diabetic conditions increase the number of MVECs and affect their mitochondrial structure/function in cultured coronary endothelium. The in vitro model of diabetes consisted in the treatment of bovine coronary artery endothelial cells (BCAECs) with high-insulin (100 nmol/L, HI) for three days followed by high-glucose (20 mmol/L, HG) and HI for nine additional days. Simulated diabetic conditions increased the abundance of MVECs compared to normal glucose (NG, 5.5 mM). MVECs had a higher nucleic acid content (7.2-Fold), cell diameter (2.2-Fold), and cell area (11.4-Fold) than mononuclear cells. Immunodetection of von-Willebrand factor (endothelial cell marker) in MVECs was positive. The mitochondrial mass was reduced, and mitochondrial membrane potential increased in mononuclear cells cultured in HG+HI compared to mononuclear cells grown in NG. However, the opposite mitochondrial findings were noted in MVECs compared to mononuclear cells. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic and gene ontology analysis suggested augmented mitochondrial autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammation suppression in cells cultured under HG+HI compared to NG conditions. These findings show that simulated diabetes increases the abundance of MVECs, and that mitochondrial structure and function are differentially affected between MVECs and mononuclear cells.",

Yet, this understanding is generally constrained by the availability of fine-resolution data for multiple services across large areas and the spatial variability of land-use effects on services. We systematically surveyed published literature for New Zealand (1970 - 2015) to quantify the supply of 17 services across 25 land covers (as a proxy for land use). We found a consistent trade-off in the services supplied by anthropogenic land covers with a high production intensity (e.g., cropping) versus those with extensive or no production. In contrast, forest cover was not associated with any distinct patterns of service supply. By drawing on existing research findings we reveal complementarity and redundancy (potentially influencing resilience) in service supply from different land covers. This can guide practitioners in shaping land systems that sustainably support human well-being.",

This paper includes a detailed description of how to build a simple photoconversion setup that can increase reliability and throughput of this well-established technique. The system described here, is particularly well-suited for thick neuronal tissue, where light penetration and oxygen diffusion may be limiting DAB oxidation. To demonstrate the system, we use Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) to visualize functionally-labelled individual synaptic vesicles released onto an identified layer 5 neuron in an acute cortical slice. The setup significantly simplifies the photoconversion workflow, increasing the depth of photoillumination, improving the targeting of the region of interest and reducing the time required to process each individual samples. We have tested this setup extensively for the photoconversion of FM 1-43FX and Lucifer Yellow both excited at 473 nm. In principle, the system can be adapted to any dye or nanoparticle able to oxidize DAB when excited by a specific light wavelength.",

When tested in cheatgrass bioassays these metabolites were able to delay seed germination, with P-Acid B being the most active compound. Here, we have investigated the cross-kingdom activity of P-Acid B and its mode of action and found that it activates the ABA signaling pathway in order to inhibit seedling establishment. P-Acid B inhibits seedling establishment in wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana while several mutants affected in the early perception as well as in downstream ABA signaling components were insensitive to the fungal compound. However, in spite of structural similarities between ABA and P-Acid B, the latter is not able to activate the PYR/PYL family of ABA receptors. Instead, we have found that P-Acid B uses the ABA biosynthesis pathway at the level of alcohol dehydrogenase ABA2 to reduce seedling establishment. We propose that the fungus Pyrenophora semeniperda manipulates plant ABA biosynthesis as a strategy to reduce seed germination, increasing its ability to cause seed mortality and thereby increase its fitness through higher reproductive success.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTrichoderma reesei is the main filamentous fungus used in industry to produce cellulases. Over the last decades, there have been a strong increase in the understanding of the regulatory network controlling cellulase-coding gene expression in response to a number of inducers and environmental signals. In this sense, the role of calcium and the Calcineurin-responsive protein (CRZ1) has been investigated in industrially relevant strains of T. reesei RUT-C30, but this system has not been investigated in wild-type reference strain of this fungus.\\n\\nResultsHere, we investigated the role of CRZ1 and Ca2+ signaling in the fungus T. reesei QM6a. For this, we first searched for potential CRZ1 binding sites in promoter regions of key genes coding holocellulases, as well as transcriptional regulators and sugar and calcium transporters. Using a nearly constructed T. reesei {Delta}crzl strain, we demonstrated that most of the genes expected to be regulated by CRZ1 were affected in the mutant strain induced with sugarcane bagasse (SCB) and cellulose. In particular, our data demonstrate that Ca2+ acts synergistically with CRZ1 to modulate gene expression, but also exerts CRZ1-independent regulatory role in gene expression in T. reesei, suggesting the existence of additional Ca2+ sensing mechanisms in this fungus.\\n\\nConclusionsThis work presents new evidence on the regulatory role of CRZ1 and Ca2+ sensing in the regulation of cellulolytic enzymes in T. reesei, evidencing significant and previously unknown function of this Ca2+ sensing system in the control key transcriptional regulators (XYR1 and CRE1) and on the expression of genes related to sugar and Ca2+ transport. Taken together, the data obtained here provide new evidence on the regulatory network of T. reesei related to plant biomass deconstruction.",

In the last 40 years, outcomes for low and intermediate risk patients have improved; however, high risk patients with metastatic disease still have poor overall survival. Differentiation therapy for RMS has been considered a potential clinical approach to halting tumor progression by inducing the terminal myogenic differentiation program, and thus reducing the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy. Both the NOTCH and MEK pathway have been shown to play varying roles in inducing differentiation in RMS cells. Here, we tested several different RMS cell lines harboring varying genetic abnormalities with the MEK inhibitor trametinib alone, and in combination with {gamma}-secretase inhibitors and found no significant effect on cell viability when used together.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis use is highly prevalent and is associated with adverse and beneficial effects. To better understand the full spectrum of health consequences, biomarkers that accurately classify cannabis use are needed. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an excellent candidate, yet no blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in humans exist. We conducted an EWAS of lifetime cannabis use (ever vs. never) using blood-based DNAm data from a case-cohort study within Sister Study, a prospective cohort of women at risk of developing breast cancer (Discovery N=1,730 [855 ever users]; Replication N=853 [392 ever users]). We identified and replicated an association with lifetime cannabis use at cg15973234 (CEMIP): combined P=3.3x10-8. We found no overlap between published blood-based cis-meQTLs of cg15973234 and reported lifetime cannabis use-associated SNPs (P<0.05), suggesting that the observed DNAm difference was driven by cannabis exposure. We also developed a multi-CpG classifier of lifetime cannabis use using penalized regression of top EWAS CpGs. The resulting 49-CpG classifier produced an area under the curve (AUC)=0.74 (95% confidence interval [0.72, 0.76], P=2.00x10-5) in the discovery sample and AUC=0.54 ([0.51, 0.57], P=4.64x10-2) in the replication sample. Our EWAS findings provide evidence that blood-based DNAm is associated with lifetime cannabis use.",

    "abstract": "To ensure survival during colonization of the human host, bacteria must successfully respond to unfavorable and fluctuating conditions. This study explores the fundamental phenomenon of stress response in a gram-positive bacterium, where we investigate the ability of a cell wall modification enzyme to modulate intracellular stress and prevent the triggering of the stringent response pathway. The Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall modification proteins MurM and MurN are tRNA-dependent amino acid ligases, which lead to the production of branched muropeptides by generating peptide crossbridges. In addition, MurM has been proposed to contribute to translation quality control by preferentially deacylating mischarged tRNAs mischarged with amino acids that make up the peptidoglycan. Here, we demonstrate that the murMN operon promotes optimal growth under stressed conditions. Specifically, when grown in mildly acidic conditions, a murMN deletion mutant displays early entry into stationary phase and dramatically increased lysis. Surprisingly, these defects are rescued by inhibition of the stringent response pathway or by enhancement of the cells ability to deacylate mischarged tRNA molecules. The increase in lysis results from the activity of LytA, and experiments in macrophages reveal that murMN regulates phagocytosis in a LytA-dependent manner. These results suggest that under certain stresses, these bacterial cells lacking MurMN likely accumulate mischarged tRNA molecules, activate the stringent response pathway, and enter prematurely into stationary phase. Moreover, by virtue of its ability to deacylate mischarged tRNAs while building peptidoglycan crossbridges, MurM can calibrate the stress response with consequences to host-pathogen interactions. Thus, MurM is positioned at the interface of cell wall modification, translation quality control and stringent response. These findings expand our understanding of the functions of the bacterial cell wall: cell wall modifications that impart structural rigidity to the cell are interlinked to the cells ability to signal intracellularly and mount a response to environmental stresses.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEDuring infection, microbes must survive the hostile environmental conditions of the human host. When exposed to stresses, bacteria activate an intracellular response, known as stringent response pathway, to ensure their survival. This study connects two fundamental pathways important for cellular growth in a gram-positive bacterium; it demonstrates that enzymes responsible for cell wall modification are connected to the stringent response pathway via their ability to ameliorate errors in protein translation. Our study was performed on Streptococcus pneumoniae where the cell wall modification enzyme, MurM, is a known determinant of penicillin resistance. We now demonstrate the importance of MurM in translation quality control and establish that it serves as a gatekeeper of the stringent response pathway.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam1) can potentially generate 38,016 different isoforms through stochastic, yet highly biased, alternative splicing. Genetic studies demonstrated that stochastic expression of multiple Dscam1 isoforms provides each neuron with a unique identity for self/non-self-discrimination. However, due to technical obstacles, the functional significance of the highly specific bias in isoform expression remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide conclusive evidence that Dscam1 splicing bias is required for precise mushroom body (MB) axonal wiring in flies in a variable exon-specific manner. We showed that targeted deletion of the intronic docking site perturbed base pairing-mediated regulation of inclusion of variable exons. Unexpectedly, we generated mutant flies with normal overall Dscam1 protein levels and an identical number but global changes in exon 4 and exon 9 isoform bias (Dscam{Delta}4D-/- and Dscam{Delta}9D-/-), respectively. Dscam{Delta}9D-/- mutant exhibited remarkable mushroom body defects, which were correlated with the extent of the disrupted isoform bias. By contrast, the Dscam{Delta}4D-/- animals exhibited a much less severe defective phenotype than Dscam{Delta}9D-/- animals, suggestive of a variable domain-specific requirement for isoform bias. Importantly, mosaic analysis revealed that changes in isoform bias caused axonal defects but did not influence the self-avoidance of axonal branches. We concluded that, in contrast to the Dscam1 isoform number that provides the molecular basis for neurite self-avoidance, isoform bias may play a non-repulsive role in mushroom body axonal wiring.",

While diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to myelination, it is also sensitive to unrelated microstructural properties, thus hindering straightforward interpretations. Myelin water imaging (MWI) provides a more reliable and direct in vivo measure of myelination. Although early histological studies show protracted myelination from childhood to adulthood, reliable tract-specific in vivo evidence from MWI is still lacking. Here, we combine MWI and DTI tractography to investigate myelination in middle childhood, late childhood, and adulthood in 18 major white matter tracts. In the vast majority of major white matter tracts, myelin water fraction continued to increase beyond late childhood.

B-GLI allows both high-complexity of lineage tracing and effective isolation of individual clones by CRISPRa-mediated induction of puromycin resistance, making it possible to unbiasedly trace, isolate, and study individual cancer cell lineages. We present experimental evaluation of the system performance in isolation of lineages and outline a comprehensive workflow for B-GLI applications.

We use direct, in vivo imaging of these stem cells in the chick. We find that progenitors of single and dual fates are mingled in a small region between the specialised stem zones. Divergent tissue movements surround this region. When transplanted downstream of these flows, cells from the region of mixed fates adopt the molecular identity and behaviour of the target stem zone, irrespective of their normal fate.

In this study, we used CLEAR (Covalent Ligation of Endogenous Argonaute-bound RNAs) -CLIP (Cross-Linking and Immuno-Precipitation) to explore the regulatory functions of miRNAs in the circadian system by comparing the miRNA-mRNA interactions between the Drosophila wild-type strain w1118 and the Clk mutant Clkjrk. We unambiguously identified thousands of miRNA-mRNA interactions from CLEAR-CLIP data set at unprecedented depth in vivo for the first time. Among them, about 300 miRNA-mRNA interactions were involved in the regulation of circadian, in which miRNAs targeting core clock genes pdp1, tim and vri presented distinct changes in response to Clkjrk. Particularly, the mir-375-timeless interaction from CLER-CLIP shows important effects on circadian, this functional event occurred in the l-LNv neurons. Overexpression of mir-375 in tim neurons caused decreases in TIM content resulting in arrhythmicity of daily locomotion and changes of sleep.

    "abstract": "Studies of selective attention typically consider the role of task goals or physical salience, but recent work has shown that attention can also be captured by previously reward-associated stimuli, even if they are currently task-irrelevant. One theory underlying this value-driven attentional capture (VDAC) is that reward-associated stimulus representations may undergo plasticity in sensory cortex, thereby automatically capturing attention during early processing. To test this, we used magnetoencephalography to probe whether stimulus location and identity representations in sensory cortex are modulated by reward learning. We furthermore investigated the time-course of these neural effects, and their relationship to behavioural VDAC. Male and female human participants first learned stimulus-reward associations. Next, we measured VDAC in a separate task by presenting these stimuli in the absence of reward contingency, and probing their effects on the processing of separate target stimuli presented at different time lags. Using time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis, we found that learned value modulated the spatial selection of previously rewarded stimuli in posterior visual and parietal cortex from [~]260ms after stimulus onset. This value modulation was related to the strength of participants behavioural VDAC effect and persisted into subsequent target processing. Furthermore, we found a spatially invariant value signal from [~]340ms. Importantly, learned value did not influence cortical signatures of early processing (i.e., earlier than [~]200ms), nor did it influence the decodability of the identity of previously rewarded stimuli. Our results suggest that VDAC is underpinned by learned value signals which modulate spatial selection throughout posterior visual and parietal cortex. We further suggest that VDAC can occur in the absence of changes in early visual processing in cortex.\n\nSignificance statementAttention is our ability to focus on relevant information at the expense of irrelevant information. It can be affected by previously learned but currently irrelevant stimulus-reward associations, a phenomenon termed \"value-driven attentional capture\" (VDAC). The neural mechanisms underlying VDAC remain unclear. It has been speculated that reward learning induces visual cortical plasticity which modulates early visual processing to capture attention. Although we find that learned value modulates spatial signals in visual cortical areas, an effect which correlates with VDAC, we find no relevant signatures of changes in early visual processing in cortex.",

    "abstract": "Dissecting the genetic architecture of stress tolerance in crops is critical to understand and improve adaptation. In temperate climates, early planting of chilling-tolerant varieties could provide longer growing seasons and drought escape, but chilling tolerance (<15{degrees}) is generally lacking in tropical-origin crops. Here we developed a nested association mapping (NAM) population to dissect the genetic architecture of early-season chilling tolerance in the tropical-origin cereal sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench). The NAM resource, developed from reference line BTx623 and three chilling-tolerant Chinese lines, is comprised of 771 recombinant inbred lines genotyped by sequencing at 43,320 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We phenotyped the NAM population for emergence, seedling vigor, and agronomic traits (>75,000 data points from [~]16,000 plots) in multi-environment field trials in Kansas under natural chilling stress (sown 30-45 days early) and normal growing conditions. Joint linkage mapping with early-planted field phenotypes revealed an oligogenic architecture, with 5-10 chilling tolerance loci explaining 20-41% of variation. Surprisingly, several of the major chilling tolerance loci co-localize precisely with the classical grain tannin (Tan1 and Tan2) and dwarfing genes (Dw1 and Dw3) that were under strong directional selection in the US during the 20th century. These findings suggest that chilling sensitivity was inadvertently selected due to coinheritance with desired nontannin and dwarfing alleles. The characterization of genetic architecture with NAM reveals why past chilling tolerance breeding was stymied and provides a path for genomics-enabled breeding of chilling tolerance.\\n\\nArticle SummaryChilling sensitivity limits productivity of tropical-origin crops in temperate climates, and remains poorly understood at a genetic level. We developed a nested association mapping resource in sorghum, a tropical-origin cereal, to understand the genetic architecture of chilling tolerance. Linkage mapping of growth traits from early-planted field trials revealed several major chilling tolerance loci, including some colocalized with genes that were selected in the origin of US grain sorghum. These findings suggest chilling sensitivity was inadvertently selected during 20th century breeding, but can be bypassed using a better understanding of the underlying genetic architecture.\\n\\nDisclaimerMention of a trademark, warranty, proprietary product, or vendor does not constitute a guarantee by the USDA and does not imply approval or recommendation of the product to the exclusion of others that may be suitable.

In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multi-scale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure, and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.",

Here, we report that the replication initiation machinery of D. melanogaster unexpectedly undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon binding DNA in vitro. We find that ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that drive LLPS and constitute a new class of phase separating elements. Initiator IDRs are shown to regulate multiple functions, including chromosome recruitment, initiator-specific co-assembly, and Mcm2-7 loading.

In this study, we investigated the conservation and distribution of natural transformability in the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Using a panel of 113 clinical isolates, we found that natural transformability is relatively conserved but shows large variations inconsistent with the phylogeny. By conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) we identified the conjugative plasmid pLPL as a source of these intraspecific variations. We further show that the plasmid inhibits transformation by simultaneously silencing the genes required for DNA uptake and recombination, comEC, comEA, comF and comM. We identified a plasmid-encoded small RNA (sRNA), RocRp, as solely responsible for the silencing of natural transformation. RocRp is homologous to the highly conserved and chromosome-encoded RocR which controls the transient expression of the DNA uptake system. We show that RocRp can take over the function of RocR, by acting as a substitute, ensuring that the bacterial host of the conjugative plasmid does not become naturally transformable. Distinct homologs of this plasmid-encoded sRNA are found in diverse conjugative elements in other Legionella species, suggesting that silencing natural transformation is beneficial to these genetic elements. We propose that transformation-interfering factors are frequent genetic cargo of mobile genetic elements, accounting for intraspecific variations in natural transformation but also responsible for the apparent non-transformability of some species.",

    "abstract": "The way pollinators gather resources may play a key role for buffering their population declines. Social pollinators like bumblebees could adjust their foraging after significant workforce reductions to keep provisions to the colony optimal, especially in terms of pollen quality, diversity, and quantity. To test what effects a workforce reduction causes on the foraging for pollen, colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris were experimentally manipulated in field by removing half the number of workers. The pollen pellets of the workers were taxonomically identified with DNA metabarcoding, a ROC approach was used to filter out underrepresented OTUs, and video cameras and network analyses were employed to investigate foraging strategies and behaviour. The results suggested that the plant diversity in the pollen pellets was high but plant identity and pollen quantity traits were influenced mainly by plant phenology. During the experiment, although the treated colonies increased foraging effort in relation to control nests, only minor changes in the diet breadth and in the other node-level and network-level indices were observed after workforce removal. Therefore, a consistency in the bumblebees feeding strategies emerges despite the lowered workforce, which questions the ability of social pollinators to adjust their foraging in the field.",
