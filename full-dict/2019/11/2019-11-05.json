    "abstract": "High plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) concentration is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Hepatic LDLR regulates LDL metabolism, and thereby plasma LDL-c concentration. Recently, we identified the (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] as a novel regulator of LDL metabolism, which regulates LDLR degradation and hence its protein abundance and activity. In silicon analysis suggests that the (P)RR is a target of miR-148a. In this study we determined whether miR-148a could regulate LDL metabolism by regulating (P)RR expression in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. We found that miR-148a suppressed (P)RR expression by binding to the 3-untranslated regions (3-UTR) of (P)RR mRNA. Mutating the binding sites for miR-148a in the 3-UTR of (P)RR mRNA abolished the inhibitory effects of miR-148a on (P)RR expression. In line with our recent findings, reduced (P)RR expression resulted in decreased cellular LDL uptake, likely as a consequence of decreased LDLR protein abundance. Overexpressing the (P)RR prevented miR-148a-induced reduction in LDLR abundance and cellular LDL uptake. Our study supports a new concept that miR-148a is a regulator of (P)RR expression. By reducing (P)RR abundance, miR-148a decreases LDLR protein abundance and consequently cellular LDL uptake.",

    "abstract": "miRNAs are an important class of small non-coding RNAs, which play a versatile role in gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. Expression of miRNAs is often deregulated in human cancers.\\n\\nWe analyzed small RNA massive parallel sequencing data from 50 locally advanced breast cancers aiming to identify novel breast cancer related miRNAs. We successfully predicted 10 novel miRNAs, out of which 2 (hsa-miR-nov3 and hsa-miR-nov7) were recurrent. Applying high sensitivity qPCR, we detected these two microRNAs in 206 and 214 out of 223 patients in the study from which the initial cohort of 50 samples were drawn. We found hsa-miR-nov3 and hsa-miR-nov7 both to be overexpressed in tumor versus normal breast tissue in a separate set of 13 patients (p=0.009 and p=0.016, respectively) from whom both tumor tissue and normal tissue were available. We observed hsa-miR-nov3 to be expressed at higher levels in ER-positive compared to ER-negative tumors (p=0.037). Further stratifications revealed particularly low levels in the her2-like and basal-like cancers compared to other subtypes (p=0.009 and 0.040, respectively).\\n\\nWe predicted target genes for the 2 microRNAs and identified inversely correlated genes in mRNA expression array data available from 203 out of the 223 patients. Applying the KEGG and GO annotations to target genes revealed pathways essential to cell development, communication and homeostasis.\\n\\nAlthough a weak association between high expression levels of hsa-miR-nov7 and poor survival was observed, this did not reach statistical significance. hsa-miR-nov3 expression levels had no impact on patient survival.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication protein Cdc45 is an integral part of the eukaryotic replicative helicase whose other components are the Mcm2-7 core, and GINS. We identified a PIP box motif in Leishmania donovani Cdc45. This motif is typically linked to interaction with the eukaryotic clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The homotrimeric PCNA can potentially bind upto three different proteins simultaneously via a loop region present in each monomer. Multiple binding partners have been identified from among the replication machinery in other eukaryotes, and the concerted /sequential binding of these partners are central to the fidelity of the replication process. Though conserved in Cdc45 across Leishmania species and Trypanosoma cruzi, the PIP box is absent in Trypanosoma brucei Cdc45. Here we investigate the possibility of Cdc45-PCNA interaction and the role of such an interaction in the in vivo context. Having confirmed the importance of Cdc45 in Leishmania DNA replication we establish that Cdc45 and PCNA interact stably in whole cell extracts, interacting with each other directly in vitro also. The interaction is mediated via the Cdc45 PIP box. This PIP box is essential for Leishmania survival. The importance of the Cdc45 PIP box is also examined in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and it is found to be essential for cell survival in this organism also. Our results implicate a role for the Leishmania Cdc45 PIP box in recruiting or stabilizing PCNA on chromatin. The Cdc45-PCNA interaction might help tether PCNA and associated replicative DNA polymerase to the DNA template, thus facilitating replication fork elongation. Though multiple replication proteins have been identified to associate with PCNA in other eukaryotes, this is the first report demonstrating a direct interaction between Cdc45 and PCNA, and while our analysis suggests the interaction may not occur in human cells, it indicates that it is not confined to trypanosomatids.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryLeishmaniases are manifested in three forms: cutaneous, sub-cutaneous and visceral. The prevalent form in the Indian subcontinent is visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), which is fatal if not treated on time. While there are drugs for treatment, the hunt for additional drugs continues due to emerging drug resistance patterns. The parasite is transmitted by the bite of the sandfly, whereupon it establishes itself within cells of the host immune system (macrophages) and reproduces by binary fission. The replication of its genome is essential for parasite survival. Eukaryotic DNA replication is generally conserved across species. This study targets Cdc45, a protein that helps unwind the DNA double helix to enable copying of the two strands into two daughter strands. The new chains of DNA are synthesized by DNA polymerases, and a trimeric protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), helps clamp the polymerases onto the template. In this study we find Cdc45 to interact with PCNA, and have identified the motif in Cdc45 via which it does so. Our results suggest this interaction is seen in some other eukaryotes as well. Based on the results of our experiments we propose that Cdc45 may help moor PCNA-polymerase complexes to template DNA.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that cross-modal semantic congruence plays a role in spatial attention orienting and visual search. However, the extent to which these cross-modal semantic relationships attract attention automatically is still unclear. At present the outcomes of different studies have been inconsistent. Variations in task-relevance of the cross-modal stimuli (from explicitly needed, to completely irrelevant) and the amount of perceptual load may account for the mixed results of previous experiments. In the present study, we addressed the effects of audio-visual semantic congruence on visuo-spatial attention across variations in task relevance and perceptual load. We used visual search amongst images of common objects paired with characteristic object sounds (e.g., guitar image and chord sound). We found that audio-visual semantic congruence speeded visual search times when the cross-modal objects are task relevant, or when they are irrelevant but presented under low perceptual load. Instead, when perceptual load is high, sounds fail to attract attention towards the congruent visual images. These results lead us to conclude that object-based crossmodal congruence does not attract attention automatically and requires some top-down processing.",

    "abstract": "The Alda score is commonly used to quantify lithium responsiveness in bipolar disorder. Most often, this score is dichotomized into \"responder\" and \"non-responder\" categories, respectively. This practice is often criticized as inappropriate, since continuous variables are thought to invariably be \"more informative\" than their dichotomizations. We therefore investigated the degree of informativeness across raw and dichotomized versions of the Alda score, using data from a published study of the scales inter-rater reliability (n=59 raters of 12 standardized vignettes each). After learning a generative model for the relationship between observed and ground truth scores (the latter defined by a consensus rating of the 12 vignettes), we show that the dichotomized scale is more robust to inter-rater disagreement than the raw 0-10 scale. Further theoretical analysis shows that when a measures reliability is stronger at one extreme of the continuum--a scenario which has received little-to-no statistical attention, but which likely occurs for the Alda score [&ge;] 7--dichotomization of a continuous variable may be more informative concerning its ground truth value, particularly in the presence of noise. Our study suggests that research employing the Alda score of lithium responsiveness should continue using the dichotomous definition, particularly when data are sampled across multiple raters.",

    "abstract": "The North American cheetah population serves as a reservoir for the species, and acts as a research population to help understand the unique biology of the species. Little is known about the intrauterine physiology of the cheetah, including embryo differentiation, implantation, and the development of the placenta. After mating, cheetah females frequently experience (30-65% of matings) a non-pregnant luteal phase where progestogen metabolite levels match those found in pregnant females for the first ~55 days of gestation, but parturition does not occur. Immunoglobulin J chain (IgJ) is a molecule that is involved in the activation of the secretory immune response and has been found to be indicative of pregnancy in the cheetah using fecal monitoring. In this study, western blotting was employed to track IgJ abundance in pooled weekly fecal samples following natural breeding or exogenous stimulation to ovulate, and IgJ levels were compared between individuals undergoing a pregnant (n = 12) and non-pregnant (n = 19) luteal phase. It was revealed that IgJ abundance was increased in pregnant females compared to non-pregnant females at week 4 and week 8 post-breeding, indicating the potential modulation of maternal immunity in response to sensitive events such as implantation and the increased secretory activity of the placenta. IgJ levels also tended to be higher early after breeding in females that were bred naturally with intact males compared to exogenously stimulated females with no exposure to seminal plasma, indicating the promotion of maternal tolerance to seminal antigens present upon embryonic implantation. Monitoring fecal IgJ may be a potential method to determine gestational status in the cheetah and will aid future conservation efforts of the species.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAt low mutation-detection thresholds, next generation sequencing (NGS) for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing is susceptible to artifactual detection of mutations arising from PCR error and APOBEC-mediated G-to-A hypermutation.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed published HIV-1 pol Illumina NGS data to characterize the distribution of mutations at eight NGS thresholds: 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, and 0.1%. At each threshold, we determined the proportion of amino acid mutations that were unusual (defined as having a prevalence <0.01% in HIV-1 group M sequences) or were signature APOBEC mutations.\\n\\nResultsEight studies, containing 855 samples, in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive were analyzed. As detection thresholds were lowered, there was a progressive increase in the proportion of positions with both usual and unusual mutations and in the proportion of all mutations that were unusual. The median proportion of positions with an unusual mutation increased gradually from 0% at the 20% threshold to 0.3% at the 1% threshold and then exponentially to 1.3% (0.5% threshold), 6.9% (0.2% threshold), and 23.2% (0.1% threshold). In two of three studies with available plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, the proportion of positions with unusual mutations was negatively associated with virus levels. Although the complete set of signature APOBEC mutations was much smaller than that of unusual mutations, the former outnumbered the latter in one-sixth of the samples at the 0.5%, 1%, and 2% thresholds.\\n\\nConclusionsThe marked increase in the proportion of positions with unusual mutations at thresholds below 1% and in samples with lower virus loads suggests that, at low thresholds, many unusual mutations are artifactual, reflecting PCR error or G-to-A hypermutation. Profiling the numbers of unusual and signature APOBEC pol mutations at different NGS thresholds may be useful to avoid selecting a threshold that is too low and poses an unacceptable risk of identifying artifactual mutations.",

This paper proposes Pade approximation (Pa) with Differential Evolution (DE) for obtaining solution of Hepatitis-B model which is nonlinear numerically. The proposed strategy transforms the nonlinear model into optimization problem by using Pade approximation. Initial conditions are converted into problem constraints and constraint problem become unconstraint by using penalty function. DE is obtained numerical solution of Hepatitis-B model by solving the established problem of optimization. There is no need to choose step lengths in proposed Pade-approximation based Differential Evolution (PaDE) technique and also PaDE converges to true steady state points. Finally, a convergence and error analysis evidence that the convergence speed of PaDE is greater than Non-Standard Finite Difference (NSFD) method for different time steps.",

    "abstract": "Bobcats are an apex predator and a species of socio-cultural importance in the central Appalachian Mountains. Despite their importance, knowledge of bobcat spatial ecology in the region is sparse. We examined space use and resource selection of bobcats in the Appalachian Mountains of western Virginia during 3 biological seasons: breeding (January-March), kitten-rearing (April-September), and dispersal (October-December). We observed sex effects on all space use metrics, with male seasonal areas of use (SAU) approximately 3 times larger than female SAUs and male movement rates 1.5 times higher than females during all seasons. We found no seasonal effect on SAU size for either sex. Female movement rates increased during the kitten-rearing season, and male movement rates increased during the dispersal season. We examined seasonal bobcat resource selection at 2 hierarchical scales, selection of home ranges within the landscape (2nd order) and selection of locations within home ranges (3rd order). Female bobcats exhibited 2nd order selection for higher elevations and deciduous forest and avoidance of fields. Males exhibited 2nd order selection for higher elevations and fields. Male 2nd order selection appears to be driven largely by the spatial distribution of females, which is mediated through the valley and ridge topography of the study area. Sample size precluded 3rd order analysis for females, however males exhibited 3rd order selection for higher elevations, fields, and deciduous forest. Resource selection patterns varied seasonally for both sexes, possibly driven by seasonal shifts in prey availability. Our findings highlight the importance of forested ridges to bobcats in the region. Our findings also illustrate the differences in space use between sexes, which future research efforts should consider. Further research should investigate seasonal shifts in bobcat prey selection, which may further explain the seasonal resource selection shifts we observed, and highlight potential implications for prey species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCognitive impairment is prevalent but still poorly diagnosed in hemodialysis adults, mainly because of the impracticality of current tools. This study examined whether remotely monitoring mobility performance can help identifying digital measures of cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients.\\n\\nMethodsSixty-nine hemodialysis patients (age=64.1{+/-}8.1years, body mass index=31.7{+/-}7.6kg/m2) were recruited. According to the Mini-Mental State Exam, 44 (64%) were determined as cognitive-intact, and 25 (36%) as cognitive-impaired. Mobility performance, including cumulated posture duration (sitting, lying, standing, and walking), daily walking performance (step and unbroken walking bout), as well as postural-transition (daily number and average duration), were measured using a validated pendant-sensor for a continuous period of 24-hour during a non-dialysis day. Motor capacity was quantified by assessing standing balance and gait performance under single-task and dual-task conditions.\\n\\nResultsNo between-group difference was observed for the motor capacity. However, the mobility performance was different between groups. The cognitive-impaired group spent significantly higher percentage of time in sitting and lying (Cohens effect size d=0.78, p=0.005) but took significantly less daily steps (d=0.69, p=0.015) than the cognitive-intact group. The largest effect of reduction in number of postural-transition was observed in walk-to-sit transition (d=0.65, p=0.020). Regression models based on demographics, addition of daily walking performance, and addition of other mobility performance metrics, led to area-under-curves of 0.76, 0.78, and 0.93, respectively, for discriminating cognitive-impaired cases.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study suggests that mobility performance metrics could be served as potential digital biomarkers of cognitive impairment among HD patients. It also highlights the additional value of measuring cumulated posture duration and postural-transition to improve the detection of cognitive impairment. Future studies need to examine potential benefits of mobility performance metrics for early diagnosis of cognitive impairment/dementia and timely intervention.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular RNAs present in biofluids have emerged as potential biomarkers for disease. Where most studies focus on plasma or serum, other biofluids may contain more informative RNA molecules, depending on the type of disease. Here, we present an unprecedented atlas of messenger, circular and small RNA transcriptomes of a comprehensive collection of 20 different human biofluids. By means of synthetic spike-in controls, we compared RNA content across biofluids, revealing a more than 10 000-fold difference in RNA concentration. The circular RNA fraction is increased in nearly all biofluids compared to tissues. Each biofluid transcriptome is enriched for RNA molecules derived from specific tissues and cell types. In addition, a subset of biofluids, including stool, sweat, saliva and sputum, contains high levels of bacterial RNAs. Our atlas enables a more informed selection of the most relevant biofluid to monitor particular diseases. To verify the biomarker potential in these biofluids, four validation cohorts representing a broad spectrum of diseases were profiled, revealing numerous differential RNAs between case and control subjects. Taken together, our results reveal novel insights in the RNA content of human biofluids and may serve as a valuable resource for future biomarker studies. All spike-normalized data is publicly available in the R2 web portal and serve as a basis to further explore the RNA content in biofluids.",
