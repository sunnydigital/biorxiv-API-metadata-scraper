    "abstract": "Seed storability is an important and complex agronomic trait in maize because annual seed production considerably exceeds consumption. The viability of seeds decreases over time, even when stored at low temperature, until seeds finally lose viability. In our previous study, two inbred lines with significantly different storability, Dong156 with high storage tolerance and Dong237 with low storage tolerance, were selected over six years using a natural seed aging test. In the present study, an F2:3 population and a RIL (recombinant inbred line) population were constructed from these two inbred lines and used to map QTL (quantitative trait loci) with SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers. A phenotypic index of traits related to seed storability that includes germination rate, germination potential, a germination index, a vigor index, seedling weight, and seedling length was generated using the results of an artificial aging treatment. Two consistent regions, cQTL-7 on chromosome 7 and cQTL-10 on chromosome 10, were identified by comparing QTL analysis results from these two populations. After genotyping SSR markers in these two regions, cQTL-7 was remapped to between umc1671 and phi328175 in a 7.97-Mb region, and cQTL-10 was remapped to between umc1648 and phi050 in a 39.15-Mb region. Four SSR markers linked to cQTL-7 and cQTL-10, including umc1671, phi328175, umc1648, and phi050, were identified using a Chi-squared test. The combined selection efficiency of these four markers was 83.94% in 85 RIL lines with high storability, and marker umc1648 exhibited the highest efficiency value of 88.89%. These results indicated that the four SSR markers developed in this study could be used for selection of maize germplasm with high seed storability.",
