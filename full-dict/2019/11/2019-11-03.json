    "abstract": "Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly prone to variation in copy numbers due to their repetitive and unstable nature, which makes them a major source of genomic variation between individuals. However, population variation of TRs have not been widely explored due to the limitations of existing tools, which are either low-throughput or restricted to a small subset of TRs. Here, we used SureSelect targeted sequencing approach combined with Nanopore sequencing to overcome these limitations. We achieved an average of 3062-fold target enrichment on a panel of 142 TR loci, generating an average of 97X sequence coverage on 7 samples utilizing 2 MinION flow-cells with 200ng of input DNA per sample. We identified a subset of 110 TR loci with length less than 2kb, and GC content greater than 25% for which we achieved an average genotyping rate of 75% and increasing to 91% for the highest-coverage sample. Alleles estimated from targeted long-read sequencing were concordant with gold standard PCR sizing analysis and moreover highly correlated with alleles estimated from whole genome long-read sequencing. We demonstrate a targeted long-read sequencing approach that enables simultaneous analysis of hundreds of TRs and accuracy is comparable to PCR sizing analysis. Our approach is feasible to scale for more targets and more samples facilitating large-scale analysis of TRs.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been used extensively to investigate the brain areas that are recruited during the Tower of London (ToL) task. Nevertheless, little research has been devoted to study the neural correlates of the ToL task using a network approach. Here we investigated the association between functional connectivity and network topology during resting-state fMRI and ToL task performance, that was performed outside the scanner. Sixty-two (62) healthy subjects (21-74 years) underwent eyes-closed rsfMRI and performed the task on a laptop. We studied global (whole-brain) and within subnetwork resting-state topology as well as functional connectivity between subnetworks, with a focus on the default-mode, fronto-parietal and dorsal and ventral attention networks. Efficiency and clustering coefficient were calculated to measure network integration and segregation, respectively, at both the global and subnetwork level. Our main finding was that higher global efficiency was associated with slower performance ({beta} = .22, Pbca = .04) and this association seemed mainly driven by inter-individual differences in default-mode network connectivity. The reported results were independent from age, sex, education-level and motion. Although this finding is contrary to earlier findings on general cognition, we tentatively hypothesize that the reported association may indicate that individuals with a more integrated brain during the resting-state are less able to further increase network efficiency when transitioning from a rest to task state, leading to slower responses. This study also adds to a growing body of literature supporting a central role for the default-mode network in individual differences in cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other lipids has been implicated in neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease, where the misfolding of membraneassociated -Synuclein is a key molecular event. Recent research also suggests that -Synuclein aggregation is influenced by the lipid environment. The exact molecular mechanisms responsible for cholesterols effect on -Synuclein binding to lipids and how this binding may affect -Synuclein oligomerization and fibrillation remain elusive, as does the relative importance of cholesterol versus other lipid factors. We probed the interactions and fibrillation behaviour of -Synuclein using SMA nanodiscs, containing zwitterionic and anionic lipid model systems with and without cholesterol. SPR and ThT fluorescence assays were then employed to monitor -Synuclein binding, as well as fibrillation in the absence and presence of membrane models. 1H-15N correlated NMR was used to monitor the fold of -Synuclein in response to nanodisc binding, and we determined individual residue apparent affinities for the nanodisc-contained bilayers. Cholesterol inhibited -Synuclein interaction with lipid bilayers. We also find that cholesterol significantly promotes -Synuclein fibrillation, with a more than 20-fold reduction of lag-times before fibrillation onset. When -Synuclein-bilayer interactions were analysed for individual residues by solution-state NMR, we observed two different effects of cholesterol. In nanodiscs made of DOPC, cholesterol modulated the NAC part of -Synuclein, leading to stronger interaction of this region with the lipid bilayer. In contrast, in the nanodiscs comprising DOPC, DOPE and DOPG, the NAC part was mostly unaffected by cholesterol, while the binding of the N-terminal and the C-terminal were both inhibited.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=194 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/725762v3_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (54K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c9c126org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7e026org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d1a9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eeda2d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "CAPRI Rounds 37 through 45 introduced larger complexes, new macromolecules, and multi-stage assemblies. For these rounds, we used and expanded docking methods in Rosetta to model 23 target complexes. We successfully predicted 14 target complexes and recognized and refined near-native models generated by other groups for two further targets. Notably, for targets T110 and T136, we achieved the closest prediction of any CAPRI participant. We created several innovative approaches during these rounds. Since Round 39 (target 122), we have used the new RosettaDock 4.0, which has a revamped coarse-grained energy function and the ability to perform conformer selection during docking with hundreds of pre-generated protein backbones. Ten of the complexes had some degree of symmetry in their interactions, so we tested Rosetta SymDock, realized its shortcomings, and developed the next-generation symmetric docking protocol, SymDock2, which includes docking of multiple backbones and induced-fit refinement. Since the last CAPRI assessment, we also developed methods for modeling and designing carbohydrates in Rosetta, and we used them to successfully model oligosaccharide-protein complexes in Round 41. While the results were broadly encouraging, they also highlighted the pressing need to invest in (1) flexible docking algorithms with the ability to model loop and linker motions and in (2) new sampling and scoring methods for oligosaccharide-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have wide applications in human genetics research. Notably, most PRS models include tuning parameters which improve predictive performance when properly selected. However, existing model-tuning methods require individual-level genetic data as the training dataset or as a validation dataset independent from both training and testing samples. These data rarely exist in practice, creating a significant gap between PRS methodology and applications. Here, we introduce PUMAS (Parameter-tuning Using Marginal Association Statistics), a novel method to fine-tune PRS models using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Through extensive simulations, external validations, and analysis of 65 traits, we demonstrate that PUMAS can perform a variety of model-tuning procedures (e.g. cross-validation) using GWAS summary statistics and can effectively benchmark and optimize PRS models under diverse genetic architecture. On average, PUMAS improves the predictive R2 by 205.6% and 62.5% compared to PRSs with arbitrary p-value cutoffs of 0.01 and 1, respectively. Applied to 211 neuroimaging traits and Alzheimers disease, we show that fine-tuned PRSs will significantly improve statistical power in downstream association analysis. We believe our method resolves a fundamental problem without a current solution and will greatly benefit genetic prediction applications.",

    "abstract": "Early research on orthologous protein sequence comparisons by Margoliash in 1963 discovered the astonishing phenomenon of genetic equidistance, which has inspired the ad hoc interpretation known as the molecular clock. Kimura then developed the neutral theory and claimed the molecular clock as its best evidence. However, subsequent studies over the years have largely invalidated the universal molecular clock. Yet, a watered down version of the molecular clock and the neutral theory still reigns as the default model for phylogenetic inferences. The seemingly obvious tenet of the molecular clock on evolutionary time scales remains to be established by using ancient sequences: the longer the time of evolutionary divergence, the larger the genetic distance. We here analyzed the recently published Early Pleistocene enamel proteome from Dmanisi and found that ancient proteins were not closer to an outgroup than their orthologs from the extant sister species were. Together with a previous study, the combined results showed that most ancient proteins were in fact more distant to the outgroup. The results are unexpected from the molecular clock but fully predicted by the notion that genetic distances or diversities are largely at optimum saturation levels as described by the maximum genetic diversity (MGD) theory.",

    "abstract": "Mutations resulting in amino acid substitution influence the stability of proteins along with their binding to other biomolecules. A molecular understanding of the effects induced by protein mutations are both of biotechnological and medical relevance. The availability of empirical free energy functions that quickly estimate the free energy change upon mutation ({Delta}{Delta}G) can be exploited for systematic screenings of proteins and protein complexes. Indeed, in silico saturation mutagenesis can guide the design of new experiments or rationalize the consequences of already-known mutations at the atomic level. Often software such as FoldX, while fast and reliable, lack the necessary automation features to make them useful in high-throughput scenarios. Here we introduce MutateX, a software which aims to automate the prediction of {Delta}{Delta}Gs associated with the systematic mutation of each available residue within a protein or protein complex to all other possible residue types, by employing the FoldX energy function. MutateX also supports {Delta}{Delta}G calculations over protein ensembles and the estimation of the changes in free energy upon post-translational modifications. At the heart of MutateX lies an automated pipeline engine that handles input preparation, performs parallel runs with FoldX and outputs publication-ready figures. We here illustrate the MutateX protocol applied to the study of the mutational landscape of cancer-related proteins, industrial enzymes and protein-protein interfaces. The results of the high-throughput scan provided by our tools could help in different applications, such as the analysis of disease-associated mutations, or in the design of protein variants for experimental studies or industrial applications. MutateX is a collection of Python tools that relies on Open Source libraries and requires the FoldX software to be installed beforehand.

    "abstract": "Full differentiation potential along with self-renewal capacity is a major property of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). However, the differentiation capacity frequently decreases during expansion of PSCs in vitro. We show here that transient exposure to a single microRNA, expressed at early stages during normal development, improves the differentiation capacity of already-established murine and human PSCs. Short exposure to miR-203 in PSCs (miPSCs) results in expanded differentiation potency as well as improved efficiency in stringent assays such as tetraploid complementation and human-mouse interspecies chimerism. Mechanistically, these effects are mediated by direct repression of de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, leading to transient and reversible erasing of DNA methylation. As a proof of concept, miR-203 improves differentiation and maturation of PSCs into cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as cardiac regeneration in vivo, after cardiac injury. These data support the use of transient exposure to miR-203 as a general and single method to reset the epigenetic memory in PSCs, and improve their use in regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial resistance against antibiotics often involves multiple mechanisms that are interconnected to ensure robust protection. So far, the knowledge about underlying regulatory features of those resistance networks is sparse, since they can hardly be determined by experimentation alone. Here, we present the first computational approach to elucidate the interplay between multiple resistance modules against a single antibiotic, and how regulatory network structure allows the cell to respond to and compensate for perturbations of resistance. Based on the response of B. subtilis towards the cell wall synthesis-inhibiting antibiotic bacitracin, we developed a mathematical model that comprehensively describes the protective effect of two well-studied resistance modules (BceAB and BcrC) on the progression of the lipid II cycle. By integrating experimental measurements of expression levels, the model accurately predicts the efficacy of bacitracin against the B. subtilis wild-type as well as mutant strains lacking one or both of the resistance modules. Our study reveals that bacitracin-induced changes in the properties of the lipid II cycle itself control the interplay between the two resistance modules. In particular, variations in the concentrations of UPP, the lipid II cycle intermediate that is targeted by bacitracin, connect the effect of the BceAB transporter and the homeostatic response via BcrC to an overall resistance response. We propose that monitoring changes in pathway properties caused by a stressor allows the cell to fine-tune deployment of multiple resistance systems and may serve as a cost-beneficial strategy to control the overall response towards this stressor.\\n\\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance poses a major threat to global health and systematic studies to understand the underlying resistance mechanisms are urgently needed. Although significant progress has been made in deciphering the mechanistic basis of individual resistance determinants, many bacterial species rely on the induction of a whole battery of resistance modules, and the complex regulatory networks controlling these modules in response to antibiotic stress are often poorly understood. In this work we combine experiments and theoretical modelling to decipher the resistance network of Bacillus subtilis against bacitracin, which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. In response to bacitracin stress we find a high level of cross-regulation between the two major resistance modules and quantify their effects on bacterial resistance. To rationalize our experimental data, we expand a previously established computational model for the lipid II cycle through incorporating the quantitative action of the resistance modules. This leads us to a systems-level description of the bacitracin stress response network that captures the complex interplay between resistance modules and the essential lipid II cycle of cell wall biosynthesis and accurately predicts the minimal inhibitory bacitracin concentration in all the studied mutants. With this, our study highlights how bacterial resistance emerges from an interlaced network of redundant homeostasis and stress response modules.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe HERV-K (HML-2) viruses are the youngest of the human endogenous retroviruses. They are present as several almost complete proviral copies and numerous fragments in the human genome. Many HERV-K proviruses express a regulatory protein Rec, which binds to an element present in HERV-K mRNAs called the RcRE. This interaction is necessary for the nucleo-cytoplasmic export and expression of HERV-K mRNAs that retain introns and plays a role analogous to that of Rev and the RRE in HIV replication. There are over 900 HERV-K RcREs distributed throughout the human genome. Thus, it was of interest to determine if Rev could functionally interact with selected RcRE elements that map either to HERV-K proviruses or human gene regions. This interaction would have the potential to alter the expression of both HERV-K mRNAs and cellular mRNAs during HIV-1 infection.\n\nResultsIn this study we employed a combination of RNAseq, bioinformatics and cell-based functional assays. Potential RcREs were identified through a number of bioinformatic approaches. They were then tested for their ability to promote export and translation of a reporter mRNA with a retained intron in conjunction with Rev or Rec. Some of the selected elements functioned well with either Rev, Rec or both, whereas some showed little or no function. Rev function on individual RcREs varied and was also dependent on the Rev sequence. We also performed RNAseq on total and cytoplasmic RNA isolated from SupT1 cells expressing HIV Rev, with or without Tat, or HERV-K Rec. Proviral mRNA from three HERV-K loci (4p16.1b, 22q11.23 and most significantly 3q12.3) accumulated in the cytoplasm in the presence of Rev or Tat and Rev, but not Rec. Consistent with this, the 3 RcRE from 3q12.3 functioned well with HIV-Rev in our reporter assay. In contrast, this RcRE showed little or no function with Rec.\n\nConclusionsThe HIV Rev protein can functionally interact with many RcREs present in the human genome, depending on the RcRE sequence, as well as the Rev sequence. This leads to export of some of the HERV-K proviral mRNAs and also has the potential to change the expression of non-viral genes.",

To date, methods exploring the molecular state of actin are limited to insights gained from structural approaches, providing a snapshot of protein folding, or methods that require chemical modifications compromising actin monomer thermostability. Nanopore sensing permits label-free investigation of native proteins and is ideally suited to study proteins such as actin that require specialised buffers and cofactors. Using nanopores we determined the state of actin at the macromolecular level (filamentous or globular) and in its monomeric form bound to inhibitors. We revealed urea-dependent and voltage-dependent transitional states and observed unfolding process within which sub-populations of transient actin oligomers are visible. We detected, in real-time, drug-binding and filament-growth events at the single-molecule level. This enabled us to calculate binding stoichiometries and to propose a model for protein dynamics using unmodified, native actin molecules, demostrating the promise of nanopores sensing for in-depth understanding of protein folding landscapes and for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Early response to antipsychotic medications is one of the most important determinants of later symptomatic and functional outcomes in psychosis. Glutathione and glutamate have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for patients demonstrating inadequate response to dopamine-blocking antipsychotics. Nevertheless, the role of these neurochemicals in the mechanism of early antipsychotic response remains poorly understood. Using a longitudinal design and ultra-high field 7-Tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol in 53 subjects, we report the association between dorsal anterior cingulate cortex glutamate and glutathione, with time to treatment response in drug-naive (34.6% of the sample) or minimally medicated first episode patients with non-affective psychosis. Time to response was defined as the number of weeks required to reach a 50% reduction in the PANSS-8 scores. Higher glutathione was associated with shorter time to response (F=4.86, P= .017), while higher glutamate was associated with more severe functional impairment (F=5.33, P= .008). There were no significant differences between patients and controls on measures of glutamate or glutathione. For the first time, we have demonstrated an association between higher glutathione and favourable prognosis in FEP. We propose that interventions that increase brain glutathione levels may improve outcomes of early intervention in psychosis.",
