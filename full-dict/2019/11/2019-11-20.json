    "abstract": "Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted lysophospholipase D catalyzing the extracellular production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a growth factor-like signaling lysophospholipid. ATX and LPA signaling have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of different chronic inflammatory diseases and various types of cancer. In this report, deregulated ATX and LPA levels were detected in the spinal cord and plasma of mice during the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Among the different sources of ATX expression in the inflamed spinal cord, F4/80+CD11b+ cells, mostly activated macrophages and microglia, were found to express ATX, further suggesting an autocrine role for ATX/LPA in their activation, an EAE hallmark. Accordingly, ATX genetic deletion from CD11b+ cells attenuated the severity of EAE, thus proposing a pathogenic role for the ATX/LPA axis in neuroinflammatory disorders.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial virulence may rely on secondary metabolism, but core metabolism genes are assumed to be necessary primarily for bacterial growth. To assess this assumption, we correlated the genome, the transcriptome and the pathogenicity of 30 fully sequenced Pseudomonas strains using two Drosophila and one mouse infection assay. In accordance with previous studies gene presence-absence does not explain differences in virulence among P. aeruginosa strains, but merely between P. aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species. Similarly, classical gene expression analysis of highly vs. lowly pathogenic P. aeruginosa strains identifies many virulence factors, and only a few metabolism genes related to virulence. Nevertheless, assessing the virulence of 553 core metabolic and 95 random non-metabolic gene mutants of P. aeruginosa PA14, we found 16.5% of the core metabolic and 8.5% of the non-metabolic genes to be necessary for full virulence. Strikingly, 11.8% of the core metabolism genes exhibit defects in virulence that cannot be attributed to auxotrophy. The compromised in virulence metabolic gene mutants were mapped in multiple pathways and exhibited further defects in acute virulence phenotypes and in a mouse lung infection model. Functional transcriptomics re-analysis of core metabolism at the pathway level, reveals amino-acid, succinate, citramalate, and chorismate biosynthesis and beta-oxidation as important for full virulence and expression of these pathways indicative of virulence in various strains. Thus, P. aeruginosa virulence variation, which to this point remains unpredictably combinatorial at the gene level, can be dissected at the pathway level via combinatorial trancriptome and functional core metabolism analysis.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic virus that can cause neuropathy in adults and fetal neurologic malformation following infection of pregnant women. We used a nonhuman primate model, the Indian-origin Rhesus macaque (IRM), to gain insight into virus-associated hallmarks of ZIKV-induced adult neuropathy. We find that the virus causes prevalent acute and chronic neuroinflammation and chronic disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in adult animals. Infection results in significant, targeted, and sustained upregulation of the chemokine, CXCL12, in the central nervous system (CNS). CXCL12 plays a key role both in regulating lymphocyte trafficking through the BBB to the CNS, and in mediating repair of damaged neural tissue including remyelination. Understanding how CXCL12 expression is controlled will likely be of central importance in the definition of ZIKV-associated neuropathy in adults.\n\nAuthor summaryZika virus (ZIKV) is a virus that can cause neurological problems in adults and damage to the fetal brain. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are usually superior animal models for recapitulating human neurological disease because their brain, nervous system structure and immune response to virus infection are very similar to that of humans. We have studied the effect of ZIKV infection on the adult NHP brain and made several significant observations. Infection resulted in a high incidence of mild to moderate brain inflammation that persisted for a surprisingly long period of time. We also found that the virus disrupted the blood brain barrier, which is important for controlling transport of material from blood to the brain. It appears that the central nervous system expresses a specific substance in response to virus infection called a chemokine. This specific chemokine may be involved in virus-induced inflammation and/or in repair of virus-induced brain damage. Our data are significant since they help in understanding the mechanism of brain damage caused by ZIKV in adults.",

    "abstract": "Cyniclomyces guttulatus is a common inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract in rabbits, and large numbers are often present in feces of diarrheic rabbits. However, its relation with rabbit diarrhea has not been clearly identified. We isolated a C. guttulatus Zhejiang strain from a rabbit with severe diarrhea and optimized the culture conditions in YPG medium. The sequenced 18S and 26S ribosomal DNA fragments were 1559bp and 632bp, respectively, and showed 99.8% homology with the 18S ribosomal sequence of the NRRL Y-17561 isolate from the dog and 100% homology with the 26S ribosomal sequence of the DPA-CGR1 and CGDPA-GP1 isolates from the rabbit and guinea pig. Our isolate was not pathogenic to healthy SPF rabbits. Instead, rabbits inoculated with the yeast had a slightly better body weight gain and higher food intake. Rabbits co-inoculated with C. guttulatus and the coccidian, E. intestinalis developed more severe coccidiosis as shown by clinical signs, and decreased body weight gain, diarrhea and death, associated with significantly higher fecal output of C. guttulatus vegetative cells but lower coccidian oocysts output than the rabbits inoculated with C. guttulatus or E. intestinalis alone. We also surveyed the prevalence of C. guttulatus in rabbits and found a positive rate of 83% in Zhejiang province. Our results indicate that C. guttulatus alone is not pathogenic to healthy rabbits, but could become an opportunistic pathogen when the digestive tract is damaged by other pathogens such as coccidia.\n\nAuthor summaryCyniclomyces guttulatus, a commensal yeast in rabbit gastrointestinal tract, is very commonly seen in diarrhea cases. However, it is unclear whether it causes or is a co-cause of diarrhea with other pathogens. Here, a C. guttulatus Zhejiang strain was firstly isolated from a rabbit with severe diarrhea and the culture conditions in YPG medium were optimized. Then, it was identified in morphology and molecular. It was agreed with the previous description in morphology and showed a closer phylogenetic relationship with other strains originated from herbivores than those from the carnivore. Finally, the C. guttulatus Zhejiang strain was inoculated to SPF rabbits singly or co-inoculated with Eimeria intestinalis. All of the results in animal assays show C. guttulatus alone is not pathogenic but seems a probiotic microorganism in rabbits. However, it could become an opportunistic pathogen when the digestive tract is damaged by other pathogens such as coccidia.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a major public health problem among with aging population worldwide. It causes cardiac remodeling, including hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, which leads to development of hypertensive heart disease (HHD). Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) is associated with fibrogenesis in multiple organs, its impact on hypertrophic cardiac remodeling in hypertension is not known. Circulating miR-21 level was higher in patients with HHD than that in the control subjects. It also positively correlated with serum myocardial fibrotic markers. MiR-21 expression levels were significantly upregulated in the mice hearts after angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) compared with control mice. Expression level of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a main target of miR-21, was significantly decreased in Ang II infused mice and TAC mice compared with control mice. Expression levels of transcriptional activator protein 1 (AP-1) and transforming growth factor-{beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1), which were downstream targets of PDCD4, were increased in Ang II infused mice and TAC mice compared with control mice. In vitro, mirVana-miR-21-specific inhibitor attenuated Ang II-induced PDCD4 downregulation and contributed to subsequent deactivation of AP-1/TGF-{beta}1 signaling pathway in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Thus, suppression of miR-21 prevents hypertrophic cardiac remodeling by regulating PDCD4, AP-1, and TGF-{beta}1 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive lung disease with poor prognosis due to the consequent right heart ventricular failure. Pulmonary artery remodeling and dysfunction are culprits for pathologically increased pulmonary arterial pressure, but their underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Previous genome-wide association studies revealed a significant correlation between the genetic locus of family with sequence similarity 13, member A (FAM13A) and various lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis; however whether FAM13A is also involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension remained unknown. Here, we identified a significant role of FAM13A in the development of pulmonary hypertension. FAM13A expression was reduced in mouse lungs of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension model. We identified that FAM13A was expressed in lung vasculatures, especially in endothelial cells. Genetic loss of FAM13A exacerbated pulmonary hypertension in mice exposed to chronic hypoxia in association with deteriorated pulmonary artery remodeling. Mechanistically, FAM13A decelerated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition potentially by inhibiting {beta}-catenin signaling in pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Our data revealed a protective role of FAM13A in the development of pulmonary hypertension, and therefore increasing and/or preserving FAM13A expression in pulmonary artery endothelial cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Children with movement impairments needing assistive devices for activities of daily living often require novel methods for controlling these devices. Body-machine interfaces, which rely on body movements, are particularly well-suited for children as they are non-invasive and have high signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we examined the use of a head-joystick to enable a child with congenital absence of all four limbs to control a seven degree-of-freedom robotic arm. Head movements were measured with a wireless inertial measurement unit and used to control a robotic arm to perform two functional tasks - a drinking task and a block stacking task. The child practiced these tasks over multiple sessions; a control participant performed the same tasks with a manual joystick. Our results showed that the child was able to successfully perform both tasks, with movement times decreasing by ~40-50% over 6-8 sessions of training. The childs performance with the head-joystick was also comparable to the control participant using a manual joystick. These results demonstrate the potential of using head movements for the control of high degree-of-freedom tasks in children with limited movement repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Despite the best weed control efforts, weed escapes are often present in large production fields prior to harvest, contributing to seed rain and species persistence. Late-season surveys were conducted in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields in Texas in 2016 and 2017 to identify common weed species present as escapes and estimate seed rain potential of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) and waterhemp [A. tuberculatus (Moq.) J.D. Sauer], two troublesome weed species with high fecundity. A total of 400 cotton fields across four major cotton-producing regions in Texas [High Plains (HP), Gulf Coast (GC), Central Texas, and Blacklands] were surveyed. Results have revealed that A. palmeri, Texas millet [Urochloa texana (Buckley) R. Webster], A. tuberculatus, ragweed parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.), and barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] were the top five weed escapes present in cotton fields. Amaranthus palmeri was the most prevalent weed in the HP and Lower GC regions, whereas A. tuberculatus escapes were predominantly observed in the Upper GC and Blacklands regions. On average, 9.4% of an individual field was infested with A. palmeri escapes in the Lower GC region; however, it ranged between 5.1 and 8.1% in the HP region. Average A. palmeri density ranged from 405 (Central Texas) to 3,543 plants ha-1 (Lower GC). The greatest seed rain potential by A. palmeri escapes was observed in the upper HP region (13.9 million seeds ha-1), whereas the seed rain potential of A. tuberculatus escapes was the greatest in the Blacklands (12.9 million seeds ha-1) and the upper GC regions (9.8 million seeds ha-1). Results indicated that seed rain from late-season A. palmeri and A. tuberculatus escapes are significant in Texas cotton, and effective management of these escapes is imperative for minimizing seedbank inputs and impacting species persistence.",

    "abstract": "Agrochemicals are an important component of agricultural production systems. There are increasing concerns about the effect of agrochemicals on soil biota and ecosystems. We evaluated the short-term, acute effects of commonly used herbicides and household chemicals on earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L.). The experiment was conducted on 19 Feb. 2018 (Exp. 1) and repeated on 27 Jun. 2018 (Exp. 2). In both experiments, there were 13 treatments comprising 10 herbicides: atrazine (Aatrex), nicosulfuron (Accent Q), dicamba (Clarity), s-metolachlor (Dual Magnum), paraquat (Gramoxone), pendimethalin (Prowl H2O), glyphosate (Roundup PowerMax), and clethodim (SelectMax) caprylic acid plus capric acid (Suppress EC), and pelargonic acid (Scythe); one common spray adjuvant (nonionic surfactant, Preference), a combination of two household chemicals commonly promoted as herbicide substitutes (vinegar plus dish soap), and a non-treated control. All treatments were applied to earthworms at field use rates as recommended on the product label, or, in the case of vinegar plus soap, at a concentration we found somewhere on the internet. Treatments were arranged in a completely randomized design with 10 replicates. Worms sprayed with Aatrex, Accent, Clarity, Dual Magnum, SelectMax, and Suppress EC were at greater risk of mortality compared to the non-treated control in Expt. 1, but in Expt. 2, chemical treatments did not increase the risk of worm mortality. Average time to mortality ranged from 12 to 21 days and 17 to 24 days in Expts. 1 and 2, respectively. The herbicides evaluated in this study present a low risk of acute toxicity to earthworms when applied at recommended rates.",
