    "abstract": "O_LISpecies traits mediate ecological interaction outcomes and community structure. It is important, therefore, to identify the minimum number of traits required to characterise observed networks, i.e. the  minimum dimensionality. Existing methods for estimating minimum dimensionality often lack three features commonly associated with a higher numbers of traits: a mechanistic description of observed interactions, alternative interaction modes (e.g. different feeding strategies such as active vs sit-and-wait feeding), and trait-mediated  forbidden links. Omitting these features can lead to underestimation of the trait numbers involved, and therefore, minimum dimensionality. Here, we develop a  minimum mechanistic dimensionality measure, accounting for these three features.\nC_LIO_LIThe only input required by our method is the observed network of interaction outcomes. We then assume how traits are mechanistically involved in alternative interaction modes. These unidentified traits are contrasted using pairwise performance inequalities between the interacting species. E.g. if a predator feeds upon a prey species via a typical predation mode, in each step of the predation sequence the predators performance must be greater than the preys. We construct a system of inequalities from all observed outcomes, which we attempt to solve with mixed integer linear programming. The minimum number of traits required for a feasible system of inequalities provides our dimensionality estimate.\nC_LIO_LIWe applied our method to 658 published empirical ecological networks including animal dominance, predator-prey, primary consumption, pollination, parasitism and seed dispersal networks, to compare with minimum dimensionality estimates when the three focal features are missing. Minimum dimensionality was typically higher when including alternative interaction modes (54% of empirical networks),  forbidden interactions as trait-mediated interaction outcomes (92%), or a mechanistic perspective (81%), compared to network dimensionality estimates missing these features.\nC_LIO_LIOur method can reduce the risk of omitting essential traits that are involved mechanistically, in different interaction modes, or in failure outcomes. More accurate estimates will allow us to parameterise models to generate theoretical networks with a more realistic structure at the interaction outcome level. Thus, we hope our method can improve predictions of community structure and structure-dependent dynamics.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sleep slow waves are known to participate in memory consolidation, yet slow waves occurring under anesthesia present no positive effects on memory. Here, we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of extracellular recordings in vivo, in vitro, and computational models. We find two types of slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive slow-wave events. The first type is consistently observed in natural slow-wave sleep, while the second is shown to be ubiquitous under anesthesia. Network models of spiking neurons predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different gain on inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of spike-frequency adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical distinctions between the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by varying adaptation strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which demonstrated a neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves. Finally, we show that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to external stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.",

Functional deficiencies in Factor IX result in the bleeding disorder haemophilia B, which is treated with plasma-derived or recombinant Factor IX concentrates. Here, we investigated the post-translational modifications of human serum-derived Factor IX and report previously undescribed O-linked monosaccharide compositions at serine 141 and a novel site of glycosylation. At serine 141 we observed two monosaccharide compositions, with HexNAc1Hex1NeuAc2 dominant and a low level of HexNAc1Hex1NeuAc1. This O-linked site lies N-terminal to the first cleavage site for the activation peptide, an important region of the protein that is removed to activate Factor IX. The novel site is an N-linked site in the serine protease domain with low occupancy in a non-canonical consensus motif at asparagine 258, observed with a HexNAc4Hex5NeuAc2 monosaccharide composition attached. This is the first reported instance of a site of modification in the serine protease domain. The description of these glycosylation events provides a basis for future functional studies and contributes to structural characterisation of native Factor IX for the production of effective therapeutic biosimilars and biobetters.",

This process plays a crucial role in organ development and repair, in wound healing and in numerous pathological processes such as cancer progression or diabetes. Here, we present a mathematical model of early stage angiogenesis that permits exploration of the relative importance of mechanical, chemical and cellular cues. Endothelial cells proliferate and move over an extracellular matrix by following external gradients of Vessel Endothelial Growth Factor, adhesion and stiffness, which are incorporated to a Cellular Potts model with a finite element description of elasticity. The dynamics of Notch signaling involving Delta-4 and Jagged-1 ligands determines tip cell selection and vessel branching. Through their production rates, competing Jagged-Notch and Delta-Notch dynamics determine the influence of lateral inhibition and lateral induction on the selection of cellular phenotypes, branching of blood vessels, anastomosis (fusion of blood vessels) and angiogenesis velocity. Anastomosis may be favored or impeded depending on the mechanical configuration of strain vectors in the ECM near tip cells. Numerical simulations demonstrate that increasing Jagged production results in pathological vasculatures with thinner and more abundant vessels, which can be compensated by augmenting the production of Delta ligands.\n\nAuthor SummaryAngiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels grow from existing ones. This process plays a crucial role in organ development, in wound healing and in numerous pathological processes such as cancer growth or in diabetes. Angiogenesis is a complex, multi-step and well regulated process where biochemistry and physics are intertwined. The process entails signaling in vessel cells being driven by both chemical and mechanical mechanisms that result in vascular cell movement, deformation and proliferation. Mathematical models have the ability to bring together these mechanisms in order to explore their relative relevance in vessel growth. Here, we present a mathematical model of early stage angiogenesis that is able to explore the role of biochemical signaling and tissue mechanics. We use this model to unravel the regulating role of Jagged, Notch and Delta dynamics in vascular cells. These membrane proteins have an important part in determining the leading cell in each neo-vascular sprout. Numerical simulations demonstrate that increasing Jagged production results in pathological vasculatures with thinner and more abundant vessels, which can be compensated by augmenting the production of Delta ligands.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConsistent with their assumed mechanism of action, PARP inhibitors show significant therapeutic efficacy in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer, which are the solid tumor types most often associated with the loss of function of key homologous recombination genes. It remains unknown, however, how frequent homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is in other solid tumor types. Since it is well established, that HRD induces specific DNA aberration profiles and genomic scars that can be captured by various next-generation sequencing (NGS) based biomarkers, it is possible to assess the presence or absence of this DNA repair pathway aberration in any given tumor biopsy.\n\nMethodsWe derived the various HRD associated mutational signatures from whole genome and whole exome sequencing data in the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) cases from TCGA, in a patient of ours with stage IVA lung cancer with exceptionally good response to platinum-based therapy and in lung cancer cell lines.\n\nResultsWe have found evidence that a subset of the investigated cases shows robust signs of HR deficiency, some of which exhibiting similar patterns to those with a complete loss of function of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, however, without any signs of genetic alterations being present in either of those genes. The extreme platinum responder case also showed a robust HRD associated genomic mutational profile. HRD associated mutational signatures were also associated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity in lung cancer cell lines.\n\nConclusionsLung cancer cases with high levels of HRD associated mutational signatures could be candidates for PARP inhibitor treatment, and in general, the prioritization of patients for clinical trials might be achieved using the combined analysis of the HRD-related next-generation sequencing-based mutational signatures.",

    "abstract": "Pirate phages use the structural proteins encoded by unrelated helper phages to propagate. The best-studied example is the pirate P4 and helper P2 of coliphages, and it has been known that the Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) that can encode virulence factors act as pirate phages, too. When alone in the host, the pirate phages act as a prophage, but when the helper phage gene is also in the same host cell, the pirate phage has ability to exploit the helper phages structural proteins to produce pirate phage particles and spread, interfering with the helper phage production. The known helper phages in these systems are temperate phages. Interestingly, the interference of the pirate phage to the helper phage occurs in a different manner between the SaPI-helper system and the P4-P2 system. SaPIs cannot lyse a helper lysogen upon infection, while when a helper phage lyse a SaPI lysogen, most of the phage particles produced are the SaPI particles. On the contrary, in the P4-P2 system, a pirate phage P4 can lyse a helper P2 lysogen to produce mostly the P4 particles, while when P2 phage lyses a P4 lysogen, most of the produced phages are the P2 particles. Here, the consequences of these different strategies in the pirate and helper phage spreading among uninfected host is analyzed by using mathematical models. It is found that SaPIs strategy interferes with the helper phage spreading significantly more than the P4s strategy, because SaPI interferes with the helper phages main reproduction step, while P4 interferes only by forcing the helper lysogens to lyse. However, the interference is found to be weaker in the spatially structured environment than in the well-mixed environment. This is because, in the spatial setting, the system tends to self-organize so that the helper phages take over the front of propagation due to the need of helper phage for the pirate phage spreading.\n\nCompeting interestsThe author declares no competing interest.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLocal phosphatase regulation is critical for determining when phosphorylation signals are activated or deactivated. A typical example is the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis, which regulates kinetochore PP1 and PP2A-B56 activities to switch-off signalling events at the correct time. In this case, kinetochore phosphatase activation dephosphorylates MELT motifs on KNL1 to remove SAC proteins, including the BUB complex. We show here that, surprisingly, neither PP1 or PP2A are required to dephosphorylate the MELT motifs. Instead, they remove polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) from the BUB complex, which can otherwise maintain MELT phosphorylation in an autocatalytic manner. This is their principle role in the SAC, because both phosphatases become redundant if PLK1 is inhibited or BUB-PLK1 interaction is prevented. Therefore, phosphatase regulation is critical for the SAC, but primarily to restrain and extinguish autonomous kinase activity. We propose that these circuits have evolved to generate a semi-autonomous SAC signal that can be synchronously silenced following kinetochore-microtubule tension.",

    "abstract": "FtsZ, a highly conserved bacterial tubulin GTPase homolog, is a central component of the cell division machinery in nearly all walled bacteria. FtsZ polymerizes at the future division site and recruits greater than 30 proteins to assemble into a macromolecular complex termed the divisome. Many of these divisome proteins are involved in septal cell wall peptidoglycan (sPG) synthesis. Recent studies found that FtsZ polymers undergo GTP hydrolysis-coupled treadmilling dynamics along the circumference the division site, driving the processive movement of sPG synthesis enzymes. How FtsZs treadmilling drives the directional transport of sPG enzymes and what its precise role is in bacterial cell division are unknown. Combining theoretical modeling and experimental testing, we show that FtsZs treadmilling drives the directional movement of sPG-synthesis enzymes via a Brownian ratchet mechanism, where the shrinking end of FtsZ polymers introduces an asymmetry to rectify diffusions of single sPG enzymes into persistent end-tracking movement. Furthermore, we show that the processivity of this directional movement is dependent on the binding potential between FtsZ and the enzyme, and hinges on the balance between the enzymes diffusion and FtsZs treadmilling speed. This interplay could provide a mechanism to control the level of available enzymes for active sPG synthesis both in time and space, explaining the distinct roles of FtsZ treadmilling in modulating cell wall constriction rate observed in different bacterial species.",

In vitro experiments confirmed that these alterations conferred CDK4/6i resistance. Cancer cells cultured to resistance with CDK4/6i also acquired RB1, KRAS, AURKA, or CCNE2 alterations, which conferred sensitivity to AURKA, ERK, or CHEK1 inhibition.

    "abstract": "One of the most intriguing features of biological systems is their ability to regulate the steady-state fluxes of the underlying biochemical reactions, however the regulatory mechanisms and their physicochemical properties are not fully understood. Fundamentally, flux regulation can be explained with a chemical kinetic formalism describing the transitions between discrete states with the reaction rates defined by an underlying free-energy landscape. Which features of the energy landscape affect the flux distribution? Here we prove that the ratios of the steady-state fluxes of quasi-first-order biochemical processes are invariant to energy perturbations of the discrete states and are only affected by the energy barriers. In other words, the non-equilibrium flux distribution is under kinetic and not thermodynamic control. We illustrate the generality of this result for three biological processes. For the network describing protein folding along competing pathways, the probabilities of proceeding via these pathways are shown to be invariant to the stability of the intermediates or to the presence of additional misfolded states. For the network describing protein synthesis, the error rate and the energy expenditure per peptide bond is proven to be independent of the stability of the intermediate states. For molecular motors such as myosin-V, the ratio of forward to backward steps and the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed per step is demonstrated to be invariant to energy perturbations of the intermediate states. These findings place important constraints on the ability of mutations and drug perturbations to affect the steady-state flux distribution for a wide class of biological processes.",

For a set of 51 mutants, we found that T50 and TM are moderately correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.58, indicated the two methods capture different physical features. The performance of predicted stability using five computational tools are also evaluated on the 51 mutants dataset, none of which are found to be strong predictors of the observed changes in T50, TM, or {Delta}{Delta}G. Furthermore, the ability of the five algorithms to predict the production of isolatable soluble protein is examined, which revealed that Rosetta {Delta}{Delta}G, ELASPIC, and DeepDDG are capable of predicting if a mutant could be produced and isolated as a soluble protein. These results further highlight the need for new algorithms for predicting modest, yet important, changes in thermal stability as well as a new utility for current algorithms for prescreening designs for the production of soluble mutants.",

    "abstract": "DNA is emerging as a novel material for digital data storage. The two main challenges are efficient encoding and data security. Here, we develop an approach that allows for writing and erasing data by relying solely on Watson-Crick base pairing of short oligonucleotides to single-stranded DNA overhangs located along a long double-stranded DNA hard drive (DNA-HD). Our enzyme-free system enables fast synthesis-free data writing with predetermined building blocks. The use of DNA base pairing allows for secure encryption on DNA-HDs that requires a physical key and nanopore sensing for decoding. The system is suitable for miniature integration for an end-to-end DNA storage device. Our study opens a novel pathway for rewritable and secure data storage with DNA.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryStoring digital information on molecules along DNA hard drives for rewritable and secure data storage.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate DNA crosslink repair is a crucial process that excises toxic replication-blocking DNA interstrand crosslinks1. This pathway fails in the inherited human disease Fanconi anemia (FA), resulting in abnormal development, loss of blood production, and marked cancer susceptibility2. Numerous factors involved in crosslink repair have been identified, and mutations in their corresponding genes cause FA3. A biochemical description of how FA gene products might initiate the removal of DNA crosslinks is now emerging. However, structural insight into this vital process has been limited. Here, we use electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to determine the structure of a key DNA crosslink repair factor - FANCD2 heterodimerized with FANCI (D2-I). Recombinant chicken D2-I adopts a conformation that is in agreement with the structure of its murine counter-part4. In contrast, the activated monoubiquitinated form of D2-I (ubD2-I) adopts an alternative closed conformation, creating a channel that encloses double-stranded DNA. Ubiquitin is positioned at the interface of FANCD2 and FANCI, and acts as a molecular pin to trap ubD2-I in the closed conformation, clamped on DNA. The new solvent-exposed interface around the monoubiquitination site is likely a platform for recruitment of other DNA repair factors. We also find that isolated FANCD2 is a dimer, but it adopts a closed conformation that is unable to bind DNA. When incubated with free FANCI, the FANCD2 homodimer exchanges to D2-I, acquiring DNA binding properties. This suggests an autoinhibitory mechanism that prevents FANCD2 activation on DNA until after assembly with FANCI. Together, our cryoEM and biochemical analysis suggests that D2-I is a clamp that is locked onto DNA by ubiquitin, and provides unanticipated new insight into the regulation and the initiation of DNA cross-link repair.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of gut microbiota in liver disease has been addressed in the context of the \"leaky gut hypothesis\" postulating that dysbiosis allow microbial components to elicit liver inflammatory responses and hepatic tissue damage. Conversely, commensal gut microbiota acting on innate immune receptors protect against hepatotoxic insults. Given that mice deficient for the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (Trem-2) show increased vulnerability to experimental drug-induced hepatic damage we explored the possibility that Trem-2 is a modulator of gut microbiota composition.\n\nWe found that microbiota composition in untreated Trem-2 KO mice differs from the wild-type showing overall decrease in microbiota diversity and increased representation of Verrucomicrobia. Interestingly, induction of liver damage with hepatotoxic drugs blunted this microbiota diversity difference and altered phyla composition with increased representation of Verrucomicrobia during acute hepatic injury and Proteobacteria during chronic challenge. Furthermore, co-housing experiments that homogenized microbiota diversity showed that the increased liver tissue vulnerability to hepatotoxic insults in Trem-2 KO mice was not dependent on microbiota composition. This work uncouples Trem-2 dependent alterations in gut commensal microbiota from Trem-2 pro-recovery effects in the damaged liver tissue. These findings support the possibility that unlinked actions of innate immune receptors contribute to disease association with microbiota alterations, particularly with the Verrucomicrobia phylum.\n\nImportanceTrem-2 is a mammalian innate immunity receptor involved in development and resolution of tissue damage, namely in the brain and in the liver. Nevertheless, it is not known whether gut microbiota is contributing to these Trem-2 mediated phenotypes. We found that Trem-2 KO mice spontaneously display different gut microbiota composition as compared to wild-type mice, namely with increased abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia. Notably these differences do not impact the control of Trem-2 on liver tissue vulnerability to hepatotoxic insults. This work uncouples Trem-2 modulation of gut microbiota and the role of Trem-2 on responses to liver damage. This work brings new insights on role of innate immune receptors on the association of organic and systemic diseases with gut microbiota.",

Viral receptor utilization is a major determinant of cell tropism, host range, and pathogenesis. The bona fide receptor for HNoV is unknown. Recently, we identified CD300lf as a proteinaceous receptor for MNoV. Interestingly, its paralogue CD300ld was also sufficient for MNoV infection in vitro. Here we explored whether CD300lf is the sole physiologic receptor in vivo and whether HNoV can use a CD300 ortholog as an entry receptor.

However, the roles of SOX2 in SCLC remain unclear, and strategies to selectively target SOX2 in SCLC cells have not yet been established. We herein demonstrated that SOX2 is involved in NE differentiation and tumorigenesis in cooperation with ASCL1, a lineage-specific transcriptional factor, in the classical subtype of SCLC cell lines. ASCL1 recruits SOX2, which promotes INSM1 expression. Precursor SCLC lesions were established in Trp53 (-/-); CCSPrtTA; tetOCre; floxedRb1; floxedHes1 mice, and the NE neoplasms induced were positive for Ascl1, Sox2, and Insm1. In contrast to the ASCL1-SOX2 signaling axis to control the SCLC phenotype in classical subtype SCLC, SOX2 targeted distinct genes, such as those related to the Hippo pathway, in ASCL1-negative, variant subtype SCLC. The present results support the importance of the ASCL1-SOX2 axis as a main subtype of SCLC, and suggest the therapeutic potential of targeting the ASCL1-SOX2 signaling axis and the clinical utility of SOX2 as a biological marker in the classical subtype of SCLC.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAFV600E mutant melanomas remains a major obstacle that limits patient benefit. Microenvironment components including the extracellular matrix (ECM) can support tumor cell adaptation and tolerance to targeted therapies, however the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the process of matrix-mediated drug resistance (MM-DR) in response to BRAF inhibition in melanoma. We demonstrate that physical and structural cues from fibroblast-derived ECM abrogate anti-proliferative responses to BRAF/MEK inhibition. MM-DR is mediated by the drug-induced clustering of DDR1 and DDR2, two tyrosine kinase collagen receptors. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition of DDR1 and DDR2 overcome ECM-mediated resistance to BRAF inhibition. In melanoma xenografts, targeting DDRs by Imatinib enhances BRAF inhibitor efficacy, counteracts drug-induced collagen remodeling and delays tumor relapse. Mechanistically, DDR-mediated MM-DR fosters a targetable pro-survival NIK/IKK/NF-{kappa}B2 pathway. Our study reveals a novel role of collagen-rich matrix and DDRs in tumor cell adaptation and therapy resistance, thus providing important insights into environment-mediated drug resistance and a pre-clinical rationale for targeting DDR1/2 signaling in combination with BRAF-targeted therapy in melanoma.",

Despite the assumption that the loss of satellite cells would be detrimental in a chronic regeneration-inducing muscle disease such as muscular dystrophy, this assumption has never been tested using mouse genetics. Here we generated a novel model of satellite cell ablation and crossed it with mouse models of muscular dystrophy to directly investigate how critical these cells are in maintaining muscle during a chronic degenerative disorder. Satellite cell deletion in 2-week-old young dystrophic mice provided noticeable improvements in histopathology and function, although at this early timepoint it was utimately detrimental because muscle size was not sufficient to permit survival. However, depletion of satellite cells beginning at 2 months of age in dystrophic mice provided similar histological and functional improvements but without compromising muscle size. The improved profile showed fewer damaged fibers, less myofiber central nucleation, increased sarcolemma integrity, decreased fibrosis and a dramatic size increase in the remaining myofibers. At the functional level, young adult dystrophic mice lacking satellite cells performed significantly better than those with satellite cells when exercised on a treadmill. Thus, loss of satellite cells during early adulthood in dystrophic mice produces an unexpected protective effect.",

    "abstract": "Degeneration of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons and dysregulation of noradrenergic signaling are ubiquitous features of Parkinsons disease (PD). The LC is among the first brain regions affected by -synuclein (asyn) pathology, yet how asyn affects these neurons remains unclear. LC-derived norepinephrine (NE) can stimulate neuroprotective mechanisms and modulate immune cells, while dysregulation of NE neurotransmission may exacerbate disease progression, particularly non-motor symptoms, and contribute to the chronic neuroinflammation associated with PD pathology. Although transgenic mice overexpressing asyn have previously been developed, transgene expression is usually driven by pan-neuronal promoters and thus has not been selectively targeted to LC neurons. Here we report a novel transgenic mouse expressing human wild-type asyn under control of the noradrenergic-specific dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase promoter. These mice developed oligomeric and conformation-specific asyn in LC neurons, alterations in hippocampal and LC microglial abundance, upregulated GFAP expression, degeneration of LC fibers, decreased striatal dopamine (DA) metabolism, and age-dependent behaviors reminiscent of non-motor symptoms of PD that were rescued by adrenergic receptor antagonists. These mice provide novel insights into how asyn pathology affects LC neurons and how central noradrenergic dysfunction may contribute to early PD pathophysiology.\n\nSignificance statement-synuclein (asyn) pathology and loss of neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) are two of the most ubiquitous neuropathologic features of Parkinsons disease (PD). Dysregulated NE neurotransmission is associated with the non-motor symptoms of PD including sleep disturbances, emotional changes such as anxiety and depression, and cognitive decline. Importantly, loss of central NE may contribute to the chronic inflammation in, and progression of, PD. We have generated a novel transgenic mouse expressing human asyn in LC neurons to investigate how increased asyn expression affects the function of the central noradrenergic transmission and associated behaviors. We report cytotoxic effects of oligomeric and conformation-specific asyn, astrogliosis, LC fiber degeneration, disruptions in striatal dopamine metabolism, and age-dependent alterations in non-motor behaviors without inclusions.",

    "abstract": "Vietnam features extensive ethnolinguistic diversity and occupies a key position in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). Yet, the genetic diversity of Vietnam remains relatively unexplored, especially with genome-wide data, because previous studies have focused mainly on the majority Kinh group. Here we analyze newly-generated genome-wide SNP data for the Kinh and 21 additional ethnic groups in Vietnam, encompassing all five major language families in MSEA. In addition to analyzing the allele and haplotype sharing within the Vietnamese groups, we incorporate published data from both nearby modern populations and ancient samples for comparison. We find that the Vietnamese ethnolinguistic groups harbor multiple sources of genetic diversity that are associated with heterogeneous ancestry sharing profiles in each language family. However, linguistic diversity does not completely match genetic diversity; there have been extensive interactions between the Hmong-Mien and Tai-Kadai groups, and a likely case of cultural diffusion in which some Austro-Asiatic groups shifted to Austronesian languages. Overall, our results highlight the importance of genome-wide data from dense sampling of ethnolinguistic groups in providing new insights into the genetic diversity and history of an ethnolinguistically-diverse region, such as Vietnam.",

    "abstract": "In the circumboreal region, plants often have extremely-wide species ranges. Lagotis minor-glauca species complex widespread from (sub)arctic Asia to Alaska, however, have two allied narrow endemics in northern Japan: a serpentine plant L. takedana endemic to the Yubari Mountains (Mt. Yubari) and a non-serpentine plant L. yesoensis endemic to the Taisetsu Mountains (Mt. Taisetsu). Elucidating their origins sheds light on drivers for secondary-speciation of widespread circumboreal plants. To infer phylogenetic distinctiveness of two narrow endemics with those related taxa, which contained 25 out of all the 29 species of the genus, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), nuclear ribosomal (nrITS), two low copy nuclear gene (LCN) markers and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (MIG-seq) were used. In the result of cpDNA analyses, the Lagotis minor-glauca species complex formed a clade. Within the clade, L. yesoensis and a portion of L. glauca samples formed a subclade. However, monophyly of each of the four species was not supported. In the results of nrITS and two LCN analyses, L. takedana was monophyletic, while monophyly was not recovered for each L. yesoensis, L. glauca, and L. minor. Based on a Bayesian dating analysis using nrITS data, the age of the most recent common ancestor of L. takedana was Ma (95% confidence interval: 0.05-1.75 Ma). Possible scenario is that an ancestral linage being adapted to serpentine soils migrated into the alpine habitat of Mt. Yubari, that was formed with mountain uplift by the early Pleistocene, and subsequently reproductively isolated from non-serpentine populations and speciated. The contrasting result of L. yesoensis, that was phylogenetically indistinct, is possibly explained by incorrect taxonomy, or alternatively, shallow history and incomplete lineage sorting. In Mt. Taisetsu, massive volcanic eruptions had occurred the Early Pleistocene and even after the last glacial period, suggesting that alpine plants have not migrated into and established populations in Mt. Taisetsu until very recently. To fully resolve the phylogeny of the three species L. yesoensis, L. glauca, and L. minor, further analyses using high resolution molecular markers are needed. The present study illustrated that two narrow endemics in northern Japan diverged from the widespread species include phylogenetically distinctive and indistinctive species, owing to historical orogeny and ecological factors.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Herpesviruses mediate entry by a multi-component, virus-encoded machinery. Herpesviruses enter cells by endosomal low pH and pH-neutral mechanisms in a cell-specific manner. HSV mediates cell entry via envelope glycoproteins gB, gD, and the heterodimer gH/gL regardless of pH or endocytosis requirements. HSV envelope proteins that function selectively in a given entry pathway have been elusive. Here we demonstrate that gC regulates cell entry and infection by a low pH pathway. Conformational changes in the core herpesviral fusogen gB are critical for membrane fusion. The presence of gC conferred a higher pH threshold to acid-induced antigenic changes in gB. Thus, gC may selectively facilitate low pH entry by regulating conformational changes in the fusion protein gB. We propose that gC modulates the HSV fusion machinery during entry into pathophysiologically relevant cells, such as human epidermal keratinocytes.\n\nImportanceHerpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause lifelong latent infections and are characterized by multiple entry pathways. We propose that herpes simplex virus (HSV) gC plays a selective role in modulating HSV entry by a low pH pathway, such as into epithelial cells. gC facilitates conformational change of the main fusogen gB, a class III fusion protein. We propose a model whereby gC functions with gB, gD, and gH/gL to allow low pH entry. In the absence of gC, HSV entry occurs at a lower pH, coincident with trafficking to a lower pH compartment where gB changes occur at more acidic pHs. This study identifies a new function for gC and provides novel insight into the complex mechanism of HSV entry and fusion.",

    "abstract": "Descriptions of crustacean brains have mainly focused on three highly derived lineages: the reptantian infraorders represented by spiny lobsters, lobsters, and crayfish. Those descriptions advocate the view that dome- or cap-like neuropils, referred to as \"hemiellipsoid bodies,\" are the ground pattern organization of centers that are comparable to insect mushroom bodies in processing olfactory information. Here we challenge the doctrine that hemiellipsoid bodies are a derived trait of crustaceans, whereas mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods. We demonstrate that mushroom bodies typify lineages that arose before Reptantia and exist in Reptantia. We show that evolved variations of the mushroom body ground pattern are, in some lineages, defined by extreme diminution or loss and, in others, by the incorporation of mushroom body circuits into lobeless centers. Such transformations are ascribed to modifications of the columnar organization of mushroom body lobes that, as shown in Drosophila and other hexapods, contain networks essential for learning and memory. We propose that lobed mushroom bodies distinguish crustaceans that negotiate the multidimensionality of complex ecologies, where continuous updating of multistimulus valence and memory is paramount.",

    "abstract": "The biochemical hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases (neural fibrils, clumps, and tangles; heightened reactive oxygen species (ROS); cofilin-actin rods) have presented numerous challenges for development of in vivo diagnostic tools (1-7). Biomarkers such as amyloid beta (A{beta}) fibrils and Tau tangles in Alzheimers Disease (AD) are only accessible via invasive cerebrospinal fluid assay for peptide mass fingerprinting or post-mortem diagnosis (8-11), while ROS can be fleeting and thus challenging to monitor in vivo (12-15). While remaining a challenge for in vivo detection, the unique protein-protein interactions underlying these disease-specific biomarkers also present rich opportunities for the engineering of in vitro pathology-sensitive biosensors and bioactuators. These tools can be useful for the investigation of critical, early stage events in neurodegenerative diseases in both cellular and animal models (16, 17), while potentially leading to advanced detection reagents with clinical applications. In this report, we describe a light and redox-gated protein switch inspired by the phenomenon of cofilin-actin rod formation, which occurs in stressed neurons in the AD brain and following brain ischemia (18). By coupling the redox-sensitive interaction of cofilin and actin with the light responsive Cry2-CIB blue light switch, we accomplish both light- and ROS-gated control of this interaction. The resulting switch is referred to as the \"CofActor\" system. Site-directed mutagenesis of both cofilin and actin partners demonstrate which residues are critical for sustaining or abrogating the light and redox gated response. Furthermore, switch response varies depending on whether oxidative stress is generated via glycolytic inhibition or a combination of glycolytic inhibition and azide-induced oxidative stress. Finally, light and redox gated switch function was demonstrated in cultured hippocampal neurons. As a dual input biosensor, CofActor holds promise for the tracking of early stage events in neurodegeneration and the investigation of actin-binding protein interactions under oxidative stress.",

Resolving the taxonomic problem is crucial also in judging the conservation priority of B. tatewakiana in a global perspective. Our chromosome observation revealed that B. tatewakiana is tetraploid as well as B. ovalifolia. Collaterally, we conducted morphological observation and clarified that B. tatewakiana is morphologically identical to B. ovalifolia in white hairs and dense resinous glands respectively on adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces, based on which they are different from closely related species in the same section Fruticosae.

    "abstract": "The Island Species-Area relationship (ISAR) describes how the number of species increases with increasing size of an island (or island-like habitat), and is of fundamental importance in island biogeography and conservation. Here, we use a framework based on individual-based rarefactions to infer whether ISARs result from random sampling, or whether some process are acting beyond sampling (e.g., disproportionate effects and/or habitat heterogeneity). Using data on total and relative abundances of four taxa (birds, butterflies, amphibians and reptiles) across the Andamans and Nicobar archipelago, we examine how different metrics of biodiversity (total species richness, rarefied species richness, and abundance-weighted effective numbers of species emphasizing common species) vary with island area. Total species richness increased for all taxa, as did rarefied species richness for a given sampling effort. This indicates that the ISAR did not result because of random sampling, but that instead, species were disproportionately favored on larger islands. This disproportionate effect was primarily due to changes in the abundance of rarer species, because there was no effect on the abundance-weighted diversity measure for all taxa except butterflies. Furthermore, for the two taxa for which we had plot-level data (lizards and frogs), within-island {beta} -diversity did not increase with island size, suggesting that heterogeneity effects were unlikely to be driving these ISARS. Overall, our results indicate that the ISAR of these taxa is most likely because rarer species are more likely to survive and persist beyond that which would have been expected by random sampling alone, and emphasizes the role of these larger islands in the preservation and conservation of species.",

    "abstract": "Private and public breeding programs, as well as companies and universities, have developed different genomics technologies which have resulted in the generation of unprecedented amounts of sequence data, which bring new challenges in terms of data management, query, and analysis. The magnitude and complexity of these datasets bring new challenges but also an opportunity to use the data available as a whole. Detailed phenotype data, combined with increasing amounts of genomic data, have an enormous potential to accelerate the identification of key traits to improve our understanding of quantitative genetics. Data harmonization enables cross-national and international comparative research, facilitating the extraction of new scientific knowledge. In this paper, we address the complex issue of combining high dimensional and unbalanced omics data. More specifically, we propose a covariance-based method for combining partial datasets in the genotype to phenotype spectrum. This method can be used to combine partially overlapping relationship/covariance matrices. Here, we show with applications that our approach might be advantageous to feature imputation based approaches; we demonstrate how this method can be used in genomic prediction using heterogenous marker data and also how to combine the data from multiple phenotypic experiments to make inferences about previously unobserved trait relationships. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to harmonize datasets to improve available information across gene-banks, data repositories or other data resources.\n\nKey messageSeveral covariance matrices obtained from independent experiments can be combined as long as these matrices are partially overlapping. We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology with applications in combining data from several partially linked genotypic and phenotypic experiments.\n\nAuthor contribution statement-DA: Conception or design of the work, statistics, R programs, simulations, drafting the article, and critical revision of the article.\n\n-JIS: R programs, graphs, drafting the article, critical revision of the article.\n\n-RK: Critical revision of the article.",

    "abstract": "The plant endophytic fungus Serendipita indica colonizes roots of a wide range of plant species and can enhance growth and stress resistance of these plants. Due to its ease of axenic cultivation and its broad host plant range including the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and numerous crop plants, it is widely used as a model fungus to study beneficial fungus-root interactions. In addition, it was suggested to be utilized for commercial applications, e.g. to enhance yield in barley and other species. To produce inoculum, S. indica is mostly cultivated in a complex Hill-Kafer medium (CM medium), however, growth in this medium is slow, and yield of chlamydospores, which are often used for plant root inoculation, is relatively low. We tested and optimized a simple vegetable juice-based medium for an enhanced yield of fungal inoculum. The described vegetable juice (VJ) medium is based on commercially available vegetable juice and is easy to prepare. VJ medium was superior to the currently used CM medium with respect to biomass production in liquid medium and hyphal growth on agar plates. Using solid VJ medium supplemented with sucrose (VJS), a high amount of chlamydospores developed already after 8 days of cultivation, producing significantly more spores than on CM medium. Use of VJ medium is not restricted to S. indica, as it also supported growth of two pathogenic fungi often used in plant pathology experiments: the ascomycete Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight disease on wheat and barley, and Verticillium longisporum, the causal agent of verticillium wilt. The described VJ medium is recommended for a streamlined and efficient production of inoculum for the plant endophytic fungus Serendipita indica and might prove superior for the propagation of other fungi for research purposes.",

    "abstract": "Numerous evidences indicate that Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in the occurrence and development of diseases. Identifying the association between circRNAs and diseases plays a crucial role in exploring the pathogenesis of complex diseases and improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. However, due to the complex mechanisms between circRNAs and diseases, it is expensive and time-consuming to discover the new circRNA-disease associations by biological experiment. Therefore, there is increasingly urgent need for utilizing the computational methods to predict novel circRNA-disease associations. In this study, we propose a computational method called GCNCDA based on the deep learning Fast learning with Graph Convolutional Networks (FastGCN) algorithm to predict the potential disease-associated circRNAs. Specifically, the method first forms the unified descriptor by fusing disease semantic similarity information, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity information based on known circRNA-disease associations. The FastGCN algorithm is then used to objectively extract the high-level features contained in the fusion descriptor. Finally, the new circRNA-disease associations are accurately predicted by the Forest by Penalizing Attributes (Forest PA) classifier. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment of GCNCDA achieved 91.2% accuracy with 92.78% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.90% on circR2Disease benchmark dataset. In comparison with different classifier models, feature extraction models and other state-of-the-art methods, GCNCDA shows strong competitiveness. Furthermore, 10 of the top 15 circRNA-disease association candidates with the highest prediction scores were confirmed by recently published literature. These results suggest that GCNCDA can effectively predict potential circRNA-disease associations and provide highly credible candidates for biological experiments.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe recognition of circRNA-disease association is the key of disease diagnosis and treatment, and it is of great significance for exploring the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Computational methods can predicte the potential disease-related circRNAs quickly and accurately. Based on the hypothesis that circRNA with similar function tends to associate with similar disease, GCNCDA model is proposed to effectively predict the potential association between circRNAs and diseases by combining FastGCN algorithm. The performance of the model was verified by cross-validation experiments, different feature extraction algorithm and classifier models comparison experiments. Furthermore, 10 of the top 15 disease-associated circRNAs with the highest prediction scores were confirmed by recently published literature. It is anticipated that GCNCDA model can give priority to the most promising circRNA-disease associations on a large scale to provide reliable candidates for further biological experiment.",

    "abstract": "Splicing removes intronic RNA sequences from pre-mRNA molecules and enables, by alternative splicing, the generation of multiple unique RNA molecules from a single gene. As such, splicing is an essential part of the whole translation system of a cell. The spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein complex in which five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) are involved; U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. For each of these snRNAs there are variant gene copies present in a genome. Furthermore, in many eukaryotic species there is an alternative, minor spliceosome that can splice a small number of specific introns. As we previously discovered an embryogenesis-specific ribosomal system in zebrafish early embryogenesis based on variant rRNA and snoRNA expression, we hypothesized that there may also be an embryogenesis-specific spliceosome. An inventory of zebrafish snRNA genes revealed clustered and dispersed loci for all but U2 major snRNAs. For each minor spliceosome snRNA, just one gene locus was found. Since complete snRNA molecules are hard to sequence, we employed a combined PCR-sequencing approach to measure the individual snRNA-variant presence. Analysis of egg and male-adult samples revealed embryogenesis-specific and somatic-specific variants for each major snRNA. These variants have substantial sequence differences, yet none in their mRNA binding sites. Given that many of the sequence differences are found in loop structures indicate possible alternative protein binding. Altogether, with this study we established that the spliceosome is also an element of the embryogenesis-specific translation system in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionOnchocerciasis is one of the most devastating Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) and it is mostly prevalent in Africa. The disease has important heavy social and economic burdens on the infected populations including low productivity, unemployment, social isolation, and stigma.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsThe socio-economic impacts of the Onchocerciasis elimination in Abu-Hamed, River Nile State, Sudan; were investigated using a well-established questionnaire, 512 participants in ten affected communities were interviewed. Our findings revealed that these communities are recovering from the social and economic burden of the diseases, with 90% of the research participants reported general satisfaction about the elimination of the disease in their community, and about 48.3% of them attended secondary school or university. Only 0.6% reported unemployment, and 25.3% and 24.7% of the participants were workers and farmers respectively. Except about the vector biting and nuisance, the majority of the respondents (90%) had no complain after the elimination of the disease in the area. Also, 90.5% of the participants reported either stable or increase in their work performance during the last twelve months. About 93.8% of the respondents were engaged in normal daily activities and involved in happy events like marriage and giving birth during the last twelve months.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceOverall, we conclude that the elimination of Onchocerciasis in Abu-Hamed has several positive impacts on the economy and social life of Abu-Hamed local communities, but this could be maximized by controlling the vector, which is still having a negative impact on the populations. Establishing local developmental projects will help these communities greatly to recover and become more productive.\n\nAuthor SummaryOnchocerciasis, also known as the river blindness, is a disease that caused by a parasitic worm which could infest people eyes or skin causing a blindness or sub-dermal disease. This worm is transmitted to human by the bite of an insect, the black fly. Although the disease is not fatal in most of the patient but it presents a significant economic and social burden on the infected people, their families and communities. This burden is a result of the social stigma associated with the skin form of the disease, and the lack of vision in case of blindness (ocular manifestation). Onchocerciasis was a public health problem in the study site, Abu-Hamed. In 2015, the disease was officially has been declared eliminated from the area. We investigated the socio-economic impacts of this success on the local communities. We have interviewed randomly selected 512 participants to understand their perspective and highlighting their experience regarding the disease elimination. Our research aimed to fill the gap of knowledge between the public health and social science by highlighting the social and economic benefits of health interventions and diseases elimination/eradication. Furthermore, to urge intervention programs to empower the local communities in the planning and implementation of health interventions for a better success.",

    "abstract": "Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is caused by infection of the brain by larvae of the parasitic cestode Taenia solium. It is the most prevalent parasitic infection of the central nervous system and one of the leading causes of adult-acquired epilepsy worldwide. However, little is known about how cestode larvae affect neurons directly. To address this, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging in rodent and human brain slices to identify direct effects of cestode larval products on neuronal activity. We found that both whole cyst homogenate and excretory/secretory products of cestode larvae have an acute excitatory effect on neurons, which can trigger seizure-like events in vitro. Underlying this effect was cestode-induced neuronal depolarization, which was mediated by glutamate receptor activation but not by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, acid-sensing ion channels nor Substance P. Glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters (iGluSnFR) and amino acid assays revealed that the larval homogenate of the cestodes Taenia crassiceps and Taenia solium contained high concentrations of the amino acids glutamate and aspartate. Furthermore, we found that larvae of both species consistently produce and release these excitatory amino acids into their immediate environment. Our findings suggest that perturbations in glutamatergic signaling may play a role in seizure generation in NCC.",

They are made with tandem copies of similar amino acid stretches that fold into elongated architectures. Here, we build and curated a dataset of 200 thousand proteins that contain 1,2 million Ankyrin regions and characterize the abundance, structure and energetics of the repetitive regions in natural proteins. We found that there is a continuous roughly exponential variety of array lengths with an exceptional frequency at 24 repeats. We describe that individual repeats are seldom interrupted with long insertions and accept few deletions, consistently with the know tertiary structures. We found that longer arrays are made up of repeats that are more similar to each other than shorter arrays, and display more favourable folding energy, hinting at their evolutionary origin. The array distributions show that there is a physical upper limit to the size of an array of Ankyrin repeats of about 120 copies, consistent with the limit found in nature. Analysis of the identity patterns within the arrays suggest that they may have originated by sequential copies of more than one Ankyrin unit.\n\nAuthor summaryRepeat proteins are coded in tandem copies of similar amino acid stretches.

    "abstract": "Membrane transporters carry key metabolites through the cell membrane and, from a resource standpoint, are hypothesized to be produced when necessary. The expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated by the transporter substrate. In E. coli, such systems include for example the lacY, araFGH, and xylFGH genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and xylose transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we build a generalizable physical model of the xapABR genetic circuit, which features a regulatory feedback loop through membrane transport (positive feedback) and enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer. Dynamical systems analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane transport makes the model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus, it serves as a genetic \"on-off\" switch, enabling the cell to only produce a set of metabolic enzymes when the corresponding metabolite is present in large amounts. We find that the negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does not significantly disturb the positive feedback from the membrane transporter. We investigate hysteresis in the switching and discuss the role of cooperativity and multiple binding sites in the model circuit. Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic switch for a set of enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of a membrane transporter through its substrate.",

    "abstract": "The search for the genetic determinism of prolificacy variability in sheep has evidenced several major mutations in genes playing a crucial role in the control of ovulation rate. In the Noire du Velay (NV) sheep population, a recent genetic study has evidenced the segregation of such a mutation named FecLL. However, based on litter size (LS) records of FecLL non-carrier ewes, the segregation of a second prolificacy major mutation was suspected in this population. In order to identify this mutation, we have combined case/control genome-wide association study with ovine 50k SNP chip genotyping, whole genome sequencing and functional analyses. A new single nucleotide polymorphism (OARX:50977717T>A, NC_019484) located on the X chromosome upstream of the BMP15 gene was evidenced highly associated with the prolificacy variability (P =1.93E-11). The variant allele was called FecXN and shown to segregate also in the Blanche du Massif Central (BMC) sheep population. In both NV and BMC, the FecXN allele frequency was estimated close to 0.10, and its effect on LS was estimated at +0.20 lamb per lambing at heterozygous state. Homozygous FecXN carrier ewes were fertile with increased prolificacy in contrast to numerous mutations affecting BMP15. At the molecular level, FecXN was shown to decrease BMP15 promoter activity and to impact BMP15 expression in oocyte. This regulatory action was proposed as the causal mechanism for the FecXN mutation to control ovulation rate and prolificacy in sheep.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the genetic etiology of women infertility syndromes, a focus was done on the oocyte-expressed BMP15 and GDF9 genes harboring several mutations associated with ovarian dysfunctions. In sheep also, mutations in these two genes are known to affect the ovarian function leading to sterility or, on the opposite, increasing ovulation rate and litter size constituting the prolificacy trait genetically selected in this species. Through a genome-wide association study with the prolificacy phenotype conducted in the French Noire du Velay sheep breed, we describe a novel mutation located in the regulatory region upstream of the BMP15 gene on the X chromosome. This mutation increases litter size by +0.2 lamb per lambing at the heterozygous state, possibly through an inhibition of BMP15 expression within the oocyte. Our findings suggest a novel kind of BMP15 variant responsible for high prolificacy, in contrast to all other BMP15 variants described so far in the coding sequence.",

    "abstract": "Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is a major bacterial pathogen that causes urinary tract infections (UTIs). Several virulence factors (VFs) in the bacteria have been associated with the pathogenicity. The mouse is an available UTI model for studying the pathogenicity; however, Caenorhabditis elegans represents as an alternative surrogate host for studying UPEC with the capacity for high-throughput analysis. Therefore, we established a simple assay for a UPEC infection model with C. elegans for large-scale screening. An E. coli culture to be tested and synchronized C. elegans were mixed in 96-well plates, and the pathogenicity was determined by comparison of the turbidity before and after incubation. A total of 133 clinically isolated E. coli strains, which included UTI-associated and fecal isolates, were applied to demonstrate the liquid pathogenicity assay. The E. coli isolates associated with UTIs showed higher pathogenicity in C. elegans than the fecal isolates, suggesting that the simple assay with C. elegans is useful as a UPEC infectious model. From the screening, VFs involved with iron acquisition (chuA, fyuA, and irp2) were significantly associated with high pathogenicity. C. elegans is a heme auxotroph, and iron homeostasis also serves innate immunity in C. elegans. We then evaluated whether the VFs in UPEC were involved in the pathogenicity. Mutants of E. coli UTI89 with defective iron acquisition systems were applied to a solid killing assay with C. elegans. As a result, the survival rate of C. elegans fed with the mutants significantly increased compared to when fed with the parent strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the involvement of iron acquisition in the pathogenicity of UPEC in a C. elegans model.",

    "abstract": "BRG1 and BRM are ATPase core subunits of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes. The function of the SWI/SNF complexes in transcriptional initiation has been well studied, while a function in alternative splicing has only been studied for a few cases for BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes. Here, we have expressed BRG1 in C33A cells, a BRG1 and BRM-deficient cell line, and we have analysed the effects on the transcriptome by RNA sequencing. We have shown that BRG1 expression affects the splicing of a subset of genes. For some, BRG1 expression favours exon inclusion and for others, exon skipping. Some of the changes in alternative splicing induced by BRG1 expression do not require the ATPase activity of BRG1. Among the exons regulated through an ATPase-independent mechanism, the included exons had signatures of high GC-content and lacked a positioned nucleosome at the exon. By investigating three genes in which the expression of either wild-type BRG1 or a BRG1-ATPase-deficient variant favoured exon inclusion, we showed that expression of the ATPases promotes the local recruitment of RNA binding factors to chromatin and RNA in a differential manner. The hnRNPL, hnRNPU and SAM68 proteins associated to chromatin in C33A cells expressing BRG1 or BRM, but their association with RNA varied. We propose that SWI/SNF can regulate alternative splicing by interacting with splicing-RNA binding factor and altering their binding to the nascent pre-mRNA, which changes RNP structure.\n\nAuthor summarySplicing, in particular alternative splicing, is a combinatorial process which involves splicing factor complexes and many RNA binding splicing regulatory proteins in different constellations. Most splicing events occur during transcription, which also makes the DNA sequence, the chromatin state and the transcription rate at the exons important components that influence the splicing outcome. We show here that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complex SWI/SNF influences the interactions of splicing regulatory factors with RNA during transcription on certain exons that have a high GC-content. The splicing on this type of exon rely on the ATPase BRG1 and favour inclusion of alternative exons in an ATP-independent manner. SWI/SNF complexes are known to alter the chromatin structure at promoters in transcription initiation, and have been previously shown to alter the transcription rate or nucleosome position in splicing. Our results suggests a further mechanism for chromatin remodelling proteins in splicing: to change the interaction patterns of RNA binding splicing regulatory factors at alternative exons to alter the splicing outcome.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of glioma, has a 5-year survival rate of <5%. While radiation and immunotherapies are routinely studied in the murine Gl261 glioma model, little is known about its inherent immune response. This study quantifies the temporal and spatial localization of immune cell populations and mediators during glioma development.\n\nEight-week old male C57Bl/6 mice were orthotopically inoculated with 1x106 Gl261 cells and tumor morphology, local and systemic immune cell populations, and plasma cytokines/chemokines assessed at Day-0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 post-inoculation by magnetic resonance imaging, chromogenic immunohistochemistry, multiplex immunofluorescent immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and multiplex immunoassay respectively.\n\nFrom Day-3 tumors were distinguishable with >30% Ki67 and increased tissue vascularization (p<0.05). Increasing tumor proliferation/malignancy and vascularization were associated with significant temporal changes in immune cell populations within the tumor (p<0.05) and systemic compartments (p=0.02 to p<0.0001). Of note, at Day-14 16/24 plasma cytokine/chemokines levels decreased coinciding with an increase in tumor cytotoxic T cells, natural killer and natural killer/T cells. Data derived provide baseline characterization of the local and systemic immune response during glioma development. They reveal that type II macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells are more prevalent in tumors than regulatory T cells, highlighting these cell types for further therapeutic exploration.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTWhen a formerly rare pathogen emerges to cause a pandemic, it is critical to understand the ecology of the disease dynamics and its potential effects on disease control. Here, we take advantage of newly available experimental data to parameterize a temperature-dependent dynamical model of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission, and analyze the effects of temperature variability and the parameters related to control strategies on ZIKV R0 and the final epidemic size (i.e., total number of human cases). Sensitivity analyses identified that R0 and the final epidemic size were largely driven by different parameters, with the exception of temperature, which is the dominant driver of epidemic dynamics in the models. Our estimate of R0 had a single optimum temperature (\u2248 30\u00b0 C), comparable to recently published results (\u2248 29\u00b0)1. However, the total number of human cases (\u201cfinal epidemic size\u201d) is maximized across a wider temperature range, from 24 to 36\u00b0C. The models indicate that the disease is highly sensitive to seasonal temperature variation. For example, although the model predicts that Zika transmission cannot occur at a constant temperature of 22\u00b0C, with seasonal variation of 5\u00b0C around a mean of 22\u00b0C, the model predicts a larger epidemic than what would occur at a constant 30\u00b0C, the temperature predicted to maximize R0. This suggests that the potential geographic range of Zika is wider than indicated from static R0 models, underscoring the importance of climate dynamics and variation on emerging infectious diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Recreational and competitive slalom waterskiing is popular among those with spinal cord injuries. People with paraplegia can practice on the slalom course using a sit-ski. A slalom run consists of a boat towing the sit-skier through a set of buoys and normally begins with a deep-water start. Despite its popularity, very little is known about the physiological aspects of the sit-skier's preparation. We examined the internal training load (TL) experienced by a sit-skier with paraplegia while learning and improving the slalom deep-water starts, executed with both the traditional technique and an alternative method. The TL was determined by means of heart rate (HR) and session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) methods. The percentage of maximal heart rate values ranged from from 63.2% to 81.3% during deep-water starts. Training sessions were performed most of the time below the ventilatory threshold and tended to be qualitatively described as hard. A moderate but non-significant correlation existed between HR and sRPE-based methods. We also found a significant decrement in handgrip strength after practice. These findings indicate that the intensity of training experienced by our sit-skier was moderate in terms of physiological internal load during an adaptive slalom waterskiing training program.",

The materials of the 3-DGIUD were the nitinol wire and the silicone rubber. The frame of the 3-DGIUD was three-dimensional and grid-like. Twenty adult female rhesus macaques were divided into the 3-DGIUD group (placing the 3-DGIUD, n=9), the sham operation group (no placing the 3-DGIUD, n=9) and the control group (n=2). On the 10th-day after surgery, the 3-DGIUD group and the sham operation group macaques were caged together with male macaques (female: male = 1:1). The uterus, 3-DGIUD and pregnancy of 18 female rhesus monkeys were examined by abdominal ultrasound every month. The endometrium pathological examination was carried out and the expression of PAX2 and hormone receptor (ER, PR) was detected by immunohistochemical staining. After 3-DGIUD was placed in case group for 3 and 12 months, only 1 of female macaque was pregnant in 9. The contraceptive effective rate was 88.9% (8/9). The 3-DGIUD in the uterus of macaques was observed by ultrasound. In the sham operation group, 9 macaques were pregnant (9/9). There was significant difference in uterine size of the 3-DGIUD group between pre-placement and after surgery for 3 and 12 months (P<0.05). The endometrial epithelium was intact, just a small number of glands vacuoles and a few neutrophils infiltration around the 3-DGIUD. The expression of endometrial ER, PR and PAX2 in 3-DGIUD group on 12 months after surgery was similar to those in control macaque. The 3-DGIUD has a good contraceptive effect on female macaques, and has no significant affection on the expression of endometrial steroid receptor and PAX2 in rhesus monkeys.",

    "abstract": "Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) are a versatile tool in many branches of science, including biophysics and synthetic biology. Octanol-Assisted Liposome Assembly (OLA), a recently developed microfluidic technique enables the production and testing of GUVs within a single device under highly controlled experimental conditions. It is therefore gaining significant interest as a platform for use in drug discovery, the production of artificial cells and more generally for controlled studies of the properties of lipid membranes. In this work, we expand the capabilities of the OLA technique by forming GUVs of tunable binary lipid mixtures of DOPC, DOPG and DOPE. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching we investigated the lateral diffusion coefficients of lipids in OLA liposomes and found the expected values in the range of 1 m2/s for the lipid systems tested. We studied the OLA derived GUVs under a range of conditions and compared the results with electroformed vesicles. Overall, we found the lateral diffusion coefficients of lipids in vesicles obtained with OLA to be quantitatively similar to those in vesicles obtained via traditional electroformation. Our results provide a quantitative biophysical validation of the quality of OLA derived GUVs, which will facilitate the wider use of this versatile platform.",

We demonstrate a highly significant enrichment for oncogenes on amplified ecDNA and that the most common recurrent oncogene amplifications arise on ecDNA. EcDNA amplifications resulted in higher levels of oncogene transcription compared to copy number matched linear DNA, coupled with enhanced chromatin accessibility. Patients whose tumors have ecDNA-based oncogene amplification showed increase of cell proliferation signature activity, greater likelihood of lymph node spread at initial diagnosis, and significantly shorter survival, even when controlled for tissue type, than do patients whose cancers are not driven by ecDNA-based oncogene amplification. The results presented here demonstrate that ecDNA-based oncogene amplification plays a central role in driving the poor outcome for patients with some of the most aggressive forms of cancers.",

    "abstract": "Accurate measurements of cell morphology and behaviour are fundamentally important for understanding how disease, molecules and drugs affect cell function in vivo. Using muscle stem cell (muSC) responses to injury in zebrafish as our biological paradigm we have established a ground truth for muSC cell behaviour. This revealed that variability in segmentation and tracking algorithms from commonly used programs are error-prone, leading us to develop a fast semi-automated image analysis pipeline that allows user defined parameters for segmentation and correction of cell tracking. Cell Tracking Profiler (CTP) operates through the freely available Icy platform, and allows user-managed cell tracking from 3D time-lapsed datasets to provide measures of cell shape and movement. Using dimensionality reduction methods, multiple correlation and regression analyses we identify myosin II-dependent parameters of muSC behaviour during regeneration. CTP and the associated statistical tools we have developed thus provide a powerful framework for analysing complex cell behaviour in vivo from 4D datasets.\n\nSummaryAnalysis of cell shape and movement from 3D time-lapsed datasets is currently very challenging. We therefore designed Cell Tracking Profiler for analysing cell behaviour from complex datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness by analysing stem cell behaviour during muscle regeneration in zebrafish.",

Previously we have described the p.[(Pro34Thr);(Ser83del)] double NANOS1 mutation as associated with an absence of germ cells in the testes of infertile patients. The aim of this study was to identify the mechanism underlying infertility phenotype of patients bearing the NANOS1 mutation.\n\nMethodsConstructs encoding a wild-type or mutated NANOS1 protein were used for transfection of TCam-2 cell line, representing male germ cells in culture. Influence of this mutation on cell proliferation was performed using MTS assay while apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry. RNA-Seq analysis including quantitative RT-PCR was conducted for selecting pro-apoptotic genes, repressed by the wild-type NANOS1. Influence of the p.[(Pro34Thr);(Ser83del)] NANOS1 mutation on that repression was investigated by quantitative RT-PCR.\n\nResultsWe show here that the p.[(Pro34Thr);(Ser83del)] double NANOS1 mutation causes NANOS1 to functionally switch from being anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic in the human male germ cell line TCam-2. This mutation disrupts repression of mRNAs encoding pro-apoptotic GADG45A, GADD45B, GADD45G and RHOB factors, which could contribute to an increase in apoptosis.\n\nConclusionsThis report underscores the conservation of Nanos from flies to humans as a repressor of pro-apoptotic mRNAs in germ cells, and provides a basis for understanding NANOS1 functions in human reproductive health.",

According to the results of functional annotation, we found that C1 and C2 are related to immune functions, while C5 is related to programmed cell death. Then based on subclonal basis gene expression matrix, we applied deconvolution algorithm on TCGA tissue RNA-seq data and observed that microenvironment is diverse among TNBC subclones, especially C1 is closely related to T cells.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain cancer, with a median survival of 1 to 2 years1. These tumours contain glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly tumorigenic, resistant to conventional therapies2, 3, and exhibit metabolic plasticity to adapt to challenging environments4, 5. GSCs can be specifically targeted by a short cell-penetrating peptide based on connexin43 (Cx43) (TAT-Cx43266-283) that reduces tumour growth and increases survival in preclinical models6 via c-Src inhibition7. Because several reports revealed poor clinical efficacy of various antitumoral drugs due to metabolic rewiring in cancer cells8-10, we investigated the effect of TAT-Cx43266-283 on GSC metabolism and metabolic plasticity. Here we show that TAT-Cx43266-283 decreases GSC glucose uptake and oxidative phosphorylation without a compensatory increase in glycolysis, with no effect on neuron or astrocyte metabolism. GSC changes were mediated by decreased hexokinase (HK) activity and aberrant mitochondrial localization, ultrastructure and function. Moreover, TAT-Cx43266-283 reduced GSC growth and survival under different nutrient availability conditions by impairing the metabolic plasticity needed to exploit glucose as an energy source in the absence of other nutrients. Finally, GSCs intracranially implanted into mice together with TAT-Cx43266-283 showed decreased levels of important targets for cancer therapy, such as HK-211, 12 and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT-3)13, evidencing the reduced ability of treated GSCs to survive in challenging environments. Our results confirm the value of TAT-Cx43266-283 for glioma therapy alone or in combination with therapies whose resistance relies on metabolic adaptation. More importantly, these results allow us to conclude that the advantageous metabolic plasticity of GSCs is a targetable vulnerability in malignant gliomas.",

Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of canonical pro-apoptotic p53 target genes in colon cancer cells imposes a critical dependence on the long splice form of the caspase-8 regulator FLIP (FLIP(L)), which we identify as a direct p53 transcriptional target. Inhibiting FLIP(L) expression with siRNA or Class-I HDAC inhibitors promotes apoptosis in response to p53 activation by the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3A, which otherwise predominantly induces cell-cycle arrest. When FLIP(L) upregulation is inhibited, apoptosis is induced in response to p53 activation via a novel ligand-independent TRAIL-R2/caspase-8 complex, which, by activating BID, induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Notably, FLIP(L) depletion inhibits p53-induced expression of the cell cycle regulator p21 and enhances p53-mediated upregulation of PUMA, with the latter activating mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in FLIP(L)-depleted, Nutlin-3A-treated cells lacking TRAIL-R2/caspase-8. Thus, we report two previously undescribed, novel FLIP(L)-dependent mechanisms that determine cell fate following p53 activation.",

    "abstract": "The epithelial tight junction regulates barrier function and is responsive to extracellular stimuli. Here we demonstrated that contact of synthetic surfaces with defined nanotopography at the apical surface of epithelial monolayers increased paracellular permeability of macromolecules. To monitor changes in tight junction morphology in live cells, we fluorescently tagged the scaffold protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) through CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing. Contact between cells and nanostructured surfaces destabilized junction-associated ZO-1 and promoted its arrangement into highly dynamic non-junctional cytosolic complexes that averaged [~]2 m in diameter. Junction-associated ZO-1 rapidly remodeled, and we also observed the direct transformation of cytosolic complexes into junction-like structures. Claudin-family tight junction transmembrane proteins and F-actin also were associated with these ZO-1 containing cytosolic complexes. These data suggest that the cytosolic structures are novel intermediates formed in response to nanotopographic cues that facilitate rapid tight junction remodeling in order to regulate paracellular permeability.",
