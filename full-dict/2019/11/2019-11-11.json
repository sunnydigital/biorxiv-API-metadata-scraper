    "abstract": "1A cornerstone of theoretical neuroscience is the circuit model: a system of equations that captures a hypothesized neural mechanism. Such models are valuable when they give rise to an experimentally observed phenomenon - whether behavioral or a pattern of neural activity - and thus can offer insights into neural computation. The operation of these circuits, like all models, critically depends on the choice of model parameters. A key step is then to identify the model parameters consistent with observed phenomena: to solve the inverse problem. In this work, we present a novel technique, emergent property inference (EPI), that brings the modern probabilistic modeling toolkit to theoretical neuroscience. When theorizing circuit models, theoreticians predominantly focus on reproducing computational properties rather than a particular dataset. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn parameter distributions with these computational properties. This methodology is introduced through a motivational example inferring conductance parameters in a circuit model of the stomatogastric ganglion. Then, with recurrent neural networks of increasing size, we show that EPI allows precise control over the behavior of inferred parameters, and that EPI scales better in parameter dimension than alternative techniques. In the remainder of this work, we present novel theoretical findings gained through the examination of complex parametric structure captured by EPI. In a model of primary visual cortex, we discovered how connectivity with multiple inhibitory subtypes shapes variability in the excitatory population. Finally, in a model of superior colliculus, we identified and characterized two distinct regimes of connectivity that facilitate switching between opposite tasks amidst interleaved trials, characterized each regime via insights afforded by EPI, and found conditions where these circuit models reproduce results from optogenetic silencing experiments. Beyond its scientific contribution, this work illustrates the variety of analyses possible once deep learning is harnessed towards solving theoretical inverse problems.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveUltrasonic acoustic power transfer is an efficient mechanism for coupling energy to millimeter and sub-millimeter implants in the body. To date, published ultrasonically powered implants have been encapsulated with thin film polymers that are susceptible to well-documented failure modes in vivo, including water penetration and attack by the body. As with all medical implants, packaging with ceramic or metallic materials can reduce water vapor transmission and improve biostability to provide decadal device lifetime. In this paper, we evaluate methods of coupling acoustic energy to the interior of ceramic packages.\n\nMethodsThe classic wave approach and modal expansion are used to obtain analytical expressions for acoustic transmission through two different package designs and these approaches are validated experimentally. A candidate package design is demonstrated using alumina packages and titanium lids, designed to be acoustically transparent.\n\nResultsBulk modes are shown to be more effective at coupling acoustic energy to a piezoelectric receiver than flexural modes. Using bulk modes, packaged motes have an overall link efficiency of roughly 10%, compared to 25% for unpackaged motes. Packaging does not have a significant effect on translational misalignment penalties, but does increase angular misalignment penalties. Passive amplitude-modulated backscatter communication is demonstrated.\n\nConclusionThin lids enable the use of acoustically coupled devices even with package materials of very different acoustic impedance. Significance: This work provides an analysis and method for designing packages that enable acoustic coupling with implantable medical devices, which could facilitate clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Despite its widespread use, the majority of patients with gastric cancer (GC) will not respond to taxane chemotherapy due to resistance mechanisms. Here, we report the discovery of a novel truncated variant of the microtubule plus-end binding protein (+TIP) CLIP-170, hereafter CLIP-170S, whose expression is enriched in taxane resistant cell lines and patients with GC. To establish causation, we knocked-down (KD) CLIP-170S which completely reversed taxane resistance. Mass-spec proteomics and 5-RACE further showed that CLIP-170S lacked the first 150 amino acids, including the Cap-Gly motif required for microtubule (MT) plus-end localization. Mechanistically, we show that CLIP-170S was mislocalized from the MT plus-end to the MT lattice obstructing the MT pore surface site required for taxane entry into the MT lumen. Computational analysis of RNA-seq data from taxane-sensitive and resistant GC cell lines, predicted imatinib as the top candidate drug to overcome drug resistance. Imatinib treatment completely reversed taxane resistance, as predicted, and did so unexpectedly by selective depletion of CLIP-170S. Importantly, CLIP170S was found to be highly prevalent in tumor biopsies from patients with GC. Taken together, these data identify CLIP-170S as a novel, clinically prevalent +TIP variant that obstructs the MT pore and confers taxane resistance. The discovery of this previously unrecognized variant together with the computational discovery of Imatinib as a selective CLIP-170S inhibitor, implicate the MT pore in clinical taxane resistance and provide new therapeutic opportunities for treatment of GC and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Exercise benefits the musculoskeletal system and reduces the effects of cancer. The beneficial effects of exercise are multifactorial, where metabolic changes and tissue adaptation influence outcomes. Mechanical signals, a principal component of exercise, are anabolic to the musculoskeletal system and restrict cancer progression. We examined the mechanisms through which cancer cells sense and respond to mechanical signals. Low-magnitude, high-frequency signals were applied to human breast cancer cells in the form of low-intensity vibration (LIV). LIV decreased invasion through matrix and impaired secretion of osteolytic factors PTHLH, IL-11, and RANKL. Furthermore, paracrine signals from mechanically stimulated cancer cells, reduced osteoclast differentiation resorptive capacity. Physically disconnecting the nucleus by knockdown of SUN1 and SUN2 impaired the ability of LIV to suppress invasion and production of osteolytic factors. LIV also increased cell stiffness; an effect dependent on an intact LINC complex. These data show that mechanical signals alter the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells, where the nucleus serves as a mechanosensory apparatus to alter cell structure and intercellular signaling.",

    "abstract": "Genetic redundancy can be exploited to identify therapeutic targets for inherited disorders. An example is DYT1 dystonia, a neurodevelopmental movement disorder caused by a loss-of-function (LOF) mutation in the TOR1A gene encoding torsinA. Prior work demonstrates that torsinA and its paralog torsinB have conserved functions at the nuclear envelope. This work established that low neuronal levels of torsinB dictate the neuronal selective phenotype of nuclear membrane budding. Here, we examined whether torsinB expression levels impact the onset or severity of abnormal movements, or neuropathological features in DYT1 mouse models. We demonstrate that torsinB levels bidirectionally regulate these phenotypes. Reducing torsinB levels causes a dosedependent worsening whereas torsinB overexpression rescues torsinA LOF-mediated abnormal movements and neurodegeneration. These findings identify torsinB as a potent modifier of torsinA LOF phenotypes and suggest that augmentation of torsinB expression level may retard or prevent symptom development in DYT1 dystonia.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers consider a key role in initiation of apoptosis along the mitochondrial pathway to be enhanced by cytochrome c, one of the components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which acquires peroxidase activity by forming a complex with phospholipids. Mitochondrial membranes are destroyed affected by the peroxidase reaction catalyzed by this supramolecular nanoparticle, resulting in the release of various proapoptotic factors into the cellular cytoplasm, ultimately leading to the development of an apoptosis pathway. The study of lipoperoxidase activity of the cytochrome c with cardiolipin complex is conducted via activated chemiluminescence. However, prior to this study, no assessment of the potential contribution of free non-heme iron, which can be inserted into the sample, into chemiluminescence of the system of cytochrome c complex with cardiolipin- hydrogen peroxide. It was found during the study process, that chemiluminescence of this system is indeed generated by the activity of the cytochrome c with cardiolipin complex, and the method of activated chemiluminescence is actually suitable for its study. The effect of trolox and dihydroquercetin (taxifolin) as synthetic and natural antioxidants on lipoperoxidase activity of the cytochrome c with cardiolipin complex was as well assessed via application of chemiluminescence activator specific for lipid peroxidation reactions - coumarin-334. A complete inhibition of lipoperoxidase activity for a few minutes with its subsequent full development under the trolox response and its dose-dependent uniform decrease under dihydroquercetin effect was obtained. These findings are promising for the future studies on inhibition of lipoperoxidase activity of this nanoparticle by antioxidants in order to inhibit the inappropriate apoptosis. Peroxidase activity of intact mitochondria in the comparative application of two chemiluminescence activators: coumarin-334 and coumarin-525, was also featured.\n\nSignificance of the studyThis study proves that the method of activated chemiluminescence is adequate to study the processes occurring in the early stages of apoptosis. Inhibition of lipoperoxidase activity of the cytochrome c with cardiolipin complex by antioxidants was demonstrated. These findings prove that studies on the effect of antioxidants on this supramolecular nanoparticle will eventually lead to discovery of the news means to prevent and treat diseases caused by apoptosis: myocardial infarction, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, etc.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic environmental alterations such as urbanization can threaten native populations as well as create novel environments that allow human pests and pathogens to thrive. As the number and size of urban environments increase globally, it is more important than ever to understand the dispersal dynamics of hosts, vectors and pathogens of zoonotic disease systems. For example, a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans, Trypanosoma cruzi, recently colonized and spread through the city of Arequipa, Peru. We used population genomic and phylogenomic tools to analyze whole genomes of 123 T. cruzi isolates collected throughout Arequipa to determine patterns of T. cruzi dispersal. The data show significant population genetic structure within city blocks-parasites in the same block tend to be very closely related - but no population structure among blocks within districts - parasites in neighboring blocks are no more closely related to one another than to parasites in distant districts. These data suggest that T. cruzi dispersal within a block occurs regularly and that occasional long-range dispersal events allow the establishment of new T. cruzi populations in distant blocks. Movement of domestic animals may be the primary mechanism of inter-block and inter-district T. cruzi dispersal.\n\nAuthor SummaryUrbanization creates environments that are ideal for some human pests and pathogens. As the number and size of urban environments increases globally, it is becoming vital to understand how human disease-causing pathogens, their vectors, and their non-human hosts disperse through urban landscapes. Here we study a population of Trypanosoma cruzi - the protozoan parasite and causative agent of Chagas disease in humans - that recently colonized the city of Arequipa, Peru. We use population genomic and phylogenomic tools to understand how this parasite population dispersed through the city to achieve its current distribution and abundance. We show that T. cruzi collected from the same city block tend to be very closely related, while those from neighboring blocks are often as distantly related as those from blocks in distant districts. The data suggest that vectors facilitate frequent within-block dispersal of the parasite, while domestic animal movement may facilitate the relatively infrequent inter-block and interdistrict dispersal.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the primary yeast species responsible for most fermentations in winemaking. However, other yeasts, including Saccharomyces uvarum, have occasionally been found conducting commercial fermentations around the world. S. uvarum is typically associated with white wine fermentations in cool-climate wine regions, and has been identified as the dominant yeast in fermentations from France, Hungary, northern Italy, and, recently, Canada. However, little is known about how the origin and genetic diversity of the Canadian S. uvarum population relates to strains from other parts of the world. In this study, a highly diverse S. uvarum population was found dominating uninoculated commercial fermentations of Chardonnay grapes sourced from two different vineyards. Most of the strains identified were found to be genetically distinct from S. uvarum strains isolated around the world. Of the 106 strains of S. uvarum identified in this study, four played a dominant role in the fermentations, with some strains predominating in the fermentations from one vineyard over the other. Furthermore, two of the dominant strains were previously identified as dominant strains in uninoculated Chardonnay fermentations at the same winery two years earlier, providing evidence for a winery-resident population of indigenous S. uvarum. This research provides a valuable insight into the diversity and persistence of non-commercial S. uvarum strains in North America, and provides a stepping stone for future work into the enological potential of an alternative Saccharomyces yeast species.",

    "abstract": "Two fundamental goals of decision making are to select actions that maximize rewards while minimizing costs and to have strong confidence in the accuracy of a judgment. Neural signatures of these two forms of value: the subjective value (SV) of choice alternatives and the value of the judgment (confidence), have both been observed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However, the relationship between these dual value signals and their relative time courses are unknown. We recorded fMRI while 28 men and women performed a two-phase Ap-Av task with mixed-outcomes of monetary rewards paired with painful shock stimuli. Neural responses were measured during offer valuation (offer phase) and choice valuation (commit phase) and analyzed with respect to observed decision outcomes, model-estimated SV and confidence. During the offer phase, vmPFC tracked SV and decision outcomes, but it not confidence. During the commit phase, vmPFC tracked confidence, computed as the quadratic extension of SV, but it bore no significant relationship with the offer valuation itself, nor the decision. In fact, vmPFC responses from the commit phase were selective for confidence even for rejected offers, wherein confidence and SV were inversely related. Conversely, activation of the cognitive control network, including within lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was associated with ambivalence, during both the offer and commit phases. Taken together, our results reveal complementary representations in vmPFC during value-based decision making that temporally dissociate such that offer valuation (SV) emerges before decision valuation (confidence).",

CO2 response curves and parameters were fitted using a rectangular hyperbola model, non-rectangular hyperbola model, exponential equation, and modified rectangular hyperbola model. Results revealed that the relative soil water content (RWC) required to maintain a high photosynthetic rate (Pn) and carboxylation efficiency (CE) ranged from 42.8% to 83.2%. When RWC fell outside these ranges, the photosynthetic capacity (Pnmax), CE, and CO2 saturation point (CSP) decreased. CO2 response curves and three parameters, CE, CO2 compensation point ({Gamma}), and photorespiration rate (Rp), were well fitted by the four models when RWC was appropriate. When RWC exceeded the optimal range, only the modified rectangular hyperbola model fitted the CO2 response curves and photosynthetic parameters better.",

We calculated an index of adhesion for differently treated legs of the two species in a cribellar U. plumipes capture thread, i.e. untreated legs, water-washed legs, and legs washed with the organic solvent n-hexane.
