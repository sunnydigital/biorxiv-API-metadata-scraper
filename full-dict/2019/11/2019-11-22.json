    "abstract": "Reference materials (RM)-assisted Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation (rm-RGDA) has been developed and used to in situ determine the size and thickness of the adlayer on the particles in solution. The particle size determined by rm-RGDA is quite close to that measured by electron microscopy but significantly smaller than that measured by DLS. The BSA adlayer absorbed on PS50, PS100 and SiO2 NPs is 3.3, 0.9 and 1.2 nm, respectively, and close to those observed by SEM, which is 4.6, 1.3 and 3.8 nm, respectively. The FTIR analysis results show that the BSA absorbed on larger particles or hydroxyl-abundant surface, e.g. PS100 and SiO2 NPs can lose its secondary structure, e.g. -helix, to a great extent and that absorbed on a more curve surface, e.g. smaller PS50 particles can largely preserve its secondary structure as its free state. The measurement results show the curvature of the NPs is closely related to the structure change of the adsorbed protein. This method provide a facile and new approach to measure the size and its adlayer change of the hybrid and core-shell structured nanoparticles in a wide range of wavelength.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEQuantitative study on the adsorption of the protein on colloidal nanoparticles is an important approach to understand the biophysical effect, compared with other ex situ methods such as TEM and SEM, where the specimen are undergone pre-processing and no longer the original state in measurement. It is, therefore, a big challenge. In order to cope with this challenge, UV-vis based RGDA has been developed and applied to in situ measure the size of the dispersed colloidal nanoparticles and their protein adlayer thickness, where the protein adlayer thickness on the colloidal nanoparticles can be easily determined. We believe this method provide a facile and sensitive way to in situ measure the dimension change of hybrid colloidal nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "1A multiple-trait Bayesian LASSO (MBL) for genome-based analysis and prediction of quantitative traits is presented and applied to two real data sets. The data-generating model is a multivariate linear Bayesian regression on possibly a huge number of molecular markers, and with a Gaussian residual distribution posed. Each (one per marker) of the T x 1 vectors of regression coefficients (T : number of traits) is assigned the same T -variate Laplace prior distribution, with a null mean vector and unknown scale matrix{Sigma} . The multivariate prior reduces to that of the standard univariate Bayesian LASSO when T = 1. The covariance matrix of the residual distribution is assigned a multivariate Jeffreys prior and{Sigma} is given an inverse-Wishart prior. The unknown quantities in the model are learned using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme constructed using a scale-mixture of normal distributions representation. MBL is demonstrated in a bivariate context employing two publicly available data sets using a bivariate genomic best linear unbiased prediction model (GBLUP) for benchmarking results. The first data set is one where wheat grain yields in two different environments are treated as distinct traits. The second data set comes from genotyped Pinus trees with each individual was measured for two traits, rust bin and gall volume. In MBL, the bivariate marker effects are shrunk differentially, i.e., \"short\" vectors are more strongly shrunk towards the origin than in GBLUP; conversely, \"long\" vectors are shrunk less. A predictive comparison was carried out as well where, in wheat, the comparators of MBL where bivariate GBLUP and bivariate Bayes C{pi}, a variable selection procedure. A training-testing layout was used, with 100 random reconstructions of training and testing sets. For the wheat data, all methods produced similar predictions. In Pinus, MBL gave better predictions that either a Bayesian bivariate GBLUP or the single trait Bayesian LASSO. MBL has been implemented in the Julia language package JWAS and is now available for the scientific community to explore with different traits, species and environments. It is well known that there is no universally best prediction machine and MBL represents a new piece in the armamentarium for genome-enabled analysis and prediction of complex traits.",

    "abstract": "Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is a multifunctional histone chaperone that can activate RNA Polymerase II-driven chromatin transcription. Acetylation of NPM1 by acetyltransferase p300 has been shown to further enhance its transcription activation potential. Moreover, its total and acetylated pools are increased in oral squamous cell carcinoma. However, the role of NPM1 or its acetylated form (AcNPM1) in transcriptional regulation in cells is not fully elucidated. Using ChIP-seq analyses, we show that AcNPM1 co-occupies marks of active transcription at promoters and DNase I hypersensitive sites at enhancers. Moreover, NPM1 interacts with proteins involved in transcription, including RNA Pol II, general transcription factors, mediator subunits, histone acetyltransferase complexes, and chromatin remodelers. Moreover, its histone chaperone also contributes to transcriptional activation. We further show that AcNPM1 regulates key genes required for proliferation, migration and invasion potential of oral cancer cells and knockdown of NPM1 mitigates these processes in cells as well as orthotopic tumors in mice. Collectively, these results establish that AcNPM1 functions as a coactivator and regulates the expression of key genes involved in oral tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The Weddell Seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) represents a remarkable example of adaptation to diving among marine mammals. This species is capable of diving >900 m deep and remaining underwater for more than 60 minutes. A number of key physiological specializations have been identified, including the low levels of aerobic, lipid-based metabolism under hypoxia, significant increase in oxygen storage in blood and muscle; high blood volume and extreme cardiovascular control. These adaptations have been linked to increased abundance of key proteins, suggesting an important, yet still understudied role for gene reprogramming.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the possibility that post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) has contributed to the adaptive evolution of diving capacities in the Weddell Seal.\n\nUsing small RNA data across 4 tissues (cortex, heart, muscle and plasma), in 3 biological replicates, we generate the first miRNA annotation in this species, consisting of 559 high confidence, manually curated miRNA loci. Evolutionary analyses of miRNA gain and loss highlight a high number of Weddell seal specific miRNAs.\n\n416 miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) among tissues, whereas 83 miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE) across all tissues between pups and adults and 221 miRNAs demonstrated developmental changes in specific tissues only. mRNA targets of these altered miRNAs identify possible protective mechanisms in individual tissues, particularly relevant to hypoxia tolerance, anti-apoptotic pathways, and nitric oxide signal transduction. Novel, lineage-specific miRNAs associated with developmental changes target genes with roles in angiogenesis and vasoregulatory signaling.\n\nAltogether, we provide an overview of miRNA composition and evolution in the Weddell seal, and the first insights into their possible role in the specialization to diving.",

While Tmem176a/b appeared surprisingly dispensable for the protective function of Th17 and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in the intestinal mucosa, we found that they were required in cDCs for optimal antigen processing and presentation to CD4+ T cells. Using a real-time imaging method, we show that TMEM176A/B accumulate in dynamic post-Golgi vesicles preferentially linked to the late endolysosomal system and strongly colocalize with HLA-DM. Together, our results suggest that TMEM176A/B ion channels play a direct role in the MHC II compartment (MIIC) of DCs for the fine regulation of antigen presentation and naive CD4+ T cell priming.",

    "abstract": "All living organisms adapt their membrane lipid composition in response to changes in their environment or diet. These conserved membrane-adaptive processes have been studied extensively. However, key concepts of membrane biology linked to regulation of lipid composition including homeoviscous adaptation maintaining stable levels of membrane fluidity, and gel-fluid phase separation resulting in domain formation, heavily rely upon in vitro studies with model membranes or lipid extracts. Using the bacterial model organisms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, we now show that inadequate in vivo membrane fluidity interferes with essential complex cellular processes including cytokinesis, envelope expansion, chromosome replication/segregation and maintenance of membrane potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that very low membrane fluidity is indeed capable of triggering large-scale lipid phase separation and protein segregation in intact, protein-crowded membranes of living cells; a process that coincides with the minimal level of fluidity capable of supporting growth. Importantly, the in vivo lipid phase separation is not associated with a breakdown of the membrane diffusion barrier function, thus explaining why the phase-separation process induced by low fluidity is biologically reversible.",

We developed a novel model of enriched environment to longitudinally monitor 40 inbred mice exploring 35 connected cages over periods of three to six months. We show that behavioral individuality that emerged during the first three months of environmental enrichment persisted when mice were withdrawn from the enriched environment for three additional months. Behavioral trajectories were associated with stable inter-individual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and persistent epigenetic effects on neuronal plasticity genes in the hippocampus. Using genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing, we show that one third of the DNA methylation changes were maintained after withdrawal from the enriched environment. Our results suggest that, even under the most constraint conditions controlling genes and environment, early-life experiences result in lasting individualized changes in behavior and brain plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Determination of muscle forces during motion can help to understand motor control, assess pathological movement, diagnose neuromuscular disorders, or estimate joint loads. Difficulty of in vivo measurement made computational analysis become a common alternative in which, as several muscles serve each degree of freedom, the muscle redundancy problem must be solved. Unlike static optimization (SO), synergy optimization (SynO) couples muscle activations across all time frames, thereby altering estimated muscle co-contraction. This study explores whether the use of a muscle synergy structure within a static optimization framework improves prediction of muscle activations during walking. A motion/force/EMG gait analysis was performed on five healthy subjects. A musculoskeletal model of the right leg actuated by 43 Hill-type muscles was scaled to each subject and used to calculate joint moments, muscle-tendon kinematics and moment arms. Muscle activations were then estimated using SynO with two to six synergies and traditional SO, and these estimates were compared with EMG measurements. SynO neither improved SO prediction of experimental activation patterns nor provided SO exact matching of joint moments. Finally, synergy analysis was performed on SO estimated activations, being found that the reconstructed activations produced poor matching of experimental activations and joint moments. As conclusion, it can be said that, although SynO did not improve prediction of muscle activations during gait, its reduced dimensional control space could be beneficial for applications such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) or motion control and prediction.",

MiR476a exhibited inducible expression during AR formation and directly targets several Restorer of Fertility like (RFL) genes encoding mitochondrion-localized pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. Genetic modification of miR476-RFL expression revealed the miR476/RFL-mediated dynamic regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis on AR formation in transgenic poplar. Furthermore, mitochondrial perturbation via exogenous chemical inhibitor validated that the miR476a/RFL-directed AR formation depended on mitochondrial regulation though modulating the auxin pathway. Our results established a miRNA-directed mitochondrion-auxin signaling cascade required for AR development, providing novel insights into the understanding of mitochondrial regulation on plant developmental plasticity.",

We found that convolutional neural networks outperformed capsule networks in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The capsule networks had the most robust performance at detecting one specific category of cell images. An ensemble of three best-fitted single-architecture models achieves the highest overall accuracy, precision, and recall due to complementary performances. In addition, extending classification classes and augmentation of the training dataset can improve the predictions of the biological categories in our study.

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic profiling is a computational method to predict genes involved in the same biological process by identifying protein families which tend to be jointly lost or retained across the tree of life. Phylogenetic profiling has customarily been more widely used with prokaryotes than eukaryotes, because the method is thought to require many diverse genomes. There are now many eukaryotic genomes available, but these are considerably larger, and typical phylogenetic profiling methods require quadratic time or worse in the number of genes. We introduce a fast, scalable phylogenetic profiling approach entitled HogProf, which leverages hierarchical orthologous groups for the construction of large profiles and locality-sensitive hashing for efficient retrieval of similar profiles. We show that the approach outperforms Enhanced Phylogenetic Tree, a phylogeny-based method, and use the tool to reconstruct networks and query for interactors of the kinetochore complex as well as conserved proteins involved in sexual reproduction: Hap2, Spo11 and Gex1. HogProf enables large-scale phylogenetic profiling across the three domains of life, and will be useful to predict biological pathways among the hundreds of thousands of eukaryotic species that will become available in the coming few years.

The potential of osteoblasts to induce osteoclastogenesis is characterized by a switch of OPG (low osteoclastogenic potential) towards RANKL production (high osteoclastogenic potential).\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the influence of endogenous Syndecan-1 on local bone-cell-communication via the RANKL/OPG-axis in murine osteoblasts and osteoclasts in wild type and Syndecan-1 lacking cells. Syndecan-1 expression and secretion was increased in osteoblasts with high osteoclastogenic potential. Syndecan-1 deficiency led to increased OPG release by osteoblasts that decreased the availability of RANKL. In co-cultures of Syndecan-1 deficient osteoblasts with osteoclast these increased OPG in supernatant caused decreased development of osteoclasts. Syndecan-1 and RANKL level were increased in serum of aged WT mice, whereas Syndecan-1 deficient mice showed high serum OPG concentration. However, bone structure of Syndecan-1 deficient mice was not different compared to wild type.\n\nIn conclusion, Syndecan-1 could be regarded as a new modulator of bone-cell-communication via RANKL/OPG axis. This might be of high impact during bone regeneration or bone diseases like cancer where Syndecan-1 expression is known to be even more prevalent.",

Our results show that maternal exposure to PM2.5 led to an elevation in blood glucose levels within the two following generations (F1 and F2). There was also an increase in DNA methylation in the aforementioned promoter regions accompanied by reduced gene expression in generations F1 and F2 upon F0 exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy. These data suggest that maternal exposure to PM2.5 from air pollution, particularly during pregnancy, may lead to a multigenerational and lifelong negative impact on glucose homeostasis mediated by an increase in DNA methylation within the promoter region of the genes Pdx1 and NEUROG3 in pancreatic islets.",

    "abstract": "Strongyloidiasis is a prevailing helminth infection ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas. However, prevalence data are scarce in migrant populations.\n\nThis study aims at evaluating the prevalence of S. stercoralis at hospital level in migrant populations or long term travellers being attended in out-patient and in-patient units as part of a systematic screening implemented in 6 Spanish hospitals. A cross-sectional study was conducted and systematic screening for S. stercoralis infection using serological tests was offered to all eligible participants. The overall seroprevalence of S. stercoralis was 9.04% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 7.76 -10.31). The seroprevalence of people with a risk of infection acquired in Africa and Latin America was 9.35% (95%CI 7.01-11.69), 9.22% (7.5-10.93), respectively. The number of individuals coming from Asian countries was significantly smaller and the overall prevalence in these countries was 2.9% (95%CI -0.3; -6.2). There was only one case (1/14 (7.14%) from an individual from East European countries. The seroprevalence in units attending potentially immunosuppressed patients was significantly lower (5.64%) compared with the seroprevalence in other units of the hospital (10.20%) or Tropical diseases units (13.33%) (p<0.001). Conclusions: We report a hospital-based systematic screening of strongyloidiasis with a seroprevalence of almost 10% in a mobile population coming from endemic areas suggesting the need of implementing strongyloidiasis screening in hospitalized patients coming from endemic areas, particularly if they are at risk of immunosuppression.\n\nAuthor summaryStrongyloidiasis is an infection caused by the helminth Strongyloides stercoralis which is ubiquitous in tropical and subtropical areas. In the rest of the countries, it is also frequent in migrants coming from tropical and subtropical areas. The disease is more severe when an infected subject has an impaired immune system. Within this study we have evaluated the prevalence of this infection in people being attended in six Spanish hospitals. The prevalence was around 9%, being higher in Africa and Latin America compared with other regions. In addition, the prevalence in patients with an impaired immune system (immunosuppression) was lower compared with people non suffering immunosuppression. These results suggest that the prevalence of strongyloidiasis is quite high among migrants living in Spain and that a screening programme should be designed, particularly in immunosuppressed patients that are at more risk of suffering severe complications of the infection.",

    "abstract": "Trophic interactions can result in changes to the abundance and distribution of habitat-forming species that dramatically reduce ecosystem health and functioning. Nowhere may this be as dramatic as in the coastal zone of the Aleutian Archipelago, where overgrazing by herbivorous sea urchins that began in the 1980s resulted in widespread deforestation of the regions kelp forests. Here we show that this deforestation resulted in decreased macroalgal and invertebrate abundance and diversity, increased benthic irradiances, and reduced rates of gross primary production and respiration by the ecosystem. These opposing metabolic processes remain in balance, however, which resulted in little-to-no changes to net ecosystem production. These patterns were consistent across nine islands spanning more than 1000 kilometers of the archipelago. In light of the worldwide declines in kelp forests observed in recent decades, our findings suggest that marine deforestation profoundly affects the health of coastal ecosystems and how they function.\n\nSignificance statementWidespread marine deforestation results in reduced biodiversity and primary productivity throughout more than 1000 km of the Aleutian Archipelago.",

    "abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogenic virus that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration in pigs of all ages. Deoxynivalenol (DON), the most abundant trichothecene in food and feed, causes vomit and diarrhea in animals and human. However, whether DON exposure could affect PEDV infection remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the impacts of DON on entry and replication of PEDV, morbidity situation of piglets and the mechanisms involved. In vivo, twenty-seven piglets infected naturally with PEDV were randomly divided into three groups, receiving the basal diet containing 0, 750 and 1500 g/kg DON, respectively. We observed significant increases in the diarrhea rates, the villous injury of jejunums and the PEDV proliferation of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and mesenterium of piglets in experimental groups compared with control. Additionally, the autophagosome-like vesicles and the autophagy-related protein expressions were also increased in experimental groups. In vitro, we observed that, approximately 2 hrs post-infection, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M DON promoted PEDV entry (P < 0.05) in IPEC-J2s and resulted in tight junction protein occludin internalization. Knockdown of occludin and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of LC3B indicated a vital role of autophagy-induced occludin internalization in DON-promoted PEDV entry. We also observed that, 24 hrs post-infection, a significant increase in PEDV replication after 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M DON treatment, along with the induction of a complete autophagy. Specifically, deletion of LC3B indicated a crucial role of autophagy in DON-promoted PEDV replication. Pretreatment with SB202190, a p38 signaling inhibitor, abolished the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, downregulation of type I interferon revealed that DON contributed PEDV to escape innate immune. Mechanistically, DON-caused innate immune escape was related to the upregulation of LC3B, which further inhibited STING phosphorylation. Taken together, DON could promote PEDV infection by inducing occludin internalization and innate immune escape via triggering p38-mediated autophagy.\n\nAuthor summaryPorcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease, leads to catastrophic economic loss to the global pig industry. Its primary pathogen is the coronavirus PED virus (PEDV). Growing evidence indicates that pathogen infection is not the only factor of PED outbreaks, other non-infectious factors is also related to this disease. We guessed some ubiquitous substances, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), that lead to pig intestinal epithelial cell stress might encourage the progress and spread of PED. In the present study, the weaning piglets infected naturally with PEDV and the IPEC-J2 cell line were selected as models to explore the effects of DON on PEDV infection, morbidity and gut barrier. Our results showed that DON exposure can promote PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism might be related to LC3B-mediated autophagy. Our findings reveal new pathways for developing potential novel antiviral strategies against PEDV infection.",

    "abstract": "Hospital acquired infections are responsible for morbidity and mortality worldwide. Acinetobacter spp. infections are particularly notorious for complicating patient management in ICU settings. Extremely high mortality rates are associated with Acinetobacter infections because of their resistance to first- and second-line drugs. There is imminent need to develop infections control systems that are specific and environment friendly. Here, we report a proof-of-concept anti-Acinetobacter spp. bacteriophage-based infection control assay that is very target specific as well as innocuous to environment. extensively drug resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii strain was inoculated at various solid surfaces. A bacteriophage, enriched in the same strain, was applied on the inoculated surfaces. Phenol (carbolic acid) was used as a positive control. We show that bacteriophages can be used as infection control agents. In our assay, they killed XDR Acinetobacter baumannii present on solid surfaces. Our bacteriophage was extremely effective at reducing the CFU of inoculated strain to almost undetectable levels.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to identify new drugs for therapeutic and preventive treatments against parasitic nematodes have gained increasing interest with expanding pathogen omics databases and drug databases from which new anthelmintic compounds might be identified. Here, a novel approach focused on integrating a pan-Nematoda multi-omics data targeted to a specific nematode organ system (the intestinal tract) with evidence-based filtering and chemogenomic screening was undertaken. Based on de novo computational target prioritization of the 3,564 conserved intestine genes in A. suum, exocytosis was identified as a high priority pathway, and predicted inhibitors of exocytosis were tested using the large roundworm (Ascaris suum larval stages), a filarial worm (Brugia pahangi adult and L3), a whipworm (Trichuris muris adult), and the non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. 10 of 13 inhibitors were found to cause rapid immotility in A. suum L3 larvae, and five inhibitors were effective against the three phylogenetically diverse parasitic nematode species, indicating potential for a broad spectrum anthelmintics. Several distinct pathologic phenotypes were resolved related to molting, motility, or intestinal cell and tissue damage using conventional and novel histologic methods. Pathologic profiles characteristic for each inhibitor will guide future research to uncover mechanisms of the anthelmintic effects and improve on drug designs. This progress firmly validates the focus on intestinal cell biology as a useful resource to develop novel anthelmintic strategies.\n\nAuthor summaryThe intestinal cells of parasitic nematodes are not known to regenerate, therefore disruption of essential processes that cause irreparable damage to intestinal cells is expected to promote worm expulsion. To facilitate improved methods of therapy we need to better understand the basic intestinal cell and tissue functions of this critical organ. To that end have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of multi-omics omics data and identify and prioritize intestinal genes/pathways with essential functions and associated drugs and established a foundational model of the STH intestinal system using the large roundworm Ascaris suum to test and validate inhibitors of these functions. We found 10 inhibitors to impacted motility, and seven of those showed severe pathology and an apparent irreparable damage to intestinal cells. Furthermore, five inhibitors were effective against the three phylogenetically diverse parasitic nematode species, indicating potential for a broad spectrum anthelmintics. Our results firmly validate the focus on intestinal cell biology as a useful resource to develop novel anthelmintic strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundScrub typhus is a severely ignored tropical disease and a leading cause of undifferentiated febrile illness worldwide caused by infection of an obligate intracellular bacteria Orientia tsutsugamushi. It has been rapidly expanding in South Asian countries, although clear epidemiological information is not available from Nepal. After the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, a sudden upsurge in scrub typhus cases was reported. The objective of this study was to investigate scrub typhus and its causative agents in human, rodent and chigger mites to better understand the ongoing transmission ecology.\n\nMethodsScrub typhus cases with confirmed diagnosis throughout the country were included in the analysis. Studies were concentrated in the Chitwan district, the site of a major outbreak in 2016. Additional country-wide data from 2015 to 2017 was made available from the government database to analyse the disease distribution using geographical mapping.\n\nResultsDuring 2015-2017, 1,239 scrub typhus cases were confirmed with the largest outbreak occurring in 2016 with 831 (67.1%) cases. The remainder 267 cases were reported in 2017. The case fatality rate was 5.7% in 2015 and declined to 1.1% in 2017. Nationwide outbreak of scrub typhus was identified as the cases were found from 52 of the 75 districts of Nepal. A seasonal trend was observed with a peak during August and September (p = 0.01). In addition to the human cases, the presence of O. tsutsugamushi was also confirmed in rodents and chigger mites from the outbreak areas of southern Nepal.\n\nConclusionThe detection of O. tsutsugamushi in human, rodent, and chigger mites from outbreak locations and wide-spread reports of scrub typhus throughout the country over two years confirms the ongoing transmission of O. tsutsugamushi with a firmly established ecology in Nepal. The countrys health system needs to be strengthened for systematic surveillance, early outbreaks detection, and immediate response actions including treatment and preventive measures.\n\nAuthor SummaryScrub typhus is a disease caused by a bacteria called Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted to people through bites of infected chiggers (larval mites). After the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, a sudden upsurge in scrub typhus cases was reported with repeated outbreaks from different parts of the country. This study has documted epidemiology of scrub typhus and its causative agents in human, rodent and chigger mites confimring the local transmission O. tsutsugamushi with a firmly established ecology in Nepal. The local transmission of the diseases from most parts of the country demands strengthening for systematic surveillance, early outbreaks detection, and immediate response actions including treatment and preventive measures.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) evolved as a unique effector mechanism contributing to resistance against infection that can also promote tissue damage in inflammatory conditions. Malaria infection can trigger NET release, but the mechanisms and consequences of NET formation in this context remain poorly characterized. Here we show, similarly to previous reports, that patients suffering from severe malaria had increased amounts of circulating DNA and increased neutrophil elastase (NE) levels in plasma. We used cultured erythrocytes and isolated human neutrophils to show that Plasmodium-infected red blood cells release MIF, which in turn caused NET formation by neutrophils in a mechanism dependent on the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). NET production was dependent on histone citrulination by PAD4 and independent of reactive oxygen species (ROS), myeloperoxidase (MPO) or NE. In vitro, NETs functioned to restrain parasite dissemination in a mechanism dependent on MPO and NE activities. Finally, C57/B6 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA, a well-established model of cerebral malaria, presented high amounts of circulating DNA, while treatment with DNAse increased parasitemia and accelerated mortality, indicating a role for NETs in resistance against Plasmodium infection.\n\nAuthor summaryProtozoans of the Plasmodium genre infect red blood cells and cause malaria in humans and various other mammalian species. Estimated malaria cases are at more than 200 million, with 450,000 deaths per year, being cerebral malaria a serious complication that accounts for the majority of deaths. Neutrophils are cells that participate in host defense against pathogens. These cells use various mechanisms to kill invading microrganisms, including the release of webs of DNA, called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These NETs can help control infections but can also induce tissue damage and their role in malaria and the mechanisms of NET production during malaria infection are starting to be understood. Here we show that infected red blood cells produce a cytokine, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) that stimulates neutrophils to release NETs. These NETs function to limit Plasmodium dissemination and, thus, digestion of NETs with DNAse treatment causes increased parasitemia and accelerated death in an experimental model of cerebral malaria. Our study uncovers the mechanism by which infected red blood cells stimulate neutrophils to release NETs and suggest an important participation of this process in malaria control.",
