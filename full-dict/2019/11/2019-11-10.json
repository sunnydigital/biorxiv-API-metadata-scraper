    "abstract": "In mammalian cells, >25% of synthesized proteins are exported through the secretory pathway. The pathway complexity, however, obfuscates its impact on the secretion of different proteins. Unraveling its impact on diverse proteins is particularly important for biopharmaceutical production. Here we delineate the core secretory pathway functions and integrate them with genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human, mouse, and Chinese hamster cells. The resulting reconstructions enable the computation of energetic costs and machinery demands of each secreted protein. By integrating additional omics data, we find that highly secretory cells have adapted to reduce expression and secretion of other expensive host cell proteins. Furthermore, we predict metabolic costs and maximum productivities of biotherapeutic proteins and identify protein features that most significantly impact protein secretion. Finally, the model successfully predicts the increase in secretion of a monoclonal antibody after silencing a highly expressed selection marker. This work represents a knowledgebase of the mammalian secretory pathway that serves as a novel tool for systems biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Systemic amyloidosis represents a class of disorders in which misfolded proteins are secreted by effector organs and deposited as proteotoxic aggregates at downstream target tissues. Despite being well-described clinically, the contribution of effector organs such as the liver to the pathogenesis of these diseases is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model of hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloid disease (ATTR amyloidosis) in order to define the contributions of hepatic cells to the distal proteotoxicity of secreted TTR. To this end, we employ a gene correction strategy to generate isogenic, ATTR amyloidosis patient-specific iPSCs expressing either amyloidogenic or wild-type TTR. We further utilize this gene editing strategy in combination with single cell RNAseq to identify multiple hepatic proteostasis factors, including many components of adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways, whose expression correlates with the production of destabilized TTR variants in iPSC-derived hepatic cells. We further demonstrate that enhancing ER proteostasis within ATTR amyloidosis iPSC-derived hepatic lineages via stress-independent activation of aforementioned adaptive UPR signaling preferentially reduces the secretion of destabilized amyloidogenic TTR. Together, these results suggest the potential of the liver to chaperone-at-a-distance and impact pathogenesis at downstream target cells in the context of systemic amyloid disease, and further highlight the promise of UPR modulating therapeutics for the treatment of TTR-mediated and other amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "The initial characterization and clustering of biological samples is a critical step in the analysis of any transcriptomic study. In many studies, principal component analysis (PCA) is the clustering algorithm of choice to predict the relationship of samples or cells based solely on differential gene expression. In addition to the pure quality evaluation of the data, a PCA can also provide initial insights into the biological background of an experiment and help researchers to interpret the data and design the subsequent computational steps accordingly. However, to avoid misleading clusterings and interpretations, an appropriate selection of the underlying gene sets to build the PCA and the choice of the most fitting principal components for the visualization are crucial parts. Here, we present PCAGO, an easy-to-use and interactive web service to analyze gene quantification data derived from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments with PCA. The tool includes features such as read-count normalization, filtering of read counts by gene annotation, and various visualization options. Additionally, PCAGO helps to select appropriate parameters such as the number of genes and principal components to create meaningful visualizations.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe web service is implemented in R and freely available at pcago.bioinf.uni-jena.de.\n\nContactmartin.hoelzer@uni-jena.de",

In the studied area, Salpa thompsoni hot spot distributions have been located mostly around Elephant Island but also within islands around Brensfield and Gerlache Straits, as well as to the south near the cold Bellingshausen Sea.

    "abstract": "1Missense variants are present amongst the healthy population, but some of them are causative of human diseases. Therefore, a classification of variants associated with \\\"healthy\\\" or \\\"diseased\\\" states is not always straightforward. A deeper understanding of the nature of missense variants in health and disease, the cellular processes they may affect, and the general molecular principles which underlie these differences, is essential to better distinguish pathogenic from population variants. Here we quantify variant enrichment across full-length proteins, their domains and 3D-structure defined regions. We integrate this with available transcriptomic and proteomic (protein half-life, thermal stability, abundance) data. Using this approach we have mined a rich set of molecular features which enable us to understand the differences underlying pathogenic and population variants: pathogenic variants mainly affect proteins involved in cell proliferation and nucleotide processing, localise to protein cores and interaction interfaces, and are enriched in more abundant proteins. In terms of their molecular properties, we find that common population variants and pathogenic variants show the greatest contrast. Additionally, in contrary to other studies, we find that rare population variants display features closer to common than pathogenic variants. This study provides molecular details into how different proteins exhibit resilience and/or sensitivity towards missense variants. Such details could be harnessed to predict variant deleteriousness, and prioritise variant-enriched proteins and protein domains for therapeutic targeting and development. The ZoomVar database, which we created for this study, is available at http://fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/ZoomVar. It allows users to programmatically annotate a large number of missense variants with protein structural information, and to calculate variant enrichment in different protein structural regions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOne of the greatest challenges in understanding the genetic basis of diseases is to discriminate between likely harmless and potentially disease-causing sequence variants. To better evaluate the pathogenic potential of missense variants, we developed a strategy to quantitatively measure the enrichment of both disease and non disease-related variants within a protein based on its structural and domain organisation. By integrating available transcriptomics and proteomics data, our approach distinguishes pathogenic from population variants far more clearly than previously possible, and reveals hitherto unknown details of how different proteins exhibit resilience and/or sensitivity towards genetic variants. Our results will help to prioritise variant-enriched proteins for therapeutic targeting; we have created the ZoomVar database, accessible at http://fraternalilab.kcl.ac.uk/ZoomVar, for programmatic mapping of user-defined variants to protein structural and domain information.",

    "abstract": "The genetic control of gene expression is a core component of human physiology. For the past several years, transcriptome-wide association studies have leveraged large datasets of linked genotype and RNA sequencing information to create a powerful gene-based test of association that has been used in dozens of studies. While numerous discoveries have been made, the populations in the training data are overwhelmingly of European descent, and little is known about the generalizability of these models to other populations. Here, we test for cross-population generalizability of gene expression prediction models using a dataset of African American individuals with RNA-Seq data in whole blood. We find that the default models trained in large datasets such as GTEx and DGN fare poorly in African Americans, with a notable reduction in prediction accuracy when compared to European Americans. We replicate these limitations in cross-population generalizability using the five populations in the GEUVADIS dataset. Via realistic simulations of both populations and gene expression, we show that accurate cross-population generalizability of transcriptome prediction only arises when eQTL architecture is substantially shared across populations. In contrast, models with non-identical eQTLs showed patterns similar to real-world data. Therefore, generating RNA-Seq data in diverse populations is a critical step towards multi-ethnic utility of gene expression prediction.\n\nAuthor summaryAdvances in RNA sequencing technology have reduced the cost of measuring gene expression at a genome-wide level. However, sequencing enough human RNA samples for adequately-powered disease association studies remains prohibitively costly. To this end, modern transcriptome-wide association analysis tools leverage existing paired genotype-expression datasets by creating models to predict gene expression using genotypes. These predictive models enable researchers to perform cost-effective association tests with gene expression in independently genotyped samples. However, most of these models use European reference data, and the extent to which gene expression prediction models work across populations is not fully resolved. We observe that these models predict gene expression worse than expected in a dataset of African-Americans when derived from European-descent individuals. Using simulations, we show that gene expression predictive model performance depends on both the amount of shared genotype predictors as well as the genetic relatedness between populations. Our findings suggest a need to carefully select reference populations for prediction and point to a pressing need for more genetically diverse genotype-expression datasets.",

    "abstract": "Neutral genetic diversity across the genome is determined by the complex interplay of mutation, demographic history, and natural selection. While the direct action of natural selection is limited to functional loci across the genome, its impact can have effects on nearby neutral loci due to genetic linkage. These effects of selection at linked sites, referred to as genetic hitchhiking and background selection (BGS), are pervasive across natural populations. However, only recently has there been a focus on the joint consequences of demography and selection at linked sites, and empirical studies have sometimes come to apparently contradictory conclusions as to their combined effects. In order to understand the relationship between demography and selection at linked sites, we conducted an extensive forward simulation study of BGS under a range of demographic models. We found that the relative levels of diversity in BGS and neutral regions vary over time and that the initial dynamics after a population size change are often in the opposite direction of the long-term expected trajectory. Our detailed observations of the temporal dynamics of neutral diversity in the context of selection at linked sites in non-equilibrium populations provides new intuition about why patterns of diversity under BGS vary through time in natural populations and help reconcile previously contradictory observations. Most notably, our results highlight that classical models of BGS are poorly suited for predicting diversity in non-equilibrium populations.",

    "abstract": "Impaired lung function is often caused by cigarette smoking, making it challenging to disentangle its role in lung cancer susceptibility. Investigation of the shared genetic basis of these phenotypes in the UK Biobank and International Lung Cancer Consortium (29,266 cases, 56,450 controls) shows that lung cancer is genetically correlated with reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1: rg=0.098, p=2.3x10-8) and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC: rg=0.137, p=2.0x10-12). Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate that reduced FEV1 increases squamous cell carcinoma risk (odds ratio (OR)=1.51, 95% confidence intervals: 1.21-1.88), while reduced FEV1/FVC increases the risk of adenocarcinoma (OR=1.17, 1.01-1.35) and lung cancer in never smokers (OR=1.56, 1.05-2.30). These findings support a causal role of pulmonary impairment in lung cancer etiology. Integrative analyses reveal that pulmonary function instruments, including 73 novel variants, influence lung tissue gene expression and implicate immune-related pathways in mediating the observed effects on lung carcinogenesis.",

In the context of cancer therapeutics, plasticity refers to transient fluctuations in the molecular state of tumor cells, driving the formation of rare cells primed to survive drug treatment and ultimately reprogram into a stably resistant fate. However, the biological processes governing this cellular plasticity remain unknown. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to reveal genes that affect cell fate decisions by altering cellular plasticity across a range of functional categories. We found that cellular plasticity and cell fate decision making can be decoupled in that factors can affect cell fate decisions in both plasticity-dependent and independent manners. We discovered a novel mode of altering resistance based on cellular plasticity that, contrary to known mechanisms, pushes cells towards a more differentiated state. We further confirmed our prediction that manipulating cellular plasticity before the addition of the main therapy would result in changes in therapy resistance more than concurrent administration. Together, our results indicate that identifying pathways modulating cellular plasticity has the potential to alter cell fate decisions and may provide a new avenue for treating drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The past century has seen substantial theoretical and empirical progress on the genetic basis of adaptation. Over this same period a pressing need to prevent the evolution of drug resistance has uncovered much about the potential genetic basis of persistence in declining populations. However, we have little theory to predict and generalize how persistence - by sufficiently rapid adaptation - might be realized in this explicitly demographic scenario. Here we use Fishers geometric model with absolute fitness to begin a line of theoretical inquiry into the genetic basis of evolutionary rescue, focusing here on asexual populations that adapt through de novo mutations. We show how the dominant genetic path to rescue switches from a single mutation to multiple as mutation rates and the severity of the environmental change increase. In multi-step rescue, intermediate genotypes that themselves go extinct provide a  springboard to rescue genotypes. Comparing to a scenario where persistence is assured, our approach allows us to quantify how a race between evolution and extinction leads to a genetic basis of adaptation that is composed of fewer loci of larger effect. We hope this work brings awareness to the impact of demography on the genetic basis of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Co-production of two or more desirable compounds from low-cost substrates by a single microbial catalyst could greatly improve the economic competitiveness of many biotechnological processes. However, reports demonstrating the adoption of such co-production strategy are still scarce. In this study, the ability of genome-edited strain Psudomonas putida EM42 to simultaneously valorise D-xylose and D-cellobiose -two important lignocellulosic carbohydrates -by converting them into the platform chemical D-xylonic acid and medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoates, respectively, was investigated. Biotransformation experiments performed with P. putida resting cells showed that promiscuous periplasmic glucose oxidation route can efficiently generate extracellular xylonate with high yield reaching 0.97 g per g of supplied xylose. Xylose oxidation was subsequently coupled to the growth of P. putida with cytoplasmic {beta}-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca on D-cellobiose. This disaccharide turned out to be a better co-substrate for xylose-to-xylonate biotransformation than monomeric glucose. This was because unlike glucose, cellobiose did not block oxidation of the pentose by periplasmic glucose dehydrogenase Gcd, but, similarly to glucose, it was a suitable substrate for polyhydroxyalkanoate formation in P. putida. Co-production of extracellular xylose-born xylonate and intracellular cellobiose-born medium chain length polyhydroxyalkanoates was established in proof-of-concept experiments with P. putida grown on the disaccharide. This study highlights the potential of P. putida EM42 as a microbial platform for the production of xylonic acid, identifies cellobiose as a new substrate for mcl-PHA production, and proposes a fresh strategy for the simultaneous valorisation of xylose and cellobiose.",

    "abstract": "Infant crying is an innate communicative behavior that is frequently impaired in certain neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Since advanced paternal age is a reported risk factor for NDDs in offspring, we evaluated the impact of a fathers age on early vocal development in C57BL/6J mice. We recorded and applied a unique combination of computational analyses to ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) emitted by mouse pups sired by young and aged fathers. Our data showed that advanced paternal age reduced the number and duration of USVs, and altered the syllable composition in pups. Moreover, pups born to young fathers showed convergent vocal characteristics with a rich repertoire during postnatal development, while those born to aged fathers exhibited more divergent vocal patterns with limited repertoire. Principal component analysis in conjunction with clustering analysis demonstrated that pups from aged fathers deviated from typical trajectories of vocal development, which were considered as atypical individuals. Thus, our study indicates that advanced paternal age has a significant effect on offsprings early vocal development. It is suggested that the trajectories of vocal development could be a useful marker of the NDD-like phenotype associated with the advanced paternal age. In addition, our comprehensive computational analysis described here is an effective approach to characterize the altered individual diversity relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAdvanced paternal age affects vocal development in early postnatal mice, with more pups showing atypical developmental trajectories.",

    "abstract": "In a multi-speaker scenario, a hearing aid lacks information on which speaker the user intends to attend, and therefore it often mistakenly treats the latter as noise while enhancing an interfering speaker. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to decode the attended speaker from the brain activity, e.g., recorded by electroencephalography sensors. While numerous of these auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms appeared in the literature, their performance is generally evaluated in a non-uniform manner. Furthermore, AAD algorithms typically introduce a trade-off between the AAD accuracy and the time needed to make an AAD decision, which hampers an objective benchmarking as it remains unclear which point in each algorithms trade-off space is the optimal one in a context of neuro-steered gain control. To this end, we present an interpretable performance metric to evaluate AAD algorithms, based on an adaptive gain control system, steered by AAD decisions. Such a system can be modeled as a Markov chain, from which the minimal expected switch duration (MESD) can be calculated and interpreted as the expected time required to switch the operation of the hearing aid after an attention switch of the user, thereby resolving the trade-off between AAD accuracy and decision time. Furthermore, we show that the MESD calculation provides an automatic and theoretically founded procedure to optimize the number of gain levels and decision time in an AAD-based adaptive gain control system.",

    "abstract": "Rehearsal during working memory (WM) maintenance facilitates retrieval. Less is known about how rehearsal modulates WM delay activity. In the present study, 44 participants completed a Sternberg Task with either intact novel scenes or phase-scrambled scenes, which had similar color and spatial frequency but lacked semantic content. During each condition participants generated a descriptive label and covertly rehearsed or suppressed (repeated \"the\") during the delay. This was easy in the former but more difficult in the later condition where scenes lacked semantic content. Behavioral performance and EEG delay activity was analyzed as a function of maintenance strategy. Performance during WM revealed a benefit of rehearsal for phase-scrambled but not intact scenes. Examination of the absolute amplitude revealed three underlying sources of activity for rehearsal, including the left anterior temporal (TAL), left and midline parietal regions. Increases in alpha and theta activity in TAL were correlated with improvement in performance on WM with rehearsal only when labeling was not automatic (i.e. phase-scrambled scenes), which may reflect differences in labeling and rehearsal (i.e. semantic associations vs. shallow labels). We conclude that rehearsal only benefits memory for visual stimuli that lack semantic information, and that this is correlated with changes in alpha and theta rhythms.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSusceptibility distortions impact diffusion MRI data analysis and is typically corrected during preprocessing. Correction strategies involve three classes of methods: registration to a structural image, the use of a fieldmap, or the use of images acquired with opposing phase encoding directions. It has been demonstrated that phase encoding based methods outperform the other two classes, but unfortunately, the choice of which phase encoding based method to use is still an open question due to the absence of any systematic comparisons.\\n\\nMethodsIn this paper we quantitatively evaluated six popular phase encoding based methods for correcting susceptibility distortions in diffusion MRI data. We employed a framework that allows for the simulation of realistic diffusion MRI data with susceptibility distortions. We evaluated the ability for methods to correct distortions by comparing the corrected data with the ground truth. Four diffusion tensor metrics (FA, MD, eigenvalues and eigenvectors) were calculated from the corrected data and compared with the ground truth. We also validated two popular indirect metrics using both simulated data and real data. The two indirect metrics are the difference between the corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation over the corrected LR, RL, AP and PA data.\\n\\nResultsWe found that DR-BUDDI and TOPUP offered the most accurate and robust correction compared to the other four methods using both direct and indirect evaluation metrics. EPIC and HySCO performed well in correcting b0 images but produced poor corrections for diffusion weighted volumes, and also they produced large errors for the four diffusion tensor metrics. We also demonstrate that the indirect metric (the difference between corrected LR and AP data) gives a different ordering of correction quality than the direct metric.\\n\\nConclusionWe suggest researchers to use DR-BUDDI or TOPUP for susceptibility distortion correction. The two indirect metrics (the difference between corrected LR and AP data, and the FA standard deviation) should be interpreted together as a measure of distortion correction quality. We also suggest that indirect metrics must be interpreted cautiously when evaluating methods for correcting susceptibility distortions in diffusion MRI data.",

    "abstract": "Injured tendons heal through the formation of a fibrovascular scar that has inferior mechanical properties compared to native tendon tissue. Reducing inflammation that occurs as a result of the injury could limit scar formation and improve functional recovery of tendons. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) plays an important role in promoting inflammation in some injury responses and chronic disease processes, and the inhibition of PGD2 has improved healing and reduced disease burden in animal models and early clinical trials. Based on these findings, we sought to determine the role of PGD2 signaling in the healing of injured tendon tissue. We tested the hypothesis that a potent and specific inhibitor of hematopoietic PGD synthase (HPGDS), GSK2894631A, would improve the recovery of tendons of adult male rats following an acute tenotomy and repair. To test this hypothesis, we performed a full-thickness plantaris tendon tenotomy followed by immediate repair and treated rats twice daily with either 0mg/kg, 2mg/kg, or 6mg/kg of GSK2894631A. Tendons were collected either 7 or 21 days after surgical repair, and mechanical properties of tendons were assessed along with RNA sequencing and histology. While there were some differences in gene expression across groups, the targeted inhibition of HPGDS did not impact the functional repair of tendons after injury as HPGDS expression was surprisingly low in injured tendons. These results indicate that PGD2 signaling does not appear to be important in modulating the repair of injured tendon tissue.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKRAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers, but its activating mutations have remained undruggable due to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP and its smooth protein structure resulting in the absence of known allosteric regulatory sites.\n\nResultsWith the goal of treating mutated KRAS-driven cancers, two CRISPR systems, CRISPR-SpCas9 genome-editing system and transcription-regulating system dCas9-KRAB, were developed to directly deplete KRAS mutant allele or to repress its transcription in cancer cells, respectively, through guide RNA specifically targeting the mutant but not wild-type allele. The effect of in vitro proliferation and cell cycle on cancer cells as well as in vivo tumor growth was examined after delivery of Cas9 system. SpCas9 and dCas9-KRAB systems with sgRNA targeting the mutant allele both blocked the expression of mutant KRAS gene, leading to an inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Local adenoviral injections using SpCas9 and dCas9-KRAB systems both suppressed tumor growth in vivo. The gene-depletion system (SpCas9) performed more effectively than the transcription-suppressing system (dCas9-KRAB) on tumor inhibition. Application of both Cas9 systems to wild-type KRAS tumor cells did not affect cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, through bioinformatic analysis of 31555 SNP mutations of the top 20 cancer driver genes, we showed that our mutant-specific editing strategy could be extended to a list of oncogenic mutations with high editing potentials, and this pipeline can be applied to analyze the distribution of PAM sequence in the genome to survey the best targets for other editing purpose.\n\nConclusionsWe successfully developed both gene-depletion and transcription-suppressing systems to specifically target an oncogenic mutant allele of KRAS which led to significant tumor regression. It provides a promising strategy for the treatment of tumors with driver gene mutations.",

    "abstract": "We explore sequence determinants of enzyme activity and specificity in a major enzyme family of terpene synthases. Most enzymes in this family catalyze reactions that produce cyclic terpenes - complex hydrocarbons widely used by plants and insects in diverse biological processes such as defense, communication, and symbiosis. To analyze the molecular mechanisms of emergence of terpene cyclization, we have carried out in-depth examination of mutational space around (E)-{beta}-farnesene synthase, an Artemisia annua enzyme which catalyzes production of a linear hydrocarbon chain. Each mutant enzyme in our synthetic libraries was characterized biochemically, and the resulting reaction rate data was used as input to the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics, in which free energies were represented as sums of one-amino-acid contributions and two-amino-acid couplings. Our model predicts measured reaction rates with high accuracy and yields free energy landscapes characterized by relatively few coupling terms. As a result, the Michaelis-Menten free energy landscapes have simple, interpretable structure and exhibit little epistasis. We have also developed biophysical fitness models based on the assumption that highly fit enzymes have evolved to maximize the output of correct products, such as cyclic products or a specific product of interest, while minimizing the output of byproducts. This approach results in a non-linear fitness landscape which is considerably more epistatic. Overall, our experimental and computational framework provides focused characterization of evolutionary emergence of novel enzymatic functions in the context of micro-evolutionary exploration of sequence space around naturally occurring enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Growing industrial utilization of enzymes, and the increasing availability of metagenomic data highlights the demand for effective methods of targeted identification and verification of novel enzymes from various environmental microbiota. Xylanases are a class of enzymes with numerous industrial applications and are involved in the degradation of xylose, a component of lignocellulose. Optimum temperature of enzymes are essential factors to be considered when choosing appropriate biocatalysts for a particular purpose. Therefore, in-silico prediction of this attribute is a significant cost and time-effective step in the effort to characterize novel enzymes. The objective of this study was to develop a computational method to predict the thermal dependence of xylanases. This tool was then implemented for targeted screening of putative xylanases with specific thermal dependencies from metagenomic data and resulted in identification of three novel xylanases from sheep and cow rumen microbiota. Here we present TAXyl (Thermal Activity Prediction for Xylanase), a new sequence-based machine learning method that has been trained using a selected combination of various protein features. This random forest classifier discriminates non-thermophilic, thermophilic, and hyper-thermophilic xylanases. Models performance was evaluated through multiple iterations of six-fold cross-validations, and it exhibited a mean accuracy of [~]0.79. TAXyl is freely accessible as a web-service.",

    "abstract": "Targeting Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is challenging because treatment options are limited, and high recurrence rates are common. One reason for this is that hypervirulent CDI often has a binary toxin termed the C. difficile toxin (CDT), in addition to the enterotoxins TsdA and TsdB. CDT has an enzymatic component, termed CDTa, and a pore-forming or delivery subunit termed CDTb. CDTb was characterized here using a combination of single particle cryoEM, X-ray crystallography, NMR, and other biophysical methods. In the absence of CDTa, two novel di-heptamer structures for activated CDTb (aCDTb; 1.0 MDa) were solved at atomic resolution including a symmetric (SymCDTb; 3.14 [A]) and an asymmetric form (AsymCDTb; 2.84 [A]). Roles played by two receptor-binding domains of aCDTb were of particular interest since RBD1 lacks sequence homology to any other known toxin, and the RBD2 domain is completely absent in other well-studied heptameric toxins (i.e. anthrax). For AsymCDTb, a novel Ca2+ binding site was discovered in RBD1 that is important for its stability, and RBD2 was found to be critical for host cell toxicity and the novel di-heptamer fold for both forms of aCDTb. Together, these studies represent a starting point for structure-based drug-discovery strategies to targeting CDT in the most severe strains of CDI.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThere is a high burden from C. difficile infection (CDI) throughout the world, and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports more than 500,000 cases annually in the United States, resulting in an estimated 15,000 deaths. In addition to the large clostridial toxins, TcdA/TcdB, a third C. difficile binary toxin (CDT) is associated with the most serious outbreaks of drug resistant CDI in the 21st century. Here, structural biology and biophysical approaches were used to characterize the cell binding component of CDT, termed CDTb, at atomic resolution. Surprisingly, two novel structures were solved from a single sample that help to explain the molecular underpinnings of C. difficile toxicity. These structures will also be important for targeting this human pathogen via structure-based therapeutic design methods.",

    "abstract": "Haploinsufficiency of transcriptional regulators causes human congenital heart disease (CHD). However, underlying CHD gene regulatory network (GRN) imbalances are unknown. Here, we define transcriptional consequences of reduced dosage of the CHD-linked transcription factor, TBX5, in individual cells during cardiomyocyte differentiation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We discovered highly sensitive dysregulation of TBX5-dependent pathways-- including lineage decisions and genes associated with cardiomyocyte function and CHD genetics--in discrete subpopulations of cardiomyocytes. GRN analysis identified vulnerable nodes enriched for CHD genes, indicating that cardiac network stability is sensitive to TBX5 dosage. A GRN-predicted genetic interaction between Tbx5 and Mef2c was validated in mouse, manifesting as ventricular septation defects. These results demonstrate exquisite sensitivity to TBX5 dosage by diverse transcriptional responses in heterogeneous subsets of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. This predicts candidate GRNs for human CHDs, with implications for quantitative transcriptional regulation in disease.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio cholerae is a human pathogen, which is transmitted by the consumption of contaminated food or water. V. cholerae strains belonging to the serogroups O1 and O139 can cause cholera outbreaks and epidemics, a severe life-threatening diarrheal disease. In contrast, serogroups other than O1 and O139, denominated as non-O1/non-O139, have been mainly associated with sporadic cases of moderate or mild diarrhea, bacteremia and wound infections. Here we investigated the virulence determinants and phylogenetic origin of a non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strain that caused a gastroenteritis outbreak in Santiago, Chile, 2018. We found that this outbreak strain lacks the classical virulence genes harboured by O1 and O139 strains, including the cholera toxin (CT) and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). However, this strain carries genomic islands (GIs) encoding Type III and Type VI secretion systems (T3SS/T6SS) and antibiotic resistance genes. Moreover, we found these GIs are wide distributed among several lineages of non-O1/non-O139 strains. Our results suggest that the acquisition of these GIs may enhance the virulence of non-O1/non-O139 strains that lack the CT and TCP-encoding genes. Our results highlight the pathogenic potential of these V. cholerae strains.\n\nDATA SUMMARYSequence data were submitted to GenBank under the accession number SRLP00000000.

Currently, the cassava whitefly complex is divided into species and subgroups based on very limited molecular markers that did not allow clear definition of species and population structure. Based on 14,358 genome-wide SNPs from 63 cassava whitefly individuals belonging to sub-Saharan African (SSA1, SSA2 and SSA4) species, and using a well-curated mtCOI gene database, we show clear incongruities in previous taxonomic approaches underpinned by effects from pseudogenes. We show that the SSA4 species is part of the SSA2 species, and that populations of the SSA1 species comprise of south-eastern (Madagascar, Tanzania) and north-western (Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi) sub-species that show signatures of allopatric incipient speciation, with a hybrid zone separating these adjacent sub-species. These findings provide the first genomic insights into the evolution and molecular ecology of a highly cryptic hemipteran insect complex in African, and allow the systematic use of genomic data in management and control strategies for this important cassava pest.",

    "abstract": "The human genome harbors a variety of genetic variations. Single-nucleotide changes that alter amino acids in protein-coding regions are one of the major causes of human phenotypic variation and diseases. These single-amino acid variations (SAVs) are routinely found in whole genome and exome sequencing. Evaluating the functional impact of such genomic alterations is crucial for diagnosis of genetic disorders. We developed DeepSAV, a deep-learning convolutional neural network to differentiate disease-causing and benign SAVs based on a variety of protein sequence, structural and functional properties. Our method outperforms most stand-alone programs and has similar predictive power as some of the best available. We transformed DeepSAV scores of rare SAVs observed in the general population into a mutation severity measure of protein-coding genes. This measure reflects a genes tolerance to deleterious missense mutations and serves as a useful tool to study gene-disease associations. Genes implicated in cancer, autism, and viral interaction are found by this measure as intolerant to mutations, while genes associated with a number of other diseases are scored as tolerant. Among known disease-associated genes, those that are mutation-intolerant are likely to function in development and signal transduction pathways, while those that are mutation-tolerant tend to encode metabolic and mitochondrial proteins.",

Here we propose a mechanism based on the interplay between cellular mechanics and primordia patterning that results in self-sustained planar cell intercalations. Thus, we show that a location-dependent modulation of cell mechanics due to positional information leads to robust axis extension. To illustrate the plausibility of this model, we use different experimentally reported patterning mechanisms in simulations that implement mechano-signaling feedback. Our results suggest that robust elongation relies on a trade-off between cellular and tissue strains that is orchestrated via the cleavage orientation. In the particular context of axis extension in Turing-patterned primordia we report that the combination of different directional cell activities lead to synergetic effects. Altogether, our findings help to understand how the emerging phenomenon of tissue elongation emerges from the individual cell dynamics.",

Using integrative modeling, we determine the architecture of LRRK2, showing that the GTPase points towards the microtubule, while the kinase is exposed to the cytoplasm.

Here we elucidate how the BMP gradient is interpreted in the Drosophila embryo, by combining live imaging with computational modelling to infer transcriptional burst parameters at single cell resolution. By comparing burst kinetics in cells receiving different levels of BMP signaling, we show that BMP signaling controls burst frequency by regulating the promoter activation rate. We provide evidence that the promoter activation rate is influenced by both enhancer and promoter sequences, whereas Pol II loading rate is primarily modulated by the enhancer. Consistent with BMP-dependent regulation of burst frequency, the numbers of BMP target gene transcripts per cell are graded across their expression domains. We suggest that graded mRNA output is a general feature of morphogen gradient interpretation and discuss how this can impact on cell fate decisions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Antigen recognition by the B cell receptor (BCR) is a physiological trigger for reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and can be recapitulated in vitro by cross-linking of surface immunoglobulins. Previously, we identified a subset of EBV microRNAs (miRNAs) that attenuate BCR signal transduction and subsequently, dampen lytic replication in B cells. The roles of host miRNAs in virus reactivation are not completely understood. To investigate this process, we profiled the small RNAs in latently infected and reactivated Burkitts lymphoma cells, and identified several miRNAs, such as miR-141, that are induced upon BCR cross-linking. Notably, EBV encodes a viral miRNA, miR-BART9, with sequence homology to miR-141. To better understand the functions of these two miRNAs, we examined their molecular targets and experimentally validated multiple candidates commonly regulated by both miRNAs. Targets included transcriptional regulators of the EBV immediate early promoters and B cell transcription factors, leading us to hypothesize that these miRNAs modulate kinetics of the latent to lytic switch in B cells. Through functional assays, we identified roles for miR-141 and EBV miR-BART9 and one specific target, FOXO3, in lytic reactivation. Our data support a model whereby EBV exploits BCR-responsive miR-141 and further mimics activity of this miRNA family via a viral miRNA to promote productive virus replication.\n\nImportanceEBV is a human pathogen associated with several malignancies. A key aspect of lifelong virus persistence is the ability to switch between latent and lytic replication modes. Mechanisms governing latency and lytic reactivation are only partly understood, and how the EBV latent to lytic switch is post-transcriptionally regulated remains an outstanding question. This study sheds light on how miR-141 expression is regulated in Burkitts lymphoma cells, and identifies a role for FOXO3, a common target of both miR-141 and viral miR-BART9, in modulating EBV reactivation.",

Here, we investigated the multiscale structure and composition of the mussel byssus cuticle before, during and after formation to gain further insight into the processing of this hard, yet extensible metal cross-linked protein composite. Our findings reveal that the granular substructure crucial to the cuticles function as a wear-resistant coating of an extensible polymer fiber is pre-organized in condensed liquid phase secretory vesicles. These are separated into catechol-rich proto-granules enveloped in a sulfur-rich proto-matrix which fuses during secretion, forming the sub-structure of the cuticle. Metal ions are added subsequently in a site-specific way, with Fe contained in the sulfur-rich matrix and V being relegated to the granules, coordinated by catechol. We posit that this hierarchical structure self-organizes via phase separation of specific amphiphilic protein components within secretory vesicles, resulting in a meso-scale structuring, critical to the cuticles advanced function.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell barcoding technologies have recently been used to perform whole-genome sequencing of thousands of individual cells in parallel. These technologies provide the opportunity to characterize genomic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution, but their extremely low sequencing coverage (<0.05X per cell) has thus far restricted their use to identification of the total copy number of large multi-megabase segments in individual cells. However, total copy numbers do not distinguish between the two homologous chromosomes in humans, and thus provide a limited view of tumor heterogeneity and evolution missing important events such as copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). We introduce CHISEL, the first method to infer allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers in single cells and subpopulations of cells by aggregating sparse signal across thousands of individual cells. We applied CHISEL to 10 single-cell sequencing datasets from 2 breast cancer patients, each dataset containing {approx}2000 cells. We identified extensive allele-specific copy-number aberrations (CNAs) in these samples including copy-neutral LOH, whole-genome duplications (WGDs), and mirrored-subclonal CNAs in subpopulations of cells. These allele-specific CNAs alter the copy number of genomic regions containing well-known breast cancer genes including TP53, BRCA2, and PTEN but are invisible to total copy number analysis. We utilized CHISELs allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers to derive a more refined reconstruction of tumor evolution: timing allele-specific CNAs before and after WGDs, identifying low-frequency subclones distinguished by unique CNAs, and uncovering evidence of convergent evolution. This reconstruction is supported by orthogonal analysis of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) obtained by pooling barcoded reads across clones defined by CHISEL.",

A Cell Counting Kit-8 kit, Alizarin-Red and Oil-Red-O staining, alkaline phosphatase activity kit, and dichlorodihydro-fluoresce in diacetate were used to test cell proliferation, cell cycle, osteogenic ability, adipogenic ability, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively, in each group. Real-time PCR was performed to test the expression of osteogenic (osteocalcin and Runt-related transcription factor 2), adipogenic (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- genes.\n\nResultsBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and the number of cells undergoing division (S+G2 phase of the cell cycle) were found to be lower in group B than in group A. and the cellular levels of ROS, adipogenic differentiation, and expression of inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-) were higher in group B than in group A. Furthermore, osteogenic differentiation ability was higher in group D than in group B, and adipogenic differentiation ability, cellular levels of ROS, and gene expression of TNF- and IL-6 were lower in group D than in group B.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrated that 2 Gy radiation could decrease the osteogenic differentiation ability of BMSCs and increase their adipogenic differentiation ability by increasing the production of ROS. However, Sema3a could reduce these side effects by decreasing the levels of ROS.",

    "abstract": "The mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) consists of many cells, in particular macrophages, scattered throughout the body. However, there is increasing evidence for the heterogeneity of tissue-resident macrophages, leading to a pressing need for new tools to discriminate MPS subsets from other hematopoietic lineages. Mpeg1.1 is an evolutionary conserved gene encoding perforin-2, a pore-forming protein associated with host defense against pathogens. Zebrafish mpeg1.1:GFP and mpeg1.1:mCherry reporters were originally established to specifically label macrophages. Since, more than 100 peer-reviewed publications have made use of mpeg1.1-driven transgenics for in vivo studies, providing new insights into key aspects of macrophage ontogeny, activation and function. However, while the macrophage-specific expression pattern of the mpeg1.1 promoter has been firmly established in the zebrafish embryo, it is currently not known whether this specificity is maintained through adulthood. Here we report direct evidence that beside macrophages, a subpopulation of B-lymphocytes is marked by mpeg1.1 reporters in most adult zebrafish organs. These mpeg1.1+ lymphoid cells endogenously express mpeg1.1 and can be separated from mpeg1.1+ macrophages by virtue of their light-scatter characteristics using FACS. Remarkably, our analyses also revealed that B-lymphocytes, rather than mononuclear phagocytes, constitute the main mpeg1.1-positive population in irf8null myeloid-defective mutants, which were previously reported to recover tissue-resident macrophages in adulthood. One notable exception are skin macrophages, whose development and maintenance appear to be independent from irf8, similar to mammals. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that irf8 functions in myelopoiesis are evolutionary conserved and highlight the need for alternative macrophage-specific markers to study the MPS in adult zebrafish.\n\nSUMMARY SENTENCEMpeg1 is not a restricted macrophage marker, but also labels B cells in the adult zebrafish. Therefore, previously identified irf8-independent macrophages likely consist of B lymphocytes.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=183 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/836098v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@128a738org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa6097org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db61b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eb2e2e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Before squamous cell lung cancer develops, pre-cancerous lesions can be found in the airways. From longitudinal monitoring, we know that only half of such lesions become cancer, whereas a third spontaneously regress. While recent studies have described the presence of an active immune response in high-grade lesions, the mechanisms underpinning clinical regression of pre-cancerous lesions remain unknown. Here, we show that host immune surveillance is strongly implicated in lesion regression. Using bronchoscopic biopsies from human subjects, we find that regressive carcinoma in-situ lesions harbour more infiltrating immune cells than those that progress to cancer. Moreover, molecular profiling of these lesions identifies potential immune escape mechanisms specifically in those that progress to cancer: antigen presentation is impaired by genomic and epigenetic changes, TGF-beta signalling is overactive, and the immunomodulator TNFSF9 is downregulated. Changes appear intrinsic to the CIS lesions as the adjacent stroma of progressive and regressive lesions are transcriptomically similar. This study identifies mechanisms by which pre-cancerous lesions evade immune detection during the earliest stages of carcinogenesis and forms a basis for new therapeutic strategies that treat or prevent early stage lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLittle is known about mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations. Further investigation of resistance in clinical cohorts may point to strategies to prevent or overcome treatment failure.\n\nPatients and MethodsWe obtained tumor biopsies from metastatic breast cancer patients with BRCA1/2 deficiency before and after acquired resistance to PARP inhibitor or platinum chemotherapy. Whole exome sequencing was performed on each tumor, germline DNA, and circulating tumor DNA. Tumors underwent RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical staining for RAD51 foci on tumor sections was performed for functional assessment of intact homologous recombination.\n\nResultsPre- and post-resistance tumor samples were sequenced from 8 patients (4 with BRCA1 and 4 with BRCA2 mutation; 4 treated with PARP inhibitor and 4 with platinum). Following disease progression on DNA-damaging therapy, four patients (50%) acquired at least one somatic reversion alteration likely to result in functional BRCA1/2 protein detected by tumor or circulating tumor DNA sequencing. Two patients with germline BRCA1 deficiency acquired genomic alterations anticipated to restore homologous recombination through increased DNA end resection: loss of TP53BP1 in one patient and amplification of MRE11A in another. RAD51 foci were acquired post-resistance in all patients with genomic reversion, consistent with reconstitution of homologous recombination. All patients whose tumors demonstrated RAD51 foci post-resistance were intrinsically resistant to subsequent lines of DNA-damaging therapy.\n\nConclusionsGenomic reversion in BRCA1/2 was the most commonly observed mechanism of resistance, occurring in 4 of 8 patients. Novel sequence alterations leading to increased DNA end resection were seen in two patients, and may be targetable for therapeutic benefit. The presence of RAD51 foci by immunohistochemistry was consistent with BRCA1/2 protein functional status from genomic data and predicted response to later DNA-damaging therapy, supporting RAD51 focus formation as a clinically useful biomarker.",

From this dataset 857 sequences were selected because they had associated values of CD4+ T lymphocytes counts and viral loads and they were used to assess the correlation between clinical parameters and hypermutation. We found that the frequency of stop codons at sites 5, 11 and 79 ranged from 2.8x10-4 to 4.2x10-4. On the other hand, at codons 21, 38, 70, 89 and 174 the frequency of stop codons ranged from 1.4x10-3to 2.5x10-3. We also found a correlation between clinical parameters and hypermutation where patients harboring proviruses with one or more stop codons at the tryptophan sites of the gene vif had higher CD4+ T lymphocytes counts and lower viral loads compared to the population. Our findings indicate that A3 activity potentially restrains HIV-1 replication because individuals with hypermutated proviruses tend to have lower numbers of RNA copies. However, owing to the low frequency of hypermutated sequences observed in the databank (44 out 7072), it is unlikely that A3 has a significant impact to curb HIV-1 dissemination at the population level.",

However, there is little mention of genetic information for this species, especially regarding the biosynthetic pathways of anthraquinones.

A comprehensive functional annotation and classification with multiple public databases identified array of genes involved in major secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways and important transcription factor (TF) families (MYB, MYB-related, AP2/ERF, C2C2-YABBY, and bHLH). Differential expression analysis indicated that the expression level of genes involved in anthraquinone biosynthetic pathway regulates differently depending on the degree of tissues and seeds development. Furthermore, we identified that the amount of anthraquinone compounds were greater in late seeds than early ones.

    "abstract": "Biofilms are community structures of bacteria enmeshed in a self-produced matrix of exopolysaccharides. The biofilm matrix serves numerous roles, including resilience and persistence, making biofilms a subject of research interest among persistent clinical pathogens of global health importance. Our current understanding of the underlying biochemical pathways responsible for biosynthesis of these exopolysaccharides is largely limited to Gram-negative bacteria. Clostridia are a class of Gram-positive, anaerobic and spore-forming bacteria, and include the important human pathogens Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridioides difficile, among numerous others. Clostridia have been reported to form biofilms composed of cellulose, although the specific loci which encode the cellulose synthase have not been identified. Here, we report the discovery of a gene cluster, which we named ccsABZCD, among selected bacteria within class Clostridia that appears to encode a synthase complex responsible for polymerization, modification, and export of an O-acetylated cellulose exopolysaccharide. To test this hypothesis, we subcloned the putative glycoside hydrolase CcsZ and solved the X-ray crystal structure of both apo- and product-bound CcsZ. Our results demonstrate that CcsZ is in fact an endo-acting cellulase belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH-5). This is in contrast to the Gram-negative cellulose synthase, which instead encodes BcsZ, a structurally distinct GH-8. We further show CcsZ is capable of hydrolysis of the soluble mock substrate carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) with a pH optimum of 4.5. The data we present here serves as an entry point to an understanding of biofilm formation among class Clostridia and allowed us to predict a model for Clostridial cellulose synthesis.\n\nAuthor summaryBiofilms are communities of microorganisms that enmesh themselves in a protective matrix of elf-produced polysaccharide materials. Biofilms have demonstrated roles in both virulence and persistence among bacterial pathogens of global health importance. The class Clostridia are a polyphyletic grouping of primarily Gram-positive, anaerobic and spore-forming bacteria which contain the important and well-studied human pathogens Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium perfringens, among others. Bacteria belonging to class Clostridia have been anecdotally reported to form biofilms made of cellulose, although the molecular mechanisms governing their production has not before been described. In this work, we identify a gene cluster, which we name ccsABZHI, for the Clostridial cellulose synthase, which bears remarkable similarity to molecular machinery required for the production of cellulose biofilms in other Gram-negative bacteria. We further biochemically characterize one of these enzymes, CcsZ, a predicted endoglucanase which we predicted from our model should cleave cellulose exopolysaccharides. We show that CcsZ is in fact capable of this activity and belongs to a broader family of glycoside hydrolases with unexpected taxonomic diversity. Our work represents an entry point towards an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing cellulose biofilm formation in Gram-positive bacteria.",

    "abstract": "We show that the characteristic time for sickled blood to traverse 100 {micro}m-diameter glass capillaries can be used as the foundation for a useful point-of-care diagnosis for sickle cell disease. 3.2 cm long capillaries were inserted into a 5 {micro}L drop of blood, and 1/4 {micro}L was spontaneously drawn into the tube. The rate at which the blood traversed the capillary was significantly changed by deoxygenation only for sickle genotypes, a consequence of the increased viscosity of cells containing sickle fibers. Under these conditions, we find deoxygenation causes the time for sickle blood to traverse the capillary to increase to about 3 times its original value, in contrast to normal blood, where the times are equivalent regardless of state of oxygenation. This corresponds to readily-observed time differences of around 10 s for capillary traversal. Such changes are present for blood from homozygous sickle cell patients, as well as heterozygous patients with hemoglobin AS, SC, and S{beta}+ thalassemia. Moreover, we demonstrate that this test is sensitive to sickling therapies that increase the production of fetal Hb. This viscosity-based measurement thus offers the prospect of an assay that is 10 times faster than any current test of which we are aware, at costs that rival the least expensive of any current assays.",

Acacia auriculiformis, an important salt tolerant crop, is growing abundantly in the salt-affected mangrove areas of Sunderban, West Bengal, India. In the present study, we have reported the physiological, molecular and antioxidant response of this crop to a gradient of salt treatments ranging between 0 and 800 mM NaCl. As a stress response, the antioxidant enzymes viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) were highly activated at 200, 400 and 800 mM NaCl respectively. Antioxidant metabolites such as phenols and thiols elevated with increasing salt treatments thus augmenting antioxidant activity with significant positive relationship with phenol content. Similarly, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity was up-regulated in a dose dependent manner with significant relationship with phenol content. This study also reported the phenolic profile for the first time in A. auriculiformis with the abundance of flavonoids. In addition, transcriptional up-regulation of Na+/H+ antiporter gene (NHX1) and the development of robust vascular tissues was noticed at 400 mM NaCl stress compared to control, while further stress at 800 mM NaCl induced poor vascular tissue growth but with higher PAL activity and consequent higher phenol content. Based on this observation, a model for salt tolerance mechanism of A. auriculiformis has been proposed.",

These hAECs on the membranes were evaluated by surface biomarkers including epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA4) and endoglin (CD105), transcriptional level of biomarkers including POU class 5 homeobox 1 (OCT4), sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4), immunofluorescence of cytokeratin-8 (CK-8), alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and collagen type I alpha 1 chain (ColA1). Finally, the hAECs membrane were transplanted on skin-removed mice to evaluate its effect on wound healing. In comparison to the hAECs isolated by the conventional methods, the cells isolated by this proposed method had higher purity of hAECs, expressed higher in pluripotency related genes, and maintained an epithelium construction in a long-term culture. In mice application, the hAECs membrane effectively improved the skin wound healing. An efficient method was successfully established to produce hAECs membrane in this work which not only held promise to obtain hAECs in higher purity and quality, but also showed practical clinical potential.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) was first recognized in Sri Lanka in the early 1990s, and since then it has reached epidemic levels in the North Central Province of the country. The prevalence of CKDu is reportedly highest among communities that engage in chena and paddy farming, which is most often practiced in the dry zone including the North Central and East Central Provinces of Sri Lanka. Previous studies have suggested varied hypotheses for the etiology of CKDu; however, there is not yet a consensus on the primary risk factors, possibly due to disparate study designs, sample populations, and methodologies. The goal of this pilot case-control study was to evaluate the relationships between key demographic, cultural, and occupational variables as risk factors for CKDu, with a primary interest in pesticide exposure both occupationally and through its potential use as an ingredient in brewed kasippu alcohol. A total of 56 CKDu cases and 54 control individuals were surveyed using a proctored, self-reported questionnaire. Occupational pesticide exposure and alcohol consumption were not found to be significant risk factors for CKDu. However, a statistically significant association with CKDu was observed with chewing betel (OR: 6.11, 95% CI: 1.93, 19.35), age (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.13), owning a pet dog (OR: 3.74, 95% CI: 1.38, 10.11), water treatment (OR: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 12.43) and pests in the house (OR: 5.81, 95% CI: 1.56, 21.60). The findings of this study suggest future research should focus on practices associated with chewing betel, potential animal interactions including pests in the home and pets, and risk factors associated with water.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSince a new variant of chronic kidney disease was acknowledged in the early 1990s among those in the agricultural community of Sri Lanka, especially rice farmers, the research community has searched for causes of what has become known as chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology or CKDu. Previous studies have focused on heavy metals in the environment as they are known to be toxic to the kidneys however, a proverbial \"smoking gun\" has yet to be identified. Understanding that the causes is potential multifactorial we implemented a pilot case-control study using a One Health methodology administering a comprehensive interview to assess environmental, animal, and, human exposures that may be contributing to the diagnosis of CKDu. We found statistically significant odds ratio among those that reported having a pet dog, chewing betel (a traditional preparation or various ingredients wrapped in a betel leaf inserted between the teeth and cheek), pests in the home, treating drinking water, and older age. These results serve to guide further hypothesis generation regarding mechanisms behind associated exposures from infectious diseases such as hantavirus and leptospirosis to food preparation through boiling drinking water in aluminum vessels and oral pesticide exposure linked to betel preparation.",
