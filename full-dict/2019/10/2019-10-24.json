    "abstract": "Mutant resources are essential to improve our understanding of the biology of slow-growing mycobacteria, which include the causative agents of tuberculosis in various species, including humans. The generation of deletion mutants in slow-growing mycobacteria in a gene-by-gene approach in order to make genome-wide ordered mutant resources is still a laborious and costly approach; despite the recent development of improved methods. On the other hand, transposon mutagenesis in combination with Cartesian Pooling-Coordinate Sequencing allows the creation of large archived Mycobacterium transposon insertion libraries. However, such mutants contain selection marker genes with a risk of polar gene effects, which is undesired both for research and for use of these mutants as live attenuated vaccines. In this paper, a derivative of the Himar1 transposon is described, which allows the generation of clean, markerless knockouts from archived transposon libraries. By incorporating FRT sites for FlpE/FRT-mediated recombination and I-SceI sites for ISceIM-based transposon removal, we enable two thoroughly experimentally validated possibilities to create unmarked mutants from such marked transposon mutants. The FRT approach is highly efficient but leaves an FRT scar in the genome, whereas the I-SceI mediated approach can create mutants without any heterologous DNA in the genome. The combined use of CP-CSeq and this optimized transposon was applied in the BCG Danish 1331 vaccine strain (WHO reference 07/270), creating the largest ordered, characterized resource of mutants in a member of the M. tb complex (18,432 clones, mutating 83% of the non-essential M. tb homologues), from which clean knockouts can be generated.\\n\\nImportanceWhile speeding up research for many fields of biology (e.g. yeast, plant, and C. elegans), genome-wide ordered mutant collections are still elusive in mycobacterial research. We developed methods to generate such resources in a time- and cost-effective manner, and developed a newly engineered transposon from which unmarked mutants can be efficiently generated. Our library in the WHO reference vaccine strain of M. bovis BCG Danish targets 83% of all non-essential genes and was made publicly available via the BCCM/ITM Mycobacteria Collection. This resource will speed up Mycobacterium research (e.g. drug resistance research, vaccine development) and paves the way to similar genome-wide mutant collections in other strains of the M. tb complex. The stretch to a full collection of mutants in all non-essential genes is now much shorter, with just 17% remaining genes to be targeted using gene-by-gene approaches, for which highly effective methods have recently also been described.",

    "abstract": "Our choices are often informed by temporally integrating streams of sensory information. This has been well demonstrated in the visual and auditory domains, but the integration of tactile information over time has been less studied. We designed an active touch task in which subjects explored a spheroid-shaped object to determine its inclination with respect to the horizontal plane (inclined to the left or to the right). In agreement with previous findings, our results show that more errors, and longer decision times, accompany difficult decisions (small inclination angles). To gain insight into the decision-making process, we used a task in which the time available for tactile exploration was varied by the experimenter, in a trial-by-trial basis. The behavioral results were fit with a model of bounded accumulation, and also with an independent-sampling model which assumes no sensory accumulation. The results of model fits favor an accumulation-to-bound mechanism, and suggest that participants integrate the first 600 ms of 1800 ms-long stimuli. This means that the somatosensory system benefits from longer streams of information although it does not make use of all available evidence.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe somatosensory system integrates information streams through time.\\nC_LIO_LISomatosensory discrimination thresholds decrease with longer stimuli.\\nC_LIO_LIA bounded accumulation model is favored over independent sampling.\\nC_LIO_LIHumans accumulate up to 600 ms, out of 1800 ms-long stimuli.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in functional neuroimaging suffers from magnetic susceptibility artifacts and interference from metal implants. The resulting signal loss hampers functional neuroimaging studies and can lead to misinterpretation of findings. Here, we reconstructed compromised BOLD signal using deep machine learning. We trained a deep learning model to learn principles governing BOLD activity in one dataset and reconstructed artificially-compromised regions in another dataset, frame by frame. Strikingly, BOLD time series extracted from reconstructed frames were correlated with the original time series, even though the frames did not independently carry information about BOLD fluctuations through time. Moreover, reconstructed functional connectivity (FC) maps exhibited good correspondence with the original FC maps, indicating that the deep learning model recovered functional relationships among brain regions. We replicated this result in patients whose scans suffered signal loss due to intracortical electrodes. Critically, the reconstructions captured individual-specific information rather than group information learned during training. Deep machine learning thus presents a unique opportunity to reconstruct compromised BOLD signal while capturing features of an individuals own functional brain organization.",

    "abstract": "Improving catalytic ability of protein biocatalysts leads to reduction in the production cost of biocatalytic manufacturing process, but the search space of possible proteins/mutants is too large to explore exhaustively through experiments. To some extent, highly soluble recombinant proteins tend to exhibit high activity. Here, we demonstrate that an optimization methodology based on machine learning prediction model can effectively predict which peptide tags can improve protein solubility quantitatively. Based on the protein sequence information, a support vector machine model we recently developed was used to evaluate protein solubility after randomly mutated tags were added to a target protein. The optimization algorithm guided the tags to evolve towards variants that can result in higher solubility. Moreover, the optimization results were validated successfully by adding the tags designed by our optimization algorithm to a model protein, expressing it in vivo and experimentally quantifying its solubility and activity. For example, solubility of a tyrosine ammonium lyase was more than doubled by adding two tags to its N- and C-terminus. Its protein activity was also increased nearly 3.5 fold by adding the tags. Additional experiments also supported that the designed tags were effective for improving activity of multiple proteins and are better than previously reported tags. The presented optimization methodology thus provides a valuable tool for understanding the correlation between amino acid sequence and protein solubility and for engineering protein biocatalysts.\\n\\nContactkang.zhou@nus.edu.sg, chewxia@nus.edu.sg",

    "abstract": "The evolution of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is of great relevance for both evolutionary and synthetic biology. Understanding the relationship between GRN structure and its function can allow us to understand the selective pressures that have shaped a given circuit. This is especially relevant when considering spatiotemporal expression patterns, where GRN models have been shown to be extremely robust and evolvable. However, previous models that studied GRN evolution did not include the evolution of protein and genetic elements that underlie GRN architecture. Here we use toyLIFE, a multilevel genotype-phenotype map, to show that not all GRNs are equally likely in genotype space and that evolution is biased to find the most common GRNs. toyLIFE rules create Boolean GRNs that, embedded in a one-dimensional tissue, develop a variety of spatiotemporal gene expression patterns. Populations of toyLIFE organisms choose the most common GRN out of a set of equally fit alternatives and, most importantly, fail to find a target pattern when it is very rare in genotype space. Indeed, we show that the probability of finding the fittest phenotype increases dramatically with its abundance in genotype space. This phenotypic bias represents a mechanism that can prevent the fixation in the population of the fittest phenotype, one that is inherent to the structure of genotype space and the genotype-phenotype map.",

Population genetic studies have consistently revealed significant structure across central African rain forest plants, in particular a North-South genetic discontinuity close to the equator at the level of a climatic inversion. Here, we take a phylogeographic approach using 351 nuclear markers in 112 individuals across the distribution of the African rain forest tree species Annickia affinis (Annonaceae). We show for the first time that the North-South divide is the result of a single major colonisation event across the climatic inversion from an ancestral population located in Gabon. We suggest that differences in ecological niche of populations distributed either side of this inversion may have contributed to this phylogenetic discontinuity. We find evidence for inland dispersal, predominantly in northern areas, and variable demographic histories among genetic clusters, indicating that populations responded differently to past climate change. We show how newly-developed genomic tools can provide invaluable insights into our understanding of tropical rain forest evolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "As climate change progresses, reef-building corals must contend more often with suboptimal conditions, motivating a need to understand coral stress response. Here we test the hypothesis that there is a stereotyped transcriptional response that corals enact under any stressful conditions, functionally characterized by downregulation of growth and activation of cell death, response to reactive oxygen species, immunity, and protein homeostasis. We analyze RNA-seq and Tag-Seq data from 14 previously published studies and supplement them with four new experiments involving different stressors, totaling over 600 gene expression profiles from the genus Acropora. Contrary to expectations, we found not one, but two distinct types of response. The type A response was observed under all kinds of high-intensity stress, showed strong correlations between independent projects, and was functionally consistent with the hypothesized stereotyped response. Higher similarity of type A responses irrespective of stress type supports its role as the General Coral Stress Response providing a blanket solution to severely stressful conditions. The distinct type B response was observed under lower intensity stress and was weaker and more variable among studies than type A. Unexpectedly, the type B response was broadly opposite the type A response: biological processes up-regulated under type A response tended to be down-regulated under type B response, and vice versa. Gene network analysis indicated that type B response does not involve specific co-regulated gene groups and is simply the opposite of type A response. We speculate that these paradoxically opposing responses may result from an inherent negative association between stress response and cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the genetic structure of malaria parasite populations has been proposed as a novel and sensitive approach to quantify the impact of malaria control and elimination efforts. Here we describe the first population genetic analysis of sympatric Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) populations following nationwide distribution of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLIN) in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Parasite isolates from serial cross-sectional studies pre-(2005-6) and post-LLIN (2010-2014) were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Despite parasite prevalence declining substantially in these communities (East Sepik: Pf=54.9-8.5%, Pv=35.7-5.6%, Madang: Pf=38.0-9.0%, Pv: 31.8-19.7%), genetically diverse and intermixing parasite populations remained. P. falciparum diversity declined modestly post-LLIN relative to pre-LLIN (East Sepik: Rs = 7.1-6.4, He = 0.77-0.71; Madang: Rs= 8.2-6.1, He = 0.79-0.71). Unexpectedly, population structure present in pre-LLIN populations was lost post-LLIN, suggesting that more frequent human movement between provinces may have contributed to higher gene flow between provinces. P. vivax prevalence initially declined but increased again in one province, yet diversity remained high throughout the study period (East Sepik: Rs=11.4-9.3, He=0.83-0.80; Madang: Rs=12.2-14.5, He=0.85-0.88). Although genetic differentiation values increased between provinces over time, no significant population structure was observed at any time point. For both species, the emergence of clonal transmission and significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium (mLD) due to increased focal inbreeding post-LLIN was a strong indicator of impact on the parasite population using these markers. After eight years of intensive malaria control in PNG and substantial prevalence decline the impact on parasite population diversity and structure detectable by microsatellite genotyping was limited.",

Social insect colonies navigate this challenge, in the absence of centralized control, by allocating different individuals to each of these tasks based on variation in individual behavior. To investigate how heritable differences in individual learning affect a colonys collective ability to locate and choose among different quality food resources, we develop an agent based model and test its predictions using two genetic lines of honey bees, selected for differences in their learning behavior. Here we show that, paradoxically, colonies containing individuals that are better at learning to ignore unrewarding stimuli are worse at choosing the highest quality resource at the collective level.

    "abstract": "Active sensing animals perceive their surroundings by emitting probes of energy and analyzing how the environment modulates these probes. However, the probes of conspecifics can jam active sensing, which should cause problems for groups of active sensing animals. This problem was termed the cocktail party nightmare for echolocating bats: as bats listen for the faint returning echoes of their loud calls, these echoes will be masked by the loud calls of other close-by bats. Despite this problem, many bats echolocate in groups and roost socially. Here, we present a biologically parametrized framework to quantify echo detection in groups. Incorporating known properties of echolocation, psychoacoustics, spatial acoustics and group flight, we quantify how well bats flying in groups can detect each other despite jamming. A focal bat in the center of a group can detect neighbors for group sizes of up to 100 bats. With increasing group size, fewer and only the closest and frontal neighbors are detected. Neighbor detection is improved for longer call intervals, shorter call durations, denser groups and more variable flight and sonar beam directions. Our results provide the first quantification of the sensory input of echolocating bats in collective group flight, such as mating swarms or emergences. Our results further generate predictions on the sensory strategies bats may use to reduce jamming in the cocktail party nightmare. Lastly, we suggest that the spatially limited sensory field of echolocators leads to limited interactions within a group, so that collective behavior is achieved by following only nearest neighbors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTClose-by active sensing animals may interfere with each other. We investigated if and what many echolocators fly in a group hear - can they detect each other after all? We modelled acoustic and physical properties in group echolocation to quantify neighbor detection probability as group size increases. Echolocating bats can detect at least one of their closest neighbors per call up to group sizes of even 100 bats. Call parameters such as call rate and call duration play a strong role in how much echolocators in a group interfere with each other. Even when many bats fly together, they are indeed able to detect at least their nearest frontal neighbors - and this prevents them from colliding into one another.",

AKT inhibition has pleiotropic effects, and the key aspects that determine therapeutic efficacy are not fully clear. Therefore, we investigated the antimyeloma mechanism(s) of AKT inhibition. Among the various downstream AKT targets are Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors, and we demonstrate that they are crucial for changes in gene expression upon AKT inhibition. Based on gene expression profiling we defined an AKT-induced FOXO-dependent gene set that has prognostic significance in a large cohort of MM patients, where low FOXO activity correlates with inferior survival. We show that cell cycle exit and cell death of MM cells after AKT inhibition required FOXO. In addition, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a negatively regulated AKT substrate, proved to be pivotal to induce cell death and to inhibit cell cycle progression after AKT inhibition. Finally, we demonstrate that FOXO and GSK3 induced cell death by increasing the turnover of the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein. In concordance, the AKT inhibitor MK2206 greatly sensitized MM cells for the MCL1 inhibitor S63845. Thus, our results indicate that FOXO and GSK3 are crucial mediators of the antimyeloma effects of AKT inhibition, and suggest combination therapies that may have therapeutic potential in MM.\\n\\nKEYPOINTSO_LIFOXO transcription factors and the GSK3 kinase are pivotal tumor suppressors downstream of AKT inhibition in MM cells.\\nC_LIO_LIFOXO and GSK3 activation after AKT inhibition leads to a decrease in MCL1 levels in MM cells resulting in cell death.\\nC_LI",

To assess the importance of the PGR isoform ratio in the maintenance of the healthy reproductive tract, mice with Cre recombinase- activated PGRA and PGRB transgenes were bred with the PGRCre mouse model to generate strains expressing either PGRA or PGRB in PGR positive tissues. The PGRB mice developed ovarian neoplasms at 23 weeks of age derived from ovarian luteal cells, while the PGRA expressing mice displayed a reduced frequency of tumor development. Transcriptomic analyses of the ovarian tumors revealed an enhanced AKT pathway signature, which is in agreement with expression changes found in human ovarian adenocarcinoma. Effective treatment with the PGR antagonist RU486 reduced tumor growth and the expression of cell cycle genes. We concluded that tumor growth and proliferation is hormone and PGR isoform dependent. Further analysis of the PGRB cistrome identified binding events of critical mitotic phase entry genes. This work suggests an intriguing mechanism whereby the expression of the PGR isoforms determines in vivo neoplasia through high-jacking of the cell cycle pathway.",

Support for species relationships was inferred from multiple lines of evidence including shared gene duplications, gene tree conflict, gene-wise edge-based analyses, concatenation, and coalescent-based methods and is summarized in a consensus framework.\n\nKey ResultsOur consensus approach supported a topology largely concordant with previous studies, but suggests that the data are not capable of resolving several ancient relationships due to lack of informative characters, sensitivity to methodology, and extensive gene tree conflict correlated with paleopolyploidy. We found evidence of a whole genome duplication before the radiation of all or most ericalean families and demonstrate that tree topology and heterogeneous evolutionary rates impact the inferred placement of genome duplications.\n\nConclusionsOur approach provides a novel hypothesis regarding the history of Ericales and confidently resolves most nodes. We demonstrate that a series of ancient divergences are unresolvable with these data. Whether paleopolyploidy is a major source of the observed phylogenetic conflict warrants further investigation.",

Studies on isolated cells may not accurately reflect the responses that occur in vivo due to the presence of other cells. This study elucidated the influence of microenvironment complexity on B-cell polarisation and function in the context of TB disease. B-cell function was tested in whole blood, PBMCs and as isolated cells. The different fractions were stimulated and the B-cell phenotype and immunoglobulin profiles analysed. The immunoglobulin profile and killer B-cell frequencies varied for each of the investigated sample types, while in an isolated cellular environment, secretion of immunoglobulin isotypes IgA, IgG2 and IgG3 was hampered. The differences in the immunoglobulin profile highlight the importance of cell-cell communication for B-cell activation. In contrast, increased frequencies of killer B-cells were observed following cellular isolation, suggesting a biased shift in augmented immune response in vitro. This suggests that humoral B-cell function and development was impaired likely due to a lack of co-stimulatory signals from other cell types. Thus, B-cell function should ideally be studied in a PBMC or whole blood fraction.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria respond to environmental and cellular cues both through isolated signaling events between one sensor histidine kinase and its response regulator, and through more interconnected arrays. Caulobacter crescentus achieves asymmetric division through a network of histidine kinases, and here we interrogate a novel DivL pseudokinase reverse signaling mechanism that enables productive cross-talk across the network. A leucine zipper fusion method was used to synthetically stimulate reverse signaling between the sensor and kinase domains and directly test if reverse signaling could modulate the signaling network in vivo. Stimulation of sensor-kinase helix conformational changes resulted in changes in C. crescentus motility and DivL accumulation at the cell poles. The repurposed roles of the sensor domain in these processes were evaluated. We demonstrate that a domain of unknown function that binds to two scaffolding proteins, and two conserved signaling domains are employed as modulators of an active kinase. We propose that reversed signaling may be widely used across signaling enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Our current understanding of a free-living bacterium - capable of withstanding a variety of environmental stresses-is represented by the image of a peptidoglycan-armored rigid casket. The making and breaking of peptidoglycan greatly determines cell shape. The cytoplasmic membrane follows this shape, pressed towards the cell wall by turgor pressure. Consequently, bacteria are morphologically static organisms, in contrast to eukaryotic cells that can facilitate shape changes. Here we report the discovery of the novel bacterial phylum Saltatorellota, that challenges this concept of a bacterial cell. Members of this phylum can change their shape, are capable of amoeba-like locomotion and trunk-formation through the creation of extensive pseudopodia-like structures. Two independent Saltatorellota cells can fuse, and they employ various forms of cell division from budding to canonical binary fission. Despite their polymorphisms, members of the Saltatorellota do possess a peptidoglycan cell wall. Their genomes encode flagella and type IV pili as well as a bacterial actin homolog, the  saltatorellin. This protein is most similar to MamK, a dynamic filament-forming protein, that aligns and segregates magnetosome organelles via treadmilling. We found saltatorellin to form filaments in both, E. coli and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense, leading to the hypothesis that shapeshifting and pseudopodia formation might be driven by treadmilling of saltatorellin.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of molecules and their role in neurite initiation and/or extension is not only helpful to prevent different neurodegenerative diseases but also can be important by which neuronal damages can be repaired. In this work we explored the role of TRPV2, a non-selective cation channel in the context of neurite functions. Using western blot, immunofluorescence, and live cell Ca2+-imaging; we confirm that functional TRPV2 is endogenously present in the F11 cell, a model system mimicking peripheral neuron. In F11 cells TRPV2 localizes in specific sub-cellular regions enriched with filamentous actin, such as in growth cone, filopodia, lamellipodia and in neurites. TRPV2 regulates actin cytoskeleton and also interacts with soluble actin. Ectopic expression of TRPV2-GFP but not GFP-only in F11 cell induces more primary and secondary neurites, confirming its role in neurite initiation, extension and branching events. TRPV2-mediated neuritogenesis is dependent on wild-type TRPV2 as cells expressing TRPV2 mutants reveal no neuritogenesis. However, TRPV2-mediated neuritogenesis is unperturbed by the chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by BAPTA-AM, and thus involves Ca2+-independent signaling events also. We demonstrate that pharmacological modulation of TRPV2 alters cellular cAMP levels. These findings are relevant to understand the sprouting of new neurites, neuroregeneration and neuronal plasticity at the cellular, subcellular and molecular level. Such understanding may have border implication in neurodegeneration and peripheral neuropathy.",

    "abstract": "When a strong selection pressure, such as predation risk, varies widely in space and time, how should prey respond? When risk varies predictably, prey are hypothesized to respond in a risk-sensitive manner. It is less clear how prey should respond when risk varies unpredictably.\\n\\nAdditionally, prey response may also depend on how predation risk interacts with other selection pressures. Our understanding of the complex action of multiple and variable selection pressures on prey traits is still comparatively poor. Here, we examine how predictable and unpredictable aspects of predation risk act together with another important selection pressure to influence prey behaviour in the rock pool breeding mosquito, Aedes vexans. Through the selection of sites for oviposition, female mosquitoes can influence the predation risk faced by their offspring. We tested how females select oviposition sites, when encountering pools that vary in larval predation risk and desiccation risk. We comprehensively quantified spatial and temporal variation in predation risk by measuring densities of predatory dragonfly nymphs in rock pools of different sizes, along the mosquito breeding season. We also measured hydroperiod length. We next conducted manipulative experiments in rock pools and measured female oviposition responses to variation in predation and desiccation risks. Predation risk varied widely in space and time. Desiccation risk only appeared important for the small pools. Ovipositing females appeared to respond to these multiple aspects of variation in selection pressures. Females seemed to respond to predictable variation by avoiding large pools that permanently harboured predators in natural settings. Female responses were more variable to medium-sized pools with naturally stochastic predator densities, highlighting the role of unpredictability in predation risk in shaping behaviour. Females did not clearly prefer small pools that were naturally devoid of predators but carried high desiccation risk, suggesting that they balance multiple risks - predation versus desiccation - when choosing oviposition sites. Our study suggests that wild populations may commonly experience multiple and variable selection pressures that can favour seemingly puzzling trait variation. We highlight the need to quantify variation in selection pressures and investigate how such variation, especially the unpredictable aspects, shapes prey traits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEndometriosis is a common reproductive disease with a heterogeneous presentation. Classification attempts have thus far not offered insight into its cause or its symptoms. Endometriosis may result from the migration of shed endometrium to the peritoneal cavity. However, there are cases reported in girls without uteruses and men. While a non-retrograde menstruation origin of ectopic tissue is certain in these cases, we propose using DNA methylation age (DNAm age) to distinguish between retrograde and non-retrograde etiologies.\\n\\nMethodsUsing publicly available DNA methylation data and Horvaths pan-tissue epigenetic clock, we compared DNAm age and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) of ectopic lesions to eutopic endometrium of diseased and control endometrium. We examined EAA in cancer metastasis and teratomas to control for migration and developmental origin.\\n\\nResultsDisease status does not change DNAm age of eutopic endometrium, but the effect of ectopic status was profound: -16.88 years (p = 4.82 x 10-7). There were no differences between EAA of primary/metastatic tumor pairs, suggesting that the observed effect is not due to migration. Immature or mature teratoma compartments decreased DNAm age by 9.44 and 7.40 years respectively, suggesting that developmental state correlates with DNAm age.\\n\\nConclusionsEctopic endometriotic tissue exhibits decelerated DNAm age, similar to that observed in teratomas composed of multipotent tissue. The migration process does not change DNAm age and eutopic endometrium is concordant with chronological age regardless of disease status. We conclude that DNAm age of ectopic lesions can classify endometriosis into distinct subtypes that may be clinically relevant.",

    "abstract": "Early epidemiological studies implicated manganese (Mn) as a possible caries-promoting agent while laboratory studies have indicated that manganese stimulates the expression of virulence-related factors in the dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans. To better understand the importance of manganese homeostasis to S. mutans pathophysiology, we first used RNA sequencing to obtain the global transcriptional profile of S. mutans UA159 grown under Mn-restricted conditions. Among the most highly expressed genes were the entire sloABC operon, encoding a dual iron/manganese transporter, and an uncharacterized gene, herein mntH, that codes for a protein bearing strong similarity to Nramp-type transporters. While inactivation of sloC, which encodes the lipoprotein receptor of the SloABC system, or mntH alone had no major consequence on the overall fitness of S. mutans, simultaneous inactivation of sloC and mntH ({Delta}sloC{Delta}mntH) impaired growth and survival under Mn-restricted conditions, including in human saliva or in the presence of calprotectin. Further, disruption of Mn transport resulted in diminished stress tolerance and reduced biofilm formation in the presence of sucrose. These phenotypes were markedly improved when cells were provided with excess Mn. Metal quantifications revealed that the single mutant strains contain similar intracellular levels of Mn as the parent strain, whereas Mn was nearly undetectable in the {Delta}sloC{Delta}mntH strain. Collectively, these results reveal that SloABC and MntH work independently and cooperatively to promote cell growth under Mn-restricted conditions, and that mauitanence of Mn homeostasis is essential for the expression of major virulence attributes in S. mutans.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEAs trace biometals such as manganese (Mn) are important for all forms of life, the ability to regulate biometals availability during infection is an essential trait of successful bacterial pathogens. Here, we showed that the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans utilizes two Mn transport systems, namely SloABC and MntH, to acquire Mn from the environment, and that the ability to maintain the cellular levels of Mn is important for the manifestation of characteristics that associate S. mutans with dental caries. Our results indicate that the development of strategies to deprive S. mutans of Mn hold promise in the combat against this important bacterial pathogen.",

Intracellular pathogens, including F. tularensis, have evolved mechanisms to survive in the harsh environment of macrophages and neutrophils, where they are exposed to cell envelope-damaging molecules. The bacterial cell wall, primarily composed of peptidoglycan (PG), maintains cell morphology, structure, and membrane integrity. Intracellular Gram-negative bacteria protect themselves from macrophage and neutrophil killing by recycling and repairing damaged PG - a process that involves over 50 different PG synthesis and recycling enzymes. Here, we identified a PG recycling enzyme, L,D-carboxypeptidase A (LdcA), of F. tularensis that is responsible for converting PG tetrapeptide stems to tripeptide stems. Unlike E. coli LdcA and most other orthologs, F. tularensis LdcA does not localize to the cytoplasm and also exhibits L,D-endopeptidase activity, converting PG pentapeptide stems to tripeptide stems. Loss of F. tularensis LdcA led to altered cell morphology and membrane integrity, as well as attenuation in a mouse pulmonary infection model and in primary and immortalized macrophages.

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has emerged as a leading cause of death and disability. Despite being a growing medical issue, the biological factors that promote central nervous system (CNS) pathology and neurological dysfunction following TBI remain poorly characterized. Recently, the meningeal lymphatic system was identified as a critical mediator of drainage from the CNS. In comparison to other peripheral organs, our understanding of how defects in lymphatic drainage from the CNS contribute to disease is limited. It is still unknown how TBI impacts meningeal lymphatic function and whether disruptions in this drainage pathway are involved in driving TBI pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate that even mild forms of brain trauma cause severe deficits in meningeal lymphatic drainage that can last out to at least two weeks post-injury. To investigate a mechanism behind impaired lymphatic function in TBI, we examined how increased intracranial pressure (ICP) influences the meningeal lymphatics, as increased ICP commonly occurs in TBI. We demonstrate that increased ICP is capable of provoking meningeal lymphatic dysfunction. Moreover, we show that pre-existing lymphatic dysfunction mediated by targeted photoablation before TBI leads to increased neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. These findings provide new insights into both the causes and consequences of meningeal lymphatic dysfunction in TBI and suggest that therapeutics targeting the meningeal lymphatic system may offer strategies to treat TBI.",

    "abstract": "One hallmark of natural motor control is the brains ability to adapt to perturbations ranging from temporary visual-motor rotations to paresis caused by stroke. These adaptations require modifications of learned neural patterns that can span the time-course of minutes to months. Previous work with brain-machine interfaces (BMI) has shown that over learning, neurons consolidate firing activity onto low-dimensional neural subspaces, and additional studies have shown that neurons require longer timescales to adapt to task perturbations that require neural activity outside of these subspaces. However, it is unclear how the motor cortex adapts alongside task changes that do not require modifications of the existing neural subspace over learning. To answer this question, five nonhuman primates were used in three BMI experiments, which allowed us to track how specific populations of neurons changed firing patterns as task performance improved. In each experiment, neural activity was transformed into cursor kinematics using decoding algorithms that were periodically readapted based on natural arm movements or visual feedback. We found that decoder changes caused neurons to increase exploratory-like patterns on within-day timescales without hindering previously consolidated patterns regardless of task performance. The flexible modulation of these exploratory patterns in contrast to relatively stable consolidated activity suggests a simultaneous exploration-exploitation strategy that adapts existing neural patterns during learning.",

With increasing information on tropical tree life-histories, our predictive understanding is no longer limited by species data, but by the ability of existing models to make use of it. Using a demographic forest model, we show that the basal area and compositional changes during forest succession in a Neotropical forest can be accurately predicted by representing tropical tree diversity (hundreds of species) with only five functional groups spanning two essential tradeoffs - the growth-survival and stature-recruitment tradeoffs. This data-driven modeling framework substantially improves our ability to predict consequences of anthropogenic impacts on tropical forests.",

Following the recovery of a single desiccated palaeo-faecal specimen from Bushman Rock Shelter in Limpopo Province, South Africa, we applied a multi-proxy analytical protocol to the sample. Our results indicate that the distal IM of the Neolithic  Middle Iron Age (c. AD 1485) Bantu-speaking individual exhibits features indicative of a largely mixed forager-agro-pastoralist diet. Subsequent comparison with the IMs of the Tyrolean Iceman (Otzi) and contemporary Hadza hunter-gatherers, Malawian agro-pastoralists and Italians, reveals that this IM precedes recent adaptation to  Western diets, including the consumption of coffee, tea, chocolate, citrus and soy, and the use of antibiotics, analgesics and also exposure to various toxic environmental pollutants. Our analyses reveal some of the causes and means by which current human IMs are likely to have responded to recent dietary changes, prescription medications and environmental pollutants, providing rare insight into human IM evolution following the advent of the Neolithic c. 12,000 years ago.",

    "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of asthma, inflammatory mediators cause structural and functional changes in resident airway cells including airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. Here, we report that intranasal treatment of mice with house dust mite (HDM) highly upregulated the expression of tRNA half molecules in asthmatic lungs. The 5'-tRNA haves contain a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate (cP) and thus belong to cP-containing RNAs (cP-RNAs). Capturing the whole cP-RNA transcriptome using cP-RNA-seq revealed the global upregulation of not only tRNA halves but also the cP-RNAs derived from mRNAs and rRNAs. Our investigation of the biological significance of the major upregulated 5'-tRNA half species in human primary ASM cells revealed that the 5'-tRNA halves repress autophosphorylation at Tyr416 of Src protein kinase, a key regulator of the cellular focal adhesion pathway, leading to reduction of ASM cellular focal adhesion. These results assign a novel role as a protein modification modulator to tRNA half molecules and unveil a tRNA-engaged pathway in the molecular pathogenesis of asthma.",

We investigated the underlying attentional and motor selection processes in working memory by means of oscillatory EEG parameters. Participants stored two, three or four objects in working memory and subsequent retroactive cues indicated one or two items as task-relevant. The oscillatory response in mu (10-14 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) frequencies with an estimated source in sensorimotor cortex contralateral to response side was used as a correlate of motor planning. There was a stronger suppression of oscillatory power when only one item was cued. Importantly, this effect appeared although the required response could not be anticipated at this point in time. This suggests that working memory can store multiple item-specific motor plans and the selection of a stored visual item leads to an automatic updating of associated response alternatives.",

    "abstract": "The challenges of breeding autotetraploid potato (Solanum tuberosum) have motivated the development of alternative breeding strategies. A common approach is to obtain uniparental dihaploids from a tetraploid of interest through pollination with S. tuberosum Andigenum Group (formerly S. phureja) cultivars. The mechanism underlying haploid formation of these crosses is unclear, and questions regarding the frequency of paternal DNA transmission remain. Previous reports described aneuploid and euploid progeny, which, in some cases, displayed genetic markers from the haploid inducer. Here, we surveyed a population of 167 presumed dihaploids for large-scale structural variation that would underlie chromosomal addition from the haploid inducer, and for small-scale introgression of genetic markers. In 19 progeny, we detected ten of the twelve possible trisomies and, in all cases, demonstrated the non-inducer parent origin of the additional chromosome. Deep sequencing indicated that occasional, short-tract signals appearing of haploid inducer origin were better explained as technical artifacts. Leveraging recurring CNV patterns, we documented sub-chromosomal dosage variation indicating segregation of polymorphic maternal haplotypes. Collectively, 52% of assayed chromosomal loci were classified as dosage variable. Our findings help elucidate the genomic consequences of potato haploid induction and suggest that most potato dihaploids will be free of residual pollinator DNA.",

    "abstract": "Human pregnancy requires the coordinated function of multiple tissues in both mother and fetus and has evolved in concert with major human adaptations. As a result, pregnancy-associated phenotypes and related disorders are genetically complex and have likely been sculpted by diverse evolutionary forces. However, there is no framework to comprehensively evaluate how these traits evolved or to explore the relationship of evolutionary signatures on trait-associated genetic variants to molecular function. Here we develop an approach to test for signatures of diverse evolutionary forces, including multiple types of selection, and apply it to genomic regions associated with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), a complex disorder of global health concern. We find that sPTB-associated regions harbor diverse evolutionary signatures including evolutionary sequence conservation (consistent with the action of negative selection), excess population differentiation (local adaptation), accelerated evolution (positive selection), and balanced polymorphism (balancing selection). Furthermore, these genomic regions show diverse functional characteristics which enables us to use evolutionary and molecular lines of evidence to develop hypotheses about how these genomic regions contribute to sPTB risk. In summary, we introduce an approach for inferring the spectrum of evolutionary forces acting on genomic regions associated with complex disorders. When applied to sPTB-associated genomic regions, this approach both improves our understanding of the potential roles of these regions in pathology and illuminates the mosaic nature of evolutionary forces acting on genomic regions associated with sPTB.",

    "abstract": "The active site of the essential, eukaryotic CDK1 kinase is generated by core structural elements, among which the PSTAIRE motif in the critical C-helix, is universally conserved in metazoans. The CDK2 kinase, sharing the PSTAIRE, arose early in metazoan evolution and permitted subdivision of tasks along the S-M-phase axis. The marine chordate, Oikopleura dioica, is the only metazoan known to possess more than a single CDK1 ortholog, and all of its 5 paralogs show sequence divergences in the PSTAIRE. Through assessing CDK1 gene duplications in the appendicularian lineage, we show that the CDK1 activation loop substrate binding platform, ATP entrance site, hinge region, and main Cyclin binding interface, have all diversified under positive selection. Three of the 5 CDK1 paralogs are required for embryonic divisions and knockdown phenotypes illustrate further subdivision of functions along the S-M-phase axis. In parallel to CDK1 gene duplications, there has also been amplification in the Cyclin B complement. Among these, the CDK1d:Cyclin Ba pairing is required for oogenic meiosis and early embryogenesis and shows evidence of coevolution of an exclusive interaction. In an intriguing twist on the general rule that Cyclin B oscillations on a background of stable CDK1 levels regulate M-phase MPF activity, it is CDK1d protein levels that oscillate, rather than Cyclin Ba levels, to drive rapid, early embryonic cell cycles. Strikingly, the modified PSTAIRE of odCDK1d shows convergence over great evolutionary distance with plant CDKB, and in both O. dioica, and plants, these variants exhibit increased specialization to M-phase.",

We investigated whether cognitive control training (CCT) changes hippocampal neural circuit function in mice, beyond the changes caused by place learning and memory formation. Mice learned and remembered a conditioned place avoidance during CCT that required ignoring irrelevant locations of shock. They were compared to controls that learned the same place avoidance under lower cognitive control demands. Weeks after CCT, mice learn new tasks in novel environments faster than controls; they learned to learn. We investigated entorhinal cortex-to-dentate gyrus neural circuit changes and report that CCT rapidly changes synaptic circuit function, resulting in an excitatory-inhibitory subcircuit change that persists for months. CCT increases inhibition that attenuates the dentate response to medial entorhinal cortical input, and through disinhibition, potentiates the response to strong inputs, pointing to overall signal-to-noise enhancement. These neurobiological findings support a neuroplasticity hypothesis that, beyond storing item/event associations, CCT persistently optimizes neural circuit information processing.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved effective strategies to defend themselves against pathogen invasion. Starting from the plasma membrane with the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) via pattern recognition receptors, internal cellular signaling pathways are induced to ultimately fend off the attack. Phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids to produce phosphatidic acid (PA), which has been proposed to play a second messenger role in immunity. The Arabidopsis PLD family consists of 12 members and for some a specific function in resistance towards a subset of pathogens has been shown. We demonstrate here that Arabidopsis PLD{gamma}1, but not its close homologs PLD{gamma}2 and PLD{gamma}3, is specifically involved in plant immunity. Genetic inactivation of PLD{gamma}1 resulted in increased resistance towards the virulent bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. As pld{gamma}1 mutant plants responded with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species to MAMP-treatment, a negative regulatory function for this PLD isoform is proposed. Importantly, PA levels in pld{gamma}1 mutants were not affected compared to stressed wild-type plants, suggesting that alterations in PA levels are unlikely the cause for the enhanced immunity in the pld{gamma}1 line. Instead, the plasma-membrane-attached PLD{gamma}1 protein colocalized and associated with the receptor-like kinases BIR2 and BIR3, which are known negative regulators of pattern-triggered immunity. Moreover, complex formation of PLD{gamma}1 and BIR2 was further promoted upon MAMP-treatment. Hence, we propose that PLD{gamma}1 acts as a negative regulator of plant immune responses in complex with immunity-related proteins BIR2 and BIR3.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryA phospholipase D is a novel negative regulator of plant immunity and forms complexes with regulatory receptor-like kinases.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogels are effective platforms for use as artificial extracellular matrices, cell carriers, and to present bioactive cues. Two common natural polymers, fibrin and alginate, are broadly used to form hydrogels and have numerous advantages over synthetic materials. Fibrin is a provisional matrix containing native adhesion motifs for cell engagement, yet the interplay between mechanical properties, degradation, and gelation rate is difficult to decouple. Conversely, alginate is highly tunable yet bioinert and requires modification to present necessary adhesion ligands. To address these challenges, we developed a fibrin-alginate interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel to combine the desirable adhesion and stimulatory characteristics of fibrin with the tunable mechanical properties of alginate. We tested its efficacy by examining capillary network formation with entrapped co-cultures of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). We manipulated thrombin concentration and alginate crosslinking density independently to modulate the fibrin structure, mesh size, degradation, and biomechanical properties of these constructs. In IPNs of lower stiffness, we observed a significant increase in total cell area (1.72x105 {+/-} 7.9x104 m2) and circularity (0.56 {+/-} 0.03) compared to cells encapsulated in stiffer IPNs (3.98x104 {+/-} 1.49x104 m2 and 0.77 {+/-} 0.09, respectively). Fibrinogen content did not influence capillary network formation. However, higher fibrinogen content led to greater retention of these networks confirmed via increased spreading and presence of F-actin at 7 days. This is an elegant platform to decouple cell adhesion and hydrogel bulk stiffness that will be broadly useful for cell instruction and delivery.",

The model can predict changes in proficiency levels over time and, ultimately, whether a given endangered language is on a long-term trajectory towards extinction or recovery. We calibrate the model using data from Wales and show that the model predicts that the Welsh language will thrive in the long term. We then apply the model to te reo M[a]ori, the Indigenous language of New Zealand, as a case study. Initial conditions for this model are estimated using New Zealand census data. We modify the model to describe a country, such as New Zealand, where the endangered language is associated with a particular subpopulation representing the Indigenous People.

Insulin stimulates glucose uptake in part by causing site-specific endoproteolytic cleavage of TUG, which mobilizes GLUT4 glucose transporters to the cell surface. Here, we show that the TUG C-terminal cleavage product enters the nucleus, binds the transcriptional regulators PGC-1 and PPAR{gamma}, and increases oxidative metabolism and thermogenic protein expression. Muscle-specific genetic manipulation of this pathway impacts whole-body energy expenditure, independent of glucose uptake. The PPAR{gamma}2 Pro12Ala polymorphism, which reduces diabetes risk, enhances TUG binding. The TUG cleavage product stabilizes PGC-1 and is itself susceptible to an Ate1 arginyltransferase -dependent degradation mechanism; binding of the TUG product confers Ate1-dependent stability upon PGC-1. We conclude that TUG cleavage coordinates energy expenditure with glucose uptake, that this pathway may contribute to the thermic effect of food, and that its attenuation may be important in obesity.",

    "abstract": "Within a species range, intraspecific diversity in the form of adaptive standing genetic variation (SGV) may be non-randomly clustered into different geographic regions, reflecting the combined effects of historical range movements and spatially-varying natural selection. As a consequence of a patchy distribution of adaptive SGV, populations in different parts of the range are likely to vary in their capacity to respond to changing selection pressures, especially long-lived sessile organisms like forest trees. However, the spatial distribution of adaptive SGV across the landscape is rarely considered when predicting species responses to environmental change. Here, we use a landscape genomics approach to estimate the distribution of adaptive SGV along spatial gradients reflecting the expansion history and contemporary climatic niche of balsam poplar, Populus balsamifera (Salicaceae), a widely distributed forest tree with a transcontinental distribution in North America. By scanning the genome for signatures of spatially varying local adaptation, we estimated how adaptive SGV has been shaped by geographic distance from the rear range edge (expansion history) versus proximity to the current center of the climatic niche (environmental selection). We found that adaptive SGV was strongly structured by the current climatic niche, with surprisingly little importance attributable to historical effects such as migration out of southern refugia. As expected, the effect of the climatic niche on SGV was strong for genes whose expression is responsive to abiotic stress (drought), although genes upregulated under biotic (wounding) stress also contained SGV that followed climatic and latitudinal gradients. The latter result could reflect parallel selection pressures, or co-regulation of functional pathways involved in both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Our study in balsam poplar suggests that clustering of locally adaptive SGV within ranges primarily reflects spatial proximity within the contemporary climatic niche - an important consideration for the design of effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and avoidance of maladaptation under climate change.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMale genitalia are thought to ensure transfer of sperm through direct physical contact with female during copulation. However, little attention has been given to their pre-copulatory role with respect to sexual selection and sexual conflict. Males of the fruitfly Drosophila pachea have a pair of asymmetric external genital lobes, which are primary sexual structures and stabilize the copulatory complex of female and male genitalia. We wondered if genital lobes in D. pachea may have a role before or at the onset of copulation, before genitalia contacts are made.\n\nResultsWe tested this hypothesis with a D. pachea stock where males have variable lobe lengths. In 92 mate competition trials with a single female and two males, females preferentially engaged into a first copulation with males that had a longer left lobe and that displayed increased courtship vigor. In 53 additional trials with both males having partially amputated left lobes of different lengths, we observed a weaker and non-significant effect of left lobe length on copulation success. Courtship durations significantly increased with female age and when two males courted the female simultaneously, compared to trials with only one courting male. In addition, lobe length did not affect sperm transfer once copulation was established.\n\nConclusionLeft lobe length affects the chance of a male to engage into copulation. The morphology of this primary sexual trait may affect reproductive success by mediating courtship signals or by facilitating the establishment of genital contacts at the onset of copulation.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the extent to which growing up in a socially mobile environment might decouple genetic endowments related to educational attainment with actual attainments. Many models of intergenerational transmission of advantage contain both a transmission channel through endowments (i.e. genetics) from parents to children as well as from parental investments and \\\"luck\\\". Indeed, many scholars consider the intergenerational links due to the transmission of genetically based advantage to place a lower bound on plausible levels of social mobility--genetics may be able to \\\"lock in\\\" advantage across generations. This paper explores this idea by using new genetic measurements in the Health and Retirement Study to examine potential interactions between social environments and genetics related to attainments. The results suggest evidence of gene environment interactions: children born in high mobility states have lower genetic penetrance--the interaction between state-level mobility and the polygenic score for education is negative. These results suggest a need to incorporate gene-environment interactions in models of attainment and mobility and to pursue the mechanisms behind the interactions.",

    "abstract": "Molecular techniques are expected to be highly useful in detecting taxa causing harmful algal blooms (HABs). This is the first report in Canada evaluating HABs-related species identification using a combination of morphological and molecular approaches. Microscopy, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and metabarcoding with multiple markers (i.e. 16S, 18S-dinoflagellate and 18S-diatom, large subunit (28S) rDNA) were applied on samples (n=54) containing suspected harmful algae (e.g. Alexandrium spp., Chattonella sp., Chrysochromulina spp., Dictyocha spp., Heterosigma akashiwo, Protoceratium reticulatum, Pseudochattonella verruculosa, Pseudo-nitzschia spp., Pseudopedinella sp.). Due to methodology limitations, qPCR result interpretation was limited, although good detectability occurred using previously published assays for Alexandrium tamarense, H. akashiwo, and P. verruculosa. Overall, the multiple-marker metabarcoding results were superior to the morphology-based methods, with the exception of taxa from the silicoflagellate group. The combined results using both 18S markers and the 28S marker together closely corresponded with morphological identification of targeted species, providing the best overall taxonomic coverage and resolution. The most numerous unique taxa were identified using the 18S-dinoflagellate amplicon, and the best resolution to the species level occurred using the 28S amplicon. Molecular techniques are therefore highly useful for HABs taxa detection, but currently depend on deploying multiple markers for metabarcoding.",

What aspects of substitution are important such that subjects accept an artificial sense and that it benefits their voluntary action repertoire? To obtain an evolutionary perspective on affective valence implied in sensory substitution, we introduce an animal model of deaf songbirds. As a substitute of auditory feedback, we provide binary visual feedback. Deaf birds respond appetitively to song-contingent visual stimuli, they skillfully adapt their songs to increase the rate of visual stimuli, showing that auditory feedback is not required for making targeted changes to a vocal repertoire. We find that visually instructed song learning is basal-ganglia dependent. Because hearing birds respond aversively to the same visual stimuli, sensory substitution reveals a bias for actions that elicit feedback to meet animals manipulation drive, which has implications beyond rehabilitation.",

With significant progress in deep learning, a series of neural network based models have been proposed and demonstrated with their good performances for peptide-HLA class I binding prediction. However, there still lack effective binding prediction models for HLA class II protein binding with peptides due to its inherent challenges. In this work, we present a novel sequence-based pan-specific neural network structure, DeepSeaPanII, for peptide-HLA class II binding prediction. Compared with existing pan-specific models, our model is an end-to-end neural network model without the need for pre- or post-processing on input samples. Besides state-of-the-art peformance in binding affinity prediction, DeepSeqPanII can also extract biological insight on the binding mechanism over the peptide and HLA sequences by its attention mechanism based binding core prediction capability. The leave-one-allele-out cross validation and benchmark evaluation results show that our proposed network model achieved state-of-the-art performance in HLA-II peptide binding.

    "abstract": "The human TRMT1 gene encodes a tRNA methyltransferase enzyme responsible for the formation of the dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) modification in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs. Frameshift mutations in the TRMT1 gene have been shown to cause autosomal-recessive intellectual disability (ID) in the human population but additional TRMT1 variants remain to be characterized. Moreover, the impact of ID-associated TRMT1 mutations on m2,2G levels in ID-affected patients is unknown. Here, we describe a homozygous missense variant in TRMT1 in a patient displaying developmental delay, ID, and epilepsy. The missense variant changes a conserved arginine residue to a cysteine (R323C) within the methyltransferase domain of TRMT1 and is expected to perturb protein folding. Patient cells expressing the TRMT1-R323C variant exhibit a severe deficiency in m2,2G modifications within tRNAs, indicating that the mutation causes loss-of-function. Notably, the TRMT1 R323C mutant retains the ability to bind tRNA but is unable to rescue m2,2G formation in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Our results identify a pathogenic point mutation in TRMT1 that severely perturbs tRNA modification activity, and provide the first demonstration that m2,2G modifications are disrupted in patients with TRMT1-associated ID disorders.",

    "abstract": "Understanding mutant evolution in spatially structured systems is crucially important for a range of biological systems, including bacterial populations and cancer. While previous work has shown that the mutation load is higher in spatially structured compared to well-mixed systems for neutral mutants in the absence of cell death, we demonstrate a significantly higher degree of complexity, using a comprehensive computational modeling approach that takes into account different mutant fitness, cell death, and different population structures. While an agent-based model assuming nearest neighbor interactions predicts a higher abundance of neutral or advantageous mutants compared to well-mixed systems of the same size, we show that for disadvantageous mutants, results depend on the nature of the disadvantage. In particular, if the disadvantage occurs through higher death rates, as opposed to lower reproduction rates, the result is the opposite, and a lower mutation load occurs in spatial compared to mixed systems. Interestingly, we show that in all cases, the same results are observed in fragmented patch models, where individuals can migrate to randomly chosen patches, thus lacking a strict spatial component. Hence, the results reported for spatial models are the consequence of population fragmentation, and not spatial restrictions per se. We further derive growth laws that characterize the expansion of wild type and mutant populations in different dimensionalities. For example, we find that while disadvantageous mutant abundance scales with the total population size, N, neutral mutants grow faster (as N2 for 1D, as N3/2 in 2D, and as N4/3 in 3D). Advantageous mutants scale with the cube of N in 1D and with the square of N in higher dimensions. These laws are universal (as long as mutants remain a minority) and independent of \\\"microscopic\\\" modeling details.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful model organism for studies of the innate immune system. One apparent difference between human and zebrafish innate immunity is the cellular machinery for LPS-sensing. In amniotes, the protein complex formed by Toll-like receptor 4 and myeloid differentiation factor 2 (Tlr4/Md-2) recognizes the bacterial molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and triggers an inflammatory response. It is believed that zebrafish have neither Md-2 nor Tlr4: Md-2 has not been identified outside of amniotes, while the zebrafish tlr4 genes appear to be paralogs, not orthologs, of amniote TLR4s. We revisited these conclusions. We identified a zebrafish gene encoding Md-2, ly96. Using single-cell RNA-Seq, we found that ly96 is transcribed in cells that also transcribe genes diagnostic for innate immune cells, including the zebrafish tlr4-like genes. Unlike amniote LY96, zebrafish ly96 expression is restricted to a small number of macrophage-like cells. In a functional assay, zebrafish Md-2 and Tlr4a form a complex that activates NF-{kappa}B signaling in response to LPS, but ly96 loss-of-function mutations gave little protection against LPS-toxicity in larval zebrafish. Finally, by analyzing the genomic context of tlr4 genes in eleven jawed vertebrates, we found that tlr4 arose prior to the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods. Thus, an LPS-sensitive Tlr4/Md-2 complex is likely an ancestral feature shared by mammals and zebrafish, rather than a de novo invention on the tetrapod lineage. We hypothesize that zebrafish retain an ancestral, low-sensitivity Tlr4/Md-2 complex that confers LPS-responsiveness to a specific subset of innate immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Active vision is a fundamental process by which primates gather information about the external world. Multiple brain regions have been studied in the context of simple active vision tasks in which a visual targets appearance is temporally separated from saccade execution. Most neurons have tight spatial registration between visual and saccadic signals, and in areas such as prefrontal cortex (PFC) some neurons show persistent delay activity that links visual and motor epochs and has been proposed as a basis for spatial working memory. Many PFC neurons also show rich dynamics, which have been attributed to alternative working memory codes and the representation of other task variables. Our study investigated the transition between processing a visual stimulus and generating an eye movement in populations of PFC neurons in macaque monkeys performing a memory guided saccade task. We found that neurons in two subregions of PFC, the frontal eye fields (FEF) and area 8Ar, differed in their dynamics and spatial response profiles. These dynamics could be attributed largely to shifts in the spatial profile of visual and motor responses in individual neurons. This led to visual and motor codes for particular spatial locations that were instantiated by different mixtures of neurons, which could be important in PFCs flexible role in multiple sensory, cognitive, and motor tasks.\\n\\nNew and NoteworthyA central question in neuroscience is how the brain transitions from sensory representations to motor outputs. The prefrontal cortex contains neurons that have long been implicated as important in this transition and in working memory. We found evidence for rich and diverse tuning in these neurons, that was often spatially misaligned between visual and saccadic responses. This feature may play an important role in flexible working memory capabilities.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel brain imaging method for objectively quantifying disease severity in Parkinson disease (PD). Levodopa pharmacological fMRI (phMRI) hysteresis mapping is based on the clinical observation that the benefit from a dose of levodopa wears off more quickly as PD progresses. Biologically this has been thought to represent decreased buffering capacity for dopamine as nigrostriatal cells die. Buffering capacity has been modeled previously based on clinical effects, but clinical measurements are influenced by confounding factors such as patient fatigue. The new method proposes to measure the effect directly and objectively based on the timing of the known metabolic and blood flow response of several brain regions to exogenous levodopa. Such responses are robust and can be quantified without ionizing radiation using perfusion MRI.\\n\\nHere we present simulation studies based on published clinical dose-response data and an intravenous levodopa infusion. Standard pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic methods were used to model the response. Then the effect site rate constant ke was estimated from simulated response data plus Gaussian noise.\\n\\nPredicted time:effect curves sampled at times consistent with phMRI differ substantially based on clinical severity. Estimated ke from noisy input data was recovered with good accuracy.\\n\\nThese simulation results support the feasibility of levodopa phMRI hysteresis mapping to measure the severity of dopamine denervation objectively and simultaneously in several brain regions.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) enables bodyless communication by means of the imagination of body movements. Since its apparition, MI-BCI has been widely used in applications such as guiding a robotic prosthesis, or the navigation in games and virtual reality (VR) environments. Although psychological experiments, such as the Rubber Hand Illusion - RHI, suggest the human ability for creating body transfer illusions, MI-BCI only uses the imagination of real body parts as neurofeedback training and control commands. The present work studies and explores the inclusion of an imaginary third arm as a part of the control commands for MI-BCI systems. It also compares the effectiveness of using the conventional arrows and fixation cross as training step (Graz condition) against realistic human hands performing the corresponding tasks from a first-person perspective (Hands condition); both conditions wearing a VR headset. Ten healthy subjects participated in a two-session EEG experiment involving open-close hand tasks, including a third arm that comes out from the chest. The EEG analysis shows a strong power decrease in the sensory-motor areas for the third arm task in both training conditions. Such activity is significantly stronger for Hands than Graz condition, suggesting that the realistic scenario can reduce the abstractness of the third arm and improve the generation of motor imagery signals. The cognitive load is also assessed both by NASA-TLX and Task Load index.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation is important in human health and disease, but the exact mechanisms remain largely enigmatic. DNA methylation represents one well-studied aspect of epigenetic regulation, but is challenging to quantify accurately. In this study, we introduce a digital approach for the absolute quantification of the amount, density and allele-specificity of DNA methylation. Combining the efficiency of methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes with the quantitative power of digital PCR, DNA methylation is measured accurately without the need to treat the DNA samples with sodium bisulphite. Moreover, as the combination of PCR amplicon and restriction enzyme is flexible, the context and density of DNA methylation can be taken into account. Additionally, by extending the experimental setup to a multiplex digital PCR, methylation markers may be analysed together with physically linked genetic markers to determine the allele-specificity of the methylation. In-silico simulations demonstrated the mathematical validity of the experimental setup. Next the approach was validated in a variety of healthy and malignant reference samples in the context of RASSF1A promotor methylation. RASSF1A is an established tumour suppressor gene, that is aberrantly methylated in many human cancers. A dilution series of well-characterized reference samples cross-validated the sensitivity and dynamic range of the approach. Compared to conventional PCR based methods, digital PCR provides a more accurate and more sensitive approach to quantify DNA methylation. As no sodium bisulphite conversion is needed, also analysis of minute amounts of DNA could be carried out efficiently.",

We present a new, transdiagnostic theory of how memory and mood interact in emotional disorders. Drawing upon retrieved-context models of episodic memory, we propose that memories form associations with the contexts in which they are encoded, including emotional valence and arousal. Later, encountering contextual cues retrieves their associated memories, which in turn reactivate the context that was present during encoding. We first show how our retrieved-context model accounts for findings regarding the organization of emotional memories in list-learning experiments.

However, insights on how MDA affects the eco-evolutionary dynamics of different Plasmodium species are not well known. We provide a computational model where the ecologically explicit life cycle of the parasite is implemented. Since the parasite inhabits two different ecological niches - human host and the mosquito - it undergoes different selection pressures during its reproduction. We use the model to perform an evolutionary analysis of the dynamics of resistance alleles under atovaquone, chloroquine and combined atovaquone-chloroquine drug treatments. Our study shows how the reduced viability of resistant parasites in the mosquito affects the spread of resistance and transmission interruption in treated human populations. Overall, results confirm that the disadvantage of drug-resistant genotypes in the mosquito vector is a good tool to achieve malaria control goals under MDA programmes.\\n\\nAuthor summaryEvery year there are millions of new malaria cases reported worldwide. The cause of the disease is the infection by Plasmodium, a protozoan which is transmitted between humans through the bite of a mosquito. Antimalarials have existed since long, but Plasmodium has evolved resistance to the treatment, making it necessary to develop new strategies to heal the infected humans. Lately, it has been pointed out that mosquitoes could be our allies when using drugs such as atovaquone, which resistant parasites have difficulties to reproduce in the mosquito. Here we study the scenarios in which these drugs, used in Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programmes, can interrupt the transmission of malaria in local treated populations.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of a neurons responses by the stimuli presented outside of its classical receptive field is ubiquitous in the visual system. This \\\"surround modulation\\\" mechanism is believed to be critical for efficient processing and leads to many well-known perceptual effects. The details of surround modulation, how-ever, are still not fully understood. One of the open questions is related to the differences in surround modulation mechanisms in different cortical areas, and their interactions. Here we study patterns of surround modulation in primary visual cortex (V1) and middle temporal complex (hMT+) utilizing a well-studied effect in motion perception, where human observers ability to discriminate the drift direction of a grating improves as its size gets bigger if the grating has a low contrast, and deteriorates if it has a high contrast. We first replicated the findings in the literature with a behavioral experiment using small and large (1.06 and 8.05 degrees of visual angle) drifting gratings with either low (2%) or high (99%) contrast presented at the periphery. Next, using functional MRI, we found that in V1 with increasing size cortical responses increased at both contrast levels, but they increased more at high contrast. Whereas in hMT+ with increasing size cortical responses remained unchanged at high contrast, and increased at low contrast. These findings show that surround modulation in V1 and hMT+ are distinct. Furthermore these findings provide evidence that the size-contrast interaction in motion perception is likely to originate in hMT+.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) comes under the family Flaviviridae and genus flavivirus. It predominantly infects the children under the age of 10 years and the case fatality rate can stretch out as high as 30%. Pigs act as reservoir and amplifying intermediate host for JEV. Recent report suggested longer persistence of JEV in tonsil than in circulation of experimentally infected pigs. The current investigation was conducted to understand the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of JEV infection in pigs in three different geographical sites in India (Odisha, Assam and Manipur). Serum samples were tested by ELISA and RT-PCR for detection of JEV, while only RT-PCR was done in case of tonsils tissues collected from pigs slaughtered in abattoir. Prevalence of JEV was highest in Manipur (25.45% in serum and 10.08% in tonsil) but lower in Assam (3.75% in serum and 0% in tonsils) and Odisha (1.49% in serum and 3.7% in tonsils). The percentage of sero-positivity was found to be 3.75% of IgM and 9.9% of IgG in Assam and Odisha respectively. Genotype III (GIII) of JEV was the dominant genotype and sporadic mutations of S83G, H76P, E78Q, C55S, and S64W along with two consistent mutations V46S and V51I were observed in all the GIII strains. Analysis of the E gene sequence revealed a single mutation, S118N in the GI strain. Older pigs (above 7 months) were found to be infected relatively more (8.6%) than younger pigs (age group 3-7 months). In conclusion, the high JE virus infection rate of pig in the current locations suggests the need for continuous surveillance of this virus in pigs which will ultimately help to adopt an effective control strategy to prevent the spread of JE infection to human.\\n\\nAuthor summaryJapanese encephalitis is one of the contributing factors in acute encephalitis syndrome cases reported across India as well as Asia. Primarily young naive human population are affected with JEV. The death rate can be as high as 30% and in about 30%-50% surviving population paralysis, brain damage or other serious permanent sequelae may be observed. The viral load gets amplified in pigs and thus plays a crucial role in transmitting the infection in human communities living in close proximity to pig dwelling. The current study was conducted to demonstrate prevalence of JEV in pig population of three geographical regions of India viz. the States of Odisha, Assam and Manipur that have reported JE outbreaks in human population. The current study demonstrates that the rate of infection is 3.28% among pigs in Manipur followed by Assam and Odisha. GIII was found to be the most predominant JEV genotype, while only one GI genotype strain was detected from Odisha region. These findings suggested the need of continuous surveillance of this virus in pigs and proper implementation of human and animal vaccination programme to control the infection.",

    "abstract": "The development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled the measurement of gene expression in individual cells. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the biological mechanisms at the cellular level. However, existing scRNA-seq analysis methods are susceptible to noise and outliers or ignore the manifold structure inherent in the data. In this paper, a novel method called Cauchy non-negative Laplacian regularized low-rank representation (CNLLRR) is proposed to alleviate the above problem. Specifically, we employ the Cauchy loss function (CLF) instead of the conventional norm constraints in the noise matrix of CNLLRR, which will enhance the robustness of the method. In addition, graph regularization term is applied to the objective function, which can capture the paired geometric relationships between cells. Then, alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is adopted to solve the optimization problem of CNLLRR. Finally, extensive experiments on scRNA-seq data reveal that the proposed CNLLRR method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for cell clustering, cell visualization and prioritization of gene markers. CNLLRR contributes to understand the heterogeneity between cell populations in complex biological systems.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAnalysis of single-cell data can help to further study the heterogeneity and complexity of cell populations. The current analysis methods are mainly to learn the similarity between cells and cells. Then they use the clustering algorithm to perform cell clustering or downstream analysis on the obtained similarity matrix. Therefore, constructing accurate cell-to-cell similarity is crucial for single-cell data analysis. In this paper, we design a novel Cauchy non-negative Laplacian regularized low-rank representation (CNLLRR) method to get a better similarity matrix. Specifically, Cauchy loss function (CLF) constraint is applied to punish noise matrix, which will improve the robustness of CNLLRR to noise and outliers. Moreover, graph regularization term is applied to the objective function, which will effectively encode the local manifold information of the data. Further, these will guarantee the quality of the cell-to-cell similarity matrix learned. Finally, single-cell data analysis experiments show that our method is superior to other representative methods.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic spines are the morphological basis of excitatory synapses in the cortex and their size and shape correlates with functional synaptic properties. Recent experiments show that spines exhibit large shape fluctuations that are not related to activity-dependent plasticity but nonetheless might influence memory storage at their synapses. To investigate the determinants of such spontaneous fluctuations, we propose a mathematical model for the dynamics of the spine shape and analyze it in 2D -- related to experimental microscopic imagery -- and in 3D. We show that the spine shape is governed by a local imbalance between membrane tension and the expansive force from actin bundles that originates from discrete actin polymerization foci. Experiments have shown that only few such polymerization foci co-exist at any time in a spine, each having limited life time. The model shows that the momentarily existing set of such foci pushes the membrane along certain directions until foci are replaced and other directions may now be affected. We explore these relations in depth and use our model to predict shape and temporal characteristics of spines from the different biophysical parameters involved in actin polymerization. Reducing the model further to a single recursive equation we finally demonstrate that the temporal evolution of the number of active foci is sufficient to predict the size of the model-spines. Thus, our model provides the first platform to study the relation between molecular and morphological properties of the spine with a high degree of biophysical detail.\\n\\nAuthor summarySynaptic spines are post-synaptic contact points for pre-synaptic signals in many cortical neurons and it has been shown that synaptic transmission is correlated with spine size. However, spine size and shape can vary quite strongly on short time scales and it is currently unknown how these shape variations emerge. In this study we present a biophysical model that links spine shape fluctuations to the dynamics of the spines actin-based cytoskeleton. We show that shape fluctuations arise from the fact that fast actin polymerization in a spine is a discrete process happening at only few polymerization foci. Life and death of these foci determine from moment to moment how the membrane bulges or retracts. We provide an in-depth analysis of this effect for a large set of biophysical parameters and quantify the spatial-temporal structure of the spines. Our model, thus, provides a quantitative characterization of the link between spine morphology and the underlying molecular processes, which forms an essential step towards a better understanding of synaptic transmission during steady state but also during synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "While resistance mutations are often implicated in the failure of cancer therapy, lack of response also occurs without such mutants. In bladder cancer mouse xenografts, repeated chemotherapy cycles have resulted in cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment, and consequent loss of therapy response due to the reduced susceptibility of CSCs to drugs. A particular feedback loop present in the xenografts has been shown to promote CSC enrichment in this system. Yet, many other regulatory loops might also be operational and might promote CSC enrichment. Their identification is central to improving therapy response. Here, we perform a comprehensive mathematical analysis to define what types of regulatory feedback loops can and cannot contribute to CSC enrichment, providing guidance to the experimental identification of feedback molecules. We derive a formula that reveals whether or not the cell population experiences CSC enrichment over time, based on the properties of the feedback. We find that negative feedback on the CSC division rate or positive feedback on differentiated cell death rate can lead to CSC enrichment. Further, the feedback mediators that achieve CSC enrichment can be secreted by either CSCs or by more differentiated cells. The extent of enrichment is determined by the CSC death rate, the CSC self-renewal probability, and by feedback strength. Defining these general characteristics of feedback loops can guide the experimental screening for and identification of feedback mediators that can promote CSC enrichment in bladder cancer and potentially other tumors. This can help understand and overcome the phenomenon of CSC-based therapy resistance.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac cell models reconstruct the action potential and calcium dynamics of cardiac myocytes, and are becoming widely used research tools. These models are highly detailed, with many parameters in the equations that describe current flow through ion channels, pumps, and exchangers in the cell membrane, and so it is difficult to link changes in model inputs to model behaviours. The aim of the present study was to undertake sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of two models of the human atrial action potential. We used Gaussian processes to emulate the way that 11 features of the action potential and calcium transient produced by each model depended on a set of. The emulators were trained by maximising likelihood conditional on a set of design data, obtained from 300 model evaluations. For each model evaluation, the set of inputs was obtained from uniform distributions centred on the default values for each parameter, using latin-hypercube sampling. First order and total effect sensitivity indices were calculated for each combination of input and output. First order indices were well correlated with the square root of sensitivity indices obtained by partial least squares regression of the design data. The sensitivity indices highlighted a difference in the balance of inward and outward currents during the plateau phase of the action potential in each model, with the consequence that changes to one parameter can have opposite effects in the two models. Overall the interactions among inputs were not as important as the first order effects, indicating that model parameters tend to have independent effects on the model outputs. This study has shown that Gaussian process emulators are an effective tool for sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of cardiac cell models.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe time course of the cardiac action potential is determined by the balance of inward and outward currents across the cell membrane, and these in turn depend on dynamic behaviour of ion channels, pumps and exchangers in the cell membrane. Cardiac cell models reconstruct the action potential by representing transmembrane current as a set of stiff and nonlinear ordinary differential equations. These models capture biophysical detail, but are complex and have large numbers of parameters, so cause and effect relationships are difficult to identify. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in uncertainty and variability in computational models, and a number of tools have been developed. In this study we have used one of these tools, Gaussian process emulators, to compare and contrast two models of the human atrial action potential. We obtained sensitivity indices based on the proportion of variance in a model output that is accounted for by variance in each of the model parameters. These sensitivity indices highlighted the model parameters that had the most influence on the model outputs, and provided a means to make a quantitative comparison between the models.",

In the present study, one possible candidate was isolated from the soil of Sundarban Mangroove Forest (Bangladesh) that has important physiological effects to inhibit this pathogenic bacterium. The bacterial isolate was initially identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens using BIOLOG identification system and confirmed to be B. amyloliquefaciens strain through 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The growth and antagonistic activity of this potential strain was shown to be stable under wide range of pH, temperature and salinity (NaCl). Moreover, the novel B. amyloliquefaciens isolate can also inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogenic bacteria. These results suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens might have potential antimicrobial properties and further research is required for future use of this bacterium as biological controls of S. rubidaea or development as new drugs for pathogenic bacteria.",
