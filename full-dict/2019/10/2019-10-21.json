    "abstract": "Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) is a powerful technique for interrogating membrane potential dynamics in assemblies of cortical neurons, but with effective resolution limits that confound interpretation. In particular, it is unclear how VSDI signals relate to population firing rates. To address this limitation, we developed an in silico model of VSDI in a biologically faithful digital reconstruction of rodent neocortical microcircuitry. Using this model, we extend previous experimental observations regarding the cellular origins of VSDI, finding that the signal is driven primarily by neurons in layers 2/3 and 5. We proceed by exploring experimentally inaccessible circuit properties to show that during periods of spontaneous activity, membrane potential fluctuations are anticorrelated with population firing rates. Furthermore, we manipulate network connections to show that this effect depends on recurrent connectivity and is modulated by external input. We conclude that VSDI primarily reflects inhibitory responses to ongoing excitatory dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Feedback inhibitory motifs are thought to be important for pattern separation across species. How feedback circuits may implement pattern separation of biologically plausible, temporally structured input in mammals is, however, poorly understood. We have quantitatively determined key properties of net feedback inhibition in the mouse dentate gyrus, a region critically involved in pattern separation. Feedback inhibition is recruited steeply with a low dynamic range (0 to 4% of active GCs), and with a non-uniform spatial profile. Additionally, net feedback inhibition shows frequency-dependent facilitation, driven by strongly facilitating mossy fiber inputs. Computational analyses show a significant contribution of the feedback circuit to pattern separation of theta modulated inputs, even within individual theta cycles. Moreover, pattern separation was selectively boosted at gamma frequencies, in particular for highly similar inputs. This effect was highly robust, suggesting that frequency dependent pattern separation is a key feature of the feedback inhibitory microcircuit.",

    "abstract": "Root growth relies on both cell division and elongation, which occur in the meristem and elongation zones respectively. SCARECROW (SCR) is a GRAS family gene essential for root growth and radial patterning in the Arabidopsis root. Previous studies showed that SCR promotes root growth by suppressing cytokinin response in the meristem, but there is also evidence that SCR expressed beyond the meristem is required as well for root growth. Here we report that SCR promotes root growth by promoting cell elongation through suppression of oxidative stress response and maintenance of redox homeostasis in the elongation zone. In the scr root, a higher level of hydrogen peroxide was detected, which can be attributed to down-regulation of peroxidase gene 3. When stress response was blocked or redox status was ameliorated by the aba2 or upb1 mutation, the scr mutant produced a significantly longer root with longer cells and a larger and mitotically more active meristem, even though the stem cell and radial patterning defects still persisted. We showed that WRKY15, an oxidative responsive gene, was a direct target of SCR down-regulated in the scr mutant, which suggests that SCR has an active role in suppressing oxidative stress response. Since hydrogen peroxide and peroxidases are essential for endodermal differentiation, these results suggest that SCR plays a central role in coordinating cell elongation, endodermal differentiation, redox homeostasis, and oxidative stress response in plant root.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryThis study reveals a novel mechanism of root growth regulation, which involves a previously unrecognized role of SCR in regulating cell elongation, endodermal differentiation, and redox homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "A-to-I editing is the most common editing type in human that is catalyzed by ADAR family members (ADARs), ADAR1 and ADAR2. Millions of A-to-I editing sites have been discovered recently, however, the regulation mechanisms of the RNA editing process are still not clear. Here we developed a two-step logistic regression model to identify genes that are potentially involved in RNA editing process in four human cancers. The first step by classifying the editing sites into different categories assists the analysis at the second step. In the first step, ADAR1 was identified as the enzyme that associated with the majority of the A-to-I editing sites. Thus, ADAR1 was taken as a control gene in the second step to identify genes that have a stronger effect on editing sites than ADAR1. In addition, the detectable interferons and their receptors were used as covariates in the both steps to account for potential association caused by interferons. Using our advanced method, we successfully found a set of genes that were significantly positively or negatively associated (PA or NA) with specific sets of RNA editing sites. We highlighted two genes, SRSF5 and MIR22HG which were supported by multiple evidences. Most PA and NA genes were unique to each cancer, and only a few shared across two cancers. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the PA genes from the four cancer types were enriched in Immune System, while the NA genes were enriched in two pathways: Metabolism of RNA, and Metabolism. The functional similarity of the PA and NA genes across all the four cancers indicates that even though most of the editing associated genes were unique to each cancer, they may impact on editing process through common pathways. Interestingly, the PA genes from kidney cancer were enriched for survival-associated genes while the NA genes were depleted of these genes, indicating that the PA genes may play more important roles in kidney cancer development.",

We integrated islet CAGE data with histone modification and chromatin accessibility profiles to identify epigenomic signatures of transcription initiation. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we validate transcriptional enhancer activity (5% FDR) for 2,279 of 3,378 (~68%) tested islet CAGE elements. TCs within accessible enhancers show higher enrichment to overlap type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals than existing islet annotations, which emphasizes the utility of mapping CAGE profiles in disease-relevant tissue.

    "abstract": "The rapid wide-scale spread of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) has caused serious crop losses globally. However, differences in the genetic background of subpopulations and the mechanisms of rapid adaptation behind the invasion are still not well understood. Here we report a 393.25-M chromosome-level genome assembly of fall armyworm with scaffold N50 of 13.3 M consisting of 23281 annotated protein-coding genes. Genome-wide resequencing of 105 samples from 16 provinces in China revealed that the fall armyworm population comprises a complex inter-strain hybrid, mainly with the corn-strain genetic background and less of the rice-strain genetic background, which highlights the inaccuracy of strain identification using mitochondrial or Tpi genes. An analysis of genes related to pesticide- and Bt-resistance showed that the risk of fall armyworm developing resistance to conventional pesticides is very high, while remaining currently susceptible to Bt toxins. Laboratory bioassay results showed that insects invading China carry resistance to organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides, but are sensitive to genetically modified maize expressing Cry1Ab in field experiments. Additionally, we found that two mitochondrial fragments are inserted into the nuclear genome, and the insertion event occurred after the differentiation of the two strains. This study represents a valuable advancement toward the analysis of genetic differences among subpopulations and improving management strategies for fall armyworm.",

Here we demonstrate that RIF1 is a molecular hub that co-regulates both processes. Both nuclear organisation and replication timing depend upon the interaction between RIF1 and PP1. However, whereas nuclear architecture requires the full complement of RIF1 and its interaction with PP1, replication timing is not sensitive to RIF1 dosage. RIF1s role in replication timing also extends beyond its interaction with PP1. Availing of this separation-of-function approach, we have therefore identified in RIF1 dual function the molecular bases of the co-dependency of the replication-timing program and nuclear architecture.",

The increasing of water salinization is a growing threat to Tibetan endemic fish species. Here we performed one of the first comparative genomics studies and began to characterize genomic signature of alkaline adaptation in a Schizothoracine fish inhabiting soda lake on the Tibetan Plateau. We found that expansions of lineage-specific genes associated with ion transport and transmembrane functions, genome-wide elevated rate of molecular evolution in Schizothoracine fishes relative to other lowland teleost fish species. In addition, we found specific changes in the rate of molecular evolution between G. p. kelukehuensis and other teleost fishes for ion transport-related genes. Furthermore, we identified a set of genes associated with ion transport and energy metabolism underwent positive selection. Using tissue-transcriptomics, we found that most REGs and PSGs in G. p. kelukehuensis were broadly expressed across three tissues and significantly enriched for ion transport functions. Finally, we identified a set of ion transport-related genes with evidences for both selection and co-expressed which contributed to alkaline tolerance in G. p. kelukehuensis.

Although we have extensive knowledge on biocrust ecosystem function and what drives biodiversity in lichen and moss dominated biocrusts, much less is understood about the impacts of diversity among microbial communities. Moreover, most biocrust microbial composition studies have primarily focused on bacteria. We used amplicon-based metabarcode sequencing to explore composition of both fungal and bacterial communities in biocrusts. Specifically we tested how geography, soil depth, and crust type structured biocrust microbial communities or fungal-bacterial networks. Microbial communities were surveyed from biocrust surface and subsurface soils collected from Joshua Tree National Park, Granite Mountain, Kelso Dunes, and Cima volcanic flows located within the Mojave Desert, USA. Five biocrust types were examined: Light-algal, Cyano-lichen, Green-algal lichen, Smooth moss, and Rough moss crust types. We found the primary characteristics structuring biocrust microbial diversity were 1) geography, as central and southern Mojave sites displayed different community signatures, 2) presence of plant associated fungi (plant pathogens and wood saprotrophs), indicator, and endemic species were identified at each site, 3) soil depth patterns, as surface and subsurface microbial communities were distinctly structured, and 4) the crust type, which predicted distinct microbial compositions. Network analysis showed that Cyanobacteria and Dothideomycetes (Pleosporales) were the major hubs of overall biocrust microbial community. Such hierarchical spatial organization of biocrust communities and their associated biotic networks can have pronounced impacts to ecosystem functions. Our findings provide crucial insights for dryland restoration and sustainable management.",

    "abstract": "The 16S rRNA gene is the golden standard target of sequencing to uncover the composition of bacterial communities but the presence of multiple copies of the gene makes gene copy normalization (GCN) inevitable. Even though GCN resulted in abundances closer to the metagenome, it should be validated by communities with known composition as both amplicon and shotgun sequencing are prone to methodological biases. Here we compared the composition of three mock communities to the composition derived from 16S sequencing without and with GCN. In all of them, the 16S composition was different from the mock community and GCN improved the picture only in the community with the lowest Shannon diversity. Albeit with low abundance, half of the identified genera were not present in the mock communities. Our approach provides empirical evidence to the methodological biases introduced by sequencing that was only counteracted by GCN in the case of low -diversity, potentially due to the small number of bacterial taxa with known gene copy numbers. We thus cannot recommend the use of GCN moving forward and it is questionable whether a complete catalogue of 16S rRNA copy numbers can outweigh the methodological biases of sequencing.",

Most brain-age research utilises structural neuroimaging to index brain volume. However, ageing affects multiple aspects of brain structure and function, which can be examined using multi-modality neuroimaging. Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modelled in n=2,205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2*, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (n=520), chronological age was accurately predicted (r=0.79, mean absolute error=3.52 years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly grey-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (n=14,701), significant associations with multi-modality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for: stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p<0.05). Multi-modality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.",

    "abstract": "Every year, millions of Australian Bogong moths (Agrotis infusa) complete an astonishing journey: in spring, they migrate over 1000 km from their breeding grounds to the alpine regions of the Snowy Mountains, where they endure the hot summer in the cool climate of alpine caves. In autumn, the moths return to their breeding grounds, where they mate, lay eggs and die. These moths can use visual cues in combination with the geomagnetic field to guide their flight, but how these cues are processed and integrated in the brain to drive migratory behavior is unknown. To generate an access point for functional studies, we provide a detailed description of the Bogong moths brain. Based on immunohistochemical stainings against synapsin and serotonin (5HT), we describe the overall layout as well as the fine structure of all major neuropils, including the regions that have previously been implicated in compass-based navigation. The resulting average brain atlas consists of 3D reconstructions of 25 separate neuropils, comprising the most detailed account of a moth brain to date. Our results show that the Bogong moth brain follows the typical lepidopteran ground pattern, with no major specializations that can be attributed to their spectacular migratory lifestyle. These findings suggest that migratory behavior does not require widespread modifications of brain structure, but might be achievable via small adjustments of neural circuitry in key brain areas. Locating these subtle changes will be a challenging task for the future, for which our study provides an essential anatomical framework.",

Profiling chloroplast envelope membranes was achieved by a cross comparison of protein intensities across plastid and the enriched membrane fraction both under normal and cold conditions. Multivariable logistic regression models the probabilities for the classification problem to address envelop localization. In total, we identified 38 envelope membrane intrinsic or associated proteins exhibiting altered abundance after cold acclimation. These proteins comprise several solute carries, such as the ATP/ADP antiporter NTT2 (substantially increased abundance) or the maltose exporter MEX1 (substantially decreased abundance). Remarkably, analysis of the frost recovery of ntt loss-of-function and mex1 overexpressor mutants confirmed that the comparative proteome is well suited to identify novel key factors involved in cold acclimation and acquisition of freezing tolerance. Moreover, for proteins with known physiological function we propose scenarios explaining their possible role in cold acclimation. Furthermore, spatial proteomics introduces a novel layer of complexity and enabled the identification of proteins differentially localized at the envelope membrane under the changing environmental regime.",

    "abstract": "Xanthomonas species, Pseudomonas syringae and Ralstonia solanacearum are bacterial plant pathogens that cause significant yield loss in many crop species. Current control methods for these pathogens are insufficient but there is significant potential for generating new disease-resistant crop varieties. Plant immune receptors encoded by nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes typically confer resistance to pathogens that produce a cognate elicitor, often an effector protein secreted by the pathogen to promote virulence. The diverse sequence and presence / absence variation of pathogen effector proteins within and between pathogen species usually limits the utility of a single NLR gene to protecting a plant from a single pathogen species or particular strains. The NLR protein Recognition of XopQ 1 (Roq1) was recently identified from the plant Nicotiana benthamiana and mediates perception of the effector proteins XopQ and HopQ1 from Xanthomonas and P. syringae respectively. Unlike most recognized effectors, alleles of XopQ/HopQ1 are highly conserved and present in most plant pathogenic strains of Xanthomonas and P. syringae. A homolog of XopQ/HopQ1, named RipB, is present in many R. solanacearum strains. We found that Roq1 also mediates perception of RipB and confers immunity to Xanthomonas, P. syringae, and R. solanacearum when expressed in tomato. Strong resistance to Xanthomonas perforans was observed in three seasons of field trials with both natural and artificial inoculation. The Roq1 gene can therefore be used to provide safe, economical and effective control of these pathogens in tomato and other crop species and reduce or eliminate the need for traditional chemical controls.\n\nSummaryA single immune receptor expressed in tomato confers strong resistance to three different bacterial diseases.",

    "abstract": "Ascorbate (vitamin C) plays essential roles in development, signaling, hormone biosynthesis, regulation of gene expression, stress resistance and photoprotection. In vascular plants, violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE) requires ascorbate (Asc) as reductant, thereby it is required for the energy-dependent component of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). In order to assess the role of Asc in NPQ in green algae, which are known to contain low amounts of Asc, we searched for an insertional Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant affected in the VTC2 gene, essential for Asc biosynthesis. The Crvtc2-1 knockout mutant was viable and, depending on the growth conditions, it contained 10 to 20% Asc relative to its wild type. When Chlamydomonas was grown photomixotrophically at moderate light, the zeaxanthin-dependent component of NPQ emerged upon strong red illumination both in the Crvtc2-1 mutant and in its wild type. Deepoxidation was unaffected by Asc deficiency, demonstrating that the Chlorophycean VDE found in Chlamydomonas does not require Asc as a reductant. The rapidly induced, energy-dependent NPQ component, characteristic of photoautotrophic Chlamydomonas cultures grown at high light, was not limited by Asc deficiency either. On the other hand, a reactive oxygen species-induced photoinhibitory NPQ component was greatly enhanced upon Asc deficiency, both under photomixotrophic and photoautotrophic conditions. These results demonstrate that Asc has distinct roles in NPQ formation in Chlamydomonas than in vascular plants.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryIn Chlamydomonas -in contrast to seed plants-, ascorbate is not required for violaxanthin deepoxidation and energy-dependent non-photochemical quenching but it mitigates photoinhibitory quenching.",

The effect of i admission during a medical handover on clinical outcomes is unknown.\n\nObjectivesOur purpose was to evaluate the impact of ICU admission during a medical handover on clinical outcomes.\n\nMethodsPost hoc analysis of a cohort study addressing the effect of ICU admissions during the handover on outcomes. This retrospective, single center, propensity matched cohort study was conducted in a 41-bed open general ICU located in a private tertiary care hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Based on time of ICU admission, patients were categorized into two cohorts: handover group (ICU admission between 6:30 am to 7:30 or 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm) or control group (admission between 7:31 am to 6:29 pm or 7:31 pm to 6:29 am). Patients in the handover group were propensity matched to patients in the control group at 1:2 ratio. Our primary outcome was hospital mortality.\n\nResultsBetween June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2015, 6,650 adult patients were admitted to the ICU. Following exclusion of ineligible participants, 5,779 patients [389 (6.7%) in handover group and 5390 (93.3%) in control group] were eligible for propensity score matching, of whom 1,166 were successfully matched [389 (33.4%) handover group and 777 (66.6%) in control group]. Before matching, hospital mortality was 14.1% (55/389 patients) in handover group compared to 11.7% (628/5,390) in control group (p=0.142). After propensity-score matching, ICU admission during handover was not associated with increased risk of ICU (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.92 to 2.11; p=0.11) and hospital (OR, 1.23; 95%CI, 0.85 to 1.75; p=0.26) mortality. ICU and hospital length of stay did not differ between the groups.\n\nConclusionIn this propensity-matched single center cohort study, ICU admission during medical handover did not affect clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Twelve human THAP proteins share the THAP domain, an evolutionary conserved zinc-finger DNA-binding domain. Studies of different THAP proteins have indicated roles in gene transcription, cell proliferation and development. We have analyzed this protein family, focusing on THAP7 and THAP11. We show that human THAP proteins possess differing homo- and heterodimer formation properties and interaction abilities with the transcriptional co-regulator HCF-1. HEK-293 cells lacking THAP7 were viable but proliferated more slowly. In contrast, HEK-293 cells were very sensitive to THAP11 alteration. Nevertheless, HEK-293 cells bearing a THAP11 mutation identified in a patient suffering from cobalamin disorder (THAP11F80L) were viable although proliferated more slowly. Cobalamin disorder is an inborn vitamin deficiency characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities, most often owing to biallelic mutations in the MMACHC gene, whose gene product MMACHC is a key enzyme in the cobalamin (vitamin B12) metabolic pathway. We show that THAP11F80L selectively affected promoter binding by THAP11, having more deleterious effects on a subset of THAP11 targets, and resulting in altered patterns of gene expression. In particular, THAP11F80L exhibited a strong effect on association with the MMACHC promoter and led to a decrease in MMACHC gene transcription, suggesting that the THAP11F80L mutation is directly responsible for the observed cobalamin disorder.",

    "abstract": "Microbial biomass is increasingly used to predict respiration in soil organic carbon (SOC) models. Its increased use combined with the difficulty of accurately measuring this variable points a need to directly assess the importance of microbial biomass abundance for carbon (C) cycling. To test the hypothesis that the initial microbial biomass abundance (i.e. biomass abundance on new plant litter) is a strong driver of plant litter C cycling, we manipulated biomass abundance by 10 and 100-fold dilution and composition using 12 source communities on sterile pine litter and measured respiration in microcosms for 30 days. In the first two days of microbial growth on fresh litter, a 100-fold difference in initial biomass abundance caused an average difference in respiration of nearly 300%, but the effect rapidly declined to less than 30% in 10 days and to 14% in 30 days. Parallel simulations with a soil carbon model, SOMIC 1.0, also predicted a 14% difference over 30 days, consistent with the experimental results. Model simulations predicted convergence of cumulative CO2 to within 10% in three months and within 4% in three years. Rapid microbial growth likely attenuates the effects of large initial differences in biomass abundance. In contrast, the persistence of source community as an explanatory factor in driving differences in respiration across microcosms supports the importance of microbial composition in C cycling. Overall, the results suggest that the initial abundance of microbial biomass on litter is a weak driver of C flux from litter decomposition over long timescales (months to years) when litter communities have equal nutrient availability. By extension, slight variation in the timing of microbial dispersal to fresh litter is likely to be a minor factor in long-term C flux.\\n\\nImportanceMicrobial biomass is one of the most common microbial parameters used in land carbon (C) cycle models, however, it is notoriously difficult to measure accurately. To understand the consequences of mismeasurement, as well as the broader importance of microbial biomass abundance as a direct driver of ecological phenomena, greater quantitative understanding of the role of microbial biomass abundance in environmental processes is needed. Using microcosms, we manipulated the initial biomass of numerous microbial communities across a 100-fold range and measured effects on CO2 production during plant litter decomposition. We found that the effects of initial biomass abundance on CO2 production was largely attenuated within a week, while the effects of community type remained significant over the course of the experiment. Overall, our results suggest that initial microbial biomass abundance in litter decomposition within an ecosystem is a weak driver of long-term C cycling dynamics.",

The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) and its receptor, OXTR, influence social behavior across species. In humans and animals, common variants within the OXTR gene (OXTR) have been associated with varying socio-behavioral traits. However, the reported magnitude of influence of individual variants on complex behavior has been inconsistent. Compared to human studies, non-human primate (NHP) studies in controlled environments have the potential to result in robust effects detectable in relatively small samples. Here we estimate heritability of social behavior and central OXT concentrations in 214 socially-housed adult female rhesus macaques, a species sharing high similarity with humans in genetics, physiology, brain and social complexity. We present a bioinformatically-informed approach for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with likely biological relevance. We tested 13 common SNPs in regulatory and coding regions of OXTR for associations with behavior (pro-social, anxiety-like, and aggressive) and OXT concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We found moderate rates of heritability for both social behavior and CSF OXT concentrations. No tested SNPs showed significant associations with behaviors or CSF in this sample. Associations between OXT CSF and social behavior were not significant either. SNP effect sizes were generally comparable to those reported in human studies of complex traits. While environmental control and a socio-biological similarity with humans is an advantage of rhesus models for detecting smaller genetic effects, it is insufficient to obviate large sample sizes necessary for appropriate statistical power.",

    "abstract": "Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were formally used as flame-retardants and are chemically stable, lipophlic persistent organic pollutants which are known to bioaccumulate in humans. Although its toxicities are well characterized, little is known about the changes in transcriptional regulation caused by PBDE exposure. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of transcriptional and translational processes. It is hypothesized that lncRNAs can regulate nearby protein-coding genes (PCGs) and changes in the transcription of lncRNAs may act in cis to perturb gene expression of its neighboring PCGs. The goals of this study were to 1) characterize PCGs and lncRNAs that are differentially regulated from exposure to PBDEs; 2) identify PCG-lncRNA pairs through genome annotation and predictive binding tools; and 3) determine enriched canonical pathways caused by differentially expressed lncRNA-PCGs pairs. HepaRG cells, which are human-derived hepatic cells that accurately represent gene expression profiles of human liver tissue, were exposed to BDE-47 and BDE-99 at a dose of 25 M for 24 hours. Differentially expressed lncRNA-PCG pairs were identified through DESeq2 and HOMER; significant canonical pathways were determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). LncTar was used to predict the binding of 19 lncRNA-PCG pairs with known roles in drug-processing pathways. Genome annotation revealed that the majority of the differentially expressed lncRNAs map to PCG introns. PBDEs regulated overlapping pathways with PXR and CAR such as protein ubiqutination pathway and PPAR-RXR activation but also regulate distinctive pathways involved in intermediary metabolism. BDE-47 uniquely regulated signaling by Rho Family GTPases and PBDE-99 uniquely regulates JAK/Stat signaling, bile acid biosynthesis, sirtuin signaling pathway, and autophagy. In conclusion, lncRNAs play essential roles in modifying important pathways involved in intermediary metabolism such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",

As a biological control agent, the nucleoside antibiotic wuyiencin has been industrially produced and widely used as an effective fungicide. To elucidate the effects of wuyiencin on the transcriptional regulation in B. cinerea, we, for the first time, report a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of B. cinerea treated with wuyiencin. We could identify 2067 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); of them, 886 and 1181 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional categorization indicated that genes involved in amino acid metabolism and those encoding putative secreted proteins were remarkably influenced in response to wuyiencin treatment. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis and energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) and of those encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters was markedly upregulated, whereas that of genes participating in DNA replication, cell cycle, and stress response was downregulated. Furthermore, wuyiencin resulted in mycelial malformation and negatively influenced cell growth rate and conidial yield in B. cinerea. Our results suggest that this nucleoside antibiotic regulates all aspects of cell growth and differentiation in B. cinerea.

Studies of the SW biosynthesis pathway in these fungi have demonstrated the requirement for a swnK gene and the presence of a variety of other SWN cluster genes, but have not determined a precise role for the swnR gene, which encodes a NADB Rossmann-fold reductase, nor if it is necessary for the biosynthesis of SW. In this study, we used homologous recombination (HR) to knock out the swnR gene of M. anisopliae to determine its effect on the SW biosynthesis pathway. The concentration of SW was measured in the fermentation broth of M. anisopliae at 1 d, 3 d, 5 d and 7 d using a Q Exactive Mass Spectrometer. The gene for swnR was detected by RT-qPCR. To determine the role of the swnR gene in the SW biosynthesis pathway of M. anisopliae, we used PEG-mediated homologous recombination (HR) to transform a wild-type strain (WT) with a Benomyl (ben)-resistant fragment to knock out the swnR gene producing a mutant-type strain (MT). A complemented-type (CT) strain was produced by adding a complementation vector that contains the glufosinate (herbicide) resistance (bar) gene as a marker. The content of SW decreased, but was not eliminated in the fermentation broth of the MT strain, and returned to the original level in the CT strain. These results indicate that the swnR gene plays a crucial role in the SW biosynthesis pathway of M. anisopliae, but suggests that another gene in the fungus may share the function of swnR.",

We evaluated these claims with the state of California as a control, which has prohibited sport hunting since 1972. We tested four hypotheses: 1) Sport hunting reduces puma density, 2) Sport hunting reduces problematic puma-human encounters, 3) Sport hunting reduces puma predation on livestock, and 4) Sport hunting reduces the impact of puma predation on wild ungulate numbers. Results indicated: 1) Puma densities did not differ between California and sport hunting states, 2) California was the 3rd lowest in per capita puma-human incidents. 3) The per capita loss of sheep was significantly lower (t = 5.7, P < 0.001) and the per capita loss of cattle in California did not differ significantly, from the other 10 states (P = 0.13). 4). Changes in annual deer populations in California correlated with changes in other states (F = 95.4, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.68) and average deer densities in California did not differ significantly from the other states. We concluded that sport hunting of pumas as a management tool has not produced the outcomes sought by wildlife managers and may even exacerbate conflicts between pumas and humans. It is suggested that state agencies re-assess the use of sport hunting as a management tool for pumas.",

    "abstract": "Buruli ulcer (BU), caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is currently treated by a daily combination of rifampin and either injectable streptomycin or oral clarithromycin. An intermittent oral regimen would facilitate the treatment supervision. We first evaluated the bactericidal activity of newer antimicrobials against M. ulcerans using a BU animal model. The imidazopyridine amine Q203 exhibited high bactericidal activity whereas tedizolid (oxazolidinone close to linezolid), selamectine and ivermectine (avermectine compound) and the benzothiazinone PBTZ169 were not active. Consequently, Q203 was evaluated for its bactericidal and sterilizing activities in combined intermittent regimens. Q203 given twice a week in combination with one of the other long half-life compounds, rifapentine or bedaquiline, sterilized the mice footpads in 8 weeks, i.e. after a total of only 16 doses, and prevented relapse during a period of 20 weeks after stopping the treatment. These results are very promising for future intermittent oral regimens which would greatly simplify BU treatments in the field.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe current treatment of Buruli ulcer (BU), infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans is based on a daily antibiotic combination of rifampin associated with streptomycin or clarithromycin. A shorter or intermittent treatment without an injectable drug would clearly simplify the management on the field. We evaluated the bactericidal activity of several new antimicrobials drugs in a mice model of BU and found that the Q203 exhibited the highest bactericidal effect. We subsequently identified new antibiotic combinations containing Q203 with high sterilizing activity when administrated twice a week for 8 weeks.",

    "abstract": "Studying the biology of sleep requires the accurate assessment of the state of experimental subjects, and manual analysis of relevant data is a major bottleneck. Recently, deep learning applied to electroencephalogram and electromyogram data has shown great promise as a sleep scoring method, approaching the limits of inter-rater reliability. As with any machine learning algorithm, the inputs to a sleep scoring classifier are typically standardized in order to remove distributional shift caused by variability in the signal collection process. However, in scientific data, experimental manipulations introduce variability that should not be removed. For example, in sleep scoring, the fraction of time spent in each arousal state can vary between control and experimental subjects. We introduce a standardization method, mixture z-scoring, that preserves this crucial form of distributional shift. Using both a simulated experiment and mouse in vivo data, we demonstrate that a common standardization method used by state-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithms introduces systematic bias, but that mixture z-scoring does not. We present a free, open-source user interface that uses a compact neural network and mixture z-scoring to allow for rapid sleep scoring with accuracy that compares well to contemporary methods. This work provides a set of computational tools for the robust automation of sleep scoring.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHealth education involves not only providing relevant information but also facilitating health-related behavior change. Patient education during the waiting period plays an essential role in promoting health and improving patient satisfaction rates.\n\nObjectiveTo promote health by educating patients and their companions during their waiting period at the King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) Hospital, Riyadh, with the help of nurses and assess their satisfaction rate.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional study, including patients and their companions in the waiting rooms of the various OPDs, was conducted. Group teaching sessions were conducted, followed by the assessment of patient and nurse satisfaction rate, and compliance rate using evaluation forms. Pre-implementation surveys were conducted to assess the drawbacks, based on which procedure was modified, and feedback was recorded using an electronic iPad. Data were collected with the help of questionnaires filled at the end of each teaching session and analyzed using descriptive analysis. Results of both the assessment and re-assessment were compared in terms of the number of attendees.\n\nResultsThere was an improvement in number of attendees (4362 vs. 3392), patient satisfaction rate (90% vs. 78%), nurse satisfaction rate (83.09% vs. 33.18%) and compliance rate (100% vs. 65%) post-modifications. Few loopholes in terms of inappropriate environment and time of the lecture were also observed.\n\nConclusionThe health educators can assist people in achieving their health goals by organizing structured health education activities, providing appropriate health education materials, and effective training. However, the satisfaction rates of people and health educators should be assessed by conducting routine feedback surveys.",
