    "abstract": "The Drosophila ovary is a widely used model for germ cell and somatic tissue biology. We have used single-cell RNA-sequencing to build a comprehensive cell atlas of the adult Drosophila ovary containing unique transcriptional profiles for every major cell type in the ovary, including the germline and follicle stem cells. Using this atlas we identify novel tools for identification and manipulation of known and novel cell types and perform lineage tracing to test cellular relationships of previously unknown cell types. By this we discovered a new form of cellular plasticity in which inner germarial sheath cells convert to follicle stem cells in response to starvation.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=162 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/798223v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (60K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b4c486org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d24e4aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1217adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d09a63_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Nearly all mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and imported into mitochondria following synthesis on cytosolic ribosomes. These precursor proteins are translocated into mitochondria by the TOM complex, a protein-conducting channel in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Using cryo-EM, we have obtained high-resolution structures of both apo and presequence-bound core TOM complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in dimeric and tetrameric forms. Dimeric TOM consists of two copies each of five proteins arranged in two-fold symmetry--Tom40, a pore-forming {beta}-barrel with an overall negatively-charged inner surface, and four auxiliary -helical transmembrane proteins. The structure suggests that presequences for mitochondrial targeting insert into the Tom40 channel mainly by electrostatic and polar interactions. The tetrameric complex is essentially a dimer of dimeric TOM, which may be capable of forming higher-order oligomers. Our study reveals the molecular organization of the TOM complex and provides new insights about the mechanism of protein translocation into mitochondria.",

Cryo-preserved cells are milled and a lamella with a thickness of 200-300 nm provides an electron transparent window suitable for cryo-ET imaging. Cryo-FIB milling is an effective method, but it is a tedious and time-consuming process, which typically results in ~10 lamellae per day. Here, we introduce an automated method to reproducibly prepare cryo-lamellae on a grid and reduce the amount of human supervision. We tested the routine on cryo-preserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that this method allows an increased throughput, achieving a rate of 5 lamellae/hour without the need to supervise the FIB milling. We demonstrate that the quality of the lamellae is consistent throughout the preparation and their compatibility with cryo-ET analyses.",

    "abstract": "Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are one of the prominent determinants that triggers a persistent state aiding Mycobacterium tuberculosis evasion to host generated stresses. The 79 characterized and putative TA systems described in M. tuberculosis are dominated by the VapBC, MazEF, HigAB, RelBE and ParDE TA families, largely involved in persistence and cell arrest. Hence, there is a need to maintain and conserve the TA loci in the chromosome of the pathogen. It is essential to study the genomic differences of the TA systems in clinical isolates along with its association to drug susceptibility patterns and lineage. In the current study, the TA loci and their promoter sequences were analysed from the whole genome sequence data of 74 clinical isolates. Mykrobe Predictor was used for lineage identification and drug resistance predictions in the clinical isolates. Polymorphisms associated with 79.8% (63/79) TA systems were observed across 72 clinical isolates. Among the TA systems, the isolates had a varying number of polymorphisms localised primarily in the toxin genes (58.7%), antitoxin genes (40.7%) and chaperones (0.6%), due to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) resulting in transition (67.3%), transversion or frameshift mutations. Our analysis suggests the presence of novel Phylo-SNPs by establishing high confidence association of specific lineages to polymorphisms in the TA systems. Notably, association of polymorphisms in Rv1838c-1839c (VapBC13), Rv3358-3357 (YefM/YoeB) and Rv0240-0239 (VapBC24) to Delhi/Central Asia lineage. The polymorphic loci of the 3 TA systems is localised in the antitoxin gene of the Delhi/Central Asia strains, with a resultant silent mutation. The assessment of correlation between TA polymorphisms and the drug resistance profile revealed correlation of SNPs in VapBC35 with drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains and SNPs in VapBC24, VapBC13 and YefM/YoeB to drug sensitive strains.",

    "abstract": "The non-invasive nature of fMRI would make it an excellent tool for determining language lateralization, potentially replacing the WADA test that is now considered the gold standard. However, while the result of the WADA test has 3 straightforward categories, i.e. left, right, or bilateral language lateralization, fMRI lateralization indices (LIs) are on a continuous scale between -1 (completely right lateralized) and 1 (completely left lateralized), requiring arbitrary thresholding to come to a useful clinical measure. We hypothesize that the absence of clear categories in fMRI LIs is in part linked to imperfect fMRI task control and/or homotopically mapped language activity in the non-dominant hemisphere. In this study we attempt to account for these sources of brain activity by making a detailed homotopic comparison between voxels in the language areas and their homologues, which is now possible using the Cgrid toolbox. 36 epilepsy were included who underwent presurgical fMRI including a picture naming and verb generation task, in addition to the WADA test, functional Transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD), or Electrocortical stimulation (ECS). LIs were calculated using a traditional approach, and a novel approach based on the paired comparison between language voxels and their homologues. We observed that lateralization indices came in closer alignment with those established by the WADA test, ECS, of fTCD. Activity maps indicated that the accounting for imperfect fMRI task control was at least part of the reason for the improvement when using the new approach. This Cgrid based approach could help fMRI replacing the more invasive WADA test in the future.",

    "abstract": "As development proceeds, inductive cues are interpreted by competent tissues in a spatially and temporally restricted manner. While key inductive signaling pathways within competent cells are well-described at a molecular level, the mechanisms by which tissues lose responsiveness to inductive signals are not well understood. Localized activation of Wnt signaling before zygotic gene activation in Xenopus laevis leads to dorsal development, but competence to induce dorsal genes in response to Wnts is lost by the late blastula stage. We hypothesize that loss of competence is mediated by changes in histone modifications leading to a loss of chromatin accessibility at the promoters of Wnt target genes. We use ATAC-seq to evaluate genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility across several developmental stages. Based on overlap with p300 binding, we identify thousands of putative cis-regulatory elements at the gastrula stage, including sites that lose accessibility by the end of gastrulation and are enriched for pluripotency factor binding motifs. Dorsal Wnt target gene promoters are not accessible after the loss of competence in the early gastrula while genes involved in mesoderm and neural crest development maintain accessibility at their promoters. Inhibition of histone deacetylases increases acetylation at the promoters of dorsal Wnt target genes and extends competence for dorsal gene induction by Wnt signaling. Histone deacetylase inhibition, however, is not sufficient to extend competence for mesoderm or neural crest induction. These data suggest that chromatin state regulates the loss of competence to inductive signals in a context-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalaria continues to be a disease of massive burden in Africa, and the public health resources targeted at surveillance, prevention, control, and intervention comprise large outlays of expense. Malaria transmission is largely constrained by the suitability of the climate for Anopheles mosquitoes and Plasmodium parasite development. Thus, as climate changes, we will see shifts in geographic locations suitable for transmission, and differing lengths of seasons of suitability, which will require changes in the types and amounts of resources.\\n\\nMethodsWe mapped the shifting geographic risk of malaria transmission, in context of changing seasonality (i.e. endemic to epidemic, and vice-versa), and the number of people affected. We applied a temperature-dependent model of malaria transmission suitability to continental gridded climate data for multiple future climate model projections. We aligned the resulting outcomes with programmatic needs to provide summaries at national and regional scales for the African continent. Model outcomes were combined with population projections to estimate the population at risk at three points in the future, 2030, 2050, and 2080, under two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).\\n\\nResultsGeographic shifts in endemic and seasonal suitability for malaria transmission were observed across all future scenarios of climate change. The worst-case regional scenario (RCP8.5) of climate change places an additional 75.9 million people at risk from endemic (10-12 months) exposure to malaria transmission in Eastern and Southern Africa by the year 2080, with the greatest population at risk in Eastern Africa. Despite a predominance of reduction in season length, a net gain of 51.3 million additional people will be put at some level of risk in Western Africa by midcentury.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study provides an updated view of potential malaria geographic shifts in Africa under climate change for the more recent climate model projections (AR5), and a tool for aligning findings with programmatic needs at key scales for decision makers. In describing shifting seasonality, we can capture transitions between endemic and epidemic risk areas, to facilitate the planning for interventions aimed at year-round risk versus anticipatory surveillance and rapid response to potential outbreak locations.",

    "abstract": "The competition between bacteria often involves both nutrients and phage predators and may give rise to abrupt regime shifts between the alternative stable states characterized by different species compositions. While such transitions have been previously studied in the context of competition for nutrients, the case of phage-induced bistability between competing bacterial species has not been considered yet. Here we demonstrate a possibility of regime shifts in well-mixed phage-bacterial ecosystems. In one of the bistable states the fast-growing bacteria competitively exclude the slow-growing ones by depleting their common nutrient. Conversely, in the second state the slow-growing bacteria with a large burst size generate such a large phage population that the other species cannot survive. This type of bistability can be realized as the competition between a strain of bacteria protected from phage by abortive infection and another strain with partial resistance to phage. It is often desirable to reliably control the state of microbial ecosystems, yet bistability significantly complicates this task. We discuss successes and limitations of one control strategy in which one adds short pulses to populations of individual species. Our study proposes a new type of phage therapy, where introduction of the phage is supplemented by addition of a partially resistant host bacteria.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPhage-microbial communities play an important role in human health as well as natural and industrial environments. Here we show that these communities can assume several alternative species compositions separated by abrupt regime shifts. Our model predicts these regime shifts in the competition between bacterial strains protected by two different phage defense mechanisms: abortive infection/CRISPR and partial resistance. The history dependence caused by regime shifts greatly complicates the task of manipulation and control of a community. We propose and study a successful control strategy via short population pulses aimed at inducing the desired regime shifts. In particular, we predict that a fast-growing pathogen could be eliminated by a combination of its phage and a slower-growing susceptible host.",

    "abstract": "Defying the cliche that biological variation arises from differences in nature or nurture, genetically identical animals reared in the same environment exhibit striking differences in their behaviors. Innate behaviors can be surprisingly flexible, for example by exhibiting context-dependence. The intersection of behavioral individuality and context-dependence is largely unexplored, particularly at the neural circuit level. Here, we show that individual flies tendencies to turn left or right (locomotor handedness) changes when ambient illumination changes. This change is itself a stable individual behavioral characteristic. Silencing output neurons of the central complex (a premotor area that mediates goal-directed navigation) blocks this change. These neurons respond to light with idiosyncratic changes to their baseline calcium levels, and idiosyncratic morphological variation in their presynaptic arbors correlates with idiosyncratic sensory-context-specific turn biases. These findings provide a circuit mechanism by which individual locomotor biases arise and are modulated by sensory context.",

Furthermore, the role of PSY2 in fruit color development in pepper is unknown. Here, we used a systemic approach to discover the genetic factors responsible for the yellow fruit color of C. annuum  MicroPep Yellow (MY) and to reveal the role of PSY2 in fruit color. We detected a complete deletion of PSY1 and a retrotransposon insertion in CCS in MY. Despite the loss of PSY1 and CCS function, the MY and mutant F2 plants from a cross between MY and the MicroPep Red (MR) accumulated basal levels of carotenoids, indicating that other PSY genes may complement the loss of PSY1. A qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that PSY2 is constitutively expressed in both MR and MY fruits, and a color complementation assay using Escherichia coli revealed that PSY2 is capable of biosynthesizing a carotenoid. Virus-induced gene silencing of PSY2 in MY resulted in white fruits. These findings suggest that PSY2 can compensate for the absence of PSY1 in fruit, resulting in the yellow color of MY fruits.\\n\\nHighlightWe reveal the novel function of PSY2 in the development of yellow pepper fruit coloration using a psy1 knockout mutant.

    "abstract": "Soybean is an important crop plant for food and biofuel production, and there have been considerable efforts to develop transgenic soybean lines with higher seed oil contents and/or seed yields. However, the process of screening transgenic lines is laborious and requires a large amount of space. Here, we describe a powerful screening method, Glycine max Fluorescence-Accumulating Seed Technology (GmFAST), which is based on a seed-specific fluorescent marker. The marker is composed of a soybean seed-specific promoter coupled to the OLE1-GFP gene, which encodes GFP fused to the oil-body membrane protein OLEOSIN1 of Arabidopsis thaliana. We introduced the marker gene into cotyledonary nodes of G. max Kariyutaka via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and regenerated heterozygous transgenic plants. OLE1-GFP-expressing soybean seeds can be selected nondestructively using a fluorescence stereomicroscope. Among T2 seeds, the most strongly fluorescent seeds were homozygous. GmFAST uses one-tenth of the growing space required for the conventional method. This space-saving method will contribute to facilitating transformation of soybean. OLE1-GFP was localized specifically to oil bodies in the cotyledon cells of seeds, but it did not affect oil content per seed, the size and density of the oil bodies, or oil composition. One of the homozygous lines (line #8) showed a 44% increase in the seed pod number, which resulted in 41% and 30% increases in seed yield and total oil production, respectively, compared with the wild type. In line #8, OLE1-GFP was inserted into the intron of Glyma13g30950, causing its overexpression. An increase in seed pod number was confirmed in Arabidopsis thaliana plants that overexpressed the Arabidopsis ortholog of Glyma13g30950, E6L1. These results suggest that line #8 is a valuable resource for agricultural and industrial applications. Taken together, GmFAST provides a space-saving visual and non-destructive screening method for soybean transformation, thereby increasing the chance of developing useful soybean lines.",

    "abstract": "In conditions such as minimally-verbal autism, standard assessments of language comprehension are often unreliable. Given the known heterogeneity within the autistic population, it is crucial to design tests of semantic comprehension that are sensitive in individuals. Recent efforts to develop neural signals of language comprehension have focused on the N400, a robust marker of lexical-semantic violation at the group level. However, homogeneity of response in individual neurotypical children has not been established. Here, we presented 20 neurotypical children with congruent and incongruent visual animations and spoken sentences while measuring their neural response using EEG. Despite robust group-level responses, we found high inter-individual variability in response to lexico-semantic anomalies. To overcome this, we analysed our data using temporally and spatially unconstrained MVPA, supplemented by descriptive analyses to examine the timecourse, topography, and strength of the effect. Our results show that neurotypical children exhibit heterogenous responses to lexical-semantic violation, implying that any application to heterogenous disorders such as ASD will require individual-subject analyses that are robust to variation in topology and timecourse of neural responses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesMost primate species live in groups, and temporal and spatial coordination of activities of individuals is essential for maintaining group cohesion, and there is still considerable debate to which degree social organization, the extent of despotism, and resource distribution shape group coordination processes. As different baboon species exhibit considerable variation in all of these factors, they constitute an excellent test case to resolve this debate.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe analyzed group departures and progressions of Guinea baboons, Papio papio, in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal. Guinea baboons live in a multi-level society with strong male bonds and a lack of a clear dominance hierarchy between males.\\n\\nResultsTwo-thirds of departures were initiated by adult males, and one third by adult females. Although initiators were more likely to signal than followers, signaling did not affect the initiation success. During group progression, males that were not affiliated with females were predominantly found in the front, while affiliated males, females and young were observed more frequently closer to the center of the group, and no preferences for rear positions. Overall, affiliated subjects were more likely to depart and travel together.\\n\\nDiscussionThe group departures in Guinea baboons differed strikingly from the elaborate  negotiation behaviors among male hamadryas baboons, Papio hamadryas. We did not observe that specific individuals dominated the group coordination. Neither social organization, variation in despotism, nor resource distribution alone explain variation between species. Future studies should test whether specific combinations of factors promote the occurrence of negotiation processes.\\n\\nResearch HighlightsO_LIIn wild Guinea baboons, both adult males and females initiated group departures\\nC_LIO_LIInitiators signaled during departures, but this did not affect initiation success\\nC_LIO_LISolitary males were predominantly found at the front during group progression\\nC_LI",

Horn fly susceptibility to diazinon was measured before and after treatment, and peaks of infestation were recorded. Three groups of Bradford bovines were evaluated: Group 1 (control untreated), Group 2 (15% treated) and Group 3 (control 100% treated). Weekly counts of horn flies were performed on the same animals for 78 days. Two peaks of infestation were recorded, and a higher number of horn flies occurred in the untreated control group than in the untreated cows of the selectively treated group throughout the entire period of the study, except for a single week. The horn fly field population was significantly more susceptible to diazinon than the reference susceptible strain both before and after insecticide treatment. In conclusion, treatment of 15% of the most infested animals from a herd, with 40% diazinon ear tags, quickly reduced horn fly infestations of the entire herd and may be a practical approach for horn fly control, reducing costs and chemical use.",

Although competition and predation are known to act simultaneously in communities, theory and empirical study of the two processes continue to be developed independently. Here, we integrate modern coexistence theory and food web theory to simultaneously quantify the relative importance of predation, competition, and environmental fluctuations for species coexistence. We first examine coexistence in a classic multi-trophic model, adding complexity to the food web using a novel machine learning approach. We then apply our framework to a parameterized rocky intertidal food web model, partitioning empirical coexistence dynamics. We find that both environmental fluctuation and variation in predation contribute substantially to species coexistence. Unexpectedly, covariation in these two forces tends to destabilize coexistence, leading to new insights about the role of bottom-up versus top-down forces in both theory and the rocky intertidal ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomics has begun to elucidate the genomic basis of social life in insects but insight into the genomic basis of spider sociality has lagged behind. To begin to characterize genomic signatures associated with the evolution of social life in spiders, we performed one of the first spider comparative genomics studies including five solitary species and two social species, representing two independent origins of sociality in the genus Stegodyphus. We found that the two social spider species had a large expansion of gene families associated with transport and metabolic processes and an elevated genome-wide rate of molecular evolution compared with the five solitary spider species. Genes that were rapidly evolving in the two social species relative to the five solitary species were enriched for transport, behavior, and immune functions, while genes that were rapidly evolving in the solitary species were enriched for energy metabolism processes. Most rapidly evolving genes in the social species S. dumicola were broadly expressed across four tissues and enriched for transport functions, but 12 rapidly evolving genes showed brain-specific expression and were enriched for social behavioral processes. Altogether, our study identifies putative genomic signatures and potential candidate genes associated with spider sociality. These results indicate that future spider comparative genomic studies, including broader sampling and additional independent origins of sociality, can further clarify the genomic causes and consequences of social life.",

    "abstract": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are blood cancers characterized by excessive production of mature myeloid cells that result from the acquisition of somatic driver mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1. While substantial progress has been made to define the causal somatic mutation profile for MPNs2, epidemiologic studies indicate a significant heritable component for the disease that is among the highest known for all cancers3. However, only a limited set of genetic risk loci have been identified, and the underlying biological mechanisms leading to MPN acquisition remain unexplained. Here, to define the inherited risk profile, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study of MPNs to date (978,913 individuals with 3,224 cases) and identified 14 genome-wide significant loci, as well as a polygenic signature that increases the odds for disease acquisition by nearly 3-fold between the top and median deciles. Interestingly, we find a shared genetic architecture between MPN risk and several hematopoietic traits spanning distinct lineages, as well as an association between increased MPN risk and longer leukocyte telomere length, collectively implicating HSC function and self-renewal. Strikingly, we find a significant enrichment for risk variants mapping to accessible chromatin in HSCs compared with other hematopoietic populations. Finally, gene mapping identifies modulators of HSC biology and targeted variant-to-function analyses suggest likely roles for CHEK2 and GFI1B in altering HSC function to confer disease risk. Overall, we demonstrate the power of human genetic studies to illuminate a previously unappreciated mechanism for MPN risk through modulation of HSC function.",

    "abstract": "Allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis, which quantifies the relative expression of two alleles in a diploid individual, is a powerful tool for identifying cis-regulated gene expression variations that underlie phenotypic differences among individuals. Existing methods for gene-level ASE detection analyze one individual at a time, therefore wasting shared information across individuals. Failure to accommodate such shared information not only loses power, but also makes it difficult to interpret results across individuals. However, ASE detection across individuals is challenging because the data often include individuals that are either heterozygous or homozygous for the unobserved cis-regulatory SNP, leading to heterogeneity in ASE as only those heterozygous individuals are informative for ASE, whereas those homozygous individuals have balanced expression. To simultaneously model multi-individual information and account for such heterogeneity, we developed ASEP, a mixture model with subject-specific random effect accounting for multi-SNP correlations within the same gene. ASEP is able to detect gene-level ASE under one condition and differential ASE between two conditions (e.g., pre-versus post-treatment). Extensive simulations have demonstrated the convincing performance of ASEP under a wide range of scenarios. We further applied ASEP to RNA-seq data of human macrophages, and identified genes showing evidence of differential ASE pre-versus post-stimulation, which were extended through findings in cardiometabolic trait-relevant genome-wide association studies. To the best of our knowledge, ASEP is the first method for gene-level ASE detection at the population level. With the growing adoption of RNA-seq, we believe ASEP will be well-suited for various ASE studies for human diseases.",

Here, we report that human CST (CTC1-STN1-TEN1), a single-stranded DNA binding protein complex, localizes at stalled forks and protects forks from MRE11 nuclease degradation upon replication perturbation. CST deficiency causes nascent strand degradation, ssDNA accumulation after fork stalling, and delay in replication recovery, leading to cellular sensitivity to fork stalling agents. Purified CST binds to 5 overhangs and directly blocks MRE11 degradation in vitro, and the DNA binding ability of CST is required for blocking MRE11-mediated nascent strand degradation. Finally, we uncover that CST and BRCA2 form non-overlapping foci upon fork stalling, and CST inactivation is synthetic with BRCA2 deficiency in inducing genome instability. Collectively, our findings identify CST as an important fork protector to preserve genome integrity under replication perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Global efforts to ensure that 90% of all HIV-infected people receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be virally suppressed by 2020 could be crippled by increases in acquired and transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR), which challenge ART efficacy. The long-term sustainability of ART treatment programs is contingent on effective HIVDR monitoring yet current Sanger sequencing genotypic resistance tests are inadequate for large-scale implementation in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A simple, rapid, affordable HIVDR diagnostic would radically improve the treatment paradigm in LMICs by facilitating informed clinical decision-making upon ART failure. Although point mutation assays can be broadly deployed in this context, the primary challenge arises from extensive sequence variation surrounding targeted drug resistance mutations (DRMs). Here, we systematically and intentionally violate the canonical principles of qPCR design to develop a novel assay, Pan-Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA), that mitigates the impact of DRM-proximal secondary polymorphisms on probe-based qPCR performance to enable subtype-independent, focused resistance genotyping. Using extremely degenerate primers with 3 termini overlapping the probe-binding site, the HIV-1 genome is adapted through site-directed mutagenesis to replace secondary polymorphisms flanking the target DRM during the initial qPCR cycles. We show that PANDAA can quantify key HIV DRMs present at [&ge;]5% and has diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 96.9% and 97.5%, respectively, to detect DRMs associated with ART failure. PANDAA is an innovative solution for HIVDR genotyping and is an advancement in qPCR technology that could be applicable to any scenario where target-proximal genetic variability has been a roadblock in diagnostic development.",

    "abstract": "Cell-to-cell variability generates subpopulations of drug-tolerant cells that diminish the efficacy of cancer drugs. Efficacious combination therapies are thus needed to block drug-tolerant cells via minimizing the impact of heterogeneity. Probabilistic models such as Bliss independence are developed to evaluate drug interactions and their combination efficacy based on probabilities of specific actions mediated by drugs individually and in combination. In practice, however, these models are often applied to conventional dose-response curves in which a normalized parameter with a value between zero and one, generally referred to as fraction of cells affected (fa), is used to evaluate the efficacy of drugs and their combined interactions. We use basic probability theory, computer simulations, time-lapse live cell microscopy, and single-cell analysis to show that fa metrics may bias our assessment of drug efficacy and combination effectiveness. This bias may be corrected when dynamic probabilities of drug-induced phenotypic events, i.e. induction of cell death and inhibition of division, at a single-cell level are used as metrics to assess drug efficacy. Probabilistic phenotype metrics offer the following three benefits. First, in contrast to the commonly used fa metrics, they directly represent probabilities of drug action in a cell population. Therefore, they deconvolve differential degrees of drug effect on tumor cell killing versus inhibition of cell division, which may not be correlated for many drugs. Second, they increase the sensitivity of short-term drug response assays to cell-to-cell heterogeneities and the presence of drug-tolerant subpopulations. Third, their probabilistic nature allows them to be used directly in unbiased evaluation of synergistic efficacy in drug combinations using probabilistic models such as Bliss independence. Altogether, we envision that probabilistic analysis of single-cell phenotypes complements currently available assays via improving our understanding of heterogeneity in drug response, thereby facilitating the discovery of more efficacious combination therapies to block drug-tolerant cells.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryResistance to therapy due to tumor cell heterogeneity poses a major challenge to the use of cancer drugs. Cell-to-cell variability generates subpopulations of drug-tolerant cells that diminish therapeutic efficacy, even in populations of cells scored as highly sensitive based on drug potency. Overcoming such heterogeneity and blocking subpopulations of drug-tolerant cells motivate efforts toward identifying efficacious combination therapies. The success of these efforts depends on our ability to distinguish how heterogeneous populations of cells respond to individual drugs, and how these responses are influenced by combined drug interactions. In this paper, we propose mathematical and experimental frameworks to evaluate time-dependent drug interactions based on probabilistic metrics that quantify drug-induced tumor cell killing or inhibition of division at a single-cell level. These metrics can reveal heterogeneous drug responses and their changes with time and drug combinations. Thus, they have important implications for designing efficacious combination therapies, especially those designed to block or overcome drug-tolerant subpopulations of cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of healthy versus pathological tissue is a key concern when modeling tissue microstructure in the peritumoral area, confounded by the presence of free water (e.g., edema). Most methods that model tissue microstructure are either based on advanced acquisition schemes not readily available in the clinic, or are not designed to address the challenge of edema. This underscores the need for a robust free water elimination (FWE) method that estimates free water in pathological tissue but can be used with clinically prevalent single-shell diffusion tensor imaging data. FWE in single-shell data requires the fitting of a bi-compartment model, which is an ill-posed problem. Its solution requires optimization, which relies on an initialization step. We propose a novel initialization approach for FWE, FERNET, which improves the estimation of free water in edematous and infiltrated peritumoral regions, using single-shell diffusion MRI data. The method has been extensively investigated on simulated data and healthy and brain tumor datasets, demonstrating its applicability on clinically acquired data. Additionally, it has been applied to data from brain tumor patients to demonstrate the improvement in tractography in the peritumoral region.",

    "abstract": "Detecting somatic mutations withins tumors is key to understanding treatment resistance, patient prognosis, and tumor evolution. Mutations at low allelic frequency, those present in only a small portion of tumor cells, are particularly difficult to detect. Many algorithms have been developed to detect such mutations, but none models a key aspect of tumor biology. Namely, every tumor has its own profile of mutation types that it tends to generate. We present BATCAVE (Bayesian Analysis Tools for Context-Aware Variant Evaluation), an algorithm that first learns the individual tumor mutational profile and mutation rate then uses them in a prior for evaluating potential mutations. We also present an R implementation of the algorithm, built on the popular caller MuTect. Using simulations, we show that adding the BATCAVE algorithm to MuTect improves variant detection. It also improves the calibration of posterior probabilities, enabling more principled tradeoff between precision and recall. We also show that BATCAVE performs well on real data. Our implementation is computationally inexpensive and straightforward to incorporate into existing MuTect pipelines. More broadly, the algorithm can be added to other variant callers, and it can be extended to include additional biological features that affect mutation generation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractsMicrobial diversity is one of the most important drivers on ecosystem to maintain the simultaneous performance of functions (multifunctionality, MF) under climatic oscillation. However, existing studies typically consider taxonomic richness or Shannon index at the community level in which relations between diversity and functioning are not highly consistent. To disentangle the underlying linkages in real-world ecosystems, we conducted field investigation on biological soil crusts of Tibetan Plateau and evaluated multiple diversity facets (i.e., richness, evenness, and phylogeny-related trait dissimilarity) of carbon- and nitrogen-fixing functional groups (FGs). Seven crucial variables of soil functioning were also identified to calculate MF. We found that the integrated index, invoking multiple diversity components, was a stronger predictor on MF than richness. Moreover, the divergent performance of different diversity facets determined the idiosyncratic diversity effect of each FG on the MF. Namely, richness was the dominant factor for diazotrophs to maximize MF, whereas phylogenetic dissimilarity was the most important one for phototrophs. The heterogeneity among the focal FGs derived from the significant differentiation of the extent of multifunctional redundancy. Collectively, we speculated that the multifaceted diversity pattern depicts the response ability of crucial FGs by which biocrusts stabilize MF under environmental perturbation. Taken together, our results provided a perspective to bridge the gap between taxonomic and trait-based approaches for elucidating the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship, and could ultimately help to boost the practices of dryland management against global change.",

    "abstract": "The duration of the developmental period represents a fundamental axis of life history variation in animals, yet broad insights regarding the drivers of this diversity are currently lacking. Here using embryological data combined with information on incubation and fledging periods for 3096 species, we test key mechanistic and adaptive explanations for the evolutionary diversification of developmental durations in birds. First, using data on embryonic development for 20 model species, we show that developmental phases associated primarily with growth are longer and more variable than earlier phases, consistent with a role for allometric constraint in determining the duration of development. Second, using phylogenetic comparative methods, we find that avian developmental durations retain a strong imprint of deep evolutionary history, and that after accounting for these effects, body size differences among species explain less variation (5-22%) in developmental period lengths than previously thought. Finally, by collecting data for a suite of potential explanatory variables, our analyses reveal broad-scale ecological correlates of developmental durations, including variables associated with the relative safety of the developmental environment (e.g. nest height, insularity) and pressures of breeding phenology (e.g. migration). Overall, our results reveal that the combined effects of species body size, ecology, and phylogenetic history can account for 62-93% of the variation in developmental durations across birds, providing broad-scale quantitative insight into the relative importance of mechanistic constraints, adaptive evolution and evolutionary constraints in shaping the diversification of this key life-history trait.",

The extent to which RNA editing might be involved in diseases originated in the placenta remains unknown, because RNA editing has rarely been studied in the placenta. Here, we have systematically profiled RNA editome on the placentae from 9 patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia (EOSPE) and 32 normal subjects, and a widespread RNA editing dysregulation in EOSPE has been identified. The mis-edited gene set is enriched with known preeclampsia-associated genes and differentially expressed genes in EOSPE. The \\\"RNA editing events\\\" at two microRNA binding sites in 3-UTR of the LEP mRNA were generated, which could lead to increased expression level of LEP in trophoblast cells. Upregulation of LEP were also observed in the placentae of PE patients. These results suggest that widespread placental RNA editing may be involved in placental development and dysregulation of RNA editing in the placenta may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",

Sample thinning by cryo-focused ion beam (cryoFIB) milling has significantly expanded the range of samples that can be analyzed by cryoET. Unfortunately, cryoFIB milling is low-throughput, time-consuming and manual. Here we report a method for fully automated sequential cryoFIB preparation of high-quality lamellae, including rough milling and polishing. We reproducibly applied this method to eukaryotic and bacterial model organisms, and show that the resulting lamellae are suitable for cryoET imaging and subtomogram averaging.

Here we used brain imaging and assays of serum proteins and tracer extravasation, to determine that BBB disruption occurring after status epilepticus in mice was sufficient to permit passage of systemically-injected antisense OGNs targeting microRNA-134 (Ant-134) into the brain parenchyma. A single intraperitoneal injection of Ant-134 two hours after status epilepticus in mice resulted in potent suppression of spontaneous recurrent seizures, reaching a 99.5% reduction during recordings at three months. The duration of spontaneous seizures, when they occurred, was also reduced in Ant-134-treated mice. These studies indicate that systemic delivery of Ant-134 reaches the brain and produces disease-modifying effects after systemic injection in mice when timed with BBB disruption and may be a clinically-viable approach for this and other disease-modifying microRNA therapies.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen depletion in rodents and humans leads to inactivity, unhealthy fat accumulation, and diabetes1,2, underscoring the conserved metabolic benefits of estrogen that inevitably decline with aging. In rodents, the preovulatory surge in 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) temporarily allows energy expenditure to outpace energy intake, thus coordinating increased physical activity with peak sexual receptivity. To investigate how estrogen rebalances energy allocation in females, we examine estrogen receptor alpha (ER) signaling in the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHvl)3-7. We uncover a small population of VMHvlER neurons expressing the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) that integrates estrogen and melanocortin signals and projects to arousal centers in the hippocampus and hindbrain, enabling bursts of physical activity. ER recruitment to the Mc4r gene promotes upregulation of Mc4r in VMHvl neurons during the preovulatory surge or following E2 treatment. We leveraged three models to stimulate VMHvlMC4R neurons, restore MC4R signaling in the VMHvl of hyperphagic MC4R null females, or increase Mc4r levels in the VMHvl by CRISPR-mediated activation. All models increase spontaneous activity, whereas silencing VMHvlMC4R neurons blunts normal activity. Direct activation of the VMHvlMC4R node overrides the inactivity and hypometabolism following hormone depletion. These data extend the impact of MC4R signaling - the most common cause of monogenic human obesity8 - beyond the regulation of food intake. Our findings also rationalize reported sex differences in melanocortin signaling, including the greater disease severity of MC4R insufficiency in women9. The hormone-dependent node identified here illuminates the power of estrogen in motivating behavior during the female reproductive cycle and for maintaining an active lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "An animal at rest or engaged in stationary behaviors can instantaneously initiate goal-directed walking. How descending brain inputs trigger rapid transitions from a non-walking state to an appropriate walking state is unclear. Here, we identify two specific neuronal classes in the Drosophila brain that drive two distinct forward walking programs in a context-specific manner. The first class, named P9, consists of descending neurons that drive forward walking with ipsilateral turning. P9 receives inputs from central courtship-promoting neurons and visual projection neurons and is necessary for a male to track a female during courtship. The second class comprises novel, higher order neurons, named BPN, that drives straight, forward walking. BPN is required for high velocity walking and is active during long, fast, straight walking bouts. Thus, this study reveals separate brain pathways for object-directed steering and fast straight walking, providing insight into how the brain initiates different walking programs.",

Chemical modification of a unique cysteine residue is among the most facile methods for site-specific labeling of proteins.

This trial-and-error process often results in cysteine-free proteins with reduced activity or stability. Herein we describe a general methodology to rationally engineer cysteine-less proteins. Briefly, natural variation across orthologues is exploited to identify suitable cysteine replacements compatible with protein activity and stability. As a proof-of-concept, we recount the successful engineering of a cysteine-less mutant of the group II chaperonin from methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis.

    "abstract": "TDP-43 is an RNA/DNA-binding protein of versatile physiological functions and it is also implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease in addition to several other implicated proteins such as mutant SOD1 and FUS etc. Cytoplasmic mis-localization, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) due to RNA depletion and aggregation of TDP-43 are suggested to be important TDP-43-toxicity causing mechanisms for the ALS manifestation. So far, therapeutic options for ALS are extremely minimal and ineffective therefore, multi-faceted approaches such as treating the oxidative stress and inhibiting the TDP-43s aggregation are being actively pursued. In our recent study, an acridine imidazolium derivative compound, AIM4, has been identified to have anti-TDP-43 aggregation propensity however, its mechanism of inhibition is not deciphered. In this study, we have utilized computational methods to examine binding site(s) of AIM4 in the TDP-43 structure and have also compared its binding efficiency with several other relevant compounds. We find that AIM4 has a binding site in the C-terminal amyloidogenic core region of amino acids aa: 288-319, which coincides with one of the key residue motifs that could potentially mediate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TDP-43. Importantly, alike to the previously reported effects exerted by RNA molecules, we found that AIM4 could also inhibit the in vitro LLPS of a recombinantly purified C-terminal fragment TDP-432C bearing an A315T familial mutation. Antagonistic effects of AIM4 towards LLPS which is believed as the precursor process to the TDP-43s aggregation and the in silico prediction of a binding site of AIM4 on TDP-43 occurring in the same region, assert that AIM4 could be an important molecule for further investigations on TDP-43s anti-aggregation effects with relevance to the ALS pathogenesis.",

Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys show promise as a way to effectively characterize fine-scale patterns of community composition, but most studies to date have evaluated its effectiveness in single habitats and for conspicuous taxonomic groups in temperate ecosystems. We tested whether a single PCR survey of eDNA in seawater using a broad metazoan primer could identify differences in community composition between five adjacent habitats at 19 sites across a tropical Caribbean bay in Panama. We paired this effort with visual fish surveys to compare methods for a conspicuous taxonomic group. eDNA revealed a tremendous diversity of animals (8,586 operational taxonomic units), including many small taxa that would be undetected in traditional in situ surveys. Fish comprised only 0.07% of the taxa detected by a broad COI primer, yet included 43 species not observed in the visual survey. eDNA revealed significant differences in fish and invertebrate community composition across adjacent habitats and areas of the bay driven in part by taxa known to be habitat-specialists or tolerant to wave action. Our results demonstrate the ability of broad eDNA surveys to identify biodiversity patterns in the ocean.",

However, identification of these epitopes and the principles governing their presentation has been hindered by the imprecision of currently available methods, which cannot fully recapitulate the complexity of human pathophysiology. We present a natural antigen processing assay (NAPA), which overcomes these limitations by studying the presentation of autoantigenic CD4+ T cell epitopes by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) from patients. We applied this strategy to study the processing and presentation of topoisomerase-1 (TOP1), a prevalent autoantigen in scleroderma that is associated with lung fibrosis and high mortality. We found that a common set of 10 epitopes was presented by mo-DCs from patients with diverse HLA-DR variants, including those not previously associated with the disease. Sequence analysis revealed a shared peptide-binding motif within the HLA-DR peptide binding grooves of patients who developed anti-TOP1 autoantibodies. In addition, a subset of naturally presented TOP1 peptides were characterized by immunological promiscuity, as they could bind to diverse HLA-DR peptide binding grooves. NAPA epitopes were immunorelevant: they could stimulate autoreactive CD4+ T cells in patients, and the number of epitopes recognized correlated with lung disease severity. These findings mechanistically implicate presentation of a convergent set of TOP1 epitopes in the development of scleroderma lung disease. Precise identification of autoantigenic epitopes is key to understanding the primordial mechanisms for the loss of tolerance, studying disease-propagating autoreactive T cells, and developing antigen-specific immunotherapy.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryUse of a novel natural antigen processing assay reveals a mechanism for the presentation of shared CD4+ T cell epitopes of topoisomerase-I in immunogenetically diverse patients with scleroderma.",

We show that biomaterial FBRs mimic specialized multicellular CNS wound responses not present in peripheral tissues, which serve to isolate damaged neural tissue and restore barrier functions. Moreover, we found that the nature and intensity of CNS FBRs are determined by definable properties. For example, cationic, anionic or nonionic interfaces with CNS cells elicit quantifiably different levels of stromal cell infiltration, inflammation, neural damage and amyloid production. The nature and intensity of FBRs significantly influenced hydrogel resorption and molecular delivery functions.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEStressful life events are more likely to trigger depression among individuals exposed to childhood adversity. However, the mechanisms underlying this stress sensitization remain largely unknown. Any such mechanism must be altered by childhood adversity and interact with recent stressful life events, magnifying their association with depression. This study investigated whether reduced hippocampal and amygdala volumes are mechanisms of stress sensitization following childhood violence exposure.\\n\\nMETHODSA sample of 149 youth (aged 8-17 years), with (N=76) and without (N=73) exposure to physical abuse, sexual abuse, or domestic violence participated. Participants completed a structural MRI scan and were assessed for symptoms of depression. Approximately two years later, stressful life events were assessed along with depression symptoms in 120 participants (57 violence-exposed).\\n\\nRESULTSChildhood violence exposure was associated with smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes. Stressful life events occurring during the follow-up period predicted worsening depression over time, and this association was magnified among those with smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes. Significant moderated mediation models revealed indirect effects of violence exposure on increasing depression over time through hippocampal and amygdala volumes, particularly among youths who experienced more stressful life events.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThese results provide novel evidence for reduced hippocampal and amygdala volumes as mechanisms of stress sensitization to depression following exposure to violence. These findings suggest that hippocampal and amygdala-mediated emotional and cognitive processes may contribute to vulnerability to stressful life events following childhood violence exposure.",

    "abstract": "Second messenger signaling networks allow cells to sense and adapt to changing environmental conditions. In bacteria, the nearly ubiquitous second messenger molecule cyclic di-GMP coordinates diverse processes such as motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. In bacterial pathogens, these signaling networks allow the bacteria to survive changing environment conditions that are experienced during infection of a mammalian host. While studies have examined the effects of cyclic di-GMP levels on virulence in these pathogens, it has previously not been possible to visualize cyclic di-GMP levels in real time during the stages of host infection. Towards this goal, we generate the first ratiometric, chemiluminescent biosensor scaffold that selectively responds to c-di-GMP. By engineering the biosensor scaffold, a suite of Venus-YcgR-NLuc (VYN) biosensors is generated that provide extremely high sensitivity (KD < 300 pM) and large BRET signal changes (up to 109%). As a proof-of-concept that VYN biosensors can image cyclic di-GMP during host infection, we show that the VYN biosensors function in the context of a tissue phantom model, with only [~]103-104 biosensor-expressing cells required for the measurement. Furthermore, the stable BRET signal suggests that the sensors could be used for long-term imaging of cyclic di-GMP dynamics during host infection. The VYN sensors developed here can serve as robust in vitro diagnostic tools for high throughput screening, as well as genetically encodable tools for monitoring the dynamics of c-di-GMP in live cells, and lay the groundwork for live cell imaging of c-di-GMP dynamics in bacteria during host infection, and other complex environments.",

    "abstract": "The fatigue due to repetitive and physically challenging jobs may result in workers poor performance and Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorder (WMSD). Thus, it is imperative to frequently monitor fatigue and take necessary recovery actions. Our purpose was to develop a methodology to objectively classify subjects fatigue level in the workplace utilizing the motion sensors embedded in the smartphones. An experiment consisting of twenty-four participants (12 M, 12 F) with a smartphone attached to their right shank was conducted using a fatiguing exercise (squatting), targeted mainly the lower extremity musculature. After each set of an exercise (2-min squatting), participants were asked about their ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), then a reference gait data were collected during a straight walk of 20-32 steps. This process was continued until they reported strong fatigue ([&ge;]17). Using the RPE to label the gait data, we have developed machine learning algorithms (i.e., binary and multi-class SVM models) to classify the individuals gait into two (no-vs. strong-fatigue) and four levels (no-, low-, medium-, and strong-fatigue). The models reached the accuracies of 91% and 61% for two and four-level classification, respectively. The outcomes of this study may facilitate the implementation of a proactive approach in continuous monitoring of operators fatigue level, which may subsequently increase the workers performance and reduce the risk of WMSDs.",

Here, we test the long-term relative profitability and environmental sustainability of continuous no-till agriculture practices on crop yield, soil moisture, and N2O fluxes. Using a moving window approach, we investigate the development and stability of several attributes of continuous no-till as compared to conventional till agriculture over a 29-year period at a site in the upper Midwest, U.S. We find that over a decade is needed to detect the consistent benefits of no-till on important attributes at this site. Both crop yield and soil moisture required periods 15 years or longer to generate patterns consistent with 29-year trends. Only marginally significant trends for N2O fluxes appeared in this period. Importantly, significant but misleading short-term trends appeared in more than 20% of the periods examined. Relative profitability analysis suggests that 10 years after initial implementation, 86% of periods recuperated the initial expense of no-till implementation, with the probability of higher relative profit increasing with longevity. Results underscore the essential importance of decade and longer studies for revealing the long-term dynamics and emergent outcomes of agricultural practices for different sustainability attributes and are consistent with recommendations to support the long-term adoption of no-till management.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=187 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/788240v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (42K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e7529eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e11268org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17f8995org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2196fe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIWe test long-term effects of no-till on yield, soil moisture, and N2O fluxes\\nC_LIO_LIWe examine 29 years of data with a moving window and relative profitability method\\nC_LIO_LIIt takes at least a decade to detect consistent benefits of no-till\\nC_LIO_LIShorter studies can produce significant but misleading findings\\nC_LIO_LILong studies are essential to reveal the dynamics of agricultural management\\nC_LI",

Strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae grow well epiphytically and have been shown to grow within and kill hemipteran insects like the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Aphids are hypothesized to be an alternative host for these epiphytic bacteria but it is unclear if aphids provide fitness benefits to these bacterial pathogens. To determine if epiphytic bacteria could be adapted for infecting aphids, we characterized 21 strains of P. syringae for epiphytic ability and virulence to pea aphids and found that the two traits were positively correlated. For a subset of strains, we tested if the bacteria derived a fitness benefit from the presence of aphids. Some strains benefited significantly, with up to 18.9% higher population densities when aphids were present, and lower starting population density was predictive of higher benefit from aphid presence. However, further investigation found that honeydew, the sugary waste product of aphids, and not growth in aphids, increased P. syringae growth on leaves. This suggests that aphids may be important microbiome engineers in the phyllosphere, but evolutionarily dead-ends for epiphytic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome is known to affect host development, metabolism and immunity, however, its impact on behaviors is only beginning to be understood. Here, we investigate how bacteria modulate complex behaviors in the nematode model organism Pristionchus pacificus. P. pacificus is a predator feeding on the larvae of other nematodes including Caenorhabditis elegans. Growing P. pacificus on different bacteria and testing their ability to kill C. elegans reveals drastic differences in killing efficiencies with a Novosphingobium species showing the strongest enhancement. Strikingly, increased killing was not accompanied by an increase in feeding, a phenomenon known as surplus-killing whereby predators kill more prey than necessary for sustenance. RNA-seq revealed widespread metabolic rewiring upon exposure to Novosphingobium, which facilitated the screening for bacterial mutants leading to an altered transcriptional response. This identified bacterial derived vitamin B12 as a major micronutrient enhancing predatory behaviors. Vitamin B12 is an essential cofactor for detoxification and metabolite biosynthesis and has previously been shown to accelerate development in C. elegans. In P. pacificus vitamin B12 supplementation amplified, whereas mutants in vitamin B12-dependent pathways reduced surplus-killing. This demonstrates that bacterial vitamin B12 affects complex behaviors and thus establishes a connection between microbial diet and the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Light is known to trigger regulatory responses in diverse organisms including slime molds, animals, plants, and phototrophic bacteria. However, light-dependent processes in non-phototrophic bacteria, and those of pathogens in particular, have received comparatively little research attention. In this study, we examined the impact of light on multicellular development in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of biofilm-based bacterial infections, using a colony morphology assay. In this assay, P. aeruginosa strain PA14 grown in the dark forms vertical structures (i.e., \\\"wrinkles\\\") on the third day of incubation. We found that growth in blue light inhibited wrinkle formation until the fifth day and that this required the phenazine pyocyanin, a redox-active metabolite produced by PA14. Light-dependent inhibition of wrinkling was also correlated with low levels of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), consistent with the role of this signal in stimulating biofilm matrix production. Though phenazine-null biofilms also showed lower levels of c-di-GMP and subtle effects on wrinkling when grown in the light, their overall levels of c-di-GMP were higher than those of the wild type. This indicates that phenazines and light simultaneously promote c-di-GMP degradation such that c-di-GMP is pushed to a minimum level, yielding a pronounced macroscopic phenotype. A screen of enzymes with the potential to catalyze c-di-GMP synthesis or degradation identified four proteins that contribute to light-dependent inhibition of biofilm wrinkling. Together, these results provide a foundation for understanding the significance of light-dependent regulation in P. aeruginosa.\\n\\nImportanceThe response to light in non-phototrophic bacteria (i.e., chemotrophs) is relatively understudied in comparison to light-mediated behavior in eukaryotes and phototrophic bacteria. Though they do not depend on light for growth, chemotrophic bacteria could benefit from sensing this cue when it correlates with other parameters that are important for metabolism. In this paper, we describe light-dependent effects on a cellular signal that controls the development of multicellular assemblages, called biofilms, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that light at intensities that are not harmful to human cells inhibited biofilm maturation. P. aeruginosa is a leading cause of chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis and of hospital-acquired infections. As P. aeruginosas recalcitrance to treatment is attributed in part to its facile formation of biofilms, this study provides insight into a mechanism that could be inhibited via new therapeutic tools, such as photodynamic therapy.",

While approaches exist to overcome the multiple testing problem, these methods focus on theoretical statistical clarification rather than incorporating experimentally-derived measures to ensure appropriately tailored analysis parameters. Here, we introduce a method for estimating inter-replicate variability in reference samples for a quantitative proteomics experiment using permutation analysis. This can function as a modulator to multiple testing corrections such as the Benjamini-Hochberg ordered Q value test. We refer to this as a  same-same analysis, since this method incorporates the use of six biological replicates of the reference sample and determines, through non-redundant triplet pairwise comparisons, the level of quantitative noise inherent within the system. The method can be used to produce an experiment-specific Q value cut-off that achieves a specified false discovery rate at the quantitation level, such as 1%. The same-same method is applicable to any experimental set that incorporates six replicates of a reference sample. To facilitate access to this approach, we have developed a same-same analysis R module that is freely available and ready to use via the internet.",

Pioneer transcription factors have the unique property of binding closed chromatin and facilitating the establishment of these accessible regions. Nonetheless, much of how pioneer transcription factors coordinate changes in chromatin accessibility during development remains unknown. To determine whether pioneer-factor function is intrinsic to the protein or whether pioneering activity is developmentally modulated, we studied the highly conserved, essential transcription factor, Grainy head (Grh). Grh is expressed throughout Drosophila development and functions as a pioneer factor in the larvae. We demonstrated that Grh remains bound to condensed mitotic chromosomes, a property shared with other pioneer factors. By assaying chromatin accessibility in embryos lacking either maternal or zygotic Grh at three stages of development, we discovered that Grh is not required for chromatin accessibility in early embryogenesis, in contrast to its essential functions later in development. Our data reveal that the pioneering activity of Grh is temporally regulated and is likely influenced by additional factors expressed at a given developmental stage.",

While we know that carbon sequestration in terrestrial plants is intimately linked to the microorganisms living in their soils3-6, the interactions of seagrasses with their rhizospheres are poorly understood. We show that three seagrass species from two oceans excrete simple sugars, mainly sucrose, into their rhizosphere that accumulate to over 200 {micro}M. Such high concentrations are at least 80 times higher than previously observed in the ocean, and surprising, as sugars are quickly consumed by microorganisms. In situ analyses and incubation experiments indicated that phenolic compounds from the seagrass inhibited microbial consumption of sucrose. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses of the microbial communities in the seagrass rhizosphere revealed that many members had the genes for degrading sucrose, but these were only expressed by a few specialists that also expressed genes for degrading phenolics. Our results explain why sucrose accumulates under seagrass meadows, where it comprises as much as 40% of the dissolved organic carbon. Destruction of extant seagrass canopies would allow sediment microorganisms to consume the tremendous deposits of sucrose buried underneath their meadows, thereby releasing large amounts of CO2 into the oceans and atmosphere.",

To address this issue, we compared three hypotheses about the algorithmic implementation of imitation in human reinforcement learning. A first hypothesis, decision biasing, postulates that imitation consists in transiently biasing the learners action selection without affecting her value function. According to the second hypothesis, model-based imitation, the learner infers the demonstrators value function through inverse reinforcement learning and uses it for action selection. Finally, according to the third hypothesis, value shaping, demonstrators actions directly affect the learners value function. We tested these three psychologically plausible hypotheses in two separate experiments (N = 24 and N = 44) featuring a new variant of a social reinforcement learning task, where we manipulated the quantity and the quality of the demonstrators choices. We show through model comparison that value shaping is favored, which provides a new perspective on how imitation is integrated into human reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Fibrin is an elastomeric protein forming highly extensible fiber networks that provide the scaffold of blood clots. Here we reveal the molecular mechanisms that explain the large extensibility of fibrin networks by performing in situ small angle X-ray scattering measurements while applying a shear deformation. We simultaneously measure shear-induced alignment of the fibers and changes in their axially ordered molecular packing structure. We show that fibrin networks exhibit distinct structural responses that set in consecutively as the shear strain is increased. They exhibit an entropic response at small strains (<5%), followed by progressive fiber alignment (>25% strain) and finally changes in the fiber packing structure at high strain (>100%). Stretching reduces the fiber packing order and slightly increases the axial periodicity, indicative of molecular unfolding. However, the axial periodicity changes only by 0.7%, much less than the 80% length increase of the fibers, indicating that fiber elongation mainly stems from uncoiling of the natively disordered C-peptide linkers that laterally bond the molecules. Upon removal of the load, the network structure returns to the original isotropic state, but the fiber structure becomes more ordered and adopts a smaller packing periodicity compared to the original state. We conclude that the hierarchical packing structure of fibrin fibers, with built-in disorder, makes the fibers extensible and allows for mechanical annealing. Our results provide a basis for interpreting the molecular basis of haemostatic and thrombotic disorders associated with clotting and provide inspiration to design resilient bio-mimicking materials.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe process of alternative splicing provides a unique mechanism by which eukaryotes are able to produce numerous protein products from the same gene. Heightened variability in the proteome has been thought to potentiate increased behavioral complexity and response flexibility to environmental stimuli, thus contributing to more refined traits on which natural and sexual selection can act. While it has been long known that various forms of environmental stress can negatively affect sexual behavior and reproduction, we know little of how stress can affect the alternative splicing associated with these events, and less still about how splicing may differ between sexes. Using the model of the rock dove (Columba livia), our team previously uncovered sexual dimorphism in the basal and stress-responsive gene transcription of a biological system necessary for facilitating sexual behavior and reproduction, the hypothlamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In this study, we delve further into understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of how changes in the environment can affect reproduction by testing the alternative splicing response of the HPG axis to an external stressor in both sexes.\\n\\nResultsThis study reveals dramatic baseline differences in HPG alternative splicing between males and females. However, post submitting subjects to a restraint stress paradigm, we found a significant reduction in these differences between the sexes. In both stress and control treatments, we identified a higher incidence of splicing activity in the pituitary in both sexes as compared to other tissues. Of these splicing events, the core exon event is the most abundant form of splicing and more frequently occurs in the coding regions of the gene. Overall, we observed less splicing activity in the 3UTR end of transcripts than the 5UTR or coding regions.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide vital new insight into sex-specific aspects of the stress response on the HPG axis at an unprecedented proximate level. Males and females uniquely respond to stress, yet exhibit splicing patterns suggesting a convergent, optimal splicing landscape for stress response. This information has the potential to inform evolutionary theory as well as the development of highly-specific drug targets for stress-induced reproductive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Large scale patterns of spontaneous whole brain activity seen in resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI), are in part believed to arise from neural populations interacting through the structural fiber network [18]. Generative models that simulate this network activity, called Brain Network Models (BNM), are able to reproduce global averaged properties of empirical rsfMRI activity such as functional connectivity (FC) [7, 27]. However, they perform poorly in reproducing unique trajectories and state transitions that are observed over the span of minutes in whole brain data [20]. At very short timescales between measurements, it is not known how much of the variance these BNM can explain because they are not currently synchronized with the measured rsfMRI. We demonstrate that by solving for the initial conditions of BNM from an observed data point using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and integrating it to predict the next time step, the trained network can explain large amounts of variance for the 5 subsequent time points of unseen future trajectory. The RNN and BNM combined system essentially models the network component of rsfMRI, and where future activity is solely based on previous neural activity propagated through the structural network. Longer instantiations of this generative model simulated over the span of minutes can reproduce average FC and the 1/f power spectrum from 0.01 to 0.3 Hz seen in fMRI. Simulated data also contain interesting resting state dynamics, such as unique repeating trajectories, called QPPs [22] that are highly correlated to the empirical trajectory which spans over 20 seconds. Moreover, it exhibits complex states and transitions as seen using k-Means analysis on windowed FC matrices [1]. This suggests that by combining BNMs with RNN to accurately predict future resting state activity at short timescales, it is learning the manifold of the network dynamics, allowing it to simulate complex resting state trajectories at longer time scales. We believe that our technique will be useful in understanding the large-scale functional organization of the brain and how different BNMs recapitulate different aspects of the system dynamics.",

    "abstract": "By 2100, global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the capacity of marine primary producers for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) synthesis. Primary consumers such as harpacticoid copepods (Crustacea) might mitigate the resulting adverse effects on the food web by increased LC-PUFA bioconversion. Here, we present a high-quality de novo transcriptome assembly of the copepod Platychelipus littoralis, exposed to changes in both temperature (+3{degrees}C) and dietary LC-PUFA availability. Using this transcriptome, we detected multiple transcripts putatively encoding for LC-PUFA-bioconverting front-end fatty acid desaturases and elongases, and performed phylogenetic analyses to identify their relationship with sequences of other (crustacean) taxa. While temperature affected the absolute fatty acid concentrations in copepods, LC-PUFA levels remained unaltered even when copepods were fed a LC-PUFA-deficient diet. While this suggests plasticity of LC-PUFA bioconversion within P. littoralis, none of the putative front-end desaturase or elongase transcripts were differentially expressed under the applied treatments. Nevertheless, the transcriptome presented here provides a sound basis for future ecophysiological research on harpacticoid copepods.",

    "abstract": "Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) mediates the first committed step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis and plays important roles in cellular proliferation and the immune response. The enzyme is heavily regulated to maintain balance between guanine and adenine nucleotide pools. IMPDH reversibly polymerizes in cells and tissues in response to changes in metabolic demand, providing an additional layer of regulatory control associated with increased flux through the guanine synthesis pathway. Here, we report a series of human IMPDH2 cryo-EM structures in active and inactive conformations, and show that the filament resists inhibition by guanine nucleotides. The structures define the mechanism of filament assembly, and reveal how assembly interactions tune the response to guanine inhibition. Filament-dependent allosteric regulation of IMPDH2 makes the enzyme less sensitive to feedback inhibition, explaining why assembly occurs under physiological conditions, like stem cell proliferation and T-cell activation, that require expansion of guanine nucleotide pools.",

    "abstract": "Exploration of novel environments ensures survival and evolutionary fitness. This behavior is expressed through exploratory bouts and arrests, which change dynamically based on experience. Neural circuits mediating exploratory behavior should therefore integrate experience and use it to select the proper behavioral output. Using a spatial exploration assay, we uncovered an experience-dependent increase of momentary arrests in visited locations where animals previously arrested. Quantitative analyses of neuronal calcium activity in freely-exploring mice revealed that a large neuronal ensemble in basolateral amygdala is active during self-paced behavioral arrests. This ensemble was recruited in an experience-dependent manner, and closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of these neurons revealed that they are sufficient and necessary to drive experience-dependent arrests. Additionally, we found that neurons in the basolateral amygdala projecting to central amygdala mediate these momentary arrests. These findings uncover an amygdala circuit that mediates momentary exploratory arrests in familiar places, without changing place preference or anxiety/fear-like behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Astronauts on interplanetary space missions - such as to Mars - will be exposed to space radiation, a spectrum of highly-charged, fast-moving particles that includes 56Fe and 28Si. Earth-based preclinical studies with mature, \\\"astronaut-aged\\\" rodents show space radiation decreases performance in low- and some high-level cognitive tasks. Given the prevalence of touchscreens in astronaut training and in-mission assessment, and the ability of rodent touchscreen tasks to assess the functional integrity of brain circuits and multiple cognitive domains in a non-aversive way, it is surprising the effect of space radiation on rodent touchscreen performance is unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to whole-body space radiation and assessed on a touchscreen battery starting 1-month later. Relative to Sham, 56Fe irradiation did not overtly change performance on tasks of visual discrimination, reversal learning, rule-based, or object-spatial paired associates learning, suggesting preserved functional integrity of supporting brain circuits. Surprisingly, 56Fe irradiation led to better performance on a dentate gyrus-reliant task of pattern separation ability. Irradiated mice discriminated similar visual cues in [~]40% fewer days and [~]40% more accurately than control mice. Improved pattern separation was not touchscreen-, radiation-particle, or neurogenesis-dependent, as both 56Fe and 28Si irradiation led to faster context discrimination (e.g. Sham Block 5 vs. 56Fe Block 2) in a non-touchscreen task and 56Fe led to fewer new dentate gyrus neurons relative to Sham. These data urge revisitation of the broadly-held view that space radiation is detrimental to cognition.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAstronauts on an interplanetary mission - such as to Mars - will be unavoidably exposed to galactic cosmic radiation, a spectrum of highly-charged, fast-moving particles. Rodent studies suggest space radiation is detrimental to cognition. However, here we show this is not universally true. Mature mice that received whole body exposure to Mars-relevant space radiation perform similarly to control mice on high-level cognitive tasks, reflecting the functional integrity of key neural circuits. Even more surprisingly, irradiated mice perform better than controls in both appetitive and aversive tests of pattern separation, a mission-critical task reliant on dentate gyrus integrity. Notably, improved pattern separation was not touchscreen-, radiation-particle-, or neurogenesis-dependent. Our work urges revisitation of the generally-accepted conclusion that space radiation is detrimental to cognition.",

    "abstract": "The learning of motor skills unfolds over multiple timescales, with rapid initial gains in performance followed by a longer period in which the behavior becomes more refined, habitual, and automatized. While recent lesion and inactivation experiments have provided hints about how various brain areas might contribute to such learning, their precise roles and the neural mechanisms underlying them are not well understood. In this work, we propose neural- and circuit-level mechanisms by which motor cortex, thalamus, and striatum support such learning. In this model, the combination of fast cortical learning and slow subcortical learning gives rise to a covert learning process through which control of behavior is gradually transferred from cortical to subcortical circuits, while protecting learned behaviors that are practiced repeatedly against overwriting by future learning. Together, these results point to a new computational role for thalamus in motor learning, and, more broadly, provide a framework for understanding the neural basis of habit formation and the automatization of behavior through practice.",

    "abstract": "1.At ultra-high field, fMRI voxels can span the sub-millimeter range, allowing the recording of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses at the level of fundamental units of neural computation, such as cortical columns and layers. This sub-millimeter resolution, however, is only nominal in nature as a number of factors limit the spatial acuity of functional voxels. Multivoxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) may provide a means to detect information at finer spatial scales that may otherwise not be visible at the single voxel level due to limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Here, we evaluate the spatial scale of stimuli specific BOLD responses in multivoxel patterns exploited by linear Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Naive Bayesian classifiers across cortical depths in V1. To this end, we artificially misaligned the testing relative to the training portion of the data in increasing spatial steps, then investigated the breakdown of the classifiers performances. A one voxel shift led to a significant decrease in decoding accuracy (p<.05) across all cortical depths, indicating that stimulus specific responses in a multivoxel pattern of BOLD activity exploited by multivariate decoders can be as precise as the nominal resolution of single voxels (here .8 mm isotropic). Our results further indicate that large draining vessels, prominently residing in proximity of the pial surface, do not, in this case, hinder the ability of MVPA to exploit fine scale patterns of BOLD signals. We argue that tailored analytical approaches can help overcoming limitations in high-resolution fMRI and permit studying the mesoscale organization of the human brain with higher sensitivities.",

It is well established that cocaine epigenetically regulates transcription, yet mechanism(s) by which cocaine-induced epigenetic modifications regulate alternative splicing is largely unexplored. Our group and others have previously identified the histone modification, H3K36me3, as a putative splicing regulator. However, it has not yet been possible to establish the direct causal relevance of this modification to alternative splicing in brain or any other context. We found that mouse cocaine self-administration caused widespread alternative splicing, concomitant with enrichment of H3K36me3 at splice junctions. Differentially spliced genes were enriched in the motif for splice factor, Srsf11, which was both differentially spliced and enriched in H3K36me3. Epigenetic editing led us to conclude that H3K36me3 functions directly in alternative splicing of Srsf11, and that Set2 mediated H3K36me3 bidirectionally regulates cocaine intake.",

In mice, the decision to release urine is modulated by external and internal factors such as environmental stimuli and social history and is transmitted to the spinal cord via the pontine micturition center (PMC). The neural pathways by which social experience and sensory stimuli interact to control PMC activity and regulate micturition are unclear. Here we establish a behavioral paradigm in which mice, depending on their strain, social experience, and immediate sensory context, display either high or low territory-covering micturition (TCM). We demonstrate that social context is represented by coordinated global activity changes in the urination network upstream of the PMC, whereas sensory context is represented by the activation of discrete nodes in the network. Furthermore, we show that the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), which is directly upstream of PMC, is a key node that can switch micturition behavior between high and low TCM modes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a central regulator of gene expression, pro-survival signaling, and inflammation. However, the importance of MAPK pathway signaling in regulating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimers Disease (AD) remains unclear. Here we examined the role of MAPK signaling in microglia using pre-clinical in-vitro and in-vivo models of AD pathology integrated with quantitative proteomics studies of post-mortem human brains.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed multiplexed immunoassay analyses of MAPK phosphoproteins, particularly ERK1/2, in acutely-isolated microglia and brain tissue from wild-type and 5xFAD mice. Neuropathological studies of mouse and human brain tissues were performed to quantify total and phosphorylated ERK protein in AD. The importance of ERK signaling in unstimulated and interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma})-stimulated primary microglia cultures was investigated using NanoString transcriptomic profiling, coupled with functional assays of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) and neuronal phagocytosis. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) likely responsible for ERK signaling in homeostatic microglia and disease-associated-microglia (DAM) states and ERK-regulated human AD risk genes were identified using gene expression data. Total and phosphorylated MAPKs in human post-mortem brain tissues were measured in quantitative proteomic datasets.\\n\\nResultsPhosphorylated ERK was the most strongly up-regulated signaling protein within the MAPK pathway in microglia acutely isolated from 5xFAD brains. Neuroinflammatory transcriptomic and phagocytic profiling of mouse microglia confirmed that ERK is a critical regulator of IFN{gamma}-mediated pro-inflammatory activation of microglia, although it was also important for constitutive microglial functions. Phospho-ERK was an upstream regulator of disease-associated microglia (DAM) gene expression (Trem2, Tyrobp), as well as of several human AD risk genes (Bin1, Cd33, Trem2, Cnn2). Among RTKs that signal via ERK, CSF1R and MERTK were primarily expressed by homeostatic microglia while AXL and FLT1 were likely regulators of ERK signaling in DAM. Within DAM, FLT4 and IGF1R were specifically expressed by pro- and anti-inflammatory DAM sub-profiles respectively. In quantitative proteomic analyses of post-mortem human brains from non-disease, asymptomatic and cognitively-impaired AD cases, ERK1 and ERK2 were the only MAPK pathway signaling proteins with increased protein expression and positive associations with neuropathological grade. Moreover, in a phospho-proteomic study of post-mortem human brains from controls, asymptomatic and symptomatic AD cases, we found evidence for a progressive increased flux through the ERK signaling pathway.\\n\\nConclusionsOur integrated analyses using pre-clinical models and human proteomic data strongly suggest that ERK phosphorylation in microglia is a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory immune response in AD pathogenesis and that modulation of ERK via upstream RTKs may reveal novel avenues for immunomodulation.",

Analysis of RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 259 schizophrenia cases and 279 controls from the CommonMind Consortium showed that HERVs are actively expressed in the brain (n = 3,979), regulated in cis by common genetic variants (n = 1,759), and differentially expressed in patients (n = 81). Convergent analyses implicate LTR25_6q21 and ERVLE_8q24.3h as HERVs of etiological relevance to schizophrenia, which are co-regulated with genes involved in neuronal and mitochondrial function, respectively. Our findings provide a strong rationale for exploring the retrogenome and the expression of these locus-specific HERVs as novel risk factors for schizophrenia and potential diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets.",

    "abstract": "Familiarity-based discrimination between studied target items and similar foils in yes/no recognition memory tests is relatively poor. According to the complementary learning systems (CLS) framework this is due do a relatively small difference in familiarity strength between these two item classes. The model, however, also predicts that when targets and corresponding similar foils are presented next to each other in a forced-choice corresponding (FCC) test format, familiarity values for targets and foils can be directly compared because in each trial, targets are reliably more familiar than their corresponding foils. In contrast, when forced-choice displays contain non-corresponding foils (FCNC) which are similar to other studied items (but not the target), familiarity should not be diagnostic because familiarity values are not directly comparable (as in yes/no-tasks). We compared ERP old/new effects (ERPs of targets vs. foils) when participants were tested with FCC vs. FCNC displays after having intentionally encoded pictures of objects. As predicted, the mid-frontal old/new effect which is associated with familiarity was significantly larger in FCC compared to FCNC displays. Moreover, the target-foil amplitude difference predicted the accuracy of the recognition judgment in a given trial. This is one of the very few studies which support the assumption of the CLS framework that the test format can influence the diagnosticity of familiarity. Moreover, it implies that the mid-frontal old/new effect does not reflect the mean difference in the familiarity signal itself between studied and non-studied items but reflects the task-adequate assessment of the familiarity signal.",

To validate the model, we fit it to data from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (2014-2016). We demonstrate how a branching process can be fit to both time series of confirmed cases and chains of infection derived from contact tracing. Our estimates of the parameters suggest transmission of Ebola virus was sub-exponential during this epidemic. Both the time series data and the chains of infections lead to consistent parameter estimates. Differences in the data sets meant consistent estimates were not a foregone conclusion. Finally, we use a simulation study to investigate the properties of our methodology. In particular, we examine the extent to which the estimates obtained from time series data and those obtained from chains of infection data agree.\\n\\nOur method, based on a simple branching process, is well suited to real-time analysis of data collected during contact tracing. Identifying the characteristic early growth dynamics (exponential or sub-exponential), including an estimate of uncertainty, during the first phase of an epidemic should prove a useful tool for preliminary outbreak investigations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEpidemic forecasts have the potential to support public health decision making in outbreak scenarios for diseases such as Ebola and influenza. In particular, reliable predictions of future incidence data may guide surveillance and intervention responses. Existing methods for producing forecasts, based upon mechanistic transmission models, often make an implicit assumption that growth is exponential, at least while susceptible depletion remains negligible. However, empirical studies suggest that many infectious disease outbreaks display sub-exponential growth early in the epidemic. Here we introduce a mechanistic model of early epidemic growth that allows for sub-exponential growth in incidence. We demonstrate how the model can be applied to the types of data that are typically available in (near) real-time, including time series data on incidence as well as individual-level case series and chains of transmission data. We apply our methods to publically available data from the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic and demonstrate that early epidemic growth was sub-exponential. We also investigate the statistical properties of our model through a simulation re-estimation study to identify it performance characteristics and avenues for further methodological research.",

    "abstract": "Invasion of, development within, and exit from hepatocytes by Plasmodium is essential for the parasite to establish the malaria-causing erythrocytic cycle. Identification of signaling pathways that operate during the pre-erythrocytic cycle provides insights into a critical stage of infection and potential targets for chemoprevention of disease. Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPK) represent a kinase family that is present in Plasmodium but absent in mammals. We demonstrate that P. berghei homologs of CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 play overlapping but distinct roles in sporozoite invasion and parasite egress from hepatocytes. All three kinases are expressed in sporozoites. All three are required for optimal motility of sporozoites and consequently their invasion of hepatocytes. Increased cGMP compensates for the functional loss of CDPK1 and CDPK5 during sporozoite invasion but cannot overcome CDPK4s loss. CDPK1 and CDPK5 expression is downregulated after sporozoite invasion. CDPK5 reappears in a subset of late stage liver stages and is present in all merosomes. Chemical inhibition of CDPK4 and depletion of CDPK5 in liver stages suggests that these kinases play a role in the formation and/or release of merosomes from mature liver stages. Furthermore, depletion of CDPK5 in merosomes significantly delays a merosome-initiated erythrocytic cycle without affecting the infectivity of hepatic merozoites. These data suggest that CDPK5 is required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes. Our work provides the first evidence that sporozoite invasion requires CDPK1 and CDPK5 and that the release of hepatic merozoites is a regulated process.\\n\\nSignificanceThe malaria-parasite Plasmodium begins its mammalian cycle by infecting hepatocytes in the liver. A single parasite differentiates into tens of thousands of hepatic merozoites which exit the host cell in vesicles called merosomes. Hepatic merozoites initiate the first round of erythrocytic infection that leads to disease symptoms. We show that optimal invasion of liver cells by Plasmodium requires the action of three closely-related parasite kinases, CDPK1, 4 and 5. Loss of any of the three enzymes in the parasite significantly reduces infection of liver cells. CDPK5 is also required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes and therefore for initiating the erythrocytic cycle. A better understanding of how these kinases function could lead to drugs that prevent malaria.",

    "abstract": "Decision making relies on adequately evaluating the consequences of actions on the basis of past experience and the current physiological state. A key role in this process is played by the basal ganglia, where neural activity and plasticity are modulated by dopaminergic input from the midbrain. Internal physiological factors, such as hunger, scale signals encoded by dopaminergic neurons and thus they alter the motivation for taking actions and learning. However, to our knowledge, no formal mathematical formulation exists for how a physiological state affects learning and action selection in the basal ganglia. We developed a framework for modelling the effect of motivation on choice and learning. The framework defines the motivation to obtain a particular resource as the difference between the desired and the current level of this resource, and proposes how the utility of reinforcements depends on the motivation. To account for dopaminergic activity previously recorded at different physiological states, the paper argues that the prediction error encoded in the dopaminergic activity needs to be redefined as the difference between utility and expected utility, which depends on both the objective reinforcement and the motivation. We also demonstrate a possible mechanism by which the evaluation and learning of utility of actions can be implemented in the basal ganglia network. The presented theory brings together models of learning in the basal ganglia with the incentive salience theory in a single simple framework, and it provides a mechanistic insight into how decision processes and learning in the basal ganglia are modulated by the motivation. Moreover, this theory is also consistent with data on neural underpinnings of overeating and obesity, and makes further experimental predictions.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBehaviour is made of decisions that are based on the evaluation of costs and benefits of potential actions in a given situation. Actions are usually generated in response to reinforcement cues which are potent triggers of desires that can range from normal appetites to compulsive addictions. However, learned cues are not constant in their motivating power. Food cues are more potent when you are hungry than when you have just finished a meal. These changes in cue-triggered desire produced by a change in biological state present a challenge to many current computational models of motivation and learning. Here, we demonstrate concrete examples of how motivation can instantly modulate reinforcement values and actions; we propose an overarching framework of learning and action selection based on maintaining the physiological balance to better capture the dynamic interaction between learning and physiology that controls the incentive salience mechanism of motivation for reinforcements. These models provide a unified account of state-dependent learning of the incentive value of actions and selecting actions according to the learned positive and negative consequences of those actions and with respect to the physiological state. We propose a biological implementation of how these processes are controlled by an area in the brain called the basal ganglia, which is associated with error-driven learning.",

As with any ecological survey, false negatives can arise during sampling and, if unaccounted for, lead to biased results and potentially misdiagnosed environmental assessments. We developed a multi-scale, multi-species occupancy model for the analysis of community biodiversity data resulting from eDNA metabarcoding; this model accounts for imperfect detection and additional sources of environmental and experimental variation. We present methods for model assessment and model comparison and demonstrate how these tools improve the inferential power of eDNA metabarcoding data using a case study in a coastal, marine environment.

    "abstract": "High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a damage-associated molecular pattern with key proinflammatory functions following tissue injury. Moreover, HMGB1 neutralization was shown to alleviate LPS-induced shock, suggesting a role for the protein as a master therapeutic target for inflammatory and infectious diseases. Here, we report that HMGB1 neutralization impedes immune responses to Listeria monocytogenes, a wide-spread bacterium with pathogenic relevance for humans and rodents. Using genetic deletion strategies and neutralizing antibodies, we demonstrate that hepatocyte HMGB1, a major driver of post-necrotic inflammation in the liver, is dispensable for pathogen defense during moderately severe infection with listeria. In contrast, antibody-mediated HMGB1 neutralization and HMGB1 deficiency in myeloid cells effectuate rapid and uncontrolled bacterial dissemination in mice despite preserved basic leukocyte functionality and autophagy induction. During overwhelming infection, hepatocyte injury may contribute to increased HMGB1 serum levels and excessive inflammation in the liver, supporting context-dependent roles for HMGB1 from different cellular compartments during infection. We provide mechanistic evidence that HMGB1 from circulating immune cells contributes to the timely induction of hepatic immune regulatory gene networks, early inflammatory monocyte recruitment to the liver and promotion of neutrophil survival, which are mandatory for pathogen control. In summary, our data establish HMGB1 as a critical co-factor in the immunological clearance of listeria, and argue against HMGB1 neutralization as a universal therapeutic strategy for sepsis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHigh-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an abundantly expressed nucleoprotein with signaling properties following secretion or release into the extracellular space. Given its central immune-regulatory roles during tissue injury and LPS-induced septic shock, interventions aimed at HMGB1 signaling have been advocated as therapeutic options for various disease conditions. Here, we show that antibody-mediated HMGB1 neutralization interferes with immunological defense against Listeria monocytogenes, a gram-positive bacterium with high pathogenic relevance for rodents and humans, effectuating uncontrolled bacterial growth and inflammation. Using conditional knockout animals, we demonstrate that while leukocyte functionality is preserved in HMGB1-deficient myeloid cells, HMGB1 released in response to Listeria triggers hepatic inflammatory monocyte recruitment and activation of transcriptional immune networks required for the early control of bacterial dissemination. Hepatocyte HMGB1, a key driver of post-necrotic inflammation in the liver, is dispensable for the immune response during moderately severe infection, but likely contributes to excessive hepatitis when infection is uncontrolled and cellular injury is high. We demonstrate a critical and non-redundant role for HMGB1 in the immune-mediated clearance of listeriosis and argue against HMGB1 neutralization as a universal therapeutic option in the context of infection.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli EC121 is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain isolated from bloodstream infection of an inpatient with persistent gastroenteritis and Zone T lymphoma, that died due to septic shock. Despite causing an extraintestinal infection, it harbors few known virulence factors and was assigned into phylogenetic group B1. To evaluate if the EC121 was pathogenic or opportunistic, its genome was sequenced, and an in vitro characterization of some pathogenicity-associated properties was performed. The data retrieved from genome analysis showed that E. coli strain EC121 belongs to the O154:H25 serotype, and to ST101-B1, which was epidemiologically linked to extraintestinal infections and antimicrobial resistance spread as well. Moreover, it was closely related to Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC). Besides, strain EC121 is an MDR strain harboring 14 antimicrobial resistance genes, including blaCTX-M-2, and more than 50 complete virulence genetic clusters, which are reported to be associated either with DEC or ExPEC. The strain also displays the capacity to adhere to a variety of cell lineages, and invade T24 bladder cells, as well as the ability to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces, and survive the bactericidal serum complement activity. Additionally, it is virulent in the Galleria mellonella model. Altogether, E. coli EC121 unveiled to be a pathogen powered by its multi-drug resistance characteristic. Carry out studies providing accurate information about the virulence potential of all kinds of MDR strains are essential because these studies will help in the development of alternative therapies of infection management and spread control of MDR strains.\n\nAuthors summaryThe phylogenetic origin of extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli is mostly associated with phylogroup B2, and the majority of the studies regarding extraintestinal infection focus on the most virulent strains, which might also present multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype. Strains belonging to phylogroup B1 and isolated from extraintestinal infections are considered as opportunist pathogens and have their virulence neglected. We focus our study in one MDR strain isolated from bloodstream infection that belongs to phylogenetic group B1 to enlarge the knowledge about the virulence of this kind of strain. We demonstrated that the EC121 is capable of adheres to intestinal and bladder human cells, and invades the latter one; it survives to human serum bactericidal effects and produces biofilm. Additionally, the in vivo assay confirmed the EC121 virulence, showing that it should be considered a pathogenic strain. The genetic analyzes highlighted important aspects of EC121 which are typical from strains of sequence type 101, like its involvement in the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes and its relationship with extraintestinal infection from diverse sources. Information concerning the virulence of MDR strains is important for the development of global actions treating the spread of antimicrobial resistance, as well as to elucidate the pathogenesis of strains that were considered as an opportunist.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the factors associated with normal linear growth among pre-school children living in better-off households, using survey data from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The primary outcome variable was child height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), categorised into HAZ[&ge;]-2SD (normal growth/not stunted) and HAZ<-2 (stunted). Using logistic regression, we estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of the factors associated with normal growth. Higher maternal weight (measured by body mass index) was associated with increased odds of normal growth in Mozambique, DRC, Kenya and Nigeria. A unit increase in maternal years of education was associated with increased odds in normal growth in DRC (aOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.03, 1.09), Ghana (aOR=1.08, 95% CI=1.04, 1.12), Mozambique (aOR=1.08, 95% CI=1.05, 1.11) and Nigeria (aOR=1.07, 95% CI=1.06, 1.08). A year increase in maternal age was positively associated with normal growth in all the five countries. Breastfeeding was associated with increased odds of normal growth in Nigeria (aOR= 1.30, 95% CI=1.16, 1.46) and Kenya (aOR=1.37, 95% CI=1.05, 1.79). Children of working mothers had 25% (aOR=0.75, 95% CI=0.60, 0.93) reduced odds of normal growth in DRC. A unit change in maternal parity was associated with 10% (aOR=0.90, 95% CI=0.84, 0.97), 23% (aOR=0.77, 95% CI=0.63, 0.93), 25% (aOR=0.75, 95% CI=0.69, 0.82), 6% (aOR=0.94, 95% CI=0.89, 0.99) and 5% (aOR=0.95, 95% CI=0.92, 0.99) reduced odds of normal growth in DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and Nigeria respectively. A child being a male was associated with 16% (aOR=0.82, 95% CI=0.68, 0.98), 40% (aOR=0.60, 95% CI=0.40, 0.89), 37% (aOR=0.63, 95% CI=0.51, 0.77) and 21% (aOR=0.79, 95% CI=0.71, 0.87) reduced odds of normal child growth in DRC, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria respectively. In conclusion, maternal education, weight, age, breastfeeding and antenatal care are positively associated with normal child growth, while maternal parity, employment, and child sex and age are associated negatively with normal growth. Interventions to improve child growth should take into account these differential effects.",

    "abstract": "A vaccine to prevent maternal acquisition of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) during pregnancy is a primary strategy to reduce the incidence of congenital disease. Similarly, vaccination of transplant recipients against HCMV has been proposed to prevent transplant-associated HCMV morbidity. The MF59-adjuvanted glycoprotein B protein subunit vaccine (gB/MF59) is the most efficacious tested to-date for both indications. We previously identified that gB/MF59 vaccination elicited poor neutralizing antibody responses and an immunodominant response against gB antigenic domain 3 (AD-3). Thus, we sought to test novel gB vaccines to improve functional antibody responses and reduce AD-3 immunodominance. Groups of juvenile New Zealand White rabbits were administered 3 sequential doses of full-length gB protein with an MF59-like squalene adjuvant (analogous to clinically-tested vaccine), gB ectodomain protein (lacking AD-3) with squalene adjuvant, or lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-packaged nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding full-length gB. The AD-3 immunodominant IgG response following human gB/MF59 vaccination was closely mimicked in rabbits, with 78% of binding antibodies directed against this region in the full-length gB protein group compared to 1% and 46% in the ectodomain and mRNA-LNP-vaccinated groups, respectively. All vaccines were highly immunogenic with similar kinetics and comparable peak gB-binding and functional antibody responses. Although gB ectodomain subunit vaccination reduced targeting of non-neutralizing epitope AD-3, it did not improve vaccine-elicited neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibody functions. gB nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP-immunized rabbits exhibited enhanced durability of IgG binding to soluble and cell membrane-associated gB protein as well as HCMV-neutralizing function. Furthermore, the gB mRNA-LNP vaccine enhanced breadth of IgG binding responses against discrete gB peptide residues. Finally, low-magnitude gB-specific T cell activity was observed in the full-length gB protein and mRNA-LNP vaccine groups, though not in ectodomain-vaccinated rabbits. Altogether, these data suggest that the gB mRNA-LNP vaccine candidate, aiming to improve upon the partial efficacy of gB/MF59 vaccination, should be further evaluated in preclinical models.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common infectious cause of infant birth defects, resulting in permanent neurologic disability for one newborn child every hour in the United States. Furthermore, this virus causes significant morbidity and mortality in immune-suppressed transplant recipients. After more than a half century of research and development, we remain without a clinically-licensed vaccine or therapeutic to reduce the burden of HCMV-associated disease. In this study, we sought to improve upon the glycoprotein B protein vaccine (gB/MF59), the most efficacious HCMV vaccine evaluated in clinical trial, via targeted modifications to either the protein structure or vaccine formulation. An attempt to alter the protein structure to focus the immune response on vulnerable epitopes ( gB ectodomain) had little effect on the quality or function of the vaccine-elicited antibodies. However, a novel vaccine platform, nucleoside-modified mRNA formulated in lipid nanoparticles, increased the durability and breadth of vaccine-elicited immune responses. We propose that an mRNA-based gB vaccine may ultimately prove more efficacious than the gB/MF59 vaccine and should be further evaluated for its ability to elicit antiviral immune factors that can prevent both infant and transplant-associated disease caused by HCMV infection.",
