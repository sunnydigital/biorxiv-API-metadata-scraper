    "abstract": "To advance our understanding of adaptation to temporally varying selection pressures, we identified signatures of seasonal adaptation occurring in parallel among Drosophila melanogaster populations. Specifically, we estimated allele frequencies genome-wide from flies sampled early and late in the growing season from 20 widely dispersed populations. We identified parallel seasonal allele frequency shifts across North America and Europe, demonstrating that seasonal adaptation is a general phenomenon of temperate fly populations. Seasonally fluctuating polymorphisms are enriched in large chromosomal inversions and we find a broad concordance between seasonal and spatial allele frequency change. The direction of allele frequency change at seasonally variable polymorphisms can be predicted by weather conditions in the weeks prior to sampling, linking the environment and the genomic response to selection. Our results suggest that fluctuating selection is an important evolutionary force affecting patterns of genetic variation in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Testing whether local adaptation and intrinsic reproductive isolation share a genetic basis can reveal important connections between adaptation and speciation. Local adaptation arises as advantageous alleles spread through a population, but whether these same advantageous alleles fail on the genetic backgrounds of other populations remains largely unknown. We used a quantitative genetic breeding design to produce a late generation (F4) recombinant hybrid population by equally mating amongst four contrasting ecotypes of a native Australian daisy for four generations. We tracked fitness across generations and measured morphological traits in the glasshouse, and used a reciprocal transplant to quantify fitness in all four parental habitats. In the glasshouse, plants in the second generation showed a reduction in fitness as a loss of fertility, but this was fully recovered in the following generation. The F4 hybrid lacked extreme phenotypes present in the parental ecotypes, suggesting that genes reducing hybrid fitness were linked to traits specific to each ecotype. In the natural habitats, additive genetic variance for fitness was greatest for habitats that showed stronger native-ecotype advantage, suggesting that a loss of genetic variation present in the parental ecotypes were adaptive in the natural habitats. Reductions in genetic variance for fitness were associated with a loss of ecological trade-offs previously described in the parental ecotypes. Furthermore, natural selection on morphological traits differed amongst the parental habitats, but was not predicted to occur towards the morphology of the parental ecotypes. Together, these results suggest that intrinsic reproductive isolation removed adaptive genetic variation present in the parental ecotypes. The evolution of these distinct ecotypes was likely governed by genetic variation that resulted in both ecological trade-offs and intrinsic reproductive isolation among populations adapted to contrasting environments.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus and surrounding medial-temporal-lobe (MTL) structures are critical for both memory and spatial navigation, but we do not fully understand the neuronal representations used to support these behaviors. Much research has examined how the MTL neurally represents spatial information, such as with \\\"place cells\\\" that represent the current location or \\\"head-direction cells\\\" that code for the current heading. In addition to behaviors that require an animal to attend to the current spatial location, navigating to remote destinations is a common part of daily life. To examine the neural basis of these behaviors we recorded single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients playing Treasure Hunt, a virtual-reality spatial-memory task. By analyzing how the activity of these neurons related to behavior in Treasure Hunt, we found that the firing rates of many MTL neurons during navigation significantly changed depending on the position of the current spatial target. In addition, we observed neurons whose firing rates during navigation were tuned to specific heading directions in the environment, and others whose activity changed depending on the timing within the trial. By showing that neurons in our task represent remote locations rather than the subjects own position, our results suggest that the human MTL can represent remote spatial information according to task demands.",

    "abstract": "In neuromorphic engineering, neural populations are generally modeled in a bottom-up manner, where individual neuron models are connected through synapses to form large-scale spiking networks. Alternatively, a top-down approach treats the process of spike generation and neural representation of excitation in the context of minimizing some measure of network energy. However, these approaches usually define the energy functional in terms of some statistical measure of spiking activity (ex. firing rates), which does not allow independent control and optimization of neurodynamical parameters. In this paper, we introduce a new spiking neuron and population model where the dynamical and spiking responses of neurons can be derived directly from a network objective or energy functional of continuous-valued neural variables like the membrane potential. The key advantage of the model is that it allows for independent control over three neuro-dynamical properties: (a) control over the steady-state population dynamics that encodes the minimum of an exact network energy functional; (b) control over the shape of the action potentials generated by individual neurons in the network without affecting the network minimum; and (c) control over spiking statistics and transient population dynamics without affecting the network minimum or the shape of action potentials. At the core of the proposed model are different variants of Growth Transform dynamical systems that produce stable and interpretable population dynamics, irrespective of the network size and the type of neuronal connectivity (inhibitory or excitatory). In this paper, we present several examples where the proposed model has been configured to produce different types of single-neuron dynamics as well as population dynamics. In one such example, the network is shown to adapt such that it encodes the steady-state solution using a reduced number of spikes upon convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper we use this network to construct a spiking associative memory that uses fewer spikes compared to conventional architectures, while maintaining high recall accuracy at high memory loads.",

Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected from 10 healthy recreationally active participants before, immediately post, and 3h after a session of HIIE performed at the same absolute exercise intensity before and after HVT (Pre-HVT and Post-HVT, respectively). The protein content of common markers of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis were assessed in nuclear- and cytosolic-enriched fractions by immunoblotting; mRNA contents of key transcription factors and mitochondrial genes were assessed by qPCR. Despite exercise-induced increases in PGC-1, p53, and plant homeodomain finger-containing protein 20 (PHF20) protein content, the phosphorylation of p53 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-p53Ser15 and p-ACCSer79, respectively), and PGC-1 mRNA Pre-HVT, no significant changes were observed Post-HVT. Forty sessions of twice-daily high-intensity interval training blunted all of the measured exercise-induced molecular events associated with mitochondrial biogenesis that were observed Pre-HVT. Future studies should determine if this loss relates to the decrease in relative exercise intensity, habituation to the same exercise stimulus, or a combination of both.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA major goal in post-synthesis evolutionary biology has been to better understand how complex interactions between traits drive movement along and facilitate the formation of distinct evolutionary pathways. I present analyses of a character matrix sampled across the haplorrhine skeleton that revealed several modules of characters displaying distinct patterns in macroevolutionary disparity. Comparison of these patterns to those in neurological development showed that early ape evolution was characterized by an intense regime of evolutionary and developmental flexibility. Shifting and reduced constraint in apes was met with episodic bursts in phenotypic innovation that built a wide array of functional diversity over a foundation of shared developmental and anatomical structure. Shifts in modularity drove dramatic evolutionary changes across the ape body plan in two distinct ways: 1) an episode of relaxed integration early in hominoid evolution coincided with bursts in evolutionary rate across multiple character suites; 2) the formation of two new trait modules along the branch leading to chimps and humans preceded rapid and dramatic evolutionary shifts in the carpus and pelvis. Changes to the structure of evolutionary mosaicism may correspond to enhanced evolvability that has a  preadaptive effect by catalyzing later episodes of dramatic morphological remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Human social nature has shaped visual perception. A signature of the relationship between vision and sociality is a particular visual sensitivity to social entities such as faces and bodies. We asked whether human vision also exhibits a special sensitivity to spatial relations that reliably correlate with social relations. In general, interacting people are more often situated face-to-face than back-to-back. Using functional MRI and behavioral measures in female and male human participants, we show that visual sensitivity to social stimuli extends to images including two bodies facing toward (vs. away from) each other. In particular, the inferior lateral occipital cortex, which is involved in visual-object perception, is organized such that the inferior portion encodes the number of bodies (one vs. two) and the superior portion is selectively sensitive to the spatial relation between bodies (facing vs. non-facing). Moreover, functionally localized, body-selective visual cortex responded to facing bodies more strongly than identical, but non-facing, bodies. In this area, multivariate pattern analysis revealed an accurate representation of body dyads with sharpening of the representation of single-body postures in facing dyads, which demonstrates an effect of visual context on the perceptual analysis of a body. Finally, the cost of body inversion (upside-down rotation) on body recognition, a behavioral signature of a specialized mechanism for body perception, was larger for facing vs. non-facing dyads. Thus, spatial relations between multiple bodies are encoded in regions for body perception and affect the way in which bodies are processed.\n\nPublic Significance StatementHuman social nature has shaped visual perception. Here, we show that human vision is not only attuned to socially relevant entities, such as bodies, but also to socially relevant spatial relations between those entities. Body-selective regions of visual cortex respond more strongly to multiple bodies that appear to be interacting (i.e., face-to-face), relative to unrelated bodies, and more accurately represent single body postures in interacting scenarios. Moreover, recognition of facing bodies is particularly susceptible to perturbation by upside-down rotation, indicative of a particular visual sensitivity to the canonical appearance of facing bodies. This encoding of relations between multiple bodies in areas for body-shape recognition suggests that the visual context in which a body is encountered deeply affects its perceptual analysis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate prediction of exacerbation risk enables personalised chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) care. We developed and validated a generalisable model to predict the individualised rate and severity of COPD exacerbations.\n\nMethodsWe pooled data from three COPD trials on patients with a history of exacerbations. We developed a mixed-effect model to predict exacerbations over one-year. Severe exacerbations were those requiring inpatient care. Predictors were a history of exacerbations, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, domiciliary oxygen therapy, lung function, symptom burden, and current medication use. ECLIPSE, a multicentre cohort study, was used for external validation.\n\nResultsThe development dataset included 2,380 patients (mean 64{middle dot}7 years, 1373 [57{middle dot}7%] men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}42/year, 0{middle dot}29/year [20{middle dot}5%] severe). When validated against all COPD patients in ECLIPSE (n=1819, mean 63{middle dot}3 years, 1186 [65{middle dot}2%] men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}20/year, 0{middle dot}27/year [22{middle dot}2%] severe), the area-under-curve was 0{middle dot}81 (95%CI 0{middle dot}79-0{middle dot}83) for [&ge;]2 exacerbations and 0{middle dot}77 (95%CI 0{middle dot}74-0{middle dot}80) for [&ge;]1 severe exacerbation. Predicted rates were 0{middle dot}25/year for severe and 1{middle dot}31/year for all exacerbations, close to the observed rates (0{middle dot}27/year and 1{middle dot}20/year, respectively). In ECLIPSE patients with a prior exacerbation history (n=996, mean 63{middle dot}6 years, 611 (61{middle dot}3%) men, mean exacerbation rate 1{middle dot}82/year, 0{middle dot}40/year [22{middle dot}0%] severe), the area-under-curve was 0{middle dot}73 (95%CI 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}76) for [&ge;]2 exacerbations and 0{middle dot}74 (95%CI 0{middle dot}70-0{middle dot}78) for [&ge;]1 severe exacerbation. Calibration was accurate for severe exacerbations (predicted=0{middle dot}37/year, observed=0{middle dot}40/year) and all exacerbations (predicted=1{middle dot}80/year, observed=1{middle dot}82/year). The model is accessible at http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/accept.\n\nInterpretationThis model can be used as a decision tool to personalise COPD treatment and prevent exacerbations.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPreventing future exacerbations is a major goal in COPD care. Because of adverse effects, preventative treatments should be reserved for those at a higher risk of future exacerbations. Predicting exacerbation risk in individual patients can guide these clinical decisions. A 2017 systematic review reported that of the 27 identified COPD exacerbation prediction tools, only two had reported external validation and none was ready for clinical implementation. To find the studies that were published afterwards, we searched PubMed for articles on development and validation of COPD exacerbation prediction since 2015, using the search terms \"COPD\", \"exacerbation\", \"model\", and \"validation\". We included studies that reported prediction of either the risk or the rate of exacerbations and excluded studies that did not report external validation. Our literature search revealed two more prediction models neither of which was deemed generalisable due to lack of methodological rigour, or local and limited nature of the data available to investigators.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used data from three randomised trials to develop ACCEPT, a clinical prediction tool based on routinely available predictors for COPD exacerbations. We externally validated ACCEPT in a large, multinational prospective cohort. To our knowledge, ACCEPT is the first COPD exacerbation prediction tool that jointly estimates the individualised rate and severity of exacerbations. Successful external validation of ACCEPT showed that its generalisability can be expanded across geography and beyond the setting of therapeutic trials. ACCEPT is designed to be easily applicable in clinical practice and is readily accessible as a web application.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceCurrent guidelines rely on a history of exacerbations as the sole predictor of future exacerbations. Simple clinical and demographic variables, in aggregate, can be used to predict COPD exacerbations with improved accuracy. ACCEPT enables a more personalised approach to treatment based on routinely collected clinical data by allowing clinicians to objectively differentiate risk profiles of patients with similar exacerbation history. Care providers and patients can use individualised exacerbation risk estimates to decide on preventive therapies based on objectively-established or patient-specific thresholds for treatment benefit and harm. COPD clinical researchers can use this tool to target enriched populations for enrolment in clinical trials.",

The Reddit comment archive represents an ideal corpus for bridging this gap. We trained a word embedding model, RedMed, to facilitate the identification and retrieval of health entities from Reddit data. We compare the performance of our model trained on a consumer-generated corpus against publicly available models trained on expert-generated corpora. Our automated classification pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.88 and a specificity of >0.9 across four different term classes. Of all drug mentions, an average of 79% ({+/-}0.5%) were exact matches to a generic or trademark drug name, 14% ({+/-}0.5%) were misspellings, 6.4% ({+/-}0.3%) were synonyms, and 0.13% ({+/-}0.05%) were pill marks.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe Lower Rhombic Lip (LRL) is a transient neuroepithelial structure of the dorsal hindbrain, which expands from r2 to r7, and gives rise to deep nuclei of the brainstem, such as the vestibular and auditory nuclei and most posteriorly the precerebellar nuclei. Although there is information about the contribution of specific proneural-progenitor populations to specific deep nuclei, and the distinct rhombomeric contribution, little is known about how progenitor cells from the LRL behave during neurogenesis and how their transition into differentiation is regulated.\\n\\nRESULTSIn this work, we investigated the atoh1 gene regulatory network operating in the specification of LRL cells, and the kinetics of cell proliferation and behavior of atoh1a-derivatives by using complementary strategies in the zebrafish embryo. We unveiled that atoh1a is necessary and sufficient for specification of LRL cells by activating atoh1b, which worked as a differentiation gene to transition progenitor cells towards neuron differentiation in a Notch-dependent manner. This cell state transition involved the release of atoh1a-derivatives from the LRL: atoh1a progenitors contributed first to atoh1b cells, which are committed non-proliferative precursors, and to the lhx2b-neuronal lineage as demonstrated by cell fate studies and functional analyses. Using in vivo cell lineage approaches we showed that the proliferative cell capacity, as well as their mode of division, relied on the position of the atoh1a progenitors within the dorsoventral axis.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOur data demonstrates that the zebrafish provides an excellent model to study the in vivo behavior of distinct progenitor populations to the final neuronal differentiated pools, and to reveal the subfunctionalization of ortholog genes. Here, we unveil that atoh1a behaves as the cell fate selector gene, whereas atoh1b functions as a neuronal differentiation gene, contributing to the lhx2b neuronal population. atoh1a-progenitor cell dynamics (cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and neuronal migration) relies on their position, demonstrating the challenges that progenitor cells face in computing positional information from a dynamic two-dimensional grid in order to generate the stereotyped neuronal structures in the embryonic hindbrain.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin-3 KIF1A (UNC-104 in C. elegans) is the major fast axonal transporter of STVs (synaptic vesicle protein transport vesicles) containing synaptic precursors such as RAB3A (RAB-3) or VAMP2 (SNB-1). Heritable mutations in neuronal motor proteins (and their adaptors) lead to numerous neurodegenerative diseases. The C-terminal PH (pleckstrin homolog) domain of kinesin-3 UNC-104 directly binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates that form the lipid bilayers of STVs. We hypothesized that RAB-3-bound STVs employ a dual linker UNC-10/SYD-2 (RIMS1/liprin- in mammals) acting as a UNC-104 receptor. This tripartite RAB-3/UNC-10/SYD-2 complex would also act as an additional linker to strengthen the motor-lipid interaction. RT-PCR and Western blot experiments favor a genetic relation between SYD-2, UNC-10 and RAB-3. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed changes in binding affinities between SYD-2 and UNC-104 depending on the presence or absence of UNC-10 and RAB-3. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed in situ interaction changes between SYD-2 and UNC-104 in either unc-10 or rab-3 mutants. Neuronal expression of UNC-104 appears to be more diffused and is restricted to travel short distances with significantly reduced speeds in these mutants. Though both SNB-1 and RAB-3 are actively transported by UNC-104, the movement of RAB-3 is generally enhanced and largely depending on the presence of the dual linker. Strikingly, the deletion of UNC-104s PH domain did not affect UNC-104/RAB-3 colocalization but did affect UNC-104/SNB-1 colocalization. These findings solidly support the model of a dual UNC-10/SYD-2 linker acting as a sufficient buttress to connect the motor to RAB-3-containing STVs to enhance their transport.\n\nSCIENTIFIC STATEMENTThe interaction between molecular motors and their membranous vesicular cargoes is generally specific. However, for the major axonal transporter kinesin-3 UNC-104, only its weak and non-specific interaction via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates (forming the lipid bilayers of synaptic vesicles) has been characterized. Here, we present a novel, more specific way for UNC-104 to interact with synaptic vesicles - specifically with RAB-3 bound vesicles - via the dual linker complex UNC-10/SYD-2. Because many neurological diseases are linked to defects in axonal trafficking (often with protein accumulation phenotypes in neurons), understanding the molecular basis of motor/vesicle interaction might lead to the design of new drugs that may cure or prevent such diseases.",

Analyzing the collinearity between the genomes revealed [~]350 regions (4.1% of the euchromatin) where accession-specific tandem duplications destroyed the syntenic gene order between the genomes. These hotspots of rearrangements were characterized by the loss of meiotic recombination in hybrids within these regions and the enrichment of genes implicated in biotic stress response. Together this suggests that hotspots of rearrangements are governed by altered evolutionary dynamics as compared to the rest of the genome, which are based on new mutations and not on the recombination of existing variation, and thereby enable a quick response to the ever-evolving challenges of biotic stress.",

Although the ferredoxin receptor FusA and the processing protease, FusC, have been identified, the mechanistic basis of ferredoxin import is poorly understood. In this work we demonstrate that protein translocation across the outer membrane is dependent on the TonB-like protein FusB. In contrast to the loss of FusC, loss of FusB or FusA abolishes ferredoxin transport to the periplasm, demonstrating that FusA and FusB work in concert to transport ferredoxin across the outer membrane. In addition to interaction with the TonB-box region of FusA, FusB also forms a complex with the ferredoxin substrate, with complex formation required for substrate transport. These data suggest that ferredoxin transport requires energy transduction from the cytoplasmic membrane via FusB for both removal of the FusA plug domain and for substrate translocation through the FusA barrel.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTreatment of schizophrenia has had limited success in treating core cognitive symptoms. The evidence of multi-gene involvement suggests that multi-target therapy may be needed. Meanwhile, the complexity of schizophrenia pathophysiology and psychopathology, coupled with the species-specificity of much of the symptomatology, places limits on analysis via animal models, in vitro assays, and patient assessment. Multiscale computer modeling complements these traditional modes of study.\\n\\nMethodsUsing a hippocampal CA3 computer model with 1200 neurons, we examined the effects of alterations in NMDAR, HCN (Ih current), and GABAAR on information flow (measured with normalized transfer entropy), and in gamma activity in local field potential (LFP).\\n\\nResultsAltering NMDARs, GABAAR, Ih, individually or in combination, modified information flow in an inverted-U shape manner, with information flow reduced at low and high levels of these parameters. The strong information flow seen at the peaks were associated with an intermediate level of synchrony, seen as an intermediate level of gamma activity in the LFP, and an intermediate level of pyramidal cell excitability.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results are consistent with the idea that overly low or high gamma power is associated with pathological information flow and information processing. These data suggest the need for careful titration of schizophrenia pharmacotherapy to avoid extremes that alter information flow in different ways. These results also identify gamma power as a potential biomarker for monitoring pathology and multi-target pharmacotherapy.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCurrently, there are no good treatments for the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. We used a biophysically realistic computational model of hippocampal CA3 to investigate the effect of potential pharmacotherapeutic targets on the dynamics of CA3 activity and information processing to predict multi-target drug treatments for schizophrenia. We found an inverted-U shaped relationship between information flow and drug target manipulations, as well as between information flow and gamma power. Our study suggests that neuronal excitability and synchrony may be tuned between extremes to enhance information flow and information processing. It further predicts the need for careful titration of schizophrenia drugs, whether used individually or in drug cocktails.",

They have also recently been used to predict gene mutations from pathology images, but no comprehensive evaluation of their potential for extracting molecular features from histology slides has yet been performed. We propose a novel approach based on the integration of multiple data modes, and show that our deep learning model, HE2RNA, can be trained to systematically predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images alone, without the need for expert annotation. HE2RNA is interpretable by design, opening up new opportunities for virtual staining. In fact, it provides virtual spatialization of gene expression, as validated by double-staining on an independent dataset. Moreover, the transcriptomic representation learned by HE2RNA can be transferred to improve predictive performance for other tasks, particularly for small datasets. As an example of a task with direct clinical impact, we studied the prediction of microsatellite instability from hematoxylin & eosin stained images and our results show that better performance can be achieved in this setting.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of brain networks has been extensively studied in multiple species. However, exactly how the brain network reconfigures when a local region stops functioning remains elusive. By combining chemogenetics and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) in awake rodents, we investigated the causal impact of acutely inactivating a hub region (i.e. dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) on brain network properties. We found that disrupting hub activity profoundly changed the function the default-mode network (DMN), and this change was associated with altered DMN-related behavior. Suppressing hub activity also impacted the topological architecture of the whole-brain network in network resilience, segregation and small worldness, but not network integration. This study has established a system that allows for mechanistically dissecting the relationship between local regions and brain network properties. Our data provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that acute dysfunction of a brain hub can cause large-scale network changes. This study opens an avenue of manipulating brain networks by controlling hub-node activity.",

A neural substrate for navigation demands spatial and environmental information and the ability to effect actions through efferents. Secondary motor cortex is a prime candidate for this role given its interconnectivity with association cortices that encode spatial relationships and its projection to primary motor cortex. Here we report that secondary motor cortex neurons robustly encode both planned and current left/right turning actions across multiple turn locations in a multi-route navigational task. Comparisons within a common statistical framework reveal that secondary motor cortex neurons differentiate contextual factors including environmental position, route, action sequence, orientation, and choice availability. Despite significant modulation by context, action planning and execution are the dominant output signals of secondary motor cortex neurons. These results identify secondary motor cortex as a structure integrating environmental context toward the updating of planned movements.",

Rhesus macaques are key for modeling human immune responses, placing critical importance on the accurate annotation and quantification of their Ig and TCR repertoires. However, due to incomplete reference resources, the coverage and accuracy of the traditional targeted amplification strategies for profiling rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires are largely unknown. Here, using long read sequencing, we sequenced four Indian-origin rhesus macaque tissues and obtained high quality, full-length sequences for over 6,000 unique Ig and TCR transcripts, without the need for sequence assembly. We constructed the first complete reference set for the constant regions of all known isotypes and chain types of rhesus Ig and TCR repertoires. We show that sequence diversity exists across the entire variable regions of rhesus Ig and TCR transcripts. Consequently, existing strategies using targeted amplification of rearranged variable regions comprised of V(D)J gene segments miss a significant fraction (27% to 53% and 42% to 49%) of rhesus Ig/TCR diversity. To overcome these limitations, we designed new rhesus-specific assays that remove the need for primers conventionally targeting variable regions and allow single cell-level Ig and TCR repertoire analysis. Our improved approach will enable future studies to fully capture rhesus Ig and TCR repertoire diversity and is applicable for improving annotations in any model organism.",

In essence, the screening strategy is based upon the idea that if overexpression of a wild type allele can generate a phenotype, then overexpression of a newly induced loss-of-function allele will lack this phenotype. As a proof-of-principle, we used this method to select EMS induced mutations of the Drosophila gene hindsight (hnt). From approximately 45,000 F1 progeny we recovered 8 new EMS induced loss-of-function hnt alleles that we characterized as an allelic series of hypomorphic mutations.

Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model mixture of skin lipids, the self-assembly of the lipid matrix lamellae has been studied. At higher humidity, the resulting lamellar phase is maintained by partitioning excess water into isolated droplets of controlled size and spatial distribution. The droplets may fuse together to form intra-lamellar water channels, thereby providing a pathway for the permeation of hydrophilic species.

    "abstract": "Fibrin is an elastomeric protein forming highly extensible fiber networks that provide the scaffold of blood clots. Here we reveal the molecular mechanisms that explain the large extensibility of fibrin networks by performing in situ small angle X-ray scattering measurements while applying a shear deformation. We simultaneously measure shear-induced alignment of the fibers and changes in their axially ordered molecular packing structure. We show that fibrin networks exhibit distinct structural responses that set in consecutively as the shear strain is increased. They exhibit an entropic response at small strains (<5%), followed by progressive fiber alignment (>25% strain) and finally changes in the fiber packing structure at high strain (>100%). Stretching reduces the fiber packing order and slightly increases the axial periodicity, indicative of molecular unfolding. However, the axial periodicity changes only by 0.7%, much less than the 80% length increase of the fibers, indicating that fiber elongation mainly stems from uncoiling of the natively disordered C-peptide linkers that laterally bond the molecules. Upon removal of the load, the network structure returns to the original isotropic state, but the fiber structure becomes more ordered and adopts a smaller packing periodicity compared to the original state. We conclude that the hierarchical packing structure of fibrin fibers, with built-in disorder, makes the fibers extensible and allows for mechanical annealing. Our results provide a basis for interpreting the molecular basis of haemostatic and thrombotic disorders associated with clotting and provide inspiration to design resilient bio-mimicking materials.",

Using volatile experimental settings, we further show that such imprecise, low-level inferential processes accounted for observed human adaptive performances, unlike optimal adaptive models involving higher-order inferential capabilities, their biologically more plausible, algorithmic approximations and non-inferential adaptive models like reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are responsible for spontaneous remyelination after a demyelinating lesion. They are present in large parts of the mouse and human central nervous system, both during development and in adulthood, yet how their physiological behaviour is modified throughout life remains largely unknown. Moreover, the activity of adult human OPCs is still not fully understood. Significantly, most of the molecules involved in OPC-mediated remyelination are also involved in their development, a phenomenon that may be clinically relevant. In this article, we have systematically analyzed the intrinsic properties of OPCs isolated from the cerebral cortex of neonatal, postnatal and adult mice, as well as those recovered from neurosurgical adult human cerebral cortex tissue. We also analyze the response of these cells to two molecules that have known effects on OPC biology during development and that are overexpressed in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS): FGF2 and anosmin-1. By analyzing intact OPCs for the first time with H-1 HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy, we show that these cells behave distinctly and that they have different metabolic patterns in function of their stage of maturity. Moreover, their response to FGF-2 and anosmin-1 differs in relation to their developmental stage and in function of the species. Our data reveal that the behaviour of adult human and mouse OPCs differs in a very dynamic way that should be considered when testing drugs and for the proper design of effective pharmacological and/or cell therapies for MS.",

    "abstract": "The recognition of and differential responses to salient stimuli are among the main drivers of behavioral plasticity, yet, how animals evolve and modulate functional responses to novel classes of antagonistic stimuli remain poorly understood. We studied free-living male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) to test whether gene expression responses in blood are distinct or shared between patterns of aggressive behavioral responses directed at simulated conspecific versus heterospecific intruders. In this species, males defend territories against conspecific males and respond aggressively to female brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), a brood parasite that commonly lays eggs in blackbird nests. Both conspecific songs and parasitic calls elicited aggressive responses from focal subjects and caused a downregulation in genes associated with immune system response, relative to control calls of a second, harmless heterospecific species. In turn, only the conspecific song treatment elicited an increase in singing behavior and an upregulation of genes associated with metabolic processes relative to the two heterospecific calls. Our results suggest that aspects of antagonistic responses to both conspecifics and brood parasites can be based on similar physiological responses, suggestive of shared molecular and behavioral pathways involved in the recognition and reaction to both evolutionarily old and new enemies.",

    "abstract": "With advances in single-cell genomics, molecular signatures of cells comprising the brain vasculature are revealed in unprecedented detail1,2, yet the ageing-associated cell subtype transcriptomic changes which may contribute to neurovascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases3-7 remain elusive. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of brain endothelial cells (EC) in young adult and aged mice to characterize their ageing-associated genome-wide expression changes. We identified zonation-dependent transcriptomic changes in aged brain EC subtypes, with capillary ECs exhibiting the most transcriptomic alterations. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed altered immune/cytokine signaling in ECs of all vascular segments, while functional changes impacting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and glucose/energy metabolism were most prominently implicated in ECs of the capillary bed - the primary site where ECs and other neurovascular unit (NVU) cell types closely interact and coordinate to regulate BBB and cerebral blood flow in health and diseased conditions8-17. Furthermore, an overrepresentation of Alzheimers disease (AD)-associated genes identified from GWAS studies was evident among the human orthologs of differentially expressed genes of aged capillary ECs but not other EC subtypes. Importantly, for numerous EC-enriched differentially expressed genes with important functional roles at the BBB and/or association with AD, we found concordant expression changes in human aged or AD brains. Finally, we demonstrated that treatment with exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist, strongly reverses transcriptomic changes in ECs and largely reduces BBB leakage in the aged brain. Thus, our study provides insights into detailed transcriptomic alterations underlying brain EC ageing that are complex with subtype specificity yet amenable to pharmacological interventions.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo study the relation of epileptological and surgical variables with post-operative memory performance, following surgery for refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS).\\n\\nMethodsLogical memory (LM) and visual memory (VM) scores for immediate and late recall of 201 patients operated for MTLE/HS from 1996 to 2016 were reviewed. All patients were evaluated prior to surgery and reevaluated up until 5 years after the procedure. Scores were standardized to a control group of 54 healthy individuals matched for age and education. Patients were divided in two groups according to the hemisphere affected and scores for immediate and late recall were compared. Reliable Change Index (RCI) with a 90% confidence interval was performed to verify individual memory changes for each late LM (lLM) and late VM (lVM) score. A multiple linear regression was performed with the RCI using late recall scores of lLM and lVM and clinical variables.\\n\\nResults112 (56%) patients had left HS (lHS). The lHS group showed decreased immediate LM (iLM) scores before and after surgery (p<0.05), compared with rHS. The rHS group showed increased iLM scores post-operatively (p<0.05). RCI of the rHS group showed that 6 (7%) individuals had improved, 78 (87%) stabilized and 5 (6%) decresead in lLM scores, and for lVM 7 (8%) improved, 80 (89%) stabilized and 2 (3%) worsened (RCI> 1.645). RCI of the lHS group showed that 3 (3%) individuals had increased scores, 104 (93%) stabilized and 5 (4%) worsened for lLM, and for lVM 3 (3%) obtained improved scores, 103 (92%) stabilized and 6 (5%) decreased (RCI> 1.645). lHS and later age of onset of the first epileptic seizure were predictors of lLM loss (p<0.05).\\n\\nConclusionLeft MTLE/HS and later age of seizure onset were predictive factors for worsening of lLM. No RCI predictors of post-op lVM performance were identified. We found a decreased baseline functioning of LM in the lHS group and improvement of LM in some patients who had resection of the right MTL. Patients of the rHS group had a higher percentage of reliable post-op improvement for both VM and LM scores.",

    "abstract": "Natural products have traditionally been discovered through the screening of culturable microbial isolates from all sort of environments. The sequencing revolution allowed the identification of dozens of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within single bacterial genomes, either from cultured or uncultured strains. However, we are still far from fully exploiting the microbial reservoir, as most of the species are non-model organisms with complex regulatory systems and yet recalcitrant to be engineered. Today, genomic and metagenomic data produced by laboratories worldwide covering the most different natural and artificial environments on Earth, are an invaluable source of raw information from which natural product biosynthesis can be accessed. In the present work, we describe the environmental distribution and evolution of the abyssomicin BGC through the analysis of publicly available genomic and metagenomic data. Our results demonstrate that the selection of a pathway-specific enzyme to direct the genome mining is an excellent strategy that led to the identification of 74 new Diels-Alderase homologs and unveiled a surprising prevalence of the abyssomicin BGC within terrestrial habitats, mainly soil and plant-associated, where we have identified five complete and 12 partial new abyssomicin BGCs and 23 new potential abyssomicin BGCs. Our results strongly support the potential of genome and metagenome mining as a key preliminary tool to inform bioprospecting strategies aiming at the identification of new bioactive compounds such as -but not restricted to-abyssomicins.",

    "abstract": "Amyloidogenesis is significant in both protein function and pathology. Amyloid formation of folded, globular proteins is commonly initiated by partial unfolding. However, how this unfolding event is triggered for proteins that are otherwise stable in their native environments is not well understood. The accumulation of the immunoglobulin protein {beta}2-microglobulin ({beta}2m) into amyloid plaques in the joints of long-term hemodialysis patients is the hallmark of Dialysis Related Amyloidosis (DRA). While {beta}2m does not form amyloid unassisted near neutral pH in vitro, the localization of {beta}2m deposits to joint spaces suggests a role for the local extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, specifically collagens, in promoting amyloid formation. Indeed, collagen and other ECM components have been observed to facilitate {beta}2m amyloid formation, but the large size and anisotropy of the complex, combined with the low affinity of these interactions, has limited atomic-level elucidation of the amyloid-promoting mechanism by these molecules. Using solution NMR approaches that uniquely probe weak interactions and large complexes, we are able to derive binding interfaces for collagen I on {beta}2m and detect collagen I-induced {micro}s-ms timescale dynamics in the {beta}2m backbone. By combining solution NMR relaxation methods and 15N-dark state exchange saturation transfer experiments, we propose a model in which weak, multimodal collagen I-{beta}2m interactions promote exchange with a minor population of an amyloid-competent species to induce fibrillogenesis. The results portray the intimate role of the environment in switching an innocuous protein into an amyloid-competent state, rationalizing the localization of amyloid deposits in DRA.",

Despite the survival dependency on the proteasome pathway genes, FDA-approved proteasome inhibitors induced minimal clinical response in breast cancer patients due to weak proteasome inhibition. Here, we show that a potent proteasome inhibitor Marizomib (Mzb) inhibits multiple proteasome catalytic activities and induces a better anti-tumor response in TNBC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts alone and in combination with the standard-of-care chemotherapy. Mechanistically, Mzb inhibits oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) via PGC-1 suppression in conjunction with proteasome inhibition in TNBC cells. Mzb reduces lung and brain metastases by reducing the number of circulating tumor cells and the expression of multiple genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, Mzb-induced OXPHOS inhibition upregulates glycolysis to meet the energetic demands of TNBC cells and, hence, combined inhibition of glycolysis with Mzb exposure leads to a synergistic anti-cancer activity. Collectively, our data provide a strong rationale for a clinical evaluation of Mzb in primary and metastatic TNBC patients.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMarizomib inhibits primary tumor growth, and also reduces lung and brain metastases in pre-clinical models of triple-negative breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Dendrites develop elaborate morphologies in concert with surrounding glia, but the molecules that coordinate dendrite and glial morphogenesis are mostly unknown. C. elegans offers a powerful model for identifying such factors. Previous work in this system examined dendrites and glia that develop within epithelia, similar to mammalian sense organs. Here, we focus on the neurons BAG and URX, which are not part of an epithelium but instead form membranous attachments to a single glial cell at the nose, reminiscent of dendrite-glia contacts in the mammalian brain. We show that these dendrites develop by retrograde extension, in which the nascent dendrite endings anchor to the presumptive nose and then extend by stretch during embryo elongation. Using forward genetic screens, we find that dendrite development requires the adhesion protein SAX-7/L1CAM and the cytoplasmic protein GRDN-1/CCDC88C to anchor dendrite endings at the nose. SAX-7 acts in neurons and glia, while GRDN-1 acts in glia to non-autonomously promote dendrite extension. Thus, this work shows how glial factors can help to shape dendrites, and identifies a novel molecular mechanism for dendrite growth by retrograde extension.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification of cytosine nucleotides that represents a promising suite of aging markers with broad potential applications. In particular, determining an individuals age from their skeletal remains is an enduring problem in the field of forensic anthropology, and one that epigenetic markers are particularly well-suited to address. However, all DNA methylation-based age prediction methods published so far focus on tissues other than bone. While high accuracy has been achieved for saliva, blood and sperm, which are easily accessible in living individuals, the highly tissue-specific nature of DNA methylation patterns means that age prediction models trained on these particular tissues may not be directly applicable to other tissues. Bone is a prime target for the development of DNA methylation-based forensic identification tools as skeletal remains are often recoverable for years post-mortem, and well after soft tissues have decomposed. In this study, we generate genome-wide DNA methylation data from 32 individual bone samples. We analyze this new dataset alongside published data from 133 additional bone donors, both living and deceased. We perform an epigenome-wide association study on this combined dataset to identify 108 sites of DNA methylation that show a significant relationship with age (FDR < 0.05). We also develop an age-prediction model using lasso regression that produces highly accurate estimates of age from bone spanning an age range of 49-112 years. Our study demonstrates that DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites can serve as powerful markers of aging, and can yield more accurate predictions of chronological age in human adults than morphometric markers.",

There is an urgent call for CNA-based biomarkers in clinics, in particular for Stage III CRC, if combined with imaging or pathologic evidence, promise more precise care at the timing. We conducted this Stage III specific biomarker discovery with a cohort of 134 CRCs, and with a newly developed high-efficiency CNA profiling protocol. Specifically, we developed the profiling protocol for tumor-normal matched tissue samples based on low-coverage clinical whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We demonstrated the protocols accuracy and robustness by a systematic benchmark with microarray, high-coverage whole-exome and -genome approaches, where the low-coverage WGS-derived CNA segments were highly accordant (PCC>0.95) with those derived from microarray, and they were substantially less variable if compared to exome-derived segments. A lasso-based model and multivariate cox regression analysis identified a chromosome 17p loss, containing the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, that was significantly associated with reduced survival (P=0.0139, HR=1.688, 95% CI = [1.112-2.562]), which was validated by an independent cohort of 187 Stage III CRCs.

    "abstract": "Visualization of large-scale, multi-dimensional omics data is a major challenge. Experimental study designs in proteomics research produce multiple data layers, e.g. relationships between hundreds of proteins, their interactions and abundances as a function of time or perturbation, as well as dynamics of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and allelic variants (proteoforms). These different levels and types of information of proteins and proteoforms complicate data analysis and generation of insightful and comprehensible graphic visualizations. Middle-down mass spectrometry of histone proteins now allows quantifying hundreds of histone proteoforms including co-existing methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation events at distinct amino acid residues within histone molecules. The histone PTM landscape plays a dominant role in the regulation of chromatin activity and transcriptional and epigenetic control. The dynamics of these reversible modifications are governed by reader, writer and eraser enzymes that cooperate to regulate molecular mechanism that rely on multiple interdependent PTM marks in histones and nucleosomes in chromatin. This PTM crosstalk can be quantified and provides a detailed picture of the underlying rules for setting the histone PTM landscape and chromatin activity, and is available to the community via our CrosstalkDB platform. Here, we developed a new computational method, PTM-CrossTalkMapper, to visualize the dynamics of histone PTMs for different experimental conditions, replicates and proteoforms onto a landscape, thereby describing the crosstalk and interplay between PTMs in a more comprehensible manner. We show the power of combining different levels of information on such crosstalk maps for histone PTM dynamics in mouse organs during the aging process. The PTM-CrossTalkMapper toolkit provides flexible functions to create these maps in various scenarios of multi-dimensional experimental designs, including histone PTM patterns and PTM crosstalk.\\n\\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/veitveit/CrossTalkMapper.",

The directionality of effect between fibrosis and inflammation in the lung has been a point of debate for many years. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Interleukin 11 (IL11) signaling in fibroblasts is of primary importance for pulmonary fibrosis and that this event is upstream of lung inflammation. We generated mice with loxP-flanked Il11ra1 alleles and crossed them to a Col1a2-CreERT strain to enable Il11ra1 deletion in adult fibroblasts (Il11ra1-CKO mice). Lung fibroblasts from Il11ra1-CKO mice were selectively deleted for Il11ra1 and refractory to TGF{beta}1 stimulation. In the mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, Il11ra1-CKO mice had markedly reduced pulmonary fibrosis and lesser lung damage, which was accompanied by diminished ERK activation in the stromal compartment. Bleomycin lung injury in Il11ra1-CKO mice was also associated with diminished STAT3 activation in inflammatory cells, fewer pulmonary immune cell infiltrates and almost complete inhibition of NF-kB activation. These data reveal an essential role for IL11 signaling in fibroblasts for lung fibrosis and show that inflammation in the lung can be secondary to stromal activation.",

High-speed atomic force microscopy visualizes the complexes between monomeric SecA and SecYEG as being stable for tens of seconds.

Furthermore, luminescence resonance energy transfer reveals two conformations of the SecYEG-SecA complex that differ in the protrusion depth of SecAs two-helix finger into SecYEGs aqueous channel. Such movement of the finger is in line with the power stroke mechanism of protein translocation.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as important effectors of the cellular DNA damage response (DDR). The RBP FUS is implicated in RNA metabolism and DNA repair, and it undergoes reversible liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that FUS-dependent LLPS is necessary for the initiation of the DDR. Using laser microirradiation in FUS-knockout cells, we show that FUS is required for the recruitment to DNA damage sites of the DDR factors KU80, NBS1, 53BP1, and of SFPQ, another RBP implicated in the DDR. The relocation of KU80, NBS1, and SFPQ is similarly impaired by LLPS inhibitors, or LLPS-deficient FUS variants. We also show that LLPS is necessary for efficient {gamma}H2AX foci formation. Finally, using super-resolution structured illumination microscopy, we demonstrate that the absence of FUS impairs the proper arrangement of {gamma}H2AX nano-foci into higher-order clusters. These findings demonstrate the early requirement for FUS-dependent LLPS in the activation of the DDR and the proper assembly of DSBs repair complexes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is associated with aberrant neuronal activity levels. How those activity alterations emerge and how stable they are over time in vivo, however, remains elusive to date. To address these questions we chronically recorded the activity from identified neurons in cortex of awake APPPS1 transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermates over the course of 4 weeks by means of calcium imaging. Surprisingly, aberrant neuronal activity was very stable over time. Moreover, we identified a slow progressive gain of activity of former intermediately active neurons as the main source of new highly active neurons. Interestingly, fluctuations in neuronal activity were independent from amyloid plaque proximity, but aberrant activity levels were more likely to persist close to plaques. These results support the notion that neuronal network pathology observed in AD patients is the consequence of stable single cell aberrant neuronal activity, a finding of potential therapeutic relevance.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/801902v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (43K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16f8461org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c0952org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@681c04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@107854a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The inflammasome assembled by NLRP3 has been predominantly studied in homogenous cell populations in vitro, neglecting the influence of cellular interactions that occur in vivo. Here, we show that platelets, the second most abundant cells in the blood, boost the inflammasome capacity of human macrophages and neutrophils, and are critical for IL-1 production by monocytes. Platelets license NLRP3 transcription, thereby enhancing ASC nucleation, caspase-1 activity, and IL-1{beta} maturation. Platelet depletion attenuated LPS-induced IL-1{beta} in vivo, and platelet counts correlate with plasma concentrations of IL-1{beta} in malaria patients. Furthermore, a platelet gene signature was enriched among the highest expressed transcripts in IL-1{beta}-driven autoinflammatory diseases. The platelet-mediated enhancement of inflammasome activation was independent of cell-to-cell contacts, platelet-derived lipid mediators, purines, nucleic acids and a host of platelet cytokines, and involved the triggering of calcium sensing receptors on macrophages by a calcium-dependent protein commonly released by platelets and megakaryocytes. Finally, we report that platelets provide an additional layer of regulation of inflammasomes in vivo.",

    "abstract": "During thymic development, {gamma}{delta} T cells commit to either an IFN-{gamma}- or an IL-17-producing phenotype through mechanisms that remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether the SLAM/SAP signaling pathway played a role in the functional programming of thymic {gamma}{delta} T cells. Characterization of SLAM family receptor expression revealed that thymic {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets were each marked by distinct co-expression profiles of SLAMF1, SLAMF4, and SLAMF6. In the thymus, immature CD24hi V{gamma}1 and V{gamma}4 {gamma}{delta} T cells were largely contained within a SLAMF1+SLAMF6+ double positive (DP) population, while mature CD24low subsets were either SLAMF1+ or SLAMF6+ single positive (SP) cells. In the periphery, SLAMF1 and SLAMF6 expression on V{gamma}1, V{gamma}4, and V{gamma}6 T cells distinguished IL-17- and IFN-{gamma}-producing subsets, respectively. Disruption of SLAM family receptor signaling through deletion of SAP resulted in impaired thymic {gamma}{delta} T cell maturation at the CD24hiSLAMF1+SLAMF6+ DP stage that was associated with a decreased frequency of CD44+ROR{gamma}t+ {gamma}{delta} T cells. These defects were in turn associated with impaired {gamma}{delta} T cell IL-17 and IFN-{gamma} production in both the thymus as well as in peripheral tissues. The role for SAP was subset-specific, as V{gamma}1, V{gamma}4, V{gamma}5, but not V{gamma}6 subsets were SAP-dependent. Together, these data suggest that the SLAM/SAP signaling pathway regulates a critical checkpoint in the functional programming of IL-17 and IFN-{gamma}-producing {gamma}{delta} T cell subsets during thymic development.",

    "abstract": "The Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRTs) mediate diverse membrane remodeling events. These activities typically require ESCRT-III proteins to stabilize negatively-curved membranes, although recent work has indicated that certain ESCRT-IIIs also participate in positive-curvature membrane shaping reactions. ESCRT-IIIs polymerize into membrane-binding filaments, but the structural basis for negative versus positive membrane curvature shaping by these proteins remains poorly understood. To learn how ESCRT-IIIs shape membranes, we determined structures of human membrane-bound CHMP1B-only, membrane-bound CHMP1B+IST1, and IST1-only filaments by electron cryomicroscopy. Our structures show how CHMP1B first polymerizes into a single-stranded helical filament, shaping membranes into moderate-curvature tubules. Subsequently, IST1 assembles a second strand upon the CHMP1B filament, further constricting the membrane tube and reducing its diameter nearly to the fission point. Each step of constriction, moreover, thins the underlying bilayer and lowers the barrier to membrane fission. Together, our structures reveal how a two-component, sequential polymerization mechanism drives membrane tubulation, tube constriction, and bilayer thinning.",

    "abstract": "Recombination shapes the evolutionary trajectory of populations and plays an important role in the faithful transmission of chromosomes during meiosis. Levels of sexual reproduction and recombination are important properties of host-pathogen interactions because the speed of antagonistic co-evolution depends on the ability of hosts and pathogens to generate genetic variation. However, our understanding of the importance of recombination is limited because large taxonomic groups remain poorly investigated. Here, we analyze recombination rate variation in the basidiomycete fungus Armillaria ostoyae, which is an aggressive pathogen on a broad range of conifers and other trees. We constructed a dense genetic map using 198 single basidiospore progeny from a cross. Progeny were genotyped at a genome-wide set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). Based on a linkage map of on 11,700 SNPs spanning 1007.5 cM, we assembled genomic scaffolds into 11 putative chromosomes of a total genome size of 56.6 Mb. We identified 1984 crossover events among all progeny and found that recombination rates were highly variable along chromosomes. Recombination hotspots tended to be in regions close to the telomeres and were more gene-poor than the genomic background. Genes in proximity to recombination hotspots were encoding on average shorter proteins and were enriched for pectin degrading enzymes. Our analyses enable more powerful population and genome-scale studies of a major tree pathogen.",

These forces disrupt alveolar capillary barrier integrity, trigger proinflammatory mediator release, and differentially regulate genes and non-coding oligonucleotides such as microRNAs. In this study, we identify miR-146a as a mechanosensitive microRNA in alveolar macrophages that has therapeutic potential to mitigate lung injury during mechanical ventilation. We used humanized in-vitro systems, mouse models, and biospecimens from mechanically ventilated patients to elucidate the expression dynamics of miR-146a that might be required to decrease lung injury during mechanical ventilation. We found that the endogenous increase in miR-146a following injurious was relatively modest and not sufficient to prevent lung injury. However, when miR-146a was highly overexpressed using a nanoparticle-based delivery platform in vivo, it was sufficient to prevent lung injury. These data indicate that the endogenous increase in microRNA-146a during MV is a compensatory response that only partially limits VILI and that nanoparticle delivery approaches that significantly over-express microRNA-146a in AMs is an effective strategy for mitigating VILI.",

Biopsy is the traditional method to genetically characterise a tumour. However, it is a risky procedure, painful for the patient, and, occasionally, the tumour might be inaccessible. This work aims to study and debate the nature of the relationships between imaging phenotypes and lung cancer-related mutation status. Until now, the literature has failed to point to new research directions, mainly consisting of results-oriented works in a field where there is still not enough available data to train clinically viable models. We intend to open a discussion about critical points and to present new possibilities for future radiogenomics studies. We conducted high-dimensional data visualisation and developed classifiers, which allowed us to analyse the results for EGFR and KRAS biological markers according to different combinations of input features. We show that EGFR mutation status might be correlated to CT scans imaging phenotypes, however, the same does not seem to hold true for KRAS mutation status. Also, the experiments suggest that the best way to approach this problem is by combining nodule-related features with features from other lung structures.",

The latter enables discoveries by allowing a more diverse set of viewpoints and hypotheses to approach the data, which is self-evidently advantageous for the progress of science. However, if many researchers reuse the same dataset, multiple statistical testing may increase false positives in the literature. Current practice suggests that the number of tests to be corrected is the number of simultaneous tests performed by a researcher. Here we demonstrate that sequential hypothesis testing on the same dataset by multiple researchers can inflate error rates. This finding is troubling because, as more researchers embrace an open dataset, the likelihood of false positives (i.e. type I errors) will increase. Thus, we should expect a datasets utility for discovering new true relations between variables to decay. We consider several sequential correction procedures. These solutions can reduce the number of false positives but, at the same time, can prompt undesired challenges to open data (e.g. incentivising restricted access).",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes, as primary degradative organelles, are the end-point of different converging pathways including macroautophagy. To date, lysosome function has mainly focused on interphase cells, while their role during mitosis remains controversial. Mitosis dictates the faithful transmission of genetic material among generations, and perturbations of mitotic division lead to chromosomal instability, a hallmark of cancer. Heretofore, correct mitotic progression relies on the orchestrated degradation of mitotic factors, which was mainly attributed to ubiquitin-triggered proteasome-dependent degradation. Here, we show that mitotic transition does not only rely on proteasome-dependent degradation, as impairment of lysosomes increases mitotic timing and leads to mitotic errors, thus promoting chromosomal instability. Furthermore, we identified several putative lysosomal targets in mitotic cells. Among them, WAPL, a cohesin regulatory protein, emerged as a novel p62-interacting protein for targeted lysosomal degradation. Finally, we characterized an atypical nuclear phenotype, the toroidal nucleus, as a novel biomarker for genotoxic screenings. Our results establish lysosome-dependent degradation as an essential event to prevent genomic instability.",

We developed a novel method of reverse-calculating electric-field (E-field) models based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans that can determine individualized tDCS dose. We also sought to develop an MRI-free method of individualizing tDCS dose by measuring transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) motor threshold (MT) and single pulse, suprathreshold transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) MT and regressing it against E-field modeling.\\n\\nMethodsIn 29 healthy adults, we acquired TMS MT, TES MT, and structural MRI scans with a fiducial marking the motor hotspot. We then computed a \\\"reverse-calculated tDCS dose\\\" of tDCS applied at the scalp needed to cause a 1.00V/m E-field at the cortex. Finally, we examined whether the predicted E-field values correlated with each participants measured TMS MT or TES MT.\\n\\nResultsWe were able to determine a reverse-calculated tDCS dose for each participant. The Transcranial Electrical Stimulation MT, but not the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation MT, significantly correlated with the calculated tDCS dose determined by E-field modeling (R2 = 0.509, p < 0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsReverse-calculation E-field modeling, alone or in combination with TES MT, shows promise as a method to individualize tDCS dose. The large range of the reverse-calculated tDCS doses between subjects underscores the likely need to individualize tDCS dose. If these results are confirmed in future studies, TES MT may evolve into an inexpensive and quick method to individualize tDCS dose.",

    "abstract": "The TonB system actively transports vital nutrients across the unenergized outer membranes of the majority of Gram-negative bacteria. In this system, integral membrane proteins ExbB, ExbD, and TonB work together to transduce the protonmotive force (PMF) of the inner membrane to customized active transporters in the outer membrane by direct and cyclic binding of TonB to the transporters. A PMF-dependent TonB-ExbD interaction is prevented by 10-residue deletions within a periplasmic disordered domain of ExbD adjacent to the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we explored the function of the ExbD disordered domain in more detail. In vivo photo-cross-linking through sequential pBpa substitutions in the ExbD disordered domain captured five different ExbD complexes, some of which had been previously detected using in vivo formaldehyde crosslinking, a technique that lacks the residue-specific information that can be achieved through photo-cross-linking: 2 ExbB-ExbD heterodimers (one of which had not been detected previously), previously detected ExbD homodimers, previously detected PMF-dependent ExbD-TonB heterodimers, and for the first time, a predicted, ExbD-TonB PMF-independent interaction. The fact that multiple complexes were captured by the same pBpa substitution indicated the dynamic nature of ExbD interactions as the energy transduction cycle proceeded in vivo. In this study, we also discovered that a conserved motif, (V45, V47, L49, P50), within the disordered domain was required for signal transduction to TonB and to the C-terminal domain of ExbD and was the source of its essentiality.\\n\\nImportanceThe TonB system is a virulence factor for many Gram-negative pathogens including E-S-K-A-P-E pathogenic species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

    "abstract": "Arrestins, a structurally specialized and functionally diverse group of proteins, are central regulators of adaptive cellular responses in eukaryotes. Previous studies on fungal arrestins have demonstrated their capacity to modulate diverse cellular processes through their adaptor functions, facilitating the localization and function of other proteins. However, the mechanisms by which arrestin-regulated processes are involved in fungal virulence remain unexplored. We have identified a small family of four arrestins - Ali1, Ali2, Ali3, and Ali4 - in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Using complementary microscopy, proteomic, and reverse genetic techniques, we have defined a role for Ali1 as a novel contributor to cytokinesis, a fundamental cell cycle-associated process. We observed that Ali1 strongly interacts with proteins involved in lipid synthesis, and that ali1{Delta} mutant phenotypes are rescued by supplementation with lipid precursors that are used to build cellular membranes. From these data, we hypothesize that Ali1 contributes to cytokinesis by serving as an adaptor protein, facilitating the localization of enzymes that modify the plasma membrane during cell division, specifically the fatty acid synthases, Fas1 and Fas2. Finally, we assessed the contributions of the C. neoformans arrestin family to virulence, to better understand the mechanisms by which arrestin-regulated adaptive cellular responses influence fungal infection. We observed that the C. neoformans arrestin family contributes to virulence, and that the individual arrestin proteins likely fulfill distinct functions that are important for disease progression.\\n\\nIMPORTANCETo survive in unpredictable conditions, all organisms must adapt to stressors by regulating adaptive cellular responses. Arrestin proteins are conserved regulators of adaptive cellular responses in eukaryotes. Studies that have been limited to mammals and model fungi have demonstrated that disruption of arrestin-regulated pathways is detrimental for viability. The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans causes more than 180,000 infection-related deaths annually, especially among immunocompromised patients. In addition to being genetically-tractable, C. neoformans has a small arrestin family of four members, lending itself to a comprehensive characterization of its arrestin family. This study serves as a functional analysis of arrestins in a pathogen, particularly in the context of fungal fitness and virulence. We investigate the functions of one arrestin protein, Ali1, and define its novel contributions to cytokinesis. We additionally explore the virulence contributions of the C. neoformans arrestin family and find that they contribute to disease establishment and progression.",

Algorithms that can accurately predict the drug-kinase inhibitor constant (pKi) of kinases can considerably accelerate the drug discovery process. In this study, we have developed computational models, leveraging machine learning techniques, to predict ligand-kinase (pKi) values. Kinase-ligand inhibitor constant (Ki) data was retrieved from Drug Target Commons (DTC) and Metz databases. Machine learning models were developed based on structural and physicochemical features of the protein and, topological pharmacophore atomic triplets fingerprints of the ligands. Three machine learning models [random forest (RFR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and artificial neural network (ANN)] were tested for model development. The performance of our models were evaluated using several metrics with 95% confidence interval. RFR model was finally selected based on the evaluation metrics on test datasets and used for web implementation.

    "abstract": "Recent large-scale efforts to characterize functional activity in human have produced thousands of genome-wide experiments that quantify various forms of biochemistry, such as histone modifications, protein binding, transcription, and chromatin accessibility. Although these experiments represent a small fraction of the possible experiments that could be performed, they also make human more comprehensively characterized than any other species. We propose an extension to the imputation approach Avocado that enables the model to leverage genome alignments and the large number of human genomics data sets when making imputations in other species. We found that not only does this extension result in improved imputation of mouse functional experiments, but that the extended model is able to make accurate imputations for protein binding assays that have been performed in human but not in mouse. This ability to make \"zero-shot\" imputations greatly increases the utility of such imputation approaches and enables comprehensive imputations to be made for species even when experimental data are sparse.\n\nCCS CONCEPTS* Computing methodologies [-&gt;] Neural networks; Factorization methods; * Applied computing [-&gt;] Bioinformatics; Genomics.\n\nACM Reference FormatJacob Schreiber, Deepthi Hegde, and William Noble. 2020.

    "abstract": "A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is essential for embryonic development and impacts on diseases such as cancer, Alzheimers and inflammatory diseases. ADAM10 is a  molecular scissor that proteolytically cleaves the extracellular region from over 100 substrates, including Notch, amyloid precursor protein, cadherins, growth factors and chemokines. ADAM10 was recently proposed to function as six distinct scissors with different substrates, depending on its association with one of six regulatory tetraspanins, termed TspanC8s. However, it remains unclear to what degree ADAM10 function is critically dependent on a TspanC8 partner. To address this, we generated the first monoclonal antibodies to Tspan15 as a model TspanC8. These were used to show that ADAM10 is the principal Tspan15-interacting protein, that Tspan15 expression requires ADAM10 in cell lines and primary cells, and that a synthetic ADAM10/Tspan15 fusion protein is a functional scissor. Together these findings suggest that ADAM10 exists as an intimate ADAM10/TspanC8 scissor complex.",

Recently, genetic screens in humans and mouse models have identified mutations in LRP2 as a novel cause of a common arterial trunk, a severe form of outflow tract (OFT) defect. Yet, the underlying mechanism why the morphogen receptor LRP2 is essential for OFT development remained unexplained. Studying LRP2-deficient mouse models, we now show that LRP2 is expressed in the cardiac progenitor niche of the anterior second heart field (SHF) that contributes to elongation of the OFT during separation into aorta and pulmonary trunk. Loss of LRP2 in mutant mice results in depletion of a pool of sonic hedgehog-dependent progenitor cells in the SHF due to premature differentiation into cardiomyocytes as they migrate into the OFT myocardium. Depletion of this cardiac progenitor cell pool results in aberrant shortening of the OFT, the cause of CAT formation in affected mice. Our findings identified the molecular mechanism whereby LRP2 controls maintenance of progenitor cell fate in the anterior SHF essential for OFT separation, and why receptor dysfunction is a novel cause of conotruncal malformation.",

In macroevolution and ecology these metrics are referred to as disparity or dissimilarity metrics and can be generalised as space occupancy metrics. Researchers use these metrics to investigate how space occupancy changes through time, in relation to other groups of organisms, and in response to global environmental changes, such as global warming events or mass extinctions. However, the mathematical and biological meaning of most space occupancy metrics is vague with the majority of widely-used metrics lacking formal description.\\nC_LIO_LIHere we propose a broad classification of space occupancy metrics into three categories that capture changes in volume, density, or position. We analyse the behaviour of 25 metrics to study changes in trait-space volume, density and position on a series of simulated and empirical datasets.\\nC_LIO_LIWe find no one metric describes all of trait-space but that some metrics are better at capturing certain aspects compared to other approaches and that their performance depends on both the trait-space and the hypothesis analysed.

Dynamic causal models of effective connectivity were focused on prefrontal and parietal cortex, where we examined parietal-prefrontal connectivity in relation to delusions in patients. We further tested for an effect of polygenic risk for schizophrenia on connectivity in healthy individuals. We then leveraged support vector regression models to define optimal normalized target connectivity tailored for each patient, and tested the extent to which deviation from this target predicted individual variation in delusion severity.\\n\\nResultsIn schizophrenia patients, updating and manipulating context information was disproportionately less accurate than was WM maintenance, with a task accuracy-by-diagnosis interaction. Also, patients with delusions tended to have relatively reduced feedforward effective connectivity during context updating in WM manipulation. The same parietal-prefrontal feedforward prefrontal effective connectivity was adversely influenced by polygenic risk for schizophrenia in healthy subjects. Individual patients deviation from predicted  normal feedforward connectivity based on the support vector models correlated with delusional severity.\\n\\nConclusionsThese computationally-derived observations support a role for feed-forward parietal-prefrontal information processing deficits in delusional psychopathology, and in genetic risk for schizophrenia.",

However, our understanding of the complement, function and origin of long-non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) response to abiotic stress, especially transposon derived lncRNA (TE-lncRNA), is still in its infancy. To discover and study lncRNAs in maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), we utilized a dataset of 127 RNA sequencing samples that included PacBio fl-cDNA and total RNA-Seq datasets. Overall, we identified 23,309 candidate lncRNAs, 60% of which were identified in polyadenylated (polyA+) samples. The majority (65%) of the 23,309 lncRNAs had sequence similarity to transposable elements (TEs). Most had similarity to long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons from the Copia and Gypsy superfamilies, representing the high proportion of these elements in the genome, but class II, DNA transposons were enriched for lncRNAs relative to their genomic representation by 2-fold. By assessing the fraction of lncRNAs that respond to abiotic stresses like heat, cold, salt and drought, we identified 1,077 differentially expressed lncRNA transcripts. Their expression was correlated (r2=0.48) with their nearest gene, suggesting that lncRNAs are subject to some of the cis regulatory features as neighboring genes. By inferring co-expression networks across our large dataset, we found that 39 lncRNAs act as major hubs in co-expression networks, of which 18 appeared to be derived from TEs. These results suggest that lncRNAs, especially TE-lncRNAs, may play key regulatory roles in moderating abiotic responses.",

To examine mechanisms underlying ALS FUS dysfunction, we generated the first C. elegans knock-in models using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, creating R524S and P525L ALS FUS models. Although FUS inclusions were not detected, ALS FUS animals showed defective neuromuscular function, as well as stress-induced locomotion defects. Unlike C. elegans lacking the endogenous FUS ortholog, ALS FUS animals had impaired neuronal autophagy and increased SQST-1 accumulation in ALS FUS motor neurons. Loss of sqst-1, the C. elegans ortholog for ALS-linked, autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, suppressed both neuromuscular and stress-induced locomotion defects in ALS FUS animals, but did not suppress neuronal autophagy defects. Therefore, autophagy dysfunction is upstream of, and not dependent on, SQSTM1 function in ALS FUS pathogenesis. Combined, our findings demonstrate that autophagy dysfunction likely contributes to protein homeostasis and neuromuscular defects in ALS FUS knock-in animals.",

    "abstract": "Self-organization is a hallmark of all living systems [1]. In particular, coordinated cellular behavior, commonly orchestrated at the population level through reciprocal interactions among different cell species [2-4], regulates the spatial arrangement of specialized cell types to generate tissue patterning and form complex body layouts [5, 6]. The overwhelming complexity of living systems, however, makes deciphering the underlying mechanisms difficult and limits our knowledge of basic pattern-forming mechanism in vivo [7, 8]. A successful strategy is then to work with synthetic, engineered systems, in which cellular interactions can be more easily tailored and studied [9-13]. Here, we demonstrate a simple mechanism through which different populations of cells can self-organize in periodic patterns. Programmed population interactions are shown to lead to coordinated out-ofphase spatial oscillations of two engineered populations of Escherichia coli. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we show how such patterns arise autonomously from reciprocal density-dependent activation of cellular motility between the two species, without the need of any preexisting positional or orientational cues. Moreover, by re-designing the interaction, the original out-of-phase spatial oscillation rhythm of the two populations can be accordingly turned into in-phase oscillations. The robustness and versatility of the underlying pattern-formation process suggest that it could both be generically encountered in nature, for instance in the complex bacterial ecosystems found in biofilms [14-16], and used to promote the mixing or demixing of active particles in a controlled way.",

    "abstract": "ATP at millimolar levels has recently been implicated in the solubilization of cellular proteins. However, the significance of this high ATP level under physiological conditions and the mechanisms that maintain ATP remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adenylate kinase (ADK) cooperated to maintain cellular ATP levels regardless of glucose levels. Single cell imaging of ATP-reduced yeast mutants revealed that ATP levels in these mutants repeatedly underwent stochastic and transient depletion, which induced the cytotoxic aggregation of endogenous proteins and pathogenic proteins, such as huntingtin and -synuclein. Moreover, pharmacological elevations in ATP levels in an ATP-reduced mutant prevented the accumulation of -synuclein aggregates and its cytotoxicity. The removal of cytotoxic aggregates depended on proteasomes, and proteasomal activity cooperated with AMPK or ADK to resist proteotoxic stresses. The present study is the first to demonstrate that cellular ATP homeostasis ensures proteostasis and revealed that suppressing the high volatility of cellular ATP levels prevented cytotoxic protein aggregation, implying that AMPK and ADK are important factors that prevent proteinopathies, such as neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Many neuronal and retinal disorders are associated with pathological hyperpermeability of the microvasculature. We have used explants of rodent retinae to measure and manipulate acute neurovascular permeability and signal transduction to study the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Following stimulation with either vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) or bradykinin (BK), AMPK was rapidly and strongly phosphorylated and acted as a key mediator of permeability downstream of Ca2+ and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CAMKK). Accordingly, AMPK agonists potently induced acute retinal vascular leakage. AMPK activation led to phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which in turn increased VE-cadherin phosphorylation on Y685. In parallel, AMPK also mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and HSP27, indicating that it regulated paracellular junctions and cellular contractility, both previously associated with endothelial permeability. Endothelial AMPK provided a missing link in neurovascular permeability, connecting Ca2+ transients to the activation of eNOS and p38, irrespective of the permeability-inducing factor used. Collectively, the ex-vivo retina model was easily accessible and, due to its compatibility with small molecule antagonists/agonists and siRNA, constitutes a reliable tool to study regulators and mechanism of neurovascular permeability.",

    "abstract": "Many neurological conditions exhibit synaptic impairments, suggesting mechanistic convergence. Additionally, the pannexin 1 (PANX1) channel and signalling scaffold is linked to several of these neurological conditions and is an emerging regulator of synaptic development and plasticity; however, its synaptic pathogenic contributions are relatively unexplored. To this end, we explored connections between synaptic neurodevelopmental disorder and neurodegenerative disease susceptibility genes discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs), and the neural PANX1 interactome (483 PANX1-interacting proteins identified from mouse Neuro2a cells). To identify shared susceptibility genes, we compared synaptic suggestive GWAS candidate genes amongst autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease, and Alzheimers disease. Next, to further probe PANX1 signalling pathways at the synapse, we used bioinformatics tools to identify PANX1 interactome signalling pathways and protein-protein interaction clusters. To shed light on synaptic disease mechanisms potentially linking PANX1 and these four neurological conditions, we performed additional cross-analyses between gene ontologies enriched for the PANX1 synaptic and disease-susceptibility gene sets. Finally, to explore the regional specificity of synaptic PANX1-neurological conditions connections, we identified brain region-specific elevations of synaptic PANX1 interactome and GWAS candidate gene set transcripts. Our results confirm considerable overlap in risk genes for autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia and identify potential commonalities in genetic susceptibility for neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings also pinpointed novel putative PANX1 links to synaptic disease-associated pathways, such as regulation of vesicular trafficking and proteostasis, warranting further validation.",

    "abstract": "Incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis can lead to chromosomal instability, a hallmark of human cancers. Mitotic error correction relies on the kinesin-13 MCAK, a microtubule depolymerase whose activity in vitro is suppressed by -tubulin detyrosination - a post-translational modification enriched on long-lived microtubules. However, whether and how MCAK activity required for mitotic error correction is regulated by microtubule tyrosination/detyrosination remains unknown. Here we found that microtubule detyrosination accumulates on correct, more stable, kinetochore-microtubule attachments, whereas constitutively high microtubule detyrosination near kinetochores compromised efficient error correction. Rescue experiments suggest that mitotic errors due to excessive microtubule detyrosination result from suppression of MCAK activity, without globally affecting kinetochore microtubule half-life. Importantly, MCAK centromeric activity was required and sufficient to rescue mitotic errors due to excessive microtubule detyrosination. Thus, microtubules are not just passive elements during mitotic error correction, and their tyrosination/detyrosination works as a  mitotic error code that allows centromeric MCAK to discriminate correct and incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments, thereby promoting mitotic fidelity.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of various competing cell types in tissues, and the resulting persistent tissue population, is studied numerically and analytically in a particle-based model of active tissues. Mutations change the properties of cells in various ways, including their mechanical properties. Each mutation results in an advantage or disadvantage to grow in the competition between different cell types. While changes in signaling processes and biochemistry play an important role, we focus on changes in the mechanical properties by studying the result of variation of growth force and adhesive cross-interactions between cell types. For independent mutations of growth force and adhesion strength, the tissue evolves towards cell types with high growth force and low internal adhesion strength, as both increase the homeostatic pressure. Motivated by biological evidence, we postulate a coupling between both parameters, such that an increased growth force comes at the cost of a higher internal adhesion strength or vice versa. This tradeoff controls the evolution of the tissue, ranging from unidirectional evolution to very heterogeneous and dynamic populations. The special case of two competing cell types reveals three distinct parameter regimes: Two in which one cell type outcompetes the other, and one in which both cell types coexist in a highly mixed state. Interestingly, a single mutated cell alone suffices to reach the mixed state, while a finite mutation rate affects the results only weakly. Finally, the coupling between changes in growth force and adhesion strength reveals a mechanical explanation for the evolution towards intra-tumor heterogeneity, in which multiple species coexist even under a constant evolutianary pressure.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe evolution of cell populations in growing tissues is due to mutations during cell division, and subsequent competition through various biochemical and mechanical factors. Cancer represents an example of such an evolution on a short time scale. It is a multistep process, where several mutations are needed in order for a tumor to develop and become malignant. Furthermore, cell types in a tumor are often found to be very heterogeneous. We employ computer simulations of a particle-based model of growing tissues to study the competition of various cell types through variations of the mechanical cell properties. Unconstraint evolution drives the tissue towards cell types with stronger growth force and reduced adhesion. However, growth force and adhesion are not independent. Motivated by biologcal evidence, we consider a tissue, where enhanced growth force is coupled to increased adhesion. In a regime around a balanced tradeoff, multiple cell types coexist in a tissue, providing a tentative explanation for tumor heterogeneity. The special case of a competition between two cell types facilitates the study of the underlying competition mechanism. For example, we find that the number fraction of mutated cells is nearly independent of the mutation rate km, as long as km is much smaller than the apoptosis rate ka.",

Our findings provide detailed insight into processes such as cell-cycle switching, migration, symmetry breaking, nurse cell engulfment, egg-shell formation, and signaling during corpus luteum formation, marking a newly identified oogenesis-to-ovulation transition.

    "abstract": "Viruses and their hosts are locked in an evolutionary race where resistance to infection is acquired by the hosts while viruses develop strategies to circumvent these host defenses. Forming one arm of the host defense armory are cell autonomous restriction factors like Fv1. Originally described as protecting laboratory mice from infection by murine leukemia virus (MLV), Fv1s from some wild mice have also been found to restrict non-MLV retroviruses, suggesting an important role in the protection against viruses in nature. To begin to understand how restriction factors evolve, we surveyed the Fv1 genes of wild mice trapped in Thailand and characterized their restriction activities against a panel of retroviruses. An extra copy of the Fv1 gene, named Fv7, was found on chromosome 6 of three closely related Asian species of mice (Mus caroli, M. cervicolor and M. cookii). The presence of flanking repeats suggested it arose by LINE-mediated retrotransposition. A high degree of natural variation was observed in both Fv1 and Fv7, including numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in altered amino acids, as well as insertions and deletions that changed the length of the reading frames. These genes exhibited a range of restriction phenotypes with activities directed against feline foamy virus (FFV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and MLV. It seems likely, at least in the case of M. caroli, that the observed gene duplication confers protection against multiple viruses not possible with a single restriction factor. We suggest that EIAV-, FFV- and MLV-like viruses are endemic within these populations, driving the evolution of the Fv1 and Fv7 genes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDuring the passage of time all vertebrates will be exposed to infection by a variety of different kinds of virus. To meet this threat, a variety of genes for natural resistance to viral infection have evolved. The prototype of such so-called restriction factors is encoded by the mouse Fv1 gene, which acts to block the life cycle of retroviruses at a stage between virus entry into the cell and integration of the viral genetic material into the nuclear DNA. We have studied the evolution of this gene in certain species of wild mice from South East Asia and describe an example where a duplication of the Fv1 gene has taken place. The two copies of the gene, initially identical, have evolved separately allowing the development of resistance to two rather different kinds of retroviruses, lentiviruses and spumaviruses. Independent selection for resistance to these two kinds of retrovirus suggests that such mice are repeatedly exposed to never-before-reported pathogenic retroviruses of these genera.",

    "abstract": "Pericentric heterochromatin in Drosophila is generally composed of repetitive DNA forming a transcriptionally repressive environment. Nevertheless, dozens of genes were embedded into pericentric genome regions during evolution of Drosophilidae lineage and retained functional activity. However, factors that contribute to \\\"immunity\\\" of these gene loci to transcriptional silencing remain unknown. Here, we investigated molecular evolution of the essential Myb and Ranbp16 genes. These protein-coding genes reside in euchromatic loci of chromosome X in D. melanogaster and related species, while in other studied Drosophila species, including evolutionary distant ones, they are located in genomic regions highly enriched with the remnants of transposable elements (TEs), suggesting their heterochromatic nature and location. The promoter region of Myb exhibits a conserved structure throughout the Drosophila phylogeny and carries motifs for binding of chromatin remodeling factors, including insulator BEAF-32, regardless of eu- or heterochromatic surroundings. Importantly, BEAF-32 occupies not only the promoter region of Myb but is also found in the vicinity of transcriptional start sites (TSS) of Ranbp16 gene as well as in a wide range of genes located in the contrasting chromatin types in D. melanogaster and D. virilis, denoting the boundary of the nucleosome-free region available for RNA polymerase II recruitment and the surrounding heterochromatin. We also find that along with BEAF-32, insulators dCTCF and GAF are enriched at the TSS of heterochromatic genes in D. melanogaster. Thus, we propose that insulator proteins contribute to gene expression in the heterochromatic environment and, hence, facilitate the evolutionary repositioning of gene loci into heterochromatin.\\n\\nAuthor summaryHeterochromatin in Drosophila is generally associated with transcriptional silencing. Nevertheless, hundreds of essential genes have been identified in the pericentric heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster.

Here, we have examined the function of egl-43, the homolog of the human Evi1 proto-oncogene (also called MECOM), in the invading AC. egl-43 plays a dual role in this process, firstly by imposing a G1 cell cycle arrest to prevent AC proliferation, and secondly, by activating pro-invasive gene expression.

    "abstract": "To prevent the transmission of damaged genomic material between generations, cells require a system for accommodating DNA repair within their cell cycles. We have previously shown that Escherichia coli cells subject to a single, repairable site-specific DNA double-strand break (DSB) per DNA replication cycle reach a new average cell length, with a negligible effect on population growth rate. We show here that this new cell size distribution is caused by a DSB repair-dependent delay in completion of cell division. This delay occurs despite unperturbed cell size regulated initiation of both chromosomal DNA replication and cell division. Furthermore, despite DSB repair altering the profile of DNA replication across the genome, the time required to complete chromosomal duplication is invariant. The delay in completion of cell division is accompanied by a DSB repair-dependent delay in individualization of sister nucleoids. We suggest that DSB repair events create inter-sister connections that persist until those chromosomes are separated by a closing septum.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe bacterium Escherichia coli has a remarkable cell cycle where overlapping rounds of DNA replication can occur in a single generation between cell birth and division. This implies a complex coordination network between growth, genome duplication and cell division to ensure that the right number of genomes are created and distributed to daughter cells at all growth rates. This network must be robust to a number of unpredictable challenges. One such challenge is broken DNA, something that in E. coli is estimated to occur in ~20% of cell division cycles. In this work we perturb the E. coli cell cycle by elevating the frequency of repairable DNA double-strand breaks to determine which parameters of the cell cycle are conserved and which are changed. Our results demonstrate that this perturbation does not alter the average cell size at initiation of DNA replication or initiation of cell division. Furthermore, it does not alter the time taken to replicate the genome or the generation time. However, it does delay the segregation of the DNA to daughter cells and the completion of cell division explaining the increase in average cell size observed previously.",

    "abstract": "Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of trypanosomes, the causative agents of African animal trypanosomosis or nagana in animals and human African trypanosomosis or sleeping sickness in humans. Tsetse flies are K-strategist species with the deposition of a single larva at 10 days intervals in specific sites. As larviposition site selection will strongly impact reproductive success, it is obvious that the selection of larviposition sites is not random and is under strong selective processes, probably mediated by specific cues as suggested by the existence of an aggregation factor in the Morsitans and Fusca groups. This study aimed to highlight the existence of an aggregation effect in the Palpalis group and to test for its chemical nature. We studied the larviposition site selection of Glossina palpalis gambiensis according to the presence of conspecific and heterospecific larvae buried in substrates in different settings. Three sets of experiments were performed with either individual or grouped (n = 50) gravid females, and with physical access to substrate or not. In both individual and grouped larviposition experiments, females selected significantly more often trays conditioned by larvae (P<0.005), either conspecific or heterospecific even in the absence of physical contact with the substrate. These results highlight the first evidence for larviposition site selection mediated by volatile semiochemicals of larval origin in Glossina palpalis gambiensis. However, these compounds seem not to be species-specific and therefore offer new avenues for the behavioural manipulation of these vectors and for the development of new vector control tools targeting gravid females.\\n\\nAuthor summaryLarviposition site selection in tsetse flies is govern by several biotic and abiotic factors that lead to an aggregation effect of larvae. Among those, larvae are suspected to produce chemicals that drive females to breeding site but little information is available. This study aimed to highlight the existence of an aggregation effect of larval origin in the Palpalis group and to test for its chemical nature. Through behavioural larviposition choice experiments, we showed that females of Glossina palpalis gambiensis deposit their larvae significantly more often in trays conditioned either by conspecific or heterospecific larvae, even in the absence of physical contact with the substrate. These results highlight the first evidence for aggregation effect in Glossina palpalis gambiensis mediated by volatile semiochemicals of larval origin. Isolation and identification of these chemicals should offer new avenues for the behavioural manipulation of these vectors and for the development of new vector control tools targeting gravid females.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe WT1 gene codes for a transcription factor that presents several protein isoforms with diverse biological properties, capable of positively and negatively regulating genes involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. WT1 protein is overexpressed in more than 90% of breast cancer, however, its role during tumor progression is still unknown.\\n\\nMethodologyIn this work were analyzed the expression of WT1 isoforms (36-38 kDa and 52-54 kDa, and 17 AA (+/-) and KTS (+/-)) in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, with the purpose of mimicking the process of switch from a hormone-dependent to a hormone-independent neoplasm, an assay was performed using the MCF-7 cells cultured in long-term estrogen depletion (MCF-7 LTED cells) to determine the WT1 protein isoforms expression by western blot and RT-PCR, and Her2/neu and Estrogen receptor (ER) expression by quantitative RT-PCR assay. Growth kinetics and sensitivity to tamoxifen were performed in the MCF-7 LTED cells by trypan blue exclusion.\\n\\nResultsThe western blot shows the presence of the 52-54 kDa WT1 isoform in the ER (+) breast cancer cells, but not in the ER (-) cells. The 36-38 kDa WT1 isoform was detected in all the breast cancer cell lines analyzed. Using specific primers was found that 17 AA (+) / KTS (-) WT1 isoform was the most frequent in four breast cancer cell lines. During the sampling of the MCF-7 cells in estrogen depletion, an increase in the short-term of 52-54 kDa WT1 isoform was observed and this was kept until week 13, thereafter, its expression was absent; alternately, the 36-38 kDa WT1 isoform was observed from week 1 and it remained constant until week 27. MCF-7 LTED cells growth kinetic decreased 1.4 folds and were not sensitive to tamoxifen antiproliferative effect (p [&le;] 0.05). Finally, were observed an increase of expression of ER and Her2/neu in the MCF-7 LTED cells.\\n\\nConclusionsThe 36-38 kDa WT1 isoform expression occurs during the modifications of the hormonal environment, suggesting that it may be playing an important role in its adaptation and tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "The lateral hypothalamus (LH) regulates eating and motivation, and includes several anatomical subregions. This study explored localization of function across different LH subregions in controlling food intake stimulated by optogenetic channelrhodopsin excitation, and in supporting laser self-stimulation. We particularly compared the tuberal LH, the posterior LH, and the lateral preoptic area. Local diameters of tissue optogenetically stimulated within LH were assessed by measuring laser-induced Fos plumes and Jun plumes via immunofluorescence surrounding optic fiber tips, and were used to map localization of function for effects elicited by LH optogenetic stimulation. Optogenetic stimulation of the tuberal subsection of the LH behaviorally produced the most robust food intake initially, but produced only mild laser self-stimulation in the same rats. However, after repeated exposures to optogenetic stimulation, tuberal LH behavioral profiles shifted toward more self-stimulation and less food intake. By contrast, stimulation of the lateral preoptic area produced relatively little food intake or self-stimulation, either initially or after extended stimulation experience. Stimulation in the posterior LH subregion supported moderate self-stimulation, but not food intake here, and at higher laser intensity shifted valence to evoke escape behaviors. We conclude that the tuberal LH subregion may best mediate increases in food intake stimulated by optogenetic excitation. However, incentive motivational effects of tuberal LH stimulation may shift toward self-stimulation behavior after repeated stimulation. By contrast, the lateral preoptic area and posterior LH do not as readily elicit either eating behavior or laser self-stimulation, and may be more prone to higher-intensity aversive effects.",

    "abstract": "PV+ fast spiking basket interneurons are often implicated in gamma rhythms. Here we focus on mechanisms present in purely inhibitory networks. Neurons with type 1 excitability can fire arbitrarily slowly, whereas those with type 2 excitability cannot fire below a minimum frequency. We systematically examine how excitability type affects synchronization of individual spikes to a population rhythm in the presence of heterogeneity and noise, using model neurons of each type with matched F/I curve, input resistance, time constant and action potential shape. Population synchrony in noisy heterogeneous networks is maintained because neurons either fire within a tight time window or skip that cycle. Type 2 neurons with hyperpolarizing inhibition skip cycles due to their intrinsic dynamics; we show here the cycle skipping mechanism for type 1 neurons or type 2 neurons with shunting inhibition is synaptic and not intrinsic. Type 2 neurons are more resistant than type 1 to partial and complete suppression in networks with hyperpolarizing inhibition that exhibit network gamma. Moreover, type 2 neurons are recruited more rapidly and more completely into theta-nested gamma. In contrast, type 1 networks perform better with shunting inhibition on both counts, because the nonlinear dynamics in that case favor suppression of type 2 compared to type 1 neurons. Conductances that control excitability type may provide a therapeutic target to improve spatial and working memory and other tasks that rely on gamma synchrony or phase amplitude coupling.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe collective, synchronized activity of neurons produces brain rhythms. These rhythms are thought to subserve cognitive functions such as attention and memory encoding and retrieval. Faster rhythms are nested in slower rhythms as a putative way of chunking information. A subset of neurons called fast spiking basket cells tend to inhibit other neurons from firing. These neurons play an important role in oscillations, and in the coupling of faster oscillations to slower ones. In some brain regions these neurons can fire arbitrarily slowly (type 1 dynamics) whereas in others they cannot fire below a minimum cutoff frequency (type 2 dynamics). Mathematically, these distinct origins of rhythmic firing are signatures of very different dynamics. Here, we show that these distinct excitability types affect the ability of networks of these neurons to synchronize their fast oscillatory activity, as well as the ability of slower oscillations to modulate these fast oscillations. The exact nature of the inhibitory coupling, which may vary between brain regions, determines which type synchronizes better and is modulated better.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that studies the relationship between PRP and endometriosis. Endometriosis foci were created in the first operation. In the second operation (30th day) groups were formed. Group 1 (n= 8) was administered saline, group 2 (n= 7) leukocyte- and platelet-rich plasma (L-PRP), and group 3 (n= 8) pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP). Group 4 (n= 10) was used to obtain PRP. In the last operation (60th day), the endometriotic foci were measured, and then excised. There was no statistically significant difference between the pre and post volumes of the endometriotic foci, between their volume differences and volume difference rates (p > .05). However, it was observed that existing implant volumes in all groups decreased statistically significantly within their own groups by the end of the experiment compared to the previous volumes (p < .05). When the implants were assessed through histopathological scoring in terms of edema, vascular congestion, inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, epithelial line, and hemosiderin accumulation and immunohistochemical staining in terms of VEGF, there was no significant difference in the comparison between the groups. Although L-PRP and P-PRP generated more reduction in the endometriosis foci, they did not create any statistical differences.",

    "abstract": "The biofilm of bacteria plays an important role in antibiotic resistance and chronic infection. Thus, in order to solve the problem of resistant bacteria, it is very important to find new drugs that can inhibit the formation of biofilms. In recent years, researchers have shifted their attention to natural products. As a flavonoid, rutin has been reported to have a variety of biological activities, interestingly, in this study, the inhibitory effect of rutin on the biofilm of Staphylococcus xylosus was investigated. We confirmed that rutin could effectively inhibit the biofilm formation of S. xylosus, then, for the sake of discussion on how it interferes with the biofilm formation, the interaction between rutin and imidazolyl phosphate dehydratase (IGPD) which has been identified as the key enzyme that plays a vital role in the process of biofilm formation was analyzed by molecular docking, the results showed that rutin had a strong affinity with IGPD, it occupied the hydrophobic cavity of the active center forming four hydrogen bonds and many other interactions. In addition, we proved that rutin was able to combine with IGPD using SPR technique. Therefore, we determined the enzyme activity and histidine content of IGPD, the result indicated that rutin could simultaneously inhibit the activity of IGPD and abrogate the synthesis of histidine. Interestingly, the hisB gene encoding for IGPD and IGPD in S. xylosus were also significantly inhibited when the bacterial culture was treated with rutin. Taken together, the results have provided evidence that rutin is a natural drug that has the ability to interfere with the formation of biofilm in S. xylosus. It is therefore a potential enzyme inhibitor of IGPD.\n\nAuthors SummaryStaphylococcus xylosus has been isolated from a variety of infections, and the biofilm formed by S. xylosus can help the bacteria evade the immune system of the host and cause chronic infections. Here, we dealt with this menace by establishing a highly effective drug with the ability to interfere with the process involved in the formation of biofilm in S. xylosus. IGPD has been reported to be directly involved in the formation of biofilm in Staphylococcus xylosus and it is known to be present in a variety of microorganisms. Based on this study, we developed a drug therapy targeting IGPD and at the same time interfere with the formation of biofilm in S. xylosus",

While receiving tonic cold pain, 20 healthy participants were asked to utilise three different pain attenuation strategies.

We related the trial-by-trial variability of the attenuation performance to the trial-by-trial functional connectivity of the cortical data.\n\nAcross all conditions, we found that a higher performance of pain attenuation was predominantly associated with higher functional connectivity. Of note, we observed an association between low pain and high connectivity for regions that belong to the core areas of pain processing, i.e. the insular and cingulate cortices. For one of the cognitive strategies (safe place), the performance of pain attenuation was explained by diffusion tensor imaging metrics of increased white matter integrity.\n\nImpact StatementIn a single trial analysis, the more effective attempts to attenuate pain in three different conditions are associated with general higher functional connectivity across the entire brain.",

    "abstract": "Single-molecule force spectroscopy has brought many new insights into nanoscale biology, from the functioning of molecular motors, to the mechanical response of soft materials within the cell. To expand the single-molecule toolbox, we have developed a surface-free force spectroscopy assay based on a high-speed hydrodynamic trap capable of applying extremely high tensions for long periods of time. High-speed single-molecule trapping is enabled by a rigid and gas-impermeable microfluidic chip, rapidly and inexpensively fabricated out of glass, double-sided tape and UV-curable adhesive. Our approach does not require difficult covalent attachment chemistries, and enables simultaneous force application and single-molecule fluorescence. Using this approach, we have induced a highly extended state with twice the contour length of B-DNA in regions of partially intercalated double-stranded (dsDNA) by applying forces up to 250 pN. This highly extended state resembles the hyperstretched state of dsDNA, which was initially discovered as a structure fully intercalated by dyes under high tension. It has been hypothesized that hyperstretched DNA could also be induced without the aid of intercalators if high-enough forces were applied, which matches our observation. Combining force application with single-molecule fluorescence imaging is critical for distinguishing hyperstretched DNA from single-stranded DNA that can result from peeling. High-speed hydrodynamic trapping is a powerful yet accessible force spectroscopy method that enables the mechanics of biomolecules to be probed in previously difficult to access regimes.",

    "abstract": "Populations of genetically identical cells generally show a large variability in cell phenotypes, which is typically associated with the stochastic nature of gene expression processes. It is widely believed that a significant source of such randomness is the transcriptional bursting, which is when periods of active production of RNA molecules alternate with periods of RNA degradation. However, the molecular mechanisms of such strong fluctuations remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that DNA supercoiling, which happens during transcription, might be directly related to the bursting behavior. Stimulated by these observations, we developed a stochastic mechano-chemical model of supercoiling-induced transcriptional bursting where the RNA synthesis leads to the buildup of torsion in DNA. This slows down the RNA production until binding of an enzyme gyrase to DNA, which releases the stress and allows for the RNA synthesis to restart with the original rate. Using a thermodynamically consistent coupling between mechanical and chemical processes, dynamic properties of transcription are explicitly evaluated. In addition, a first-passage method to evaluate the dynamics of transcription is developed. Theoretical analysis shows that the transcriptional bursting is observed when both the supercoiling and the mechanical stress-release due to gyrase are present in the system. It is also found that the overall RNA production rate is not constant and depends on the number of previously synthesized RNA molecules. A comparison with experimental data on bacteria allows us to evaluate the energetic cost of supercoiling during transcription. It is argued that the relatively weak mechanochemical coupling allows transcription to be regulated most effectively.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCETranscriptional bursting has been cited as one of the probable causes of phenotypic differences in cells with identical genomes. However, the microscopic origin of noisy dynamics in RNA production remains unclear. We developed a thermodynamically-consistent mechano-chemical stochastic model, which, via explicit calculations of dynamic properties, provides a consistent physical-chemical description of how the supercoiling of DNA together with enzymatic activity of gyrases produce transcriptional bursting. It also allows us to explain that the coupling between mechanical and chemical processes might be the reason for efficient regulation of transcription.",

    "abstract": "Poor bioavailability due to the inability to cross the cell membrane is one of the major reasons for the failure of a drug in the clinical trials. We have used molecular dynamics simulations to predict the membrane permeability of natural drugs - withanolides (withaferin-A and withanone) that have similar structures but remarkably differ in their cytotoxicity. We found that withaferin-A, but not withanone, could proficiently transverse through the model membrane. The free energy profiles obtained were in accordance with the physico-chemical properties of the investigated drug molecules. It was observed that the polar head group of the bilayer exhibits high resistance for the passage of withanone as compared to withaferin-A, while the interior of the membrane behaves similarly for both withanolides. The solvation analysis revealed that the high solvation of terminal O5 oxygen of withaferin-A was the major driving force. The impact of the favorable interaction of terminal oxygen (O5) of withaferin-A with the phosphate of the membrane led to its smooth passage across the bilayer. The computational predictions were validated by raising and recruiting unique antibodies that react to withaferin-A and withanone. Further, the time-lapsed analyses of control and treated human normal and cancer cells, demonstrated proficient permeation of withaferin-A, but not withanone, through normal cells. These data strongly validated our computational method for predicting permeability and hence bioavailability of candidate compounds in the drug development process.\\n\\nStatement of significanceWhat determines the bioavailability of a drug? Does the ability to cross cell membrane determine this? A combined simulation/experimental study of the permeability of two natural drugs - withanolides (Wi-A and Wi-N) across the cell membrane was conducted. In the computational portion of the study, steered MD simulations were performed to investigate the propensity of the two molecules to permeate across the cell. It is found that Wi-A proceeds relatively simply across the cell compared to Wi-N. This trend was found to be consistent with experiment. This work is an important step towards understanding the molecular basis of permeability of natural drug molecules.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is the most expensive process in fast-growing bacteria1,2. The economic aspects of protein synthesis at the cellular level have been investigated by estimating ribosome activity3-5 and the expression of ribosomes3,6, tRNA7-9, mRNA2, and elongation factors10,11. The observed growth-rate dependencies form the basis of powerful phenomenological bacterial growth laws5,12-16; however, a quantitative theory allowing us to understand these phenomena on the basis of fundamental biophysical and biochemical principles is currently lacking. Here, we show that the observed growth-rate dependence of the concentrations of ribosomes, tRNAs, mRNA, and elongation factors in Escherichia coli can be predicted accurately by minimizing cellular costs in a detailed mathematical model of protein translation; the mechanistic model is only constrained by the physicochemical properties of the molecules and requires no parameter fitting. We approximate the costs of molecule species through their masses, justified by the observation that cellular dry mass per volume is roughly constant across growth rates17 and hence represents a limited resource. Our results also account quantitatively for observed RNA/protein ratios and ribosome activities in E. coli across diverse growth conditions, including antibiotic stresses. Our prediction of active and free ribosome abundance facilitates an estimate of the deactivated ribosome reserve14,18,19, which reaches almost 50% at the lowest growth rates. We conclude that the growth rate dependent composition of E colis protein synthesis machinery is a consequence of natural selection for minimal total cost under physicochemical constraints, a paradigm that might generally be applied to the analysis of resource allocation in complex biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States by 2020, due in part to innate resistance to widely used chemotherapeutic agents and limited knowledge about key molecular factors that drive tumor aggression. We previously reported a novel negative prognostic biomarker, keratin 17 (K17), whose overexpression in cancer results in shortened patient survival. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictive value of K17 and explore the therapeutic vulnerability in K17-expressing PDAC, using an unbiased high-throughput drug screen. Patient-derived data analysis showed that K17 expression correlates with resistance to Gemcitabine (Gem). In multiple in vitro models of PDAC, spanning human and murine PDAC cells, we determined that the expression of K17 results in a more than two-fold increase in resistance to Gem and 5-fluorouracil, key components of current standard-of-care chemotherapeutic regimens. Furthermore, through an unbiased drug screen, we discovered that Podophyllotoxin (PPT), a microtubule inhibitor, showed at least two-fold higher sensitivity in K17-expressing compared to K17-negative PDAC cells. In the clinic, another microtubule inhibitor, Paclitaxel (PTX), is used in combination with Gem as a first line chemotherapeutic regimen for pancreatic, breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. Surprisingly, we found that when combined with Gem, PPT but not PTX, was synergistic in inhibiting the viability of K17-expressing PDAC cells. This provides evidence that PPT or its derivatives could potentially be combined with Gem to enhance treatment efficacy for the approximately 50% of PDACs that express high levels of K17. In summary, we reported that K17 is a novel target for developing a biomarker-based personalized treatment for PDAC.",
