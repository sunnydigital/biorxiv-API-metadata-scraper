    "abstract": "One view is that conceptual knowledge is organized using the circuitry in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) that supports spatial processing and navigation. In contrast, we find that a domain-general learning algorithm explains key findings in both spatial and conceptual domains. When the clustering model is applied to spatial navigation tasks, so called place and grid cell-like representations emerge because of the relatively uniform distribution of possible inputs in these tasks. The same mechanism applied to conceptual tasks, where the overall space can be higher-dimensional and sampling sparser, leads to representations more aligned with human conceptual knowledge. Although the types of memory supported by the MTL are superficially dissimilar, the information processing steps appear shared. Our account suggests that the MTL uses a general-purpose algorithm to learn and organize context-relevant information in a useful format, rather than relying on navigation-specific neural circuitry.",

    "abstract": "We earlier reported cytoplasmic fluorescence exchange between cultured human fibroblasts (Fib) and malignant cells (MC). Others report similar transfer via either tunneling nanotubes (TNT) or shed membrane vesicles and this changes the phenotype of recipient cells. Our current time-lapse microscopy showed most exchange was from Fib into MC, with less in the reverse direction. Although TNT were seen, we were surprised transfer was not via TNT, but was instead via fine and often branching cell projections that defied direct visual resolution because of their size and rapid movement. Their structure was revealed nonetheless, by their organellar cargo and the grooves they formed indenting MC, while this was consistent with holotomography. Discrete, rapid and highly localized transfer events, evidenced against a role for shed vesicles. Transfer coincided with rapid retraction of the cell-projections, suggesting a hydrodynamic mechanism. Increased hydrodynamic pressure in retracting cell-projections normally returns cytoplasm to the cell body. We hypothesize  cell-projection pumping (CPP), where cytoplasm in retracting cell-projections partially equilibrates into adjacent recipient cells via micro-fusions that form temporary inter-cellular cytoplasmic continuities. We tested plausibility for CPP by combined mathematical modelling, comparison of predictions from the model with experimental results, and then computer simulations based on experimental data. The mathematical model predicted preferential CPP into cells with lower cell stiffness, expected from equilibration of pressure towards least resistance. Predictions from the model were satisfied when Fib were co-cultured with MC, and fluorescence exchange related with cell stiffness by atomic force microscopy. When transfer into 5000 simulated recipient MC or Fib was studied in computer simulations, inputting experimental cell stiffness and donor cell fluorescence values generated transfers to simulated recipient cells similar to those seen by experiment. We propose CPP as a potentially novel mechanism in mammalian inter-cellular cytoplasmic transfer and communication.\n\nSIGNIFICANCETime-lapse observations of co-cultured cells led us to hypothesize what we believe to be a novel hydrodynamic mechanism transferring cytoplasm between cells. Similar transfer by other mechanisms markedly affects cell behavior. Combined mathematical modelling, satisfaction of predictions from the mathematical model in cell culture experiments, and separate computer simulations that generate outcomes similar to experimental observations, support our hypothesized mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophil infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) after injury is associated with cognitive deficits. Using a murine model of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), we elucidate the location and mode of action of neutrophils in the CNS. Following SAH, neutrophils infiltrate the meninges, and not the brain parenchyma. Mice lacking functional myeloperoxidase (MPO KO), a neutrophil enzyme, lack both the meningeal neutrophil infiltration and the cognitive deficits associated with delayed cerebral injury from SAH. The re-introduction of biologically active MPO, and its substrate hydrogen peroxide, to the cerebrospinal fluid of MPO KO mice at the time of hemorrhage restores the spatial memory deficit observed after SAH. This implicates MPO as a mediator of neuronal dysfunction in SAH. Using primary neuronal and astrocyte cultures, we demonstrate that MPO directly affects the function of both cell types. Neurons exposed to MPO and its substrate show decreased calcium activity at baseline and after stimulation with potassium chloride. In addition, MPO and its substrate lead to significant astrocyte loss in culture, a result observed in the brain after SAH as well. These results show that, in SAH, the activity of innate immune cells in the meninges modulates the activity and function of the underlying brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations are early drivers of tumorigenesis and tumor progression. However, the mutations typically occur at variable positions across different individuals, resulting in the data being too sparse to test meaningful associations between variants and phenotypes. To overcome this challenge, we devised a novel approach called Gene-to-Protein-to-Disease (GPD) which accumulates variants into new sequence units as the degree of genetic assault on structural or functional units of each protein. The variant frequencies in the sequence units were highly reproducible between two large cancer cohorts. Survival analysis identified 247 sequence units in which somatic mutations had deleterious effects on overall survival, including consensus driver mutations obtained from multiple calling algorithms. By contrast, around 75% of the survival predictive units had been undetected by conventional gene-level analysis. We demonstrate the ability of these signatures to separate patient groups according to overall survival, therefore providing novel prognostic tools for various cancers. GPD also identified sequence units with somatic mutations whose impact on survival was modified by the occupancy of germline variants in the surrounding regions. The findings indicate that a patients genetic predisposition interacts with the effect of somatic mutations on survival outcome in some cancers.",

Here, we report physiological optical tagging sequencing (PhOTseq), a technique for tagging and expression-profiling cells based on their functional properties. We demonstrate that PhOTseq is capable of selecting rare cell types and enriching them by nearly one hundred-fold. We applied PhOTseq to the challenge of mapping receptor-ligand pairings among vomeronasal pheromone-sensing neurons in mice. Together with in vivo ectopic expression of vomeronasal chemoreceptors, PhOTseq identified the complete combinatorial receptor code for a specific set of ligands, and revealed that the primary sequence of a chemoreceptor was an unexpectedly strong predictor of functional similarity.",

    "abstract": "Spatial heterogeneity is a fundamental feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and tackling spatial heterogeneity in neoplastic metabolic aberrations is critical for tumor treatment. Genome-scale metabolic network models have been used successfully to simulate cancer metabolic networks. However, most models use bulk gene expression data of entire tumor biopsies, ignoring spatial heterogeneity in the TME. To account for spatial heterogeneity, we performed spatially-resolved metabolic network modeling of the prostate cancer microenvironment. We discovered novel malignant-cell-specific metabolic vulnerabilities targetable by small molecule compounds. We predicted that inhibiting the fatty acid desaturase SCD1 may selectively kill cancer cells based on our discovery of spatial separation of fatty acid synthesis and desaturation. We also uncovered higher prostaglandin metabolic gene expression in the tumor, relative to the surrounding tissue. Therefore, we predicted that inhibiting the prostaglandin transporter SLCO2A1 may selectively kill cancer cells. Importantly, SCD1 and SLCO2A1 have been previously shown to be potently and selectively inhibited by compounds such as CAY10566 and suramin, respectively. We also uncovered cancer-selective metabolic liabilities in central carbon, amino acid, and lipid metabolism. Our novel cancer-specific predictions provide new opportunities to develop selective drug targets for prostate cancer and other cancers where spatial transcriptomics datasets are available.",

It has a topographic frequency spectral distribution that is, quite similar for both modalities--something not surprising since both EEG and MEG are generated by the same basic oscillations in thalamocortical circuitry. However, different physical aspects underpin the two types of signals. Does this difference lead to a different distribution of reconstructed sources for EEG and MEG rhythms? This question is important for the transferal of results from one modality to the other but has surprisingly received scant attention till now. We address this issue by comparing eyes open EEG source spectra recorded from 70 subjects from the Cuban Human Brain Mapping project with the MEG of 70 subjects from the Human Connectome Project. Source spectra for each voxel and frequencies between 0-50Hz with 100 frequency points were obtained via a novel sparse-covariance inverse method (BC-VARETA) based on individualized BEM head models with subject-specific regularization parameters (noise to signal ratio). We performed a univariate permutation-based rank test among sources of both modalities and found out no differences. To carry out an unbiased comparison we computed sources from eLORETA and LCMV, performed the same permutation-based comparison, and found the same results we got with BC-VARETA.",

    "abstract": "Across sensory areas, neural microcircuits consolidate diverse streams of information into unified, representations of the external world. In the carnivore visual cortex, where eye-specific inputs converge, it has been posited that a single, shared columnar representation of orientation develops independent of sensory experience. In this study, in vivo calcium imaging with columnar and cellular resolution reveals a strikingly different developmental process in ferret visual cortex, starting with an early developmental period in which contralateral, ipsilateral or binocular stimulation each yield distinct well-organized representations of orientation that are misaligned at the columnar and cellular scale. Experience-dependent processes drive the reorganization of these three representations towards a single binocularly-aligned representation resembling the early binocular representation through concerted shifts in the preferred orientation of individual neurons. Thus, contrary to previous findings, a unified binocular representation of orientation results from an experience-dependent process that aligns the activity patterns of three distinct neural representations.",

Periodic response to a questionnaire is also obtained. The goal is to determine combinations of modalities that best serve as predictors of task performance.\\n\\nApproachA group of participants performed a computer-based visual search task mimicking postal code sorting. A five-digit number had to be assigned to one of six different non-overlapping numeric ranges. Trials were presented in blocks of progressively increasing task difficulty. The participants responses were collected simultaneously with 32 channels of electroencephalography (EEG) data, eye-tracking data, and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data. The NASA Task-Load-Index self-reporting instrument was administered at discrete time points in the experiment.\\n\\nMain resultsLow beta frequency EEG waves (12.5-18 Hz) were more prominent as cognitive task load increased, with most activity in frontal and parietal regions. These were accompanied by more frequent eye blinks and increased pupillary dilation. Blink duration correlated strongly with task performance. Phasic components of the GSR signal were related to cognitive workload, whereas tonic components indicated a more general state of arousal. Subjective data (NASA TLX) as reported by the participants showed an increase in frustration and mental workload. Based on one-way ANOVA, EEG and GSR provided the most reliable correlation to perceived workload level and were the most informative measures (taken together) for performance prediction.\\n\\nSignificanceNumerous modalities come into play during task-related activity. Many of these modalities can provide information on task performance when appropriately grouped. This study suggests that while EEG is a good predictor of task performance, additional modalities such as GSR increase the likelihood of more accurate predictions. Further, in controlled laboratory conditions, the most informative or minimum number of modalities can be isolated for monitoring in real work environments.",

    "abstract": "A defining feature of eukaryotic cells is the presence of numerous membrane-bound organelles that subdivide the intracellular space into distinct compartments. How the eukaryotic cell acquired its internal complexity is still poorly understood. Material exchange among most organelles occurs via vesicles that bud off from a source and specifically fuse with a target compartment. Central players in the vesicle fusion process are the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) proteins. These small tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins zipper into elongated four-helix bundles that pull membranes together1-3. SNARE proteins are highly conserved among eukaryotes but are thought to be absent in prokaryotes. Here, we identified SNARE-like factors in the genomes of uncultured organisms of Asgard archaea of the Heimdallarchaeota clade4,5, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of eukaryotes. Biochemical experiments show that the archaeal SNARE-like proteins can interact with eukaryotic SNARE proteins. We did not detect SNAREs in -proteobacteria, the closest relatives of mitochondria, but identified several genes encoding for SNARE proteins in {gamma}-proteobacteria of the order Legionellales, pathogens that live inside eukaryotic cells. Very probably, their SNAREs stem from lateral gene transfer from eukaryotes. Together, this suggests that the diverse set of eukaryotic SNAREs evolved from an archaeal precursor. However, whether Heimdallarchaeota actually have a simplified endomembrane system will only be seen when we succeed studying these organisms under the microscope.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) cause Rett syndrome (RTT). We carried out a genetic screen for secondary mutations that improved phenotypes in Mecp2/Y mice after mutagenesis with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), aiming to identify potential therapeutic entry points. Here we report the isolation of 106 founder animals that show suppression of Mecp2-null traits from screening 3,177 Mecp2/Y genomes. Using exome sequencing, genetic crosses and association analysis, we identify 33 candidate genes in 30 of the suppressor lines. A network analysis shows that 61% of the candidate genes cluster into the functional categories of transcriptional repression, chromatin modification or DNA repair, delineating a pathway relationship with MECP2. Many mutations lie in genes that are predicted to modulate synaptic signaling or lipid homeostasis. Surprisingly, mutations in genes that function in the DNA damage response (DDR) also improve symptoms in Mecp2/Y mice. The combinatorial effects of multiple loci can be resolved by employing association analysis. One line, which was previously reported to carry a suppressor mutation in a gene required for cholesterol synthesis, Sqle, carries a second mutation in retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (Rbbp8 or CtIP), which regulates a DDR choice in double stranded break (DSB) repair. Cells from Mecp2/Y mice have increased DSBs, so this finding suggests that the balance between homology directed repair and non-homologous end joining is important for neuronal cells. In this and other lines, the presence of two suppressor mutations confers better symptom improvement than one locus alone, suggesting that combination therapies could be effective in RTT.",

    "abstract": "Large-conductance voltage and calcium activated channels, KCa1.1, have a large single conductance (~p250) and are highly selective for potassium ions. As a result they have been termed big potassium channels (BK channels). Because of the channels ability to integrate multiple physical and chemical signals they have received much attention in excitable cells. In comparison they have received relatively little attention in non-excitable cells in those of the immune system. Here we report evidence that the BK channel regulates ADAM17 activity. Upon macrophage activation, BK channels translocate to the cell membrane. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the cell membrane BK channels resulted in elevated TNF- release and increased metalloproteinase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17 (ADAM17) activity. Inhibitors of BK channels also increased IL-6R release, a second ADAM17 substrate. In comparison, a BK channel opener decreases TNF- release. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which ion channel regulates ADAM17 activity. Given the broad range of ADAM17 substrates, this finding has implications in many fields of cell biology including immunology, neurology and cancer biology.",
