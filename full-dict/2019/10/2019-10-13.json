    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by enlargement of the ventricular muscle without dilation and is often associated with dominant pathogenic variants in cardiac sarcomeric protein genes. Here, we report a family with two infants diagnosed with infantile-onset HCM and mitral valve dysplasia that led to death before one year of age. Using exome sequencing, we discovered that one of the affected children had a homozygous frameshift variant in Myosin light chain 2 (MYL2:NM_000432.3:c.431_432delCT: p.Pro144Argfs*57;MYL2-fs), which alters the last 20 amino acids of the protein and is predicted to impact the C-terminal EF-hand (CEF) domain. The parents are unaffected heterozygous carriers of the variant and the variant is absent in control cohorts from gnomAD. The absence of the phenotype in carriers and infantile presentation of severe HCM is in contrast to HCM associated with dominant MYL2 variants. Immunohistochemical analysis of the ventricular muscle of the deceased patient with the MYL2-fs variant showed marked reduction of MYL2 expression compared to an unaffected control. In vitro overexpression studies further indicate that the MYL2-fs variant is actively degraded. In contrast, an HCM-associated missense variant (MYL2:p.Gly162Arg) and three other MYL2 stopgain variants that lead to loss of the CEF domain are stably expressed. However, stopgain variants show impaired localization suggesting a functional role for the CEF domain. The degradation of the MYL2-fs can be rescued by inhibiting the cells proteasome function supporting a post-translational effect of the variant. In vivo rescue experiments with a Drosophila MYL2-homolog (Mlc2) knockdown model indicate that neither MYL2-fs nor MYL2:p.Gly162Arg supports regular cardiac function. The tools that we have generated provide a rapid screening platform for functional assessment of variants of unknown significance in MYL2. Our study supports an autosomal recessive model of inheritance for MYL2 loss-of-function variants and highlights the variant-specific molecular differences found in MYL2-associated cardiomyopathies.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe report a novel frameshift variant in MYL2 that is associated with a severe form of infantile-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The impact of the variant is only observed in the recessive form of the disease in the proband and not in the parents who are carriers of the variant. This is in contrast to other dominant variants in MYL2 that are associated with cardiomyopathies. We compared the stability of this variant to that of other cardiomyopathy associated MYL2 variants and found molecular differences in the disease pathology. We also show different protein domain requirement for stability and localization of MYL2 in cardiomyocytes. Further, we used a fly model to demonstrate functional deficits due to the variant in the developing heart. Overall, our study shows a molecular mechanism by which loss-of-function variants in MYL2 are recessive while missense variants are dominant. We highlight the use of exome sequencing and functional testing to assist in the diagnosis of rare forms of diseases where pathogenicity of the variant is not obvious. The new tools we developed for in vitro functional study and the fly fluorescent reporter analysis will permit rapid analysis of MYL2 variants of unknown significance.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of neural tracking of natural running speech from the electroencephalogram (EEG) is an increasingly popular method in auditory neuroscience and has applications in audiology. The method involves decoding the envelope of the speech signal from the EEG signal, and calculating the correlation with the envelope of the audio stream that was presented to the subject. Typically EEG systems with 64 or more electrodes are used. However, in practical applications, set-ups with fewer electrodes are required. Here, we determine the optimal number of electrodes, and the best position to place a limited number of electrodes on the scalp. We propose a channel selection strategy based on an utility metric, which allows a quick quantitative assessment of the influence of a channel (or a group of channels) on the reconstruction error. We consider two use cases: a subject-specific case, where the optimal number and position of the electrodes is determined for each subject individually, and a subject-independent case, where the electrodes are placed at the same positions (in the 10-20 system) for all the subjects. We evaluated our approach using 64-channel EEG data from 90 subjects. In the subject-specific case we found that the correlation between actual and reconstructed envelope first increased with decreasing number of electrodes, with an optimum at around 20 electrodes, yielding 29% higher correlations using the optimal number of electrodes compared to all electrodes. This means that our strategy of removing electrodes can be used to improve the correlation metric in high-density EEG recordings. In the subject-independent case, we obtained a stable decoding performance when decreasing from 64 to 22 channels. When the number of channels was further decreased, the correlation decreased. For a maximal decrease in correlation of 10%, 32 well-placed electrodes were sufficient in 91% of the subjects.",

However, efficient storage, querying and visualization of such large datasets remain challenging. Here, we developed a comprehensive Bovine Genome Variation Database (BGVD, http://animal.nwsuaf.edu.cn/BosVar) that provides six main functionalities: Gene Search, Variation Search, Genomic Signature Search, Genome Browser, Alignment Search Tools and the Genome Coordinate Conversion Tool. The BGVD contains information on genomic variations comprising [~]60.44 M SNPs, [~]6.86 M indels, 76,634 CNV regions and signatures of selective sweeps in 432 samples from modern cattle worldwide. Users can quickly retrieve distribution patterns of these variations for 54 cattle breeds through an interactive source of breed origin map using a given gene symbol or genomic region for any of the three versions of the bovine reference genomes (ARS-UCD1.2, UMD3.1.1, and Btau 5.0.1). Signals of selection are displayed as Manhattan plots and Genome Browser tracks. To further investigate and visualize the relationships between variants and signatures of selection, the Genome Browser integrates all variations, selection data and resources from NCBI, the UCSC Genome Browser and AnimalQTLdb.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe gene content of a species largely governs its ecological interactions and adaptive potential. A species is therefore defined by both core genes shared between all individuals and accessory genes segregating presence-absence variation. There is growing evidence that eukaryotes, similar to bacteria, show intra-specific variability in gene content. However, it remains largely unknown how functionally relevant such a pangenome structure is for eukaryotes and what mechanisms underlie the emergence of highly polymorphic genome structures.\n\nResultsHere, we establish a reference-quality pangenome of a fungal pathogen of wheat based on 19 complete genomes from isolates sampled across six continents. Zymoseptoria tritici causes substantial worldwide losses to wheat production due to rapidly evolved tolerance to fungicides and evasion of host resistance. We performed transcriptome-assisted annotations of each genome to construct a global pangenome. Major chromosomal rearrangements are segregating within the species and underlie extensive gene presence-absence variation. Conserved orthogroups account for only [~]60% of the species pangenome. Investigating gene functions, we find that the accessory genome is enriched for pathogenesis-related functions and encodes genes involved in metabolite production, host tissue degradation and manipulation of the immune system. De novo transposon annotation of the 19 complete genomes shows that the highly diverse chromosomal structure is tightly associated with transposable elements content. Furthermore, transposable element expansions likely underlie recent genome expansions within the species.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, our work establishes a highly complex eukaryotic pangenome providing an unprecedented toolbox to study how pangenome structure impacts crop-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "Otitis media (OM) is the most common paediatric disease and leads to significant morbidity. Although understanding of underlying disease mechanisms is hampered by complex pathophysiology, it is clear that epithelial abnormalities underpin the disease. The mechanisms underpinning epithelial remodelling in OM remain unclear. We recently described a novel in vitro model of mouse middle ear epithelial cells (mMEECs) that undergoes mucociliary differentiation into the varied epithelial cell populations seen in the middle ear cavity. We now describe genome wide gene expression profiles of mMEECs as they undergo differentiation. We compared the gene expression profiles of original (uncultured) middle ear cells, confluent cultures of undifferentiated cells (day 0 of ALI) and cells that had been differentiated for 7 days at an ALI. >5000 genes were differentially expressed among the three groups of cells. Approximately 4000 genes were differentially expressed between the original cells and day 0 of ALI culture. The original cell population was shown to contain a mix of cell types, including contaminating inflammatory cells that were lost on culture. Approximately 500 genes were upregulated during ALI induced differentiation. These included some secretory genes and some enzymes but most were associated with the process of ciliogenesis. Our in vitro model of differentiated murine middle ear epithelium exhibits a transcriptional profile consistent with the mucociliary epithelium seen within the middle ear. Knowledge of the transcriptional landscape of this epithelium will provide a basis for understanding the phenotypic changes seen in murine models of OM.",

    "abstract": "Riboswitches are cis-acting RNA regulatory elements that control expression of a downstream gene(s) by directly binding to a specific metabolite. Here we report a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-I riboswitch in the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) that plays an additional regulatory role as a trans small noncoding RNA (sRNA) targeting the methionine biosynthesis cycle transcriptional regulator SahR. Sequence and expression analyses indicated that DseA (Desulfovibrio SAM element A) is located upstream of a small hypothetical protein DVU1170 and that the two are co-transcribed. Multiple techniques were used to verify the riboswitch activity of DseA and its activity as a transcriptional terminator in response to SAM. While determining a potential role for DseA in the methionine biosynthesis pathway, a mRNA target encoding SahR was identified. Subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the ability of DseA to bind the sahR transcript and qRT-PCR analysis of a DseA deletion strain suggested a negative regulatory role. This study presents the first regulatory role for a newly discovered sRNA in Desulfovibrio. Additionally, this study suggests that DseA acts not only as a riboswitch, but also as a trans regulatory molecule.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are important contributors to global geochemical cycles while also causing major issues for the petroleum and oil industry due to biocorrosion and souring of oil wells. Despite their significance, gene regulatory networks and pathways remain poorly understood in SRB.

We report the comprehensive characterization of transcriptomes (bulk and single-cell) and chromatin domains regulated by sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1) in adult mouse aortic endothelial cells. First, S1PR1 regulates NFkB and nuclear glucocorticoid receptor pathways to suppress inflammation-related mRNAs. Second, spatially distinct S1PR1 signaling in the aorta is associated with heterogenous endothelial cell (EC) subtypes. For example, a transcriptomically distinct arterial EC population at vascular branch points (aEC1) exhibits ligand- independent S1PR1/{beta}-arrestin coupling. In contrast, circulatory S1P-dependent S1PR1/{beta}-arrestin coupling was observed in non-branch point aEC2 cells that exhibit an inflammatory signature. Moreover, an adventitial lymphatic EC (LEC) population shows suppression of lymphangiogenic and inflammation-related transcripts in a S1P/S1PR1-dependent manner. These insights add resolution to existing concepts of GPCR signaling and S1P biology.",

    "abstract": "Repeated presentation of a stimulus leads to reductions in measures of neural responses. This phenomenon, termed repetition suppression (RS), has recently been conceptualized using models based on predictive coding, which describe RS as due to expectations that are weighted toward recently-seen stimuli. To evaluate these models, researchers have manipulated the likelihood of stimulus repetition within experiments. They have reported findings that are inconsistent across hemodynamic and electrophysiological measures, and difficult to interpret as clear support or refutation of predictive coding models. We instead investigated a different type of expectation effect that is apparent in stimulus repetition experiments: the difference in ones ability to predict the identity of repeated, compared to unrepeated, stimuli. In previous experiments that presented pairs of repeated or alternating images, once participants had seen the first stimulus image in a pair, they could form specific expectations about the repeated stimulus image. However they could not form such expectations for the alternating image, which was often randomly chosen from a large stimulus set. To assess the contribution of stimulus predictability effects to previously observed RS, we measured BOLD signals while presenting pairs of repeated and alternating faces. This was done in contexts whereby stimuli in alternating trials were either i.) predictable through statistically learned associations between pairs of stimuli or ii.) chosen randomly and therefore unpredictable. We found that RS in the right FFA was much larger in trials with unpredictable compared to predictable alternating faces. This was primarily due to unpredictable alternating stimuli evoking larger BOLD signals than predictable alternating stimuli. We show that imbalances in stimulus predictability across repeated and alternating trials can greatly inflate measures of RS, or even mimic RS effects. Our findings also indicate that stimulus-specific expectations, as described by predictive coding models, may account for a sizeable portion of observed RS effects.",

    "abstract": "Previous electrophysiological studies in monkeys and humans suggest that premotor regions are the primary loci for the encoding of perceptual choices during vibrotactile comparisons. However, these studies employed paradigms wherein choices were inextricably linked with the physical properties of the stimuli and action selection. It raises the question what brain regions represent choices at a more abstract level, independent of the sensorimotor components of the task. To address this question, we used fMRI-MVPA and a variant of the vibrotactile frequency discrimination task which enabled the isolation of choice-related signals from those related to stimulus properties and selection of the manual decision reports. We identified the left, contralateral dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as carrying information about abstract choices. Notably, our previous work using an oculomotor variant of the task also reported abstract choice representation in intraparietal and premotor regions. However, the informative premotor cluster was centered in the frontal eye fields rather than in the PMd, providing empirical support for a response effector-dependent organization of abstract choice representation in the context of vibrotactile comparisons. Considering our results together with findings from recent studies in animals, we speculate that the premotor region likely serves as a temporary storage site for information necessary for the specification of concrete manual movements, while the IPS might be more directly involved in the computation of choice.",

We challenge the assumption of sequential decisions, with evidence that visuomotor processing unfolds through a continuous flow of information from sensory to motor regions. Action selection is initiated before regional visual decisions are completed. By linking behavior and physiology through theoretical decision models, we identify simultaneous forward and backward flow of information for visuomotor decisions between sensory and motor regions, in beta and gamma ranges. The model of integrated visuomotor decisions provides a powerful approach to investigate behavioral disorders that impair the ability to use sensory inputs to guide appropriate actions.",

    "abstract": "Although often used as a nuisance in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), the global brain signal in humans and anesthetized animals has important neural basis. However, our knowledge of the global signal in awake rodents is sparse. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyzed rsfMRI data acquired with a conventional single-echo (SE) echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence in awake rats. The spatial pattern of rsfMRI frames during peaks of the global signal exhibited prominent co-activations in the thalamo-cortical and hippocampo-cortical networks, as well as in the basal forebrain, hinting that these neural networks might contribute to the global brain signal in awake rodents. To validate this concept, we acquired rsfMRI data using a multi-echo (ME) EPI sequence and removed non-neural components in the rsfMRI signal. Consistent co-activation patterns were obtained in extensively de-noised ME-rsfMRI data, corroborating the finding from SE-rsfMRI data. Furthermore, during rsfMRI experiments we simultaneously recorded neural spiking activities in the hippocampus using GCaMP-based fiber photometry. The hippocampal calcium activity exhibited significant correspondence with the global rsfMRI signal. These data collectively suggest that the global rsfMRI signal contains significant neural components that involve coordinated activities in the thalamo-cortical and hippocampo-cortical networks. These results provide important insight into the neural substrate of the global brain signal in awake rodents.",

At Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junctions, earlier work ascribed AZ enlargement by incorporating more Bruchpilot (Brp) scaffold protein a central mechanistic role in PHP.\n\nWe used localization microscopy (direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) to study AZ plasticity during PHP. We found that both acute, philanthotoxin (PhTx)-induced and chronic, genetically-induced PHP lead to compaction of individual AZs without altering Brp copy numbers per AZ. This compaction even occurs within Brp subclusters of the AZ scaffold which also move towards AZ centers. Furthermore, lowering imaging resolution revealed how AZ compaction in PHP translates into apparent increases in AZ area and Brp protein content as implied earlier. Our results suggest AZ compaction in PHP as an effective mechanism to raise presynaptic protein density and transmitter release.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHomeostatic plasticity stabilizes chemical synaptic transmission in multiple organisms ranging from insects to humans. Changes in active zones (AZs), membrane specializations of the presynapse where synaptic vesicles are discharged, are thought to be crucial in homeostatic adaptations. AZ growth by protein incorporation was proposed as a core mechanism in presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). Localization microscopy of an abundant AZ scaffold protein uncovered that instead of growing, AZs are compacted in acute and chronic PHP. At lower imaging resolution, however, AZs appear larger and brighter although protein numbers are not increased. In summary, our findings suggest AZ compaction as new and effective mechanism to raise presynaptic protein density and transmitter release in PHP.",

    "abstract": "In an uncertain world, the ability to predict and update the relationships between environmental cues and outcomes is a fundamental element of adaptive behaviour. This type of learning is typically thought to depend on prediction error, the difference between expected and experienced events, and in the reward domain this has been closely linked to mesolimbic dopamine. There is also increasing behavioural and neuroimaging evidence that disruption to this process may be a cross-diagnostic feature of several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders in which dopamine is dysregulated. However, the precise relationship between haemodynamic measures, dopamine and reward-guided learning remains unclear. To help address this issue, we used a translational technique, oxygen amperometry, to record haemodynamic signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while freely-moving rats performed a probabilistic Pavlovian learning task. Using a model-based analysis approach to account for individual variations in learning, we found that the oxygen signal in the NAc correlated with a reward prediction error, whereas in the OFC it correlated with an unsigned prediction error or salience signal. Furthermore, an acute dose of amphetamine, creating a hyperdopaminergic state, disrupted rats ability to discriminate between cues associated with either a high or a low probability of reward and concomitantly corrupted prediction error signalling. These results demonstrate parallel but distinct prediction error signals in NAc and OFC during learning, both of which are affected by psychostimulant administration. Furthermore, they establish the viability of tracking and manipulating haemodynamic signatures of reward-guided learning observed in human fMRI studies using a proxy signal for BOLD in a freely behaving rodent.",

    "abstract": "Live-cell imaging experiments have opened an exciting window into the behavior of living systems. While these experiments can produce rich data, the computational analysis of these datasets is challenging. Single-cell analysis requires that cells be accurately identified in each image and subsequently tracked over time. Increasingly, deep learning is being used to interpret microscopy image with single cell resolution. In this work, we apply deep learning to the problem of tracking single cells in live-cell imaging data. Using crowdsourcing and a human-in-the-loop approach to data annotation, we constructed a dataset of over 11,000 cell nuclear trajectories that includes lineage information. Using this dataset, we successfully trained a deep learning model to perform cell tracking within a linear programming framework. Benchmarking tests demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the task of cell tracking with respect to multiple accuracy metrics. Further, we show that our deep learning-based method generalizes to perform cell tracking for both fluorescent and brightfield images of the cell cytoplasm, despite having never been trained those data types. This enables analysis of live-cell imaging data collected across imaging modalities. A persistent cloud deployment of our cell tracker is available at http://www.deepcell.org.",
