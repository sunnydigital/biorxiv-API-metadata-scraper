    "abstract": "Reward learning is a ubiquitous cognitive mechanism guiding adaptive choices and behaviors, and when impaired, can lead to considerable mental health consequences. Reward-related functional neuroimaging studies have begun to implicate networks of brain regions essential for processing various peripheral influences (e.g., risk, subjective preference, delay, social context) involved in the multifaceted reward processing construct. To provide a more complete neurocognitive perspective on reward processing that synthesizes findings across the literature while also appreciating these peripheral influences, we utilized emerging meta-analytic techniques to elucidate brain regions, and in turn networks, consistently engaged in distinct aspects of reward processing. Using a data-driven, meta-analytic, k-means clustering approach, we dissociated seven meta-analytic groupings (MAGs) of neuroimaging results (i.e., brain activity maps) from 749 experimental contrasts across 176 reward processing studies involving 13,358 healthy participants. We then performed an exploratory functional decoding approach to gain insight into the putative functions associated with each MAG. We identified a seven-MAG clustering solution which represented dissociable patterns of convergent brain activity across reward processing tasks. Additionally, our functional decoding analyses revealed that each of these MAGs mapped onto discrete behavior profiles that suggested specialized roles in predicting value (MAG-1 & MAG-2) and processing a variety of emotional (MAG-3), external (MAG-4 & MAG-5), and internal (MAG-6 & MAG-7) influences across reward processing paradigms. These findings support and extend aspects of well-accepted reward learning theories and highlight large-scale brain network activity associated with distinct aspects of reward processing.",

    "abstract": "Plants are continuously exposed to environmental perturbations. Outcrossing annual plants can adapt rapidly to these changes via sexual mating and DNA mutations. However, perennial and clonally reproducing plants may have developed particular mechanisms allowing them to adapt to these changes and transmit this information to their offspring. It has been proposed that the mechanisms allowing this plasticity of response could come in the form of epigenetic marks that would evolve throughout a plants lifetime and modulate gene expression. To study these mechanisms, we used apple (Malus domestica) as a model perennial and clonally propagated plant. First, we investigated the DNA methylation patterns of mature trees compared to juvenile seedlings. While we did not observe a drastic genome-wide change in DNA methylation levels, we found clear changes in DNA methylation patterns localized in regions enriched in genes involved in photosynthesis. Transcriptomic analysis showed that genes involved in this pathway were overexpressed in seedlings. Secondly, we compared global DNA methylation of a newly grafted plant to its mother tree to assess if acquired epigenomic marks were transmitted via grafting. We identified clear changes, albeit showing weaker DNA methylation differences. Our results show that a majority of DNA methylation patterns from the tree are transmitted to newly grafted plants albeit with specific local differences. Both the epigenomic and transcriptomic data indicate that grafted plants are at an intermediate phase between an adult tree and seedling and inherit part of the epigenomic history of their mother tree.",

    "abstract": "Development of effective therapeutics for brain disorders is challenging, in particular, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) severely limits access of the therapeutics into the brain parenchyma. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may lead to transient BBB permeability that affords a unique opportunity for therapeutic delivery via intravenous administration ranging from macromolecules to nanoparticles (NP) for developing precision therapeutics. In this regard, we address critical gaps in understanding the range/size of therapeutics, delivery window(s), and moreover the potential impact of biological factors for optimal delivery parameters. Here we show, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that 24 h post-focal TBI female mice exhibit a heightened macromolecular tracer and NP accumulation compared to male mice, indicating sex-dependent differences in BBB permeability. Furthermore, we report for the first time the potential to deliver NP-based therapeutics within 3 d after focal injury in both female and male mice. The delineation of injury-induced BBB permeability with respect to sex and temporal profile is essential to more accurately tailor time-dependent precision and personalized nanotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in the transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is that a subset of donated RBC units may not provide optimal benefit to transfusion recipients. This variability stems from the inherent ability of donor RBCs to withstand the physical and chemical insults of cold storage, which ultimately dictate their survival in circulation. The loss of RBC deformability during cold storage is well-established and has been identified as a potential biomarker for the quality of donated RBCs. While RBC deformability has traditionally been indirectly inferred from rheological characteristics of the bulk suspension, there has been considerable interest in directly measuring the deformation of RBCs. Microfluidic technologies have enabled single cell measurement of RBC deformation but have not been able to consistently distinguish differences between RBCs between healthy donors. Using the microfluidic ratchet mechanism, we developed a method to sensitively and consistently analyze RBC deformability. We found that the aging curve of RBC deformability varies significantly across donors, but is consistent for each donor over multiple donations. Specifically, certain donors seem capable of providing RBCs that maintain their deformability during two weeks of cold storage in standard test tubes. The ability to distinguish between RBC units with different storage potential could provide a valuable opportunity to identify donors capable of providing RBCs that maintain their integrity, in order to reserve these units for sensitive transfusion recipients.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsActivation of MYC and CTNNB1 (encoding {beta}-catenin) can co-occur in liver cancer, but how these oncogenes cooperate in tumorigenesis remains unclear.\\n\\nApproach & ResultsWe generated a mouse model allowing conditional activation of MYC and WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling (through either {beta}-catenin activation or Apc loss) upon expression of CRE recombinase in the liver, and monitored their effects on hepatocyte proliferation, apoptosis, gene expression profiles and tumorigenesis. Conditional activation of WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling strongly accelerated MYC-driven carcinogenesis in the mouse liver. Both pathways also cooperated in promoting cellular transformation in vitro, demonstrating their cell-autonomous action. Short-term induction of MYC and {beta}-catenin in hepatocytes followed by RNA-seq profiling allowed the identification of a \\\"Myc/{beta}-catenin signature\\\", composed of a discrete set of Myc-activated genes whose expression increased in presence of active {beta}-catenin. Notably this signature enriched for targets of Yap and Taz, two transcriptional co-activators known to be activated by WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling, and to cooperate with MYC in mitogenic activation and liver transformation. Consistent with these regulatory connections, Yap/Taz accumulated upon Myc/{beta}-catenin activation and were required not only for the ensuing proliferative response, but also for tumor cell growth and survival. Finally, the Myc/{beta}-catenin signature was enriched in a subset of human hepatocellular carcinomas characterized by comparatively poor prognosis.\\n\\nConclusionsYap and Taz mediate the cooperative action of Myc and {beta}-catenin in liver tumorigenesis. This warrants efforts toward therapeutic targeting of Yap/Taz in aggressive liver tumors marked by elevated Myc/{beta}-catenin activity.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming as a downstream result of oncogenic signaling pathways has been described as a hallmark of cancer. Here, we describe a reverse scenario in which a metabolic enzyme regulates cancer cell behavior by triggering a signaling pathway. We find that glutathione peroxidase 8 (GPX8), a poorly characterized redox enzyme that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, is upregulated during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) program in HMLE and A549 cells. In cancer patients, high tumor levels of GPX8 correlate with mesenchymal markers and poor patient outcome. Strikingly, GPX8 knockout in mesenchymal-like cells results in an epithelial-like morphology, downregulation of EMT characteristics, loss of cancer stemness features, and impeded tumor initiation in mice. We determine the mechanism governing this reduction in cancer aggressiveness is through the repression of crucial autocrine factors, in particular, interleukin-6 (IL-6). Specifically, GPX8 knockout impairs IL-6-driven activation of the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway, a critical regulator of a cancer-aggressive state. Altogether, we uncover the GPX8-IL-6 axis as a novel metabolic-inflammatory pathway that acts as a robust EMT activator and program to induce aggressive cancer cell characteristics.",

Previously, the large variation in cancer risk across human tissues was found to strongly correlate with the number of stem cell divisions and abnormal DNA methylation levels occurring in them. Here we study the role of another potentially important factor, synthetic lethality, in cancer risk. Analyzing transcriptomics data in the GTEx compendium we quantify the extent of co-inactivation of cancer synthetic lethal (cSL) gene pairs in normal tissues and find that normal tissues with more down-regulated cSL gene pairs have lower and delayed cancer risk. We also show that the tissue-specificity of numerous tumor suppressor genes is strongly associated with the expression of their cSL partner genes in the corresponding normal tissues. Overall, our findings uncover the role of synthetic lethality as a novel important factor involved in tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Across saccadic eye movements, the visual system receives two successive static images corresponding to the pre- and the postsaccadic projections of the visual field on the retina. The existence of a mechanism integrating the content of these images is today still a matter of debate. Here, we studied the transfer of a visual feature across saccades using a blanking paradigm. Participants moved their eyes to a peripheral grating and discriminated a change in its orientation occurring during the eye movement. The grating was either constantly on the screen or briefly blanked during and after the saccade. Moreover, it either was of the same luminance as the background (i.e., isoluminant) or anisoluminant with respect to it. We found that for anisoluminant grating, the orientation discrimination across saccade was improved when a blank followed the onset of the eye movement. Such effect was however abolished with isoluminant grating. Additionally, performance was also improved when an anisoluminant grating presented before the saccade was followed by an isoluminant one. These results demonstrate that a detailed representation of the presaccadic image was transferred across saccades allowing participants to perform better on the trans-saccadic orientation task. While such a transfer of visual orientation across saccade is masked in real-life anisoluminant conditions, the use of a blank and of isoluminant postsaccadic grating allowed here to reveal its existence.\\n\\nSignificance statementStatic objects are perceived as not moving across eye movements despite their visual projection shifts on our retina. To compensate for such shifts and create a continuous perception of space, our brain may keep track of objects visual features across our movements. We found that shortly blanking a contrast-defined object during and after saccades allows to recover a detailed representation of its orientation. We propose that the transfer of visual content across saccades revealed with the use of a simple blank plays an important role in ensuring our continuous and stable perception of the world.",

    "abstract": "Remyelination failure is a crucial component of disease progression in the autoimmune demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The regenerative capacity of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to replace myelinating oligodendrocytes is likely influenced by many aspects of the lesion environment including inflammatory signaling and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. These features of MS lesions are typically attributed to infiltrating leukocytes and reactive astrocytes. Here we demonstrate that fibroblasts also contribute to the inhibitory environment in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using Col11GFP transgenic mice, we show that perivascular fibroblasts are activated in the spinal cord at EAE onset, and infiltrate the parenchyma by the peak of behavioral deficits where they are closely associated with areas of demyelination, myeloid cell accumulation, and ECM deposition. We further show that both fibroblast conditioned media and fibroblast ECM inhibit the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes. Taken together, our results indicate that the fibrotic scar is a major component of EAE pathology that leads to an inhibitory environment for remyelination, thus raising the possibility that anti-fibrotic mechanisms may serve as novel therapeutic targets for MS.",

There was evidence to suggest nicotine exposure increases blood pressure and heart rate, and negatively affects mood, but insufficient evidence that these effects differ by genotype.

We further show that GFP, Cas9, and gRNA introduced into wheat via foliar application (spraying on) of plasmid coated carbon dots are expressed and, in the case of Cas9, make genome edits in SPO11 genes. Therefore, we present a protocol for spray-on gene editing that is simple, inexpensive, fast, transforms in planta, and is applicable to multiple crop species. We believe this technique creates many opportunities for the future of plant transformation in research and shows great promise for plant protein production systems.",

Here we present riboPLATE-seq, a scalable method for generating paired libraries of ribosome-associated and total mRNA. As an extension of the PLATE-seq protocol, riboPLATE-seq utilizes barcoded primers for pooled library preparation, but additionally leverages rRNA immunoprecipitation on whole polysomes to measure ribosome association (RA). We compare RA to its analogue in ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, translation efficiency, and demonstrate both the performance of riboPLATE-seq and its utility in detecting translational alterations induced by specific inhibitors of protein kinases.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) is highly expressed in many cancer cells. Synthesizing glutamine by its enzyme function has been found to be important for supporting cancer cell survival and growth under glutamine restriction. However, GLULs functions under a glutamine-sufficient condition still have not been uncovered. Here we find that GLUL is highly expressed in lung cancer cells and provides survival and growth advantages under both glutamine restriction and adequacy conditions. Knocking down GLUL can block lung cancer cell growth in an enzyme-independent way when glutamine is sufficient. Mechanistically, GLUL regulates Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II Gamma (CaMK2G) expression at the transcription level, and CaMK2G is a major mediator in controlling cell growth under GLUL. The transcriptional regulation of CaMK2G is partially mediated by SMAD4. Our data unveil a new enzyme-independent function of GLUL in lung cancer cells under a glutamine-sufficient condition.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate the deleterious effects of temperature increases on cellular organization and proteotoxicity, organisms have developed mechanisms to respond to heat stress. In eukaryotes, HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat shock transcriptional response, but the heat shock response pathway is not yet fully understood. From a forward genetic screen for suppressors of heat shock induced gene expression in C. elegans, we identified a new allele of hsf-1 that alters its DNA-binding domain, and three additional alleles of sup-45, a previously uncharacterized genetic locus. We identified sup-45 as one of the two hitherto unknown C. elegans orthologs of the human AF4/FMR2 family proteins, which are involved in regulation of transcriptional elongation rate. We thus renamed sup-45 as affl-2 (AF4/FMR2-Like). affl-2 mutants are egg-laying defective and dumpy, but worms lacking its sole paralog (affl-1) appear wild-type. AFFL-2 is a broadly expressed nuclear protein, and nuclear localization of AFFL-2 is necessary for its role in heat shock response. affl-2 and its paralog are not essential for proper HSF-1 expression and localization after heat shock, which suggests that affl-2 may function downstream or parallel of hsf-1. Our characterization of affl-2 provides insights into the complex processes of transcriptional elongation and regulating heat shock induced gene expression to protect against heat stress.",

They increase its activity, resulting in augmented Rab10-Thr73 phosphorylation and conversely, LRRK2 inhibition decreases pRab10 levels. However, there is no assay to quantify pRab10 levels for drug target engagement or patient stratification. We developed an ultra-sensitive targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based assay for determining Rab10-Thr73 phosphorylation stoichiometry in human samples. It uses synthetic stable isotope-labeled (SIL) analogues for both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tryptic peptides surrounding Rab10-Thr73 to directly derive the percentage of Rab10 phosphorylation from attomole amounts of the endogenous phosphopeptide. We test the reproducibility of our assay by determining Rab10-Thr73 phosphorylation stoichiometry in human neutrophils before and after LRRK2 inhibition. Compared to healthy controls, neutrophils of LRRK2 G2019S and VPS35 D620N carriers robustly display 1.4-fold and 3.7-fold increased pRab10 levels, respectively. Our generic MS-based assay further establishes the relevance of pRab10 as a prognostic PD marker and is a powerful tool for determining LRRK2 inhibitor efficacy and for stratifying PD patients for LRRK2 inhibitor treatment.",

    "abstract": "As a rare subtype of prostate carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has not been studied extensively and thus lacks systematic molecular characterization. Here we applied single-cell genomic amplification and RNA-Seq to a specimen of human prostate BCC (CK34{beta}E12+/P63+/PAP-/PSA-). The mutational landscape was obtained via whole exome sequencing of the amplification mixture of 49 single cells, and the 5 putative driver genes mutated are CASC5, NUTM1, PTPRC, KMT2C and TBX3. The top 3 nucleotide substitutions are C>T, T>C and C>A, similar to common prostate cancer. The distribution of the variant allele frequency values indicated these single cells are from the same tumor clone. The transcriptomes of 69 single cells were obtained, and they were clustered into tumor, stromal and immune cells based on their global transcriptomic profiles. The tumor cells specifically express basal cell markers like KRT5, KRT14 and KRT23, and epithelial markers EPCAM, CDH1 and CD24. The transcription factor (TF) co-variance network analysis showed that the BCC tumor cells have distinct regulatory networks. By comparison with current prostate cancer datasets, we found that some of the bulk samples exhibit basal-cell signatures. Interestingly, at single-cell resolution the gene expression patterns of prostate BCC tumor cells show uniqueness compared with that of common prostate cancer-derived circulating tumor cells. This study, for the first time, discloses the comprehensive mutational and transcriptomic landscapes of prostate BCC, which lays a foundation for the understanding of its tumorigenesis mechanism and provides new insights into prostate cancers in general.",

    "abstract": "Despite its potential effectiveness for outcrossing, few examples of pollination via mushroom mimicry have been reported. This may be because the conditions under which the strategy can evolve are limited and/or because demonstrating it is challenging. Arisaema is a plant genus that has been suggested to adopt mushroom mimicry for pollination, although no compelling evidence for this has yet been demonstrated. Here, we report that Arisaema sikokianum utilizes mostly a single genus of obligate mycophagous flies (Mycodrosophila) as pollinators, and that the insect community dominated by Mycodrosophila is strikingly similar to those found on some species of wood-decaying fungi. Comparative chemical analyses of Arisaema spp. and various mushrooms further revealed that only A. sikokianum emits a set of volatile compounds shared with some mushroom species utilized by Mycodrosophila. Meanwhile, other closely related and often sympatric Arisaema species do not possess such typical traits of mushroom mimicry or attract Mycodrosophila, thereby likely achieving substantial reproductive isolation from A. sikokianum. Our finding indicates that mushroom mimicry is an exceptional and derived state in the genus Arisaema, thus providing an unprecedented opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying the coordinated acquisition of mimicry traits that occurred during a recent speciation event.",

Both lineages are characterized by complex life cycles with a variety of cell types, the formation of multicellular aggregations and syncytium-like structures, and an unusual diet for single-celled opisthokonts (partial cell fusion and joint sucking of a large eukaryotic prey), all of which provide new insights into the origin of multicellularity in Metazoa. The ability to feed on large eukaryotic prey could have been a powerful trigger in the formation and development both aggregative (e.g., joint feeding, which also implies signalling) and clonal (e.g., hypertrophic growth followed by palintomy) multicellular stages that played important roles in the emergence of multicellular animals.",

Using TCR alpha and beta repertoire sequencing for T-cell subsets, as well as single-cell RNAseq and TCRseq, we track the concentrations and phenotypes of individual T-cell clones in response to primary and secondary yellow fever immunization showing their large diversity. We confirm the secondary response is an order of magnitude weaker, albeit 10 days faster than the primary one. Estimating the fraction of the T-cell response directed against the single immunodominant epitope, we identify the sequence features of TCRs that define the high precursor frequency of the two major TCR motifs specific for this particular epitope.

We applied carefully controlled experiments in gnotobiotic mice colonized with defined communities of bacteria, fungi, or both to differentiate the direct role of fungi on microbiome assembly, host development, and susceptibility to colitis and airway inflammation. Our results revealed that fungal colonization alone was insufficient to promote the intestinal anatomic and physiological changes seen in mice colonized by bacteria, and had limited impact on the fecal metabolome. However, fungal colonization promoted major shifts in bacterial microbiome ecology, and had an independent effect on the innate and adaptive immune development in young mice. Fungi further exacerbated some aspects of the inflammatory effects of the bacterial community during OVA-induced airway inflammation by promoting macrophage infiltration in the airway. Our results demonstrate a dominant ecological and physiological role of bacteria in gut microbiomes, but highlight fungi as an ecological factor shaping the assembly of the bacterial community and a direct capacity to impact immune system and modulate disease susceptibility.

It is unclear how these spherical spores germinate into rod-shaped, walled cells without preexisting PG templates. We found that germinating spores first synthesize PG randomly on spherical surfaces. MglB, a GTPase-activating protein, forms a cluster that surveys the status of PG growth and stabilizes at one future cell pole. Following MglB, the Ras family GTPase MglA localizes to the second pole. MglA directs molecular motors to transport the bacterial actin homolog MreB and the Rod PG synthesis complexes away from poles. The Rod system establishes rod-shape by elongating PG at nonpolar regions. Thus, the interaction between GTPase, cytoskeletons and molecular motors provides a mechanism for the de novo establishment of rod-shape in bacteria.\n\nSignificanceSpheres and rods are among the most common shapes adopted by walled bacteria, in which the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall largely determines cell shape. When induced by chemicals, rod-shaped vegetative cells of the Gram-negative bacterium Myxococcus xanthus thoroughly degrade their PG and shrink into spherical spores. As these spores germinate, rod-shaped cells are rebuilt without preexisting templates, which provides a rare opportunity to visualize de novo PG synthesis and bacterial morphogenesis. In this study, we investigated how spherical spores germinate into rods and elucidated a system for rod-shape morphogenesis that includes the Rod PG synthesis system, a GTPase-GAP pair, the MreB cytoskeleton and a molecular motor.",

During the 2016-2017 influenza season, influenza B/VIC lineage variant viruses emerged with two (K162N163) or three (K162N163D164) amino acid (AA) deletions in the hemagglutinin protein. Hemagglutination inhibition assays demonstrate that these deletion variant influenza B/VIC viruses are antigenically distinct from each other and from the progenitor B/VIC virus that lacks the deletion. Therefore, there are currently four antigenically distinct HA proteins expressed by influenza B co-circulating: B/YAM, B/VIC V1A (no deletion), B/VIC V1A.1 (two-AA deletion), and B/VIC V1A.2 and V1A.3 (three-AA deletion). The prevalence of these viruses differs across geographic regions, making it critical to have a sensitive, rapid diagnostic assay(s) that detect and distinguish these Influenza B variant viruses during surveillance. Here, we present a real time RT-PCR assay that targets the influenza B/VIC deletion region in the HA gene and detects and distinguishes the influenza B/VIC V1A, B/VIC V1A.1, B/VIC V1A.2 and B/VIC V1A.3 variant viruses, with no cross-reactivity. This assay can be run as a multiplex reaction, allowing for increased testing efficiency and reduced cost. Coupling this assay with the CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel Influenza B Lineage Genotyping Kit results in rapid detection and characterization of circulating influenza B viruses. Having accurate and detailed surveillance information on these distinct Influenza B variant viruses will provide insight into the prevalence and geographic distribution and could aid in vaccine recommendations.",

    "abstract": "The corticospinal tract (CST) is the major descending pathway controlling voluntary hand function in primates, and though less dominant, it mediates voluntary paw movements in rats. As with primates, the CST in rats originates from multiple (albeit fewer) cortical sites, and functionally different motor and somatosensory subcomponents terminate in different regions of the spinal gray matter. We recently reported in monkeys that following a combined cervical dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), both motor and S1 CSTs sprout well beyond their normal terminal range. The S1 CST sprouting response is particularly dramatic, indicating an important, if poorly understood, somatosensory role in the recovery process. As rats are used extensively to model spinal cord injury (SCI), we asked if the S1 CST response is conserved in rodents. Rats were divided into sham controls, and two groups surviving post-lesion for ~6 and 10 weeks. A DRL/DCL was made to partially deafferent one paw. Behavioral testing showed a post-lesion deficit and recovery over several weeks. Three weeks prior to ending the experiment, S1 cortex was mapped electrophysiologically, for tracer injection placement to determine S1 CST termination patterns within the cord. Synaptogenesis was also assessed for labeled S1 CST terminals within the dorsal horn. Our findings show that the affected S1 CST sprouts well beyond its normal range in response to a DRL/DCL, much as it does in macaque monkeys. This, along with evidence for increased synaptogenesis post-lesion, indicates that CST terminal sprouting following a central sensory lesion, is a robust and conserved response.",

    "abstract": "The neuronal mechanisms underlying creativity are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether temporal dynamics of functional brain activity is a biomarker of creative ideation. Specifically, we investigated whether long-range temporal correlations in fluctuating resting-state alpha oscillations predict human creativity. Because lower temporal correlations reflect faster brain state switching, and faster state switching may be associated with increased flexibility of mind, we hypothesized that subjects with lower temporal correlations would show higher creativity. Creativity was measured by self-rating, examiner-rating and the alternative uses task in 40 healthy young adults, and scored on dimensions of verbal fluency, originality, elaboration, usefulness, and flexibility. For each dimension, the total number of subject-reported alternative uses that matched the criterium was noted (the quantity measure), as well as the proportion of uses that matched the dimensional criterium. A principal components analysis confirmed the two-component structure of quantity and quality. Eyes-open resting-state brain activity was measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) with 128 channels. Scaling exponents {beta} were derived from spectral analysis of the amplitude modulation of 8-13 Hz oscillations, where high exponents {beta} reflect lower decay of autocorrelation and slower switching of brain. Partial correlation analysis was used controlling for gender and age, and a cluster permutation test was performed correcting for multiple testing. Significant negative correlations between creativity and temporal correlations were observed, most prominent in right central/temporal brain areas. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that individual variation in the intrinsic dynamics of the brain may offer a neuronal explanation for individual variation in both the quality and quantity of creative ideation.",

    "abstract": "Sequential activity has been observed in multiple neuronal circuits across species, neural structures, and behaviors. It has been hypothesized that sequences could arise from unsupervised learning processes. However, it is still unclear whether biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules can organize neuronal activity to form sequences whose statistics match experimental observations. Here we investigate temporally asymmetric Hebbian rules in sparsely connected recurrent rate networks, and develop a theory of the transient sequential activity observed after learning. These rules transform a sequence of random input patterns into synaptic weight updates. After learning, recalled sequential activity is reflected in the transient correlation of network activity with each of the stored input patterns. Using mean-field theory, we derive a low-dimensional description of the network dynamics and compute the storage capacity of these networks. Multiple temporal characteristics of the recalled sequential activity are consistent with experimental observations. We find that the degree of sparseness of the recalled sequences can be controlled by non-linearities in the learning rule. Furthermore, sequences maintain robust decoding, but display highly labile dynamics, when synaptic connectivity is continuously modified due to noise or storage of other patterns, similar to recent observations in hippocampus and parietal cortex. Finally, we demonstrate that our results also hold in recurrent networks of spiking neurons with separate excitatory and inhibitory populations.",

    "abstract": "Ligand-responsive synthetic riboswitches are versatile and innovative tools for external gene regulation in pro- and eukaryotes. Riboswitches are small cis-regulatory RNA elements that regulate gene expression by conformational changes in response to ligand binding. In plants, synthetic riboswitches were used to regulate gene expression in plastids, but the application of synthetic riboswitches for the regulation of nuclear-encoded genes in planta has not been reported so far. Here we characterize the properties of a theophylline-responsive synthetic aptazyme for control of nuclear-encoded transgenes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Activation of the aptazyme, inserted in the 3-UTR of the target gene, resulted in rapid self-cleavage and subsequent decay of the mRNA. This riboswitch allowed reversible, theophylline-dependent downregulation of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter gene in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Insertion of the riboswitch into the One Helix Protein 1 (OHP1) gene allowed complementation of ohp1 mutants and induction of the mutant phenotype by theophylline. GFP or OHP1 transcript levels were downregulated by maximally 90%, and GFP protein levels by 95%. These results establish artificial riboswitches as tools for externally controlled gene expression in synthetic biology in plants or functional crop design.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryArtificial, ligand-responsive RNA aptazymes are an efficient tool for dose- and time-dependent external control of nuclear gene expression in plants.",

    "abstract": "Brown eye spot, caused by Cercospora coffeicola, causes significant losses in both quality and quantity of coffee production. As many Cercospora spp. produce the photoactivated toxin cercosporin, this study aimed to determine the role of cercosporin in C. coffeicola pathogenesis by creating disruption mutants unable to produce the toxin. Six C. coffeicola isolates from Brazilian fields, representing organic and conventional production systems in the Minas Gerais state, were evaluated for their ability to produce cercosporin in vitro. Toxin production varied among isolates, ranging from 3.5 - 25.3 {micro}M/ 5 mm mycelial plug; production was undetectable in one isolate. The C. coffeicola homolog of the polyketide synthase gene (CTB1) involved in cercosporin production was amplified using a degenerate primer strategy. The 7044 nt ccCTB1 gene sequence was 90.3% identical to the cnCTB1 gene in Cercospora nicotianae and encoded a putative protein of 2196 amino acids with 98.2% similarity and 97.5% identity to its counterpart in C. nicotianae. Transformation of two isolates of C. coffeicola with a CTB1 disruption construct resulted in the recovery of six ctb1 disruption mutants. All of the ctb1 disruptants were deficient in cercosporin production. Disruption mutants did not differ significantly from the wild type for either growth or sporulation, but were significantly altered in virulence on coffee. As compared to wild type, time to lesion development was significantly increased and numbers of lesions were significantly decreased in coffee plants inoculated with ctb1 disruption mutants. These results show that cercosporin toxin is a virulence factor for C. coffeicola infection of coffee.",

In particular, the differentiation of chloroplasts into chromoplasts results in an enhanced storage capacity for carotenoids with industrial and nutritional value such as beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A). Here, we show that synthetically inducing a burst in the production of phytoene, the first committed intermediate of the carotenoid pathway, elicits an artificial chloroplast-to-chromoplast differentiation in leaves. Phytoene overproduction initially interferes with photosynthesis, acting as a metabolic threshold switch mechanism that weakens chloroplast identity. In a second stage, phytoene conversion into downstream carotenoids is required for the differentiation of chromoplasts. Our findings reveal that lowering the photosynthetic capacity of chloroplasts and increasing the production of carotenoids are not just the consequence but an absolute requirement for chromoplast differentiation, which additionally involves a concurrent reprogramming of nuclear gene expression and plastid morphology for improved carotenoid storage.",

Yet, their general reactivity has made it challenging to pinpoint the precise role and direct cellular targets of ROS. A well-understood ROS target in plants are lignin peroxidases in the cell wall. Lignin can be deposited with exquisite spatial control, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here we establish a full kinase signaling relay that exerts direct, spatial control over ROS production and lignification within the cell wall. We show that polar localization of a single kinase component is crucial for pathway function. Our data indicates that an intersection of more broadly localized components allows for micrometer-scale precision of lignification and that this system is triggered through initiation of ROS production as a critical peroxidase co-substrate.",

    "abstract": "Diarrhea is a major cause of both morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially among young children. Cryptosporidiosis is a leading cause of diarrhea in children, particularly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where it is responsible for over 200,000 deaths per year. Beyond the initial clinical presentation of diarrhea, it is associated with long term sequelae such as malnutrition and neurocognitive developmental deficits. Risk factors include poverty and overcrowding, yet not all children with these risk factors and exposure are infected, nor do all infected children develop symptomatic disease. One potential risk factor to explain these differences is their human genome. To identify genetic variants associated with symptomatic cryptosporidiosis, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) examining 6.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 873 children from three independent cohorts in Dhaka, Bangladesh: the Dhaka Birth Cohort (DBC), the Performance of Rotavirus and Oral Polio Vaccines in Developing Countries (PROVIDE) study, and the Cryptosporidiosis Birth Cohort (CBC). Associations were estimated separately for each cohort under an additive model, adjusting for height-for-age Z-score at 12 months of age, the first two principal components to account for population substructure, and genotyping batch. The strongest meta-analytic association was with rs58296998 (P=3.73x10-8), an intronic SNP and eQTL of PRKCA. Each additional risk allele conferred 2.4 times the odds of cryptosporidiosis in the first year of life. This genetic association suggests a role for protein kinase C alpha in pediatric cryptosporidiosis and warrants further investigation. This article was submitted to an online preprint archive.(1)\\n\\nImportanceGlobally, one of the major causes of pediatric morbidity and mortality remains diarrhea. The initial symptoms of diarrhea can often lead to long term consequences for the health of young children, such as malnutrition and neurocognitive developmental deficits. Despite many children having similar exposures to infectious causes of diarrhea, not all develop symptomatic disease, indicating a possible role for human genetic variation. Here we conducted a genetic study of susceptibility to symptomatic disease associated with Cryptosporidium infection (a leading cause of diarrhea) in three independent cohorts of infants from Dhaka, Bangladesh. We identified a genetic variant within protein kinase c alpha (PRKCA) associated with higher risk of cryptosporidiosis in the first year of life. These results indicate a role for human genetics in susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis and warrant further research to elucidate the mechanism.",

However, the genomic resources for the common pheasant are generally lacking. We sequenced a male individual of the subspecies torquatus of the common pheasant with the Illumina Hiseq platform. We obtained 94.88 Gb of usable sequences by filtering out low-quality reads of the raw data generated. This resulted in a 1.02 Gb final assembly, which equals the estimated genome size. BUSCO analysis using chicken as a model showed that 93.3% of genes were complete. The contig N50 and scaffold N50 sizes were 178 kb and 10.2 Mb, respectively. All these indicate that we obtained a high-quality genome assembly. We annotated 16,485 protein-coding genes and 123.3 Mb (12.05 % of the genome) of repetitive sequences by ab initio and homology-based prediction. Furthermore, we applied a RAD-sequencing approach for another 45 individuals of seven representative subspecies in China and identified 4,376,351 novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers. Using this unprecedented dataset, we uncover the geographic population structure and genetic introgression among common pheasants in China.

We previously reported that two behavioural paradigms control mating duration of male Drosophila, called Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) and Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD) that are induced through socio-sexual environment prior to copulation. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which males exhibit plasticity to different social cues remains poorly understood. Here, we show that SIFa modulates the neural circuitry for both LMD and SMD. Neuropeptide-to-neuropeptide communication, so called  neuropeptide relay plays a key role to mediate this control. We identified that 7 neuropeptides expressed in SIFa Receptor-positive cells are functionally important to regulate either LMD and/or SMD. The modulation of two independent mating duration behaviour by the different SIFa-mediated neuropeptide relay will help to further investigate how the neuropeptidergic modulation can control complex behaviours.",

To address this empirical gap, we compiled data from nearly 200 studies where traits were measured in a common environment for two parent populations and F1 hybrids. We find that individual traits are typically halfway between the parental midpoint and one parental value (i.e., hybrid trait values are typically 0.25 or 0.75 if parents values are 0 & 1). When considering pairs of traits together, a hybrids multivariate phenotype tends to resemble one parent (pairwise parent-bias) about 50 % more than the other while also exhibiting a similar magnitude of trait mismatch due to different traits having dominance in conflicting directions. We detect no phylogenetic signal nor an effect of parental genetic distance on dominance or mismatch. Using data from an experimental field planting of recombinant hybrid sunflowers--where there is among-individual variation in dominance and mismatch due to segregation of divergent alleles--we illustrate that pairwise parent-bias improves fitness while mismatch reduces fitness. Importantly, the effect of mismatch on fitness was stronger than that of pairwise parent-bias. In sum, our study has three major conclusions. First, hybrids between ecologically divergent natural populations are typically not phenotypically intermediate but rather exhibit substantial mismatch while also resembling one parent more than the other. Second, dominance and mismatch are likely determined by population-specific processes rather than general rules. Finally, selection against hybrids likely results from both selection against somewhat intermediate phenotypes and against mismatched trait combinations.",

    "abstract": "The production of action sequences is a fundamental aspect of human motor skills. To examine whether primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in maintenance of sequential movements, we trained two monkeys (Cebus apella) to perform two sequential reaching tasks. In one task, sequential movements were instructed by visual cues, whereas in the other task, movements were generated from memory after extended practice. After the monkey became proficient with performing the tasks, we injected an inhibitor of protein synthesis, anisomycin, into M1 to disrupt information storage in this area. Injection of anisomycin in M1 had a marked effect on the performance of sequential movements that were guided by memory. In contrast, the anisomycin injection did not have a significant effect on the performance of movements guided by vision. These results suggest that M1 of non-human primates is involved in the maintenance of skilled sequential movements.",

    "abstract": "The coupling of the phase of slower electrophysiological oscillations with the amplitude of faster oscillations, termed phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), is thought to facilitate dynamic connectivity in the brain. Though the brain undergoes dramatic changes in connectivity during the first few years of life, how PAC changes through this developmental period has not been studied. Here, we examined PAC through electroencephalography (EEG) data collected longitudinally during an awake, eyes-open EEG collection paradigm in 98 children between the ages of 3 months and 3 years. We implement a novel technique developed for capturing both PAC strength and phase preference (i.e., where in the slower oscillation waveform the faster oscillation shows increased amplitude) simultaneously, and employed non-parametric clustering methods to evaluate our metrics across a range of frequency pairs and electrode locations. We found that frontal and occipital PAC, primarily between the alpha-beta and gamma frequencies, increased from early infancy to early childhood (p = 1.35 x 10-5). Additionally, we found frontal gamma coupled with the trough of the alpha-beta waveform, while occipital gamma coupled with the peak of the alpha-beta waveform. This opposing trend may reflect each regions specialization towards feedback or feedforward processing, respectively.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe brain undergoes significant changes in functional connectivity during infancy and early childhood, enabling the emergence of higher-level cognition. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is thought to support the functional connectivity of the brain. Here, we find PAC increases from 3 months to 3 years of age. We additionally report the frontal and occipital brain areas show opposing forms of PAC; this difference could facilitate each regions tendency towards bottom-up or top-down processing.",

    "abstract": "Goal-directed behaviors, complex action sequences that maximize reward, are essential for normal function and are significantly impaired across neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite extensive associations between genetic mutations and these brain disorders, the mechanisms by which candidate genes contribute to goal-directed dysfunction remains unclear, owing to challenges in (1) describing aspects of reward processing that drive goal-directed dysfunction, (2) localizing these deficits to specific brain circuits and (3) relating changes in physiology to behavioral alterations. Here we examined mice with mutations in Neurexin1, a presynaptically-localized adhesion molecule with widespread neuropsychiatric dis ease association, in value-based decision-making paradigms. We found that Neurexin1 knockout animals exhibited blunted choice bias towards outcomes associated with greater benefits. Mutant mice were similarly impaired in avoiding costlier, benefit-neutral actions. Analysis of trial-by-trial choice data via reinforcement learning models suggested these behavioral patterns were driven largely by deficits in the updating and representation of choice values. Employing conditional gene ablation and region-specific Cre-recombinase strains, we revealed that Neurexin1 disruption within forebrain excitatory projection neurons, but not thalamic population s, recapitulated most aspects of the whole-brain knockout phenotype. Finally, utilizing in vivo recordings of direct pathway spiny neuron population calcium activity, we demonstrated that selective knockout of Neurexin1 within forebrain excitatory neurons disrupts reward-associated neural signals within striatum, a major site of feedback-based learning. By relating deficits in value-based decision-making to region-specific Nrxn1 disruption and changes in reward-associated neural activity, we reveal potential neural substrates for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disease-associated cognitive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "When exposed to chronic social stress, animals display behavioral changes that are relevant to depressive-like phenotypes. However, the cascading relationship between incremental stress exposure and neural dysfunctions over time remains incompletely understood. Here we characterize the longitudinal effect of social defeat on goal-directed actions and prefrontal cortical activity in mice, using a head-fixed sucrose preference task and two-photon calcium imaging. Behaviorally, stress-induced loss of reward sensitivity intensifies over days. Motivational anhedonia, the failure to translate positive reinforcements into future actions, requires multiple sessions of stress exposure to become fully established. For neural activity, individual layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the Cg1 and M2 subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex have heterogeneous responses to stress. Changes in ensemble activity differ significantly between susceptible and resilient animals after the first defeat session, and continue to diverge following successive stress episodes before reaching persistent abnormal levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the cumulative impact of an ethologically relevant stress can be observed at the level of cellular activity of individual prefrontal neurons. The distinct neural responses associated with resilience versus susceptibility raises the hypothesis that the negative impact of social stress is neutralized in resilient animals, in part through an adaptive reorganization of prefrontal cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "Among the numerous lineages of teleost fish that have independently transitioned from obligate water-breathing to facultative air-breathing, evolved properties of hemoglobin (Hb)-O2 transport may have been shaped by the prevalence and severity of aquatic hypoxia (which influences the extent to which fish are compelled to switch to aerial respiration) as well as the anatomical design of air-breathing structures and the cardiovascular system. Here we examine the structure and function of Hbs in an amphibious, facultative air-breathing fish, the blue-spotted mudskipper (Boleophthalmus pectinirostris). We also characterized the genomic organization of the globin gene clusters of the species and we integrated phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses to unravel the duplicative history of the genes that encode the subunits of structurally distinct mudskipper Hb isoforms (isoHbs). The B. pectinirostris isoHbs exhibit high intrinsic O2-affinities, similar to those of hypoxia-tolerant, water-breathing teleosts, and remarkably large Bohr effects. Genomic analysis of conserved synteny revealed that the genes that encode the -type subunits of the two main adult isoHbs are members of paralogous gene clusters that represent products of the teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. Experiments revealed no appreciable difference in the oxygenation properties of co-expressed isoHbs in spite of extensive amino acid divergence between the alternative -chain subunit isoforms. It therefore appears that the ability to switch between aquatic and aerial respiration does not necessarily require a division of labor between functionally distinct isoHbs with specialized oxygenation properties.\n\nSummary statementThe blue-spotted mudskipper routinely switches between aquatic and aerial respiration. This respiratory versatility is associated with properties of hemoglobin-oxygen transport that are similar to those found in hypoxia-adapted water-breathing fishes.",

Screening of 601 biopsy cores from 120 consecutive patients revealed multiple alterations in a mutually exclusive manner in 37% of patients, suggesting multifocal tumors with considerable genetic differences. Furthermore, the incidence of molecular heterogeneity was higher in African Americans patients compared to Caucasian American patients. About 47% of the biopsy cores with discontinuous tumor foci showed clonal differences with distinct molecular aberrations. ERG positivity occurred predominantly in low Gleason grade cancer, whereas ETV4 expression was observed mostly in high Gleason grade cancer. Further studies revealed correlation between the incidence of molecular markers and clinical and pathologic findings, suggesting potential implications for diagnostic pathology practice, such as defining dominant tumor nodules and discriminating juxtaposed but molecularly different tumors of different grade patterns.",

    "abstract": "The loss of sensory input following a spinal deafferentation injury can be debilitating, and this is especially true in primates when the hand is involved. While significant recovery of function occurs, little is currently understood about the reorganization of the neuronal circuitry, particularly within the dorsal horn. This region receives primary afferent input from the periphery, and cortical input via the somatosensory subcomponent of the corticospinal tract (S1 CST), and is critically important in modulating sensory transmission, both in normal and lesioned states. To determine how dorsal horn circuitry alters to facilitate recovery post-injury, we used an established deafferentation lesion model (DRL/DCL - dorsal root/dorsal column) in male monkeys to remove sensory input from just the opposing digits (D1-D3) of one hand. This results in a deficit in fine dexterity that recovers over several months. Electrophysiological mapping, tract tracing, and immunolabeling techniques were combined to delineate specific changes to dorsal horn input circuitry. Our main findings show that (1) there is complementary sprouting of the primary afferent and S1 CST populations into an overlapping region of the reorganizing dorsal horn, (2) S1 CST and primary afferent inputs connect in different ways within this region to facilitate sensory integration (3) there is a loss of larger S1 CST terminal boutons in the affected dorsal horn, but no change in the size profile of the spared/sprouted primary afferent terminal boutons post-lesion. Understanding such changes helps to inform new and targeted therapies that best promote recovery.\n\nSignificance statementSpinal injuries that remove sensation from the hand, can be debilitating, though functional recovery does occur. We examined changes to the neuronal circuitry of the dorsal horn in monkeys following a lesion that deafferented three digits of one hand. Little is understood about dorsal horn circuitry, despite the fact that this region loses most of its normal input after such an injury, and is clearly a major focus of reorganization. We found that both the spared primary afferents and somatosensory corticospinal efferents sprouted in an overlapping region of the dorsal horn after injury, and that larger (presumably faster) corticospinal terminals are lost, suggesting a significantly altered cortical modulation of primary afferents. Understanding this changing circuitry is important for designing targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) is becoming an increasingly critical technology in many areas. However, its complexity and its frequent non-transparency create significant challenges, especially in the biomedical and health areas. One of the critical components in addressing the above challenges is the explainability or transparency of ML systems, which refers to the model (related to the whole data) and sample explainability (related to specific samples). Our research focuses on both model and sample explainability of Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Our RF explainer, RFEX, is designed from the ground up with non-ML experts in mind, and with simplicity and familiarity, e.g. providing a one-page tabular output and measures familiar to most users. In this paper we present significant improvement in RFEX Model explainer compared to the version published previously, a new RFEX Sample explainer that provides explanation of how the RF classifies a particular data sample and is designed to directly relate to RFEX Model explainer, and a RFEX Model and Sample explainer case study from our collaboration with the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). We show that our approach offers a simple yet powerful means of explaining RF classification at the model and sample levels, and in some cases even points to areas of new investigation. RFEX is easy to implement using available RF tools and its tabular format offers easy-to-understand representations for non-experts, enabling them to better leverage the RF technology.",

    "abstract": "Despite the harm caused by binge drinking, the neural mechanisms leading to risky and disinhibited intoxication-related behaviors are not well understood. Evidence suggests that the globus pallidus externus (GPe), a substructure within the basal ganglia, participates in inhibitory control processes, as examined in stop-signaling tasks. In fact, studies in rodents have revealed that alcohol can change GPe activity by decreasing neuronal firing rates, suggesting that the GPe may have a central role in explaining impulsive behaviors and failures of inhibition that occur during binge drinking. In this study, twenty-five healthy volunteers underwent intravenous alcohol infusion to achieve a blood alcohol level of 0.08 g/dl, which is equivalent to a binge drinking episode. A resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan was collected prior to the infusion and at binge-level exposure. Functional connectivity analysis was used to investigate the association between alcohol-induced changes in GPe connectivity, drinking behaviors, and impulsivity traits. We found that individuals with greater number of drinks or heavy drinking days in the recent past had greater alcohol-induced deficits in GPe connectivity, particularly to the striatum. Our data also indicated an association between impulsivity and alcohol-induced deficits in GPe - frontal/precentral connectivity. Moreover, alcohol induced changes in GPe-amygdala circuitry suggested greater vulnerabilities to stress-related drinking in some individuals. Taken together, these findings suggest that alcohol may interact with impulsive personality traits and drinking patterns to drive alterations in GPe circuitry associated with behavioral inhibition, possibly indicating a neural mechanism by which binge drinking could lead to impulsive behaviors.",

However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of BPH is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of Stauntonia hexaphylla and Cornus officinalis (SC extract) on a testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH model. For in vitro experiments, a human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line was used to perform western blotting for androgen receptor (AR), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and 5-reductase type 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 8 groups as follows for the in vivo experiments: control, BPH, Fina, Saw, SC25, SC50, SC100, and SC200. To induce BPH, all rats, except those in the control group, were daily administered with subcutaneous injections of TP (5 mg/kg), and orally treated with appropriate PBS/drugs for 4 consecutive weeks. Our findings indicated that the SC treatment significantly reduced the prostate size and downregulated the serum testosterone and DHT levels in BPH rats. The histological examination revealed that SC treatment markedly recovered the TP-induced abnormalities and reduced the prostatic hyperplasia. In addition, in vitro and in vivo western blotting indicated that SC treatment significantly downregulated the AR, PSA, and 5-reductase type 2 expression, while an immunohistochemistry examination revealed that the SC extract significantly reduced the expression of type 2 5-reductase and proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cell count. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that SC extract attenuates BPH through anti-proliferative and anti-inflammation activities and might be useful in the clinical treatment of BPH.",

    "abstract": "The tropical and subtropical Andes have among the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. Understanding the forces that underlie speciation and diversification in the Andes is a major focus of research. Here we tested two hypotheses of species origins in the Andes: 1. Vicariance mediated by orogenesis or shifting habitat distribution. 2. Parapatric diversification along elevational environmental gradients. We also sought insights on the factors that impacted the phylogeography of co-distributed taxa, and the influences of divergent species ecology on population genetic structure. We used phylogeographic and coalescent analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data to compare genetic diversity and evolutionary history of two frog species: Pleurodema borellii (Family: Leiuperidae, 130 individuals; 20 sites), and Hypsiboas riojanus (Family: Hyllidae, 258 individuals; 23 sites) across their shared range in northwestern Argentina. The two showed concordant phylogeographic structuring, and our analyses support the vicariance model over the elevational gradient model. However, Pleurodema borellii exhibited markedly deeper temporal divergence ([&ge;]4 Ma) than H. riojanus (1-2 Ma). The three main mtDNA lineages of P. borellii were nearly allopatric and diverged between 4-10 Ma. At similar spatial scales, differentiation was less in the putatively more habitat-specialized H. riojanus than in the more generalist P. borellii. Similar allopatric distributions of major lineages for both species implies common causes of historical range fragmentation and vicariance. However, different divergence times among clades presumably reflect different demographic histories, permeability of different historical barriers at different times, and/or difference in life history attributes and sensitivities to historical environmental change. Our research enriches our understanding of the phylogeography of the Andes in northwestern Argentina.",

    "abstract": "DNA cytosine methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and heterochromatin formation. In plants, it occurs in three sequence contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH (where H is A, T, or C). The latter does not allow direct inheritance of methylation during DNA replication due to lack of symmetry, and methylation must therefore be re-established every cell generation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously shown that CMT2 and NRPE1 are major determinants of genome-wide patterns of TE CHH-methylation. Here we instead focus on CHH-methylation of individual TEs and TE-families, allowing us to identify the pathways involved in CHH-methylation simply from natural variation and confirm the associations by comparing them with mutant phenotypes. Methylation at TEs targeted by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is unaffected by CMT2 variation, but is strongly affected by variation at NRPE1, which is largely responsible for the longitudinal cline in this phenotype. In contrast, CMT2-targeted TEs are affected by both loci, which jointly explain 7.3% of the phenotypic variation (13.2% of total genetic effects). There is no longitudinal pattern for this phenotype, however, because the geographic patterns appear to compensate for each other in a pattern suggestive of stabilizing selection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDNA methylation is a major component of transposon silencing, and essential for genomic integrity. Recent studies revealed large-scale geographic variation as well as the existence of major trans-acting polymorphisms that partly explained this variation. In this study, we re-analyze previously published data (The 1001 Epigenomes), focusing on de novo DNA methylation patterns of individual TEs and TE families rather than on genome-wide averages (as was done in previous studies). GWAS of the patterns reveals the underlying regulatory networks, and allowed us to comprehensively characterize trans-regulation of de novo DNA methylation and its role in the striking geographic pattern for this phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae, has plagued humanity for thousands of years and continues to cause morbidity, disability and stigmatization in two to three million people today. Although effective treatment is available, the disease incidence has remained approximately constant for decades so new approaches, such as vaccine or new drugs, are urgently needed for control. Research is however hampered by the pathogens obligate intracellular lifestyle and the fact that it has never been grown in vitro. Consequently, despite the availability of its complete genome sequence, fundamental questions regarding the biology of the pathogen, such as its metabolism, remain largely unexplored. In order to explore the metabolism of the leprosy bacillus with a long-term aim of developing a medium to grow the pathogen in vitro, we reconstructed an in silico genome scale metabolic model of the bacillus, GSMN-ML. The model was used to explore the growth and biomass production capabilities of the pathogen with a range of nutrient sources, such as amino acids, glucose, glycerol and metabolic intermediates. We also used the model to analyze RNA-seq data from M. leprae grown in mouse foot pads, and performed Differential Producibility Analysis (DPA) to identify metabolic pathways that appear to be active during intracellular growth of the pathogen, which included pathways for central carbon metabolism, co-factor, lipids, amino acids, nucleotides and cell wall synthesis. The GSMN-ML model is thereby a useful in silico tool that can be used to explore the metabolism of the leprosy bacillus, analyze functional genomic experimental data, generate predictions of nutrients required for growth of the bacillus in vitro and identify novel drug targets.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMycobacterium leprae, the obligate human pathogen is uncultivable in axenic growth medium, and this hinders research on this pathogen, and the pathogenesis of leprosy. The development of novel therapeutics relies on the understanding of growth, survival and metabolism of this bacterium in the host, the knowledge of which is currently very limited. Here we reconstructed a metabolic network of M. leprae-GSMN-ML, a powerful in silico tool to study growth and metabolism of the leprosy bacillus. We demonstrate the application of GSMN-ML to identify the metabolic pathways, and metabolite classes that M. leprae utilizes during intracellular growth.",

    "abstract": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multi-system disorder caused by CTG repeats in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. This leads to sequestration of the splicing factor, muscleblind-like 2 (MBNL2), and aberrant splicing, mainly in the central nervous system. We investigated the splicing patterns of MBNL1/2 and genes controlled by MBNL2 in several regions of the brain and between the grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in DM1 patients using RT-PCR. Compared with the control, the percentage of spliced-in parameter (PSI) for most of the examined exons were significantly altered in most of the brain regions of DM1 patients, except for the cerebellum. The splicing of many genes was differently regulated between the GM and WM in both DM1 and control. The level of change in PSI between DM1 and control was higher in the GM than in the WM. The differences in alternative splicing between the GM and WM may be related to the effect of DM1 on the WM of the brain. We hypothesize that in DM1, aberrantly spliced isoforms in the neuronal cell body of the GM may not be transported to the axon. This might affect the WM as a consequence of Wallerian degeneration secondary to cell body damage. Our findings may have implications for analysis of the pathological mechanisms and exploring potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "To escape or alleviate low temperatures in winter, insects have evolved many behavioral and physiological strategies. The rice pest insect, the purple stem borer, Sesamia inferens (Walker) is currently reported to be expanding their northern distributions and causing damage to summer maize in Xinxiang, China. However, their method of coping with the lower temperature in the new northern breeding area in winter is largely unknown. This paper investigates the overwinter site of S. inferens, and identifies the cold hardiness of larvae collected from a new breeding area in winter and explores a potential distribution based on low temperature threshold and on species distribution model, MaxEnt. The results show that the overwintering location of the S. inferens population is more likely to be underground with increasing latitude and,in the north, with the temperature decreasing, the larvae gradually moved down the corn stalk and drilled completely underground by February 18th. Those who were still above ground were all winterkilled. The cold hardiness test shows the species is a moderate freeze-tolerant one, and Supercooling Points (SCP), Freezing Points (FP) and mortality rate during the middle of winter (January, SCP: -7.653, FP: -6.596) were significantly lower than early winter (October) or late winter (March). Distribution in the new expansion area was predicted and the survival probability area was below N 35{degrees} for the Air Lower Lethal Temperature (ALLT50) and below N 40{degrees} for the Underground Lower Lethal Temperature (ULLT50), The suitable habitat areas for S. inferens with MaxEnt were also below N 40{degrees}. This study suggests the overwinter strategies have led to the colonization of up to a five degree more northerly overwintering latitude. This behavior of S. inferens could help maize producers to propose a control method to increase pest mortality by extracting the maize stubble after harvest.",

    "abstract": "Confronted with the challenge of understanding population-level processes, disease ecologists and epidemiologists often simplify quantitative data into distinct physiological states (e.g. susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered). However, data defining these states often fall along a spectrum rather than into clear categories. Hence, the host-pathogen relationship is more accurately defined using quantitative data, often integrating multiple diagnostic measures, just as clinicians do to assess their patients. We use quantitative data on a bacterial infection (Leptospira interrogans) in California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) to improve both our individual-level and population-level understanding of this host-pathogen system. We create a \\\"host-pathogen space\\\" by mapping multiple biomarkers of infection (e.g. serum antibodies, pathogen DNA) and disease state (e.g. serum chemistry values) from 13 longitudinally sampled, severely ill individuals to visualize and characterize changes in these values through time. We describe a clear, unidirectional trajectory of disease and recovery within this host-pathogen space. Remarkably, this trajectory also captures the broad patterns in larger cross-sectional datasets of 1456 wild sea lions in all states of health. This mapping framework enables us to determine an individuals location in their time-course since initial infection, and to visualize the full range of clinical states and antibody responses induced by pathogen exposure, including severe acute disease, chronic subclinical infection, and recovery. We identify predictive relationships between biomarkers and outcomes such as survival and pathogen shedding, and in certain cases we can impute values for missing data, thus increasing the size of the useable dataset. Mapping the host-pathogen space and using quantitative biomarker data provides more nuanced approaches for understanding and modeling disease dynamics in a system, yielding benefits for the clinician who needs to triage patients and prevent transmission, and for the disease ecologist or epidemiologist wishing to develop appropriate risk management strategies and assess health impacts on a population scale.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA pathogen can cause a range of disease severity across different host individuals, and these presentations change over the time-course from infection to recovery. These facts complicate the work of epidemiologists and disease ecologists seeking to understand the factors governing disease spread, often working with cross-sectional data. Recognizing these facts also highlights the shortcomings of classical approaches to modeling infectious disease, which typically rely on discrete and well-defined disease states. Here we show that by analyzing multiple biomarkers of health and infection simultaneously, treating these values as quantitative rather than binary indicators, and including a modest amount of longitudinal sampling of hosts, we can create a map of the host-pathogen interaction that shows the full spectrum of disease presentations and opens doors for new insights and predictions. By accounting for individual variation and capturing changes through time since infection, this mapping framework enables more robust interpretation of cross-sectional data; e.g., to detect predictive relationships between biomarkers and key outcomes such as survival, or to assess whether observed disease is associated with the pathogen of interest. This approach can help epidemiologists, ecologists and clinicians to better study and manage the many infectious diseases that exhibit complex relationships with their hosts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmerging mosquito-borne viruses like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya pose a major threat to public health, especially in low-income regions of Central and South America, southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. Outbreaks of these diseases are likely to have long-term social and economic consequences due to Zika-induced congenital microcephaly and other complications. Larval control of the container-inhabiting mosquitoes that transmit these infections is an important tool for mitigating outbreaks. However, metapopulation theory suggests that spatiotemporally uneven larvicide treatment can impede control effectiveness, as recolonization compensates for mortality within patches. Coordinating the timing of treatment among patches could therefore substantially improve epidemic control, but we must also consider economic constraints, since coordination may have costs that divert resources from treatment.\\n\\nMethodology/Principle FindingsTo inform practical disease management strategies, we ask how coordination among neighbors in the timing of mosquito control efforts influences the size of a mosquito-borne infectious disease outbreak under the realistic assumption that coordination has costs. Using an SIR/metapopulation model of mosquito and disease dynamics, we examine whether larvicide treatment triggered by surveillance information from neighboring patches reduces human infections when incorporating coordination costs. We examine how different types of coordination costs and different surveillance methods jointly influence the effectiveness of larval control. We find that the effect of coordination depends on both costs and the type of surveillance used to inform treatment. With epidemiological surveillance, coordination improves disease outcomes, even when costly. With demographic surveillance, coordination either improves or hampers disease control, depending on the type of costs and surveillance sensitivity.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceOur results suggest coordination among neighbors can improve management of mosquito-borne epidemics under many, but not all, assumptions about costs. Therefore, estimating coordination costs is an important step for most effectively applying metapopulation theory to strategies for managing outbreaks of mosquito-borne viral infections.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMosquito-borne viruses, such as Zika, are an urgent public health threat, particularly in tropical, low-income regions. Vector control, the main strategy for combatting outbreaks, can be challenging because the urban-adapted, container-breeding mosquitoes that transmit these viruses often exhibit metapopulation dynamics, where mortality in one population is compensated by migration from neighboring populations. The timing and spatial distribution of vector control efforts can therefore have a large impact on their efficacy. Using a model of virus transmission and vector population dynamics, we demonstrate that local mosquito control initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of Zika and other mosquito-borne infections are most effective when there is communication of surveillance findings among neighboring control agencies and coordination over the timing of mosquito reduction treatments. We find that local communication improves epidemic outcomes even when it imposes costs to resource-limited control agencies due to gains in the efficiency of mosquito control from spatial coordination.",

    "abstract": "Beijing strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (lineage2) have been associated with drug-resistance and transmission of tuberculosis worldwide. Most of the Beijing strains identified in the Colombian pacific coast exhibited a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype, in contrast with the phenotype observed in Beijing isolates from other South-American countries. We wanted to evaluate the clonality and genetic background of the Beijing strains isolated in Colombia that belong mostly to the spoligo-international type (SIT) 190. Out of 37 Beijing stains characterized in an 8-years period, we identified five Beijing clones; 36 that belong to the SIT190 type and only one to SIT1. Two loci in VNTR typing: MIRU 39 and QUB11b exhibited the highest level of variation among these strains. Out of the 37 Beijing strains, only one was drug susceptible, 28 represented MDR-TB, four extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) and four pre-XDR-TB. The mutations rpoB S531L and katG S315T1 were the most common among the MDR strains as reported elsewhere. Whole genome sequencing analysis allowed us to classify them as modern lineage Beijing strains, sharing up to 76 out of the 275 SNPs described in Beijing strains, as identified worldwide by Schurch et al; including 54 non-synonymous SNPs and 23 silent mutations. We were also able to confirm the presence of 8 specific SNPs that were so far only found in the Beijing strains from Colombia. The presence of modern Beijing strains, most of them representing MDR-TB, suggests a different origin of this M. tuberculosis lineage compared to other Beijing strains found in neighboring countries, such as Peru. The specific 8-SNP signature confirmed the identity of these Colombian Beijing MDR strains. This work may serve as a genetic baseline to study the evolution and spread of M. tuberculosis Beijing strains in Colombia, which play an important role in the control of MDR-TB.",

    "abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, Flavivirus genus, which includes several important human pathogens. It is responsible for neurological symptoms that may cause permanent disability or death, and, from a medical point of view, is the major arbovirus in Central/Northern Europe and North-eastern Asia. TBEV tropism is critical for neuropathogenesis, yet, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that govern the susceptibility of human brain cells to the virus. In this study, we sought to establish and characterize a new in vitro model of TBEV infection in the human brain and to decipher cell type-specific innate immunity and its relation to TBEV tropism and neuropathogenesis. We showed that infection of neuronal/glial cultures derived from human fetal neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) mimicked three major hallmarks of TBEV infection in the human brain, namely, preferential neuronal tropism, neuronal death and astrogliosis. We also showed that these cells had conserved their capacity to build an antiviral response against TBEV. TBEV-infected neuronal/glial cells, therefore, represented a highly relevant pathological model. By enriching the cultures in either human neurons or astrocytes, we further demonstrated qualitative and quantitative differential innate immune responses in the two cell types that correlated with their particular susceptibility to TBEV. Our results thus reveal that cell type-specific innate immunity is likely to contribute to shaping TBEV tropism for human brain cells. They offer a new in vitro model to further study TBEV-induced neuropathogenesis and improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which neurotropic viruses target and damage human brain cells.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a neurotropic Flavivirus that is responsible for encephalitis in humans, is of growing concern in Europe. Indeed, over the last two decades the number of reported cases has continuously increased and the virus has spread into new geographical areas. Whereas it is well established that neurons are the main target of TBEV in the human brain, the mechanisms that underlie this preferential tropism have not yet been elucidated. Here, we used neuronal/glial cells derived from human fetal neural progenitors to establish and characterize a new in vitro pathological model that mimics major hallmarks of TBEV infection in vivo; namely, neuronal tropism, neuronal death and astrogliosis. Using this highly relevant model, we showed that human neurons and astrocytes were both capable of developing an innate immune response against TBEV, but with dissimilar magnitudes that correlated with differential susceptibility to TBEV. Our results thus revealed that TBEV tropism for subsets of human brain cells is likely to depend on cell-type specific innate immunity. This improves our understanding of the mechanisms by which neurotropic viruses target and damage human brain cells and may help guide development of future therapies.",

    "abstract": "NGS studies have uncovered an ever-growing catalog of human variation while leaving an enormous gap between observed variation and experimental characterization of variant function. High-throughput screens powered by NGS have greatly increased the rate of variant functionalization, but the development of comprehensive statistical methods to analyze screen data has lagged behind. In the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), short barcodes are counted by sequencing DNA libraries transfected into cells and output RNA in order to simultaneously measure the shifts in transcription induced by thousands of genetic variants. These counts present many statistical challenges, including over-dispersion, depth dependence, and uncertain DNA concentrations. So far, the statistical methods used have been rudimentary, employing transformations on count level data and disregarding experimental and technical structure while failing to quantify uncertainty in the statistical model.\\n\\nWe have developed an extensive framework for the analysis of NGS functionalization screens available as an R package called malacoda (available from github.com/andrewGhazi/malacoda). Our software implements a probabilistic, fully Bayesian model of screen data. The model uses the negative binomial distribution with gamma priors to model sequencing counts while accounting for effects from input library preparation and sequencing depth. The method leverages the high-throughput nature of the assay to estimate the priors empirically. External annotations such as ENCODE data or DeepSea predictions can also be incorporated to obtain more informative priors - a transformative capability for data integration. The package also includes quality control and utility functions, including automated barcode counting and visualization methods.\\n\\nTo validate our method, we analyzed several datasets datasets using malacoda and alternative MPRA analysis methods. These data include experiments from the literature, simulated assays, and primary MPRA data. We also used luciferase assays to experimentally validate the strongest hits from our primary data, as well as variants for which the various methods disagree and variants detectable only with the aid of external annotations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryGenetic sequencing technology has progressed rapidly in the past two decades. Huge genomic characterization studies have resulted in a massive quantity of background information across the entire genome, including catalogs of observed human variation, gene regulation features, and computational predictions of genomic function. Meanwhile, new types of experiments use the same sequencing technology to simultaneously test the impact of thousands of mutations on gene regulation. While the design of experiments has become increasingly complex, the data analysis methods deployed have remained overly simplistic, often relying on summary measures that discard information. Here we present a statistical framework called for the analysis of massively parallel genomic experiments designed to incorporate prior information in an unbiased way. We validate our method by comparing our method to alternatives on simulated and real datasets, by using different types of assays that provide a similar type of information, and by closely inspecting an example experimental result that only our method detected. We also present the methods accompanying software package which provides and end-to-end pipeline that provides a simple interface for data preparation, analysis, and visualization.",

    "abstract": "Clubroot caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae is an important disease on cruciferous crops worldwide. Management of clubroot has been challenging, due largely to the millions of resting spores produced within an infected root that can survive dormant in the soil for many years. This study was conducted to investigate some of the environmental conditions that may affect the survival of resting spores in the soil. Soil samples containing clubroot resting spores (1 x 107 spores g-1 soil) were stored at various temperatures for two years. Additionally, other samples were buried in soil, or kept on the soil surface in the field. The content of P. brassicae DNA and the numbers of viable spores in the samples were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and pathogenicity bioassays, respectively. The results indicated that 4{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C and being buried in the soil were better conditions for spore survival than were -20{degrees}C, 30{degrees}C and at the soil surface. Most of the spores kept on the soil surface were killed, suggesting the negative effect of light on spore viability. Additional experiments confirmed that ultraviolet (UV) light contributed a large negative effect on spore viability as lower pathogenicity and less DNA content were observed from the 2-and 3-hour UV light treated spores compared to the untreated control. Finally, this work demonstrated that DNA-based quantification methods such as qPCR can be poor predictors of P. brassicae disease potential due to the presence and persistence of DNA from dead spores.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (GCs) are a functionally diverse neuron population that encodes and transmits distinct representations of the visual image on the retina to target nuclei in the brain. Independent studies of visually-evoked responses, cell morphology, and gene expression each suggest that GCs in mouse may comprise as many as forty distinct cell types. To date, only a subset of these types have been characterized in detail, and for most genetic access is still lacking. Thus, the majority of identified GC types remains inaccessible for targeted electrophysiology and functional imaging, precluding efficient studies of their response properties, and the cell-intrinsic mechanisms and presynaptic circuits that generate these properties. Here we show that an existing mouse line that is commonly used for studies of cortical inhibitory circuits - Somatostatin-IRES-Cre (Sst-Cre), consistently labels an understudied subset of four GC types with distinct visual responses. We characterized these types both anatomically and functionally using Cre-dependent reporter mouse lines and confocal fluorescence imaging, calcium imaging, and whole-cell electrophysiology. We show that one of the labeled GC types is suppressed by luminance contrast, while another matches a recently described orientation-selective GC type. Our results give new information about these two identified GC types, and establish the utility of the Sst-Cre transgenic mouse line for studies of recently identified GC circuits in the mouse retina.",

    "abstract": "Summary:Genetic methods for targeting small numbers of neurons of a specific type are critical for mapping the brain circuits underlying behavior. Existing methods can provide exquisite targeting precision in favorable cases, but for many cases alternative techniques will be required. Here, we introduce a new step-wise combinatorial method for sequentially refining neuronal targeting: Depending on the restriction achieved at the first step, a second step can be easily implemented to further refine expression. For both steps, the new method relies on two independent intersections. The primary intersection targets neurons based on their developmental origins (i.e. lineage) and terminal identities, while the second intersection limits the number of lineages represented in the primary intersection by selecting lineages with overlapping activity of two distinct enhancers during neurogenesis. Our method relies critically on two libraries of 134 transgenic fly lines that express fragments of a split Cre recombinase under the control of distinct neuroblast enhancers. The split Cre fragments are fused to non-interacting pairs of split inteins, which ensure reconstitution of full-length and active Cre when all fragments are expressed in the same cell. Our split Cre system, together with its open source libraries, represent off-the-shelf components that should facilitate the targeting and characterization of brain circuits in Drosophila. Our methodology may also prove useful in other genetic model organisms.",

    "abstract": "EDAR is a TNF receptor family member with roles in the development and growth of hair, teeth and glands. A derived allele of EDAR, single nucleotide variant rs3827760, encodes EDAR370A, a receptor with more potent signalling effects than the ancestral EDAR370V. This allele of rs3827760 is at very high frequency in modern East Asian and Native American populations as a result of ancient positive selection and has been associated with straighter, thicker hair fibres, alteration of tooth and ear shape, reduced chin protrusion and increased fingertip sweat gland density. Here we report the characterisation of another SNV in EDAR, rs146567337, encoding EDAR380R. The derived allele of this SNV is at its highest global frequency, of up to 5%, in populations of southern China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. Using haplotype analyses, we find that the rs3827760 and rs146567337 SNVs arose on distinct haplotypes and that rs146567337 does not show the same signs of positive selection as rs3827760. From functional studies in cultured cells, we find that EDAR380R displays increased EDAR signalling output, at a similar level to that of EDAR370A. The existence of a second SNV with partly overlapping geographic distribution, the same in vitro functional effect and similar evolutionary age as the derived allele of rs3827760, but of independent origin and not exhibiting the same signs of strong selection, suggests a northern focus of positive selection on EDAR function in East Asia.",
