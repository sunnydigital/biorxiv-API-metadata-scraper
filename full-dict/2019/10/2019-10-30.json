    "abstract": "Successful cell division relies on the faithful segregation of chromosomes. If chromosomes segregate prematurely the cell is at risk of aneuploidy. Alternatively, if cell division is attempted in the absence of complete chromosome segregation, non-segregated chromosomes can become trapped within the cleavage furrow and the cell can lose viability. Securin plays a key role in this process, acting as a pseudosubstrate to inhibit the protease separase that functions to cleave the cohesin rings that hold chromosomes together. Consequently, securin must be depleted ahead of anaphase, ensuring chromosome segregation occurs in time with the anaphase trigger. Here we find that MI mouse oocytes contain a large excess of securin over separase and reveal the existence of a novel mechanism that functions to promote the destruction of excess securin in prometaphase. Critically, this mechanism relies on key residues that are only exposed when securin is not bound to separase. We suggest that the majority of non-separase bound securin is removed by this mechanism, allowing for separase activity to be protected until just before anaphase. In addition, we further demonstrate the importance of complementary mechanisms of separase inhibition by directly measuring cleavage activity in live oocytes, confirming that both securin and inhibition by cyclin B1-Cdk1 are independently sufficient to prevent premature separase activation.",

    "abstract": "How satellite cells and their progenitors balance differentiation and self-renewal to achieve sustainable tissue regeneration is not well understood. A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty to study this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identified the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneity of satellite cells during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool. These findings have implications for therapeutic control of muscle regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Longevity is often associated with stress resistance, but whether they are causally linked is incompletely understood. Here we investigate chemosensory defective Caenorhabditis elegans mutants that are long-lived and stress resistant. We find that mutants in the intraflagellar transport protein gene osm-3 were significantly protected from tunicamycin-induced ER stress. While osm-3 lifespan extension is dependent on the key longevity factor DAF-16/FOXO, tunicamycin resistance was not. osm-3 mutants are protected from bacterial pathogens, which is pmk-1 p38 MAP kinase dependent while TM resistance was pmk-1 independent. Expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP) xenobiotic detoxification genes was elevated in osm-3 mutants and their knockdown or inhibition with verapamil suppressed tunicamycin resistance. The nuclear hormone receptor nhr-8 was necessary to regulate PGPs and tunicamycin resistance in a cholesterol-dependent fashion. We thus identify a cell-nonautonomous regulation of xenobiotic detoxification and show that separate pathways are engaged to mediate longevity, pathogen resistance, and xenobiotic detoxification in osm-3 mutants.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and beta-lactam drug resistance genes in Escherichia coli isolated from ready-to-eat lettuce, obtained from local supermarkets in Northern California. Bags of lettuce were purchased from 4 chain supermarkets during three different periods--Oct 2018-Jan 2019, Feb 2019-Apr 2019 and May 2019-July 2019. From 91 packages of lettuce, we recovered 34 E. coli isolates from 22 (24%) lettuce samples. All E. coli isolates were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and we found 15 distinct sequence types (STs). Five of these genotypes (ST2819, ST4600, ST2432, ST1198 and ST5143) have been reported to cause infection in humans. Twenty (59%) E. coli isolates were found resistant to at least one of the antibacterial drugs. They included resistance to ampicillin (AMP, 85%) and ampicillin/sulbactam (SAM, 50%), cefoxitin (FOX, 40%) and cefuroxime (CXM, 35%). We found 8 (40%) of 20 beta-lactam resistant E. coli isolates to carry blaCTX-M; 5 (25%) tested positive for blaSHV, while only 4 (20%) tested positive for blaTEM. Additionally, we identified a class A broad-spectrum beta-lactamase SED-1 gene, blaSED, reported by others in Citrobacter sedlakii isolated from bile of a patient. This study found that a large proportion of fresh lettuce carry beta-lactam drug-resistant E. coli, which could serve as a reservoir for drug resistance genes that could potentially enter pathogens to cause human infections.",

Individual Caenorhabditis elegans that are genetically identical and cultured in the same environment have different lifespans, suggesting a significant role of stochasticity in ageing. We have developed a novel microfluidic methodology to measure heat-shock response as a surrogate marker for heterogeneity associated with lifespan and have quantified the heat-shock response of C. elegans at the population, single individual, and tissue levels. We have further mathematically modelled our data to identify the major drivers determining such heterogeneity. This approach demonstrates that protein translation and degradation rate constants explain the individuality of the heat-shock time-course dynamic. We observed a decline of protein turnover capacity in early adulthood, co-incidentally occurring as the predicted proteostasis collapse. We identified a decline of intestinal response as the tissue that underlies the individual heterogeneity. Additionally, we verified that individuals with enhanced translation fidelity in early adulthood live longer. Altogether, our results reveal that the stochastic onset of proteostasis collapse of somatic tissues during early adulthood reflects individual protein translation capacity underlying heterogenic ageing of isogenic C. elegans.",

Within the realm of transposable elements (TEs) however, the spatial information of how genomes are folded is still only rarely integrated in experimental studies or accounted for in modelling. Here, we propose a new predictive modelling framework for the study of the integration patterns of TEs based on extensions of widely employed polymer models for genome organisation. Whilst polymer physics is recognised as an important tool to understand the mechanisms of genome folding, we now show that it can also offer orthogonal and generic insights into the integration and distribution profiles (or \\\"topography\\\") of TEs across organisms. Here, we present polymer physics arguments and molecular dynamics simulations on TEs inserting into heterogeneously flexible polymers and show with a simple model that polymer folding and local flexibility affects TE integration patterns. The preliminary discussion presented herein lay the foundations for a large-scale analysis of TE integration dynamics and topography as a function of the three-dimensional host genome.",

    "abstract": "Five table-top tasks were developed to test the visual search ability of children and young people in a real-world context, and to assess the transfer of training related improvements in visual search on computerised tasks to real-world activities. Each task involved searching for a set of target objects among distracting objects on a table-top. Performance on the Table-top Visual Search Ability Test for Children (TVSAT-C) was measured as the time spent searching for targets divided by the number of targets found. 108 typically developing children (3-11 years old) and 8 children with vision impairment (7-12 years old) participated in the study. A significant correlation was found between log-transformed age and log-transformed performance (R2 = 0.65, p = 4 x 10-26) in our normative sample, indicating a monomial power law relationship between age and performance with an exponent of -1.67, 95% CI [-1.90, -1.43]. We calculated age-dependent percentiles and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated the 3rd percentile as the optimal cut-off for detecting a visual search deficit, giving a specificity of 97.2%, 95% CI [92.2%, 99.1%] and sensitivity of 87.5%, 95% CI [52.9%, 97.8%] for the test. Further studies are required to calculate measures of reliability and external validity, to confirm sensitivity for visual search deficits, and to investigate the most appropriate response modes for participants with conditions that affect manual dexterity. Additionally, more work is needed to assess construct validity where semantic knowledge is required that younger children may not have experience with. We have made the protocol and age-dependent normative data available for those interested in using the test in research or practice, and to illustrate the smooth developmental trajectory of visual search ability during childhood.",

Using genetic models in mice we show that the increased proliferation of cardiomyocytes due to loss of the Hippo-signaling component SAV1 depends on the Myb-MuvB (MMB) complex. Similarly, proliferation of postnatal cardiomyocytes induced by constitutive active YAP requires MMB. Genome studies revealed that YAP and MMB regulate an overlapping set of cell cycle genes in cardiomyocytes. We find that YAP binds directly to B-MYB, a subunit of MMB, in a manner dependent on the YAP WW domains and a PPXY motif in B-MYB. Disruption of the interaction by overexpression of the YAP binding domain of B-MYB strongly inhibits the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. Our results point to MMB as a critical downstream effector of YAP in the control of cardiomyocyte proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Following the advent of immunotherapy as a possible cure for cancer, remarkable insight has been gained on the role of mutational load and neoantigens as key ingredients in T cell recognition of malignancies. However, not all highly mutational tumors react to immune therapies, and even initial success is often followed by eventual relapse. Recent research points out that high heterogeneity in the neoantigen landscape of a tumor might be key in understanding the failure of immune surveillance. In this work we present a mathematical framework able to describe how neoantigen distributions shape the immune response. Modeling T cell reactivity as a function of antigen dominancy and distribution across a tumor indicates the existence of a diversity threshold beyond which T cells fail at controling heterogeneous cancer growth. Furthemore, an analytical estimate for the evolution of average antigen clonality indicates rapid increases in epitope heterogeneity in early malignancy growth. In this scenario, we propose that therapies targeting the tumor prior to immunotherapy can reduce neoantigen heterogeneity, and postulate the existence of a time window, before tumor relapse due to de novo resistance, rendering immunotherapy more effective.\\n\\nMajor FindingsGenetic heterogeneity affects the immune response to an evolving tumor by shaping the neoantigen landscape of the cancer cells, and highly heterogeneous tumors seem to escape T cell recognition. Mathematical modeling predicts the existence of a well defined neoantigen diversity threshold, beyond which lymphocites are not able to counteract the growth of a population of highly heterogeneous subclones. Furthermore, evolutionary dynamics predict a fast decay of neoantigen clonality, rendering advanced tumors hard to attack at the time of immunotherapy. Within this mathematical framework we propose that targeted therapy forcing a selective pressure for resistance might as well increase neoantigen homogeneity, providing a novel possibility for combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "A self-generated touch feels less intense than an external touch of the exact same intensity. According to a prevalent computational theory of motor control, this attenuation occurs because the brain uses internal forward models to predict the somatosensory consequences of our movements using a copy of the motor command, i.e., the efference copy. These tactile predictions are then used to suppress the perceived intensity of the actual tactile feedback. Despite being highly influential, the core assumption of theory has never been tested; that is, whether the efference copy is necessary for somatosensory attenuation. A possible alternative hypothesis is that a predictable contact of two of ones own body parts is sufficient. Using a psychophysical task, we quantified the attenuation of touch applied on the participants left index finger when the touch was triggered by the active or passive movement of the participants right index finger and when it was externally generated in the absence of any movement. We observed somatosensory attenuation only when the touch was triggered by the voluntary movement of the participants finger. In contrast, during the passive movement, the intensity of the touch was perceived to be as strong as when the touch was externally triggered. In both active and passive movement conditions, the participants showed the same discrimination capacity. Electromyographic recordings confirmed minimal activity of the right hand during the passive movement. Together, our results suggest that the efference copy is necessary for computing the somatosensory predictions that produce the attenuation of self-generated touch.",

    "abstract": "Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) is a lipid droplet-associated protein which regulates cellular lipid storage and is highly expressed in the liver. Previous studies of a missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PLIN2, Ser251Pro, (i.e. rs3556875) have shown this SNP to cause decreased lipolysis and increased intracellular lipid accumulation. To explore if this SNP is associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we genotyped 116 adults with NASH and 67 age- and gender-matched controls. rs3556875 was significantly associated with NASH with an allelic odds ratio of 2.98 (95% confidence interval 1.12 - 7.31, p=0.02) and in a dominant inheritance model. In an in vitro model of hepatic steatosis, expression of the Pro251 variant protein led to phenotypic changes in intracellular lipid droplets, yielding smaller diameter and up to 7 fold more lipid droplets per cell when compared to wild type PLIN2. In conclusion, the Ser251Pro SNP of PLIN2 may convey risk for NASH and causes phenotypic changes in hepatocyte lipid droplets.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide studies have begun to elucidate the genomic basis of hypoxia, long-term cold and high saline and alkaline adaptation in highland fish, and a number of key genes contributed to its highland adaptation were identified. An increasing number of studies indicated that immune genes of Tibetan endemic fish species underwent positive selection towards functional shift, while the insight into immune gene repertoire of Tibetan highland fishes from genome-wide studies has largely lagged behind. In this study, we performed one of the first comparative genomics study in particular focusing on the signatures of immune genes in a highland fish, Gymnocypris przewalskii based on immune-relevant tissue transcriptome assemblies. We identified seven putative rapidly evolving immune genes with elevated molecular evolutionary rate (dN/dS) relative to lowland fish species. Using tissue-transcriptome data, we found most of rapidly evolving immune genes were broadly expressed in head-kidney, spleen, gills and skin tissues, which significantly enriched for complement activation and inflammatory response processes. In addition, we found a set of complement activation related genes underwent accelerated evolution and showed consistently repressed expression patterns in response to parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infection. Moreover, we detected a number of immune genes involved in adaptive immune system exhibited distinct signature of upregulated expression patterns after parasite infection. Taken together, this study provided putative transcriptomic signatures of rapidly evolving immune genes, and will gain the insight into Schizothoracine fish adaptation to high-altitude extreme aquatic environments including diversified pathogen challenge.",

    "abstract": "We present a method to incorporate structural results from neutron reflectometry, a technique that determines interfacial structures such as protein-membrane complexes at a solid surface, into molecular dynamics simulations. By analyzing component volume occupancy profiles, which describe the one-dimensional distribution of a particular molecular component within an interfacial architecture, we construct a real-space constraint in the form of a biasing potential for the simulation that vanishes when the simulated and experimental profiles agree. This approach improves the correspondence between simulation and experiment, as shown for an earlier investigation where an NR-derived structure was well captured by an independent MD simulation, and may lead to faster equilibration of ensemble structures. We further show that time averaging of the observable when biasing with this approach permits fluctuations about the average, which are necessary for conformational exploration of the protein. The method described here also provides insights into systems that are characterized by NR and MD when the two show slight differences in their profiles. This is particularly valuable for studies of proteins at interfaces that contain disordered regions since the conformation of such regions is difficult to judge from the analysis of one-dimensional experimental profiles and take prohibitively long to equilibrate in simulations.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide mapping of chromosomal distances relative to nuclear compartments using TSA-Seq suggests a more deterministic relationship between intranuclear gene position and expression as a function of nuclear speckle distance than radial position. Gene activity increases overall with decreasing distance to nuclear speckles, with active chromosomal regions forming the apex of chromosome loops protruding from the nuclear periphery into the interior. Interestingly, genomic distances to the nearest lamina-associated domain are larger for loop apexes mapping very close to nuclear speckles, suggesting the possibility of genomic \"hardwiring\" and conservation of speckle-associated regions. To facilitate comparison of genome organization relative to nuclear speckles in human K562, HCT116, HFFc6, and H1 cell lines, here we describe reducing the required cell number 10-20-fold for TSA-Seq by deliberately saturating protein-labeling while preserving distance mapping by the still unsaturated DNA-labeling. Surprisingly, in pair-wise cell line comparisons, only [~]10% of the genome shows a statistically significant shift in relative nuclear speckle distances. These modest shifts in nuclear speckle distance, however, tightly correlate with changes in cell-type specific gene expression. Similarly, half of all loci that contain induced heat-shock protein genes appear pre-positioned close to nuclear speckles, with the remaining showing small shifts towards speckles with transcriptional induction. Speckle association together with chromatin decondensation correlates with expression amplification upon HSPH1 activation. Our results demonstrate a largely \"hardwired\" genome organization and specific genes moving small mean distances relative to speckles during cell differentiation or physiological transition, suggesting an important role of nuclear speckles in gene expression regulation.",

    "abstract": "The genome of Plasmodium falciparum has one of the most skewed base pair compositions of any eukaryote, with an AT content of 80-90%. As start and stop codons are AT-rich, the probability of finding upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is high and parasite mRNAs have an average of 10 uORFs in their leader sequences. Similar to other eukaryotes, uORFs repress the translation of the downstream gene (dORF) in P. falciparum, yet the parasite translation machinery is able to bypass these uORFs and reach the dORF to initiate translation. This can happen by leaky scanning and/or reinitiation.\\n\\nIn this report, we assessed leaky scanning and reinitiation by studying the effect of uORFs on the translation of a dORF, in this case the luciferase reporter gene, and showed that both mechanisms are employed in the asexual blood stages of P. falciparum. Furthermore, in addition to codon usage of the uORF, translation of the dORF is governed by the Kozak sequence and length of the uORF, and inter-cistronic distance between the uORF and dORF. Based on these features whole genome data was analyzed to uncover classes of genes that might be regulated by uORFs. This study indicates that leaky scanning and reinitiation appear to be widespread in asexual stages of P. falciparum, which may require modifications of existing factors that are involved in translation initiation in addition to novel, parasite-specific proteins.",

Previous studies have identified the four base RNA motif UCUU as a common element in pre-mRNA targeted by RBM20. Here, we have determined the structure of the RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain from mouse RBM20 bound to RNA containing a UCUU sequence. The atomic details show that the RRM domain spans a larger region than initially proposed in order to interact with the complete UCUU motif, with a well-folded C-terminal helix encoded by exon 8 critical for high affinity binding. This helix only forms upon binding RNA with the final uracil, and removing the helix reduces affinity as well as specificity. We therefore find that RBM20 uses a coupled folding-binding mechanism by the C-terminal helix to specifically recognize the UCUU RNA motif.",

How unconstrained ncRNA levels impact RNA metabolism and gene expression are longstanding and important question. Here we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation.",

Novel domains of application define a new set of requirements that transcend accurate predictions and depend on uncertainty measures. The aims of this study are to implement Bayesian neural networks and use the corresponding uncertainty estimates to improve predictions and perform dataset analysis. We identify two main advantages in modeling the predictive uncertainty of deep neural networks performing classification tasks. The first is the possibility to discard highly uncertain predictions to increase model accuracy. The second is the identification of unfamiliar patterns in the data that correspond to outliers in the model representation of the training data distribution. Such outliers can be further characterized as either corrupted observations or data belonging to different domains. Both advantages are well demonstrated on benchmark datasets. Furthermore we apply the Bayesian approach to a biomedical imaging dataset where cancer cells are treated with diverse drugs, and show how one can increase classification accuracy and identify noise in the ground truth labels with uncertainty analysis.",

    "abstract": "The spatial structure and physical properties of the cytosol are not well understood. Measurements of the material state of the cytosol are challenging due to its spatial and temporal heterogeneity, the lack of truly passive probes, and the need for probes of many sizes to accurately describe the state across scales. Recent development of genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) has opened up study of the cytosol at the length scales of multiprotein complexes (20-60 nm). Using these probes to spatially resolve diffusivity of a cytoplasmic volume within a cell requires accurate and automated 3D tracking methods. We developed an image analysis pipeline for whole-cell imaging of GEMs in the context of large, multinucleate fungi where there is evidence of functional compartmentalization of the cytosol for both the nuclear division cycle and branching. We apply a neural network to track particles in 3D, generate surface meshes to project data on representations of the cell, and create dynamic visualizations of local diffusivities. Using this pipeline, we have found that there is remarkable variability in the properties of the cytosol both within a single cell and between cells. By analyzing the spatial diffusivity patterns, we saw an enrichment of low diffusivity zones at hyphal tips and near some nuclei. These results show that the physical state of the cytosol varies spatially within a single cell and exhibits significant cell-to-cell variability. Thus, molecular crowding contributes to heterogeneity within individual cells and across populations.",

These original species promote ecosystem multifunctionality, the ability to cope with an uncertain future, future benefits to society and therefore have a high conservation value. A potential signal of their extinction risks is their rarity (stating for geographic range-restriction in this study). On islands, life in isolation conducted to the rise of a multitude of original forms and functions as well as to high rates of endemism. Not only patterns and processes of insular originality are unexplained but the relationship between originality and rarity is still unknown. The aim of this study is to assess how original insular species are, to explore whether original species are rare or not and to investigate the factors that may explain the rarity of original species. We first compared the functional and evolutionary originality of monocotyledon species and whether continental or insular species were more original. We found that species restricted to islands were more original than continental species and, although functionally and evolutionary original species were dissimilar, many occurred on similar territories so that regional conservation strategies may allow to conserve these distinct forms. Yet, evolutionary original species were significantly more range-restricted than those which were distinct in their traits. Reflecting their rarity, evolutionary original species had low dispersal abilities and were found on islands where settlement may have been facilitated. On the opposite, functionally original species could reach a wider set of islands by being transported on long-distances. While some mechanisms may both explain rarity and originality such as extinctions, others may be specific to each of these biodiversity facets, in particular diversification, niche shift and expansion, and dispersal power. Implications for conservation are huge: original species are range-restricted and mostly found in the most threatened systems of the world, i.e. islands, endangering the reservoir of features against an uncertain future.",

    "abstract": "Optimal control strategies for human infections are often investigated by computational approaches using individual-based models (IBMs). These typically track humans and evaluate the impact of control interventions in terms of human deaths, clinical cases averted, interruption of transmission etc. Genetic selection can be incorporated into these IBMs and used to track the spread of mutations whose origin and spread are often driven by the intervention, and which subsequently undermine the control strategy; for example, mutations which encode antimicrobial drug resistance or diagnosis- or vaccine-escape phenotypes. Basic population genetic descriptions of selection are based on infinite population sizes (so that chance fluctuations in allele frequency are absent) but IBMs track finite population sizes. We describe how the finite sizes of IBMs affect simulating the dynamics of genetic selection and how best to incorporate genetic selection into these models. We use the OpenMalaria IBM of malaria as an example, but the same principles apply to IBMs of other diseases. We identify four strategies to incorporate selection into IBMs and make the following four recommendations. Firstly, calculate and report the selection coefficients, s, of the advantageous allele as the key genetic parameter. Secondly, use these values of  s to calculate the wait-time until a mutation successful establishes itself in the population. The wait time for the mutation can be added to speed of selection, s, to calculate when the mutation will reach significant, operationally important levels. Thirdly, quantify the ability of the IBM to robustly estimate small selection coefficients. Fourthly, optimise computational efficacy: when  s is small it is plausible that fewer replicates of larger IBMs will be more efficient than a larger number of replicates of smaller size.",

Bacteria migrating to lymph nodes and spleen, but not feces, were rapidly eliminated.

The MICs and MECs generated by the two methods were compared using concordance analysis.\\n\\nMicronaut-AM (MN) showed significant concordance (P< 0.0001) with CLSI method and overall agreement was high ([&ge;] 90%). In addition, Micronaut-AM produced echinocandin MECs results within 18-24h incubation time and reliably detected azole resistant isolates. Essential agreement (within 2 log2 dilution of median) between MN and CLSI reference laboratory method was 99 % for anidulafungin, 100 % for amphotericin; 90% for voriconazole and 87 % for itraconazole. Categorical agreement for anidulafungin, amphotericin B, voriconazole and itraconazole were 100%, 96%, 97% and 99% respectively.\\n\\nMicronaut-AM showed very good agreement with the reference broth micro-dilution method results for all antifungal agents tested and was able to detect azole resistance. This colorimetric method is very promising and appears to be a suitable alternative susceptibility testing method to labour intensive broth microdilution method for Aspergillus species.",

The FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) is a negative regulator of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a main driver of HPA axis regulation, and FKBP5 polymorphisms have been repeatedly linked to stress-related disorders in humans. However, the specific role of Fkbp5 in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in shaping HPA axis (re)activity remains to be elucidated. Using deletion, overexpression, and rescue of Fkbp5 exclusively in the PVN, we establish the fundamental importance of Fkbp5 in the HPA axis stress response. Furthermore, we show that Fkbp5 manipulation alters GR activation and elucidate the cellular complexity in the PVN, in which Fkbp5 operates.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine plays a crucial role in adaptive behavior, and dysfunctional dopamine is implicated in multiple psychiatric conditions characterized by inflexible or inconsistent choices. However, the precise relationship between dopamine and flexible decision making remains unclear. One reason is that, while many studies have focused on the activity of dopamine neurons, efficient dopamine signaling also relies on clearance mechanisms, notably the dopamine transporter (DAT), which predominates in striatum, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which predominates in cortex. The exact locus, extent, and timescale of the effects of DAT and COMT are uncertain. Moreover, there is limited data on how acute disruption of either mechanism affects flexible decision making strategies mediated by cortico-striatal networks. To address these issues, we combined pharmacological modulation of DAT and COMT with electrochemistry and behavior in mice. DAT blockade, but not COMT inhibition, regulated sub-second dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core, but surprisingly neither clearance mechanism affected evoked release in prelimbic cortex. This was not due to a lack of sensitivity, as both amphetamine and atomoxetine changed the kinetics of sub-second release. In a multi-step decision making task where mice had to respond to reversals in either reward probabilities or the choice sequence to reach the goal, DAT blockade selectively impaired, and COMT inhibition improved, performance after reward reversals, but neither manipulation affected the adaptation of choices after actionstate transition reversals. Together, our data suggest that DAT and COMT shape specific aspects of behavioral flexibility by regulating striatal and cortical dopamine, respectively, at fast and slow timescales.",

However, it remains unknown how inter-individual variability in the functional architecture of negative affective valence systems might relate to the anxiogenic response to CO2 challenge. In this pilot study, we explored how connectivity in systems associated with processing potential threat (\\\"anxiety\\\") correlated with behavioural measures of anxiety following prolonged CO2 inhalation.\\n\\nThe negative affective valence system was identified using a passive emotional face perception task. Spherical regions of interest were created from peak voxels of significant brain activation when 100 young adult participants viewed emotional faces compared with black and white concentric circles during a functional MRI scan. Using these regions of interest, generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analysis was undertaken to explore task-evoked functional connectivity in a separate group of 13 healthy volunteers. Within 7 days of the scan, these participants underwent CO2 challenge and results from the gPPI analysis were correlated with CO2 outcome measures.\\n\\nExposure to CO2 challenge significantly increased subjective anxiety, negative affect, systolic blood pressure and heart rate. Functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and right amygdala was positively correlated with heart rate. Increased connectivity between the vmPFC and the right amygdala, and decreased connectivity between the midcingulate cortex (MCC) and the left amygdala, correlated with subjective anxiety during CO2 challenge.\\n\\nResponse to CO2 challenge was related to task-evoked functional connectivity between regions known to be important in processing potential threat. Further studies are required to assess whether this translates into clinical populations. Measures of functional connectivity within emotional processing networks could be potential biomarkers to enable stratification of healthy volunteers, and to examine correlates of response, in trials using experimental medicine models.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of cortical connectivity likely contributes to loss of consciousness (LOC) during both sleep and general anesthesia, but the degree of overlap in the underlying mechanisms is unclear. Both sleep and anesthesia comprise states of varying levels of arousal and consciousness, including states of largely maintained consciousness (sleep: N1, REM; anesthesia: sedated but responsive) as well as states of substantially reduced consciousness (sleep: N2/N3; anesthesia: unresponsive). Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) cortical connectivity will reflect clear changes when transitioning into states of reduced consciousness, and (2) these changes are similar for arousal states of comparable levels of consciousness during sleep and anesthesia. Using intracranial recordings from five neurosurgical patients, we compared resting state cortical functional connectivity (as measured by weighted phase lag index) in the same subjects across arousal states during natural sleep [wake (WS), N1, N2, N3, REM] and propofol anesthesia [pre-drug wake (WA), sedated/responsive (S) and unresponsive (U)]. In wake states WS and WA, alpha-band connectivity within and between temporal, parietal and occipital regions was dominant. This pattern was largely unchanged in N1, REM and S. Transitions into states of reduced consciousness N2, N3 and U were characterized by dramatic and strikingly similar changes in connectivity, with dominant connections shifting to frontal cortex. We suggest that shifts from temporo-parieto-occipital to frontal cortical connectivity may reflect impaired sensory processing in states of reduced consciousness. The data indicate that functional connectivity can serve as a biomarker of arousal state and suggest common mechanisms of LOC in sleep and anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Many adults cannot voluntarily recall memories before the ages of 3-5, a phenomenon referred to as \"infantile amnesia\" The development of the hippocampal network likely plays a significant part in the emergence of the ability to form long-lasting memories. In adults, the hippocampus has specialized and privileged connections with certain cortical networks, which presumably facilitate its involvement in memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Is the hippocampus already specialized in these cortical connections at birth? And are the topographical principles of connectivity (e.g. long-axis specialization) present at birth? We analyzed resting-state hippocampal connectivity in neonates scanned within one week of birth (Developmental Human Connectome Project) and compared them to adults (Human Connectome Project). We explored the connections of the whole hippocampus and its long-axis specialization to seven canonical cortical networks. We found that the neonatal hippocampal networks show clear immaturity at birth: adults showed hippocampal connectivity that was unique for each cortical network, whereas neonates showed no differentiation in hippocampal connectivity across these networks. Further, neonates lacked long-axis specialization (i.e., along anterior-posterior axis) of the hippocampus in its differential connectivity patterns to the cortical networks. This immaturity in connectivity may contribute to immaturity in memory formation in the first years of life.\n\n\"New and Noteworthy\"While animal data, and anatomical and behavioral human data from young children suggest that the hippocampus is immature at birth, to date, there are no direct assessments of human hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) very early in life. Our study explores the FC of the hippocampus to the cortex at birth, allowing insight into the development of human memory systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a functional spiking-neuron model of human working memory (WM). This model combines neural firing for encoding of information with activity-silent maintenance. While it used to be widely assumed that information in WM is maintained through persistent recurrent activity, recent studies have shown that information can be maintained without persistent firing; instead, information can be stored in activity-silent states. A candidate mechanism underlying this type of storage is short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP), by which the strength of connections between neurons rapidly changes to encode new information. To demonstrate that STSP can lead to functional behavior, we integrated STSP by means of calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in a large-scale spiking-neuron model and added a decision mechanism. The model was used to simulate a recent study that measured behavior and EEG activity of participants in three delayed-response tasks. In these tasks, one or two visual gratings had to be maintained in WM, and compared to subsequent probes. The original study demonstrated that WM contents and its priority status could be decoded from neural activity elicited by a task-irrelevant stimulus displayed during the activity-silent maintenance period. In support of our model, we show that it can perform these tasks, and that both its behavior as well as its neural representations are in agreement with the human data. We conclude that information in WM can be effectively maintained in activity-silent states by means of calcium-mediated STSP.\n\nAuthor SummaryMentally maintaining information for short periods of time in working memory is crucial for human adaptive behavior. It was recently shown that the human brain does not only store information through neural firing - as was widely believed - but also maintains information in activity-silent states. Here, we present a detailed neural model of how this could happen in our brain through short-term synaptic plasticity: rapidly adapting the connection strengths between neurons in response to incoming information. By reactivating the adapted network, the stored information can be read out later. We show that our model can perform three working memory tasks as accurately as human participants can, while using similar mental representations. We conclude that our model is a plausible and effective neural implementation of human working memory.",

An integrated understanding of bacterial gene regulation in the host is dependent on multi-omic datasets, but these are largely lacking. Here, we simultaneously characterized the transcriptome and proteome of a foliar bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, in Arabidopsis thaliana and identified a number of bacterial processes influenced by plant immunity at the mRNA and the protein level. We found instances of both concordant and discordant regulation of bacterial mRNAs and proteins. Notably, the tip component of bacterial type III secretion system was selectively suppressed by the plant salicylic acid pathway at the protein level, suggesting protein-level targeting of the bacterial virulence system by plant immunity. Furthermore, gene co-expression analysis illuminated previously unknown gene regulatory modules underlying bacterial virulence and their regulatory hierarchy. Collectively, the integrated in planta bacterial omics approach provides molecular insights into multiple layers of bacterial gene regulation that contribute to bacterial growth in planta and elucidate the role of plant immunity in controlling pathogens.",

Recent machine learning algorithms show that gene expression data from blood and skin can provide reliable estimates of body time. However, for clinical viability, a biomarker must be easily measured and generalizable to a broad population. It is not clear that any circadian biomarker yet satisfies these criteria.\\n\\nResultsWe analyzed 24 h molecular rhythms in human dermis and epidermis at three distinct body sites, leveraging both longitudinal and population data. Circadian clock function was strongest in the epidermis, regardless of body site. We identified a 12-gene biomarker set that reported circadian phase to within 3 hours from a single sample of epidermis--the skins most superficial layer. This set performed well across body sites, ages, sexes, and detection platforms.\\n\\nConclusionsThis research shows that the clock in epidermis is more robust than dermis regardless of body site. To encourage ongoing validation of this biomarker in diverse populations, diseases, and experimental designs, we developed SkinPhaser--a user-friendly app to test biomarker performance in datasets (https://github.com/gangwug/SkinPhaser).",

For the analysis of phylogenetic relationships and introgressive hybridization between the species of the genus Salvelinus including three endemic species from Lake Elgygytgyn and all main representatives of the S. alpinus - S. malma species complex, nucleotide sequences of mtDNA control region (960 bp) and two nuclear genes (ITS1 (581 bp) and RAG1 (899 bp)) were analyzed. The differences in the topologies of individual gene trees, among others reasons, were connected with incomplete lineage sorting and historical introgressive hybridization between certain taxa. Several cases of mtDNA capture by different taxa and phylogenetic groups were proposed. In particular, the following taxa participated in introgressive hybridization: northern Dolly Varden S. m. malma, representatives of the S. alpinus complex (including mainly Taranets charr S. a. taranetzi), southern Dolly Varden S. m. lordi from North America and bull trout S. confluentus. Main phylogenetic groups of the S. alpinus - S. malma species complex were revised.

This seasonal variation is inherent to river-floodplain systems and establishes a natural pattern of these ecosystems that has frequently been observed in nature. One particular river-floodplain system of interest is the Upper Parana River and its floodplain, whose upstream contains a reservoir cascade that caused profound alterations on its flooding regime by having diminished flood magnitude, but increased its frequency. In this study, I sought to explore the flood pulse condition in the Upper Parana River Floodplain by using a set of state-of-the-art spectral and non-linear analyses and a time series of water level fluctuations (1968-2017) from this system. I divided the data into four periods: i) natural regime period, ii) transitional period, iii) dam cascade period, and iv) Primaveras dam period. Spectral analysis demonstrated a decrease in the annual cycle amplitude, reflected in its power spectrum, which means a weakening in the difference between flood and drought events. Additionally, nonlinear dynamical analysis revealed a less deterministic and predicable behavior leading to more erratic fluctuations jeopardizing the temporal heterogeneity of that system.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is an important feature of biological systems that is likely to play a major role in the future adaptation of organisms to the ongoing global changes. It may allow an organism to produce alternative phenotypes in responses to environmental cues. Modifications in the phenotype can be reversible but are sometimes enduring and can even span over generations. The notion of phenotypic plasticity was conceptualized in the early 20th century by Richard Woltereck. He introduced the idea that the combined relations of a phenotypic character and all environmental gradients that influence on it can be defined as \\\"norm of reaction\\\". Norms of reaction are specific to species and to lineages within species, and they are heritable. He postulated that reaction norms can progressively be shifted over generations depending on the environmental conditions. One of his biological models was the water-flee daphnia. Woltereck proposed that enduring phenotypic modifications and gene mutations could have similar adaptive effects, and he postulated that their molecular bases would be different. Mutations occurred in genes, while enduring modifications were based on something he called the Matrix. He suggested that this matrix (i) was associated with the chromosomes, (ii) that it was heritable, (iii) it changed during development of the organisms, and (iv) that changes of the matrix could be simple chemical substitutions of an unknown, but probably polymeric molecule. We reasoned that the chromatin has all postulated features of this matrix and revisited Wolterecks classical experiments with daphnia. We developed a robust and rapid ATAC-seq technique that allows for analyzing chromatin of individual daphnia and show here (i) that this technique can be used with minimal expertise in molecular biology, and (ii) we used it to identify open chromatin structure in daphnia exposed to different environmental cues. Our result indicates that chromatin structure changes consistently in daphnia upon this exposure confirming Wolterecks classical postulate.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are deemed either lytic (virulent) or temperate, respectively depending on whether their genomes are transmitted solely horizontally, or both horizontally and vertically. To elucidate the ecological and evolutionary conditions under which natural selection will favor the evolution and maintenance of lytic or temperate modes of phage replication and transmission, we use a comprehensive mathematical model of the dynamics of temperate and virulent phage in populations of bacteria sensitive and resistant to these viruses. For our numerical analysis of the properties of this model, we use parameters estimated with the temperate bacteriophage Lambda, {lambda}, its clear and virulent mutants, and E. coli sensitive and resistant - refractory to these phages. Using batch and serial transfer population dynamic and reconstruction experiments, we test the hypotheses generated from this theoretical analysis. Based on the results of this jointly theoretical and experimental study, we postulate the conditions under which natural selection will favor the evolution and maintenance of lytic and temperate modes of phage replication and transmission. A compelling and novel prediction this in silico, in vitro, and in plastico study makes is lysogenic bacteria from natural populations will be resistant-refractory to the phage for which they are lysogenic as well as lytic phage sharing the same receptors as these temperate viruses.",

    "abstract": "When populations colonize new habitats, they are likely to experience novel environmental conditions, and as a consequence may experience strong selection. While selection and the resulting evolutionary responses may have important implications for establishment success in colonizing populations, few studies have estimated selection in such scenarios. Here we examined evidence of selection in recently established plant populations in two prairie restorations in close proximity (< 15 km apart) using two approaches: 1) we tested for evidence of past selection on a suite of traits in two Chamaecrista fasciculata populations by comparing the restored populations to each other and their shared source population in common gardens to quantify evolutionary responses and 2) we measured selection in the field. We found evidence of past selection on flowering time, specific leaf area, and root nodule production in one of the populations, but detected contemporary selection on only one trait (plant height). This demonstrates that while selection can occur in colonizing populations, resulting in significant evolutionary responses in less than 6 generations, rapid evolutionary responses may be weak in even nearby populations sown with the same source population. Because contemporary measures of selection rarely predicted observed evolutionary responses, it also suggests that selection likely differs over the early stages of succession that characterize young prairies.",

Here we show that SPONV can cause significant fetal harm, including demise, comparable to ZIKV, in a mouse model of vertical transmission. Following maternal inoculation, we detected infectious SPONV in placentas and fetuses, along with significant fetal and placental histopathology, together indicating vertical transmission. To test vector competence, we exposed Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes to SPONV-infected bloodmeals. Aedes aegypti could efficiently transmit SPONV, whereas Culex quinquefasciatus could not. Our results suggest that SPONV has the same features that made ZIKV a public health risk.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic neuroinflammation is recognized as a major neuropathological hallmark in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Frontal Temporal Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and prion diseases. Both microglia and astrocytes exhibit region-specific homeostatic transcriptional identities, which under chronic neurodegeneration, transform into reactive phenotypes in a region- and disease-specific manner. Little is known about region-specific identity of glia in prion diseases. The current study was designed to determine whether the region-specific homeostatic signature of glia changes with the progression of prion diseases, and whether these changes occur in a region-dependent or universal manner. Also of interest was whether different prion strains give rise to different reactive phenotypes.\\n\\nMethodsTo answer these questions, we analyzed gene expression in thalamus, cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus of mice infected with 22L and ME7 prion strains using Nanostring Neuroinflammation panel at subclinical, early clinical and advanced stages of the disease.\\n\\nResultsWe found that at the preclinical stage of the disease, region-specific homeostatic identities were preserved. However, with the appearance of clinical signs, region-specific signatures were partially lost and replaced with a neuroinflammation signature. While the same sets of genes were activated by both prion strains, the timing of neuroinflammation and the degree of activation in different brain regions was strain-specific. Changes in astrocyte function scored at the top of activated pathways. Moreover, clustering analysis suggested that the astrocyte function pathway responded to prion infection prior to activated microglia or neuron and neurotransmission pathways.\\n\\nConclusionsThe current work established neuroinflammation gene expression signature associated with prion diseases. Our results illustrate that with the disease progression, the region-specific homeostatic transcriptome signatures are replaced by region-independent neuroinflammation signature, which was common for prion strains with different cell tropism. The prion-associated neuroinflammation signature identified in the current study overlapped only partially with the microglia degenerative phenotype and the disease-associated microglia phenotype reported for animal models of other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Survival in complex environments necessitates a flexible navigation system that incorporates memory of recent behavior and associations. Yet, how the hippocampal spatial circuit represents latent information independent of sensory inputs and future goals has not been determined. To address this, we imaged the activity of large ensembles in subregion CA1 via wide-field fluorescent microscopy during a novel behavioral paradigm. Our results demonstrated that latent information is represented through reliable firing rate changes during unconstrained navigation. We then hypothesized that the representation of latent information in CA1 is mediated by pattern separation/completion processes instantiated upstream within the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 subregions. Indeed, CA3 ensemble recordings revealed an analogous code for latent information. Moreover, selective chemogenetic inactivation of DG-CA3 circuitry completely and reversibly abolished the CA1 representation of latent information. These results reveal a causal and specific role of DG-CA3 circuitry in the maintenance of latent information within the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Transmembrane chloride gradients govern the efficacy and polarity of GABA signaling in neurons and are usually maintained by the activity of cation chloride cotransporters, such as KCC2 and NKCC1. Whereas their role is well established in cortical principal neurons, it remains poorly documented in GABAergic interneurons. We used complementary electrophysiological approaches to compare the effects of GABAAR activation in adult mouse hippocampal parvalbumin interneurons (PV INs) and pyramidal cells (PCs). Loose cell attached, tight-seal and gramicidin-perforated patch recordings all show GABAAR-mediated transmission is slightly depolarizing and yet inhibitory in both PV INs and PCs. Focal GABA uncaging in whole-cell recordings reveal that KCC2 and NKCC1 are functional in both PV INs and PCs but differentially contribute to transmembrane chloride gradients in their soma and dendrites. Blocking KCC2 function depolarizes the reversal potential of GABAAR-mediated currents in PV INs and PCs, often beyond firing threshold, showing KCC2 is essential to maintain the inhibitory effect of GABAARs. Finally, we show that repetitive 10 Hz activation of GABAARs in both PV INs and PCs leads to a progressive decline of the postsynaptic response independently of the ion flux direction or KCC2 function. This suggests intraneuronal chloride buildup may not predominantly contribute to activity-dependent plasticity of GABAergic synapses in this frequency range. Altogether our data demonstrate similar mechanisms of chloride regulation in mouse hippocampal PV INs and PCs and suggest KCC2 downregulation in the pathology may affect the valence of GABA signaling in both cell types.\\n\\nKey point summaryO_LICation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) play a critical role in controlling the efficacy and polarity of GABAA receptor (GABAAR)-mediated transmission in the brain, yet their expression and function in GABAergic interneurons has been overlooked.\\nC_LIO_LIWe compared the polarity of GABA signaling and the function of CCCs in mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons.\\nC_LIO_LIUnder resting conditions, GABAAR activation was mostly depolarizing and yet inhibitory in both cell types.

Previous identification of focal brain regions necessary for production focused primarily on associations with the content produced by speakers with chronic stroke, where function may have shifted to other regions after reorganization occurred. Here, we relate patterns of brain damage with deficits to the content and structure of spontaneous connected speech in 52 speakers during the acute stage of a left hemisphere stroke. Multivariate lesion behavior mapping demonstrated that damage to temporal-parietal regions impacted the ability to retrieve words and produce them within increasingly complex combinations. Damage primarily to inferior frontal cortex affected the production of syntactically accurate structure. In contrast to previous work, functional-anatomical dissociations did not depend on lesion size likely because acute lesions were smaller than typically found in chronic stroke. These results are consistent with predictions from theoretical models based primarily on evidence from language comprehension and highlight the importance of investigating individual differences in brain-language relationships in speakers with acute stroke.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between brain structure, function and self-reports has hardly been addressed until now in meditation research. Here we demonstrate such relationship, using Mindfulness meditation (MM). MM aims to reduce thought-related processes and enhance bodily awareness, thereby reducing identification with thought content and deconstructing maladaptive self-schema. We thus hypothesized that structure of the default mode network (DMN) regions, associated with spontaneous thoughts and self-representation, would negatively correlate with MM experience and self-reported positive affect, while positively correlating with DMN resting-state function.\\n\\nCross-sectionally comparing a unique group of adept MM practitioners and meditation-naive matched controls using voxel based morphometry revealed that gray matter (GM) density of the left precuneus (L-Prc) was negatively correlated with MM expertise. Furthermore, GM density of the L-Prc was positively correlated with resting state and task related functional (fMRI) measures within the L-Prc in the MM practitioners, but not in the controls. Finally, the L-Prcs GM density negatively correlated with positive affect across all participants.\\n\\nOur findings may shed light on understanding structure-function-self reports relationship. While our approach enables studying suggestive correlations in expert MM practitioners, longitudinal studies are required for direct insights concerning the question of causality.\\n\\nSignificance statementUnderstanding the relationship between brain structure and function, individual differences and self-reports, is an important goal of neuroscience. Yet, these factors were hardly investigated together in meditation research. The precuneus is part of the default mode network (DMN) involved in thought related processes. Mindfulness meditation (MM) is a mental practice aiming to reduce thought related processes. Here, by cross-sectionally comparing adept meditators and controls, we found that in the precuneus of MM practitioners, structure associated with function. Overall, structure negatively correlated with practice length, as well as with positive affect scores. The structure-function correlation was only significant in the meditators group, possibly implying that prolonged meditation improved structure and function attunement in the DMN. More generally, this study demonstrates that mental practice can be related to conjoint structural and functional effects, as well as to affective self-reports.",

    "abstract": "Hemispatial neglect, after unilateral lesions to parietal brain areas, is characterized by an inability to respond to unexpected stimuli in contralesional space. As the visual fields horizontal meridian is most severely affected, the brain networks controlling visuospatial processes might be tuned explicitly to this axis. We investigated such a potential directional tuning in the dorsal and ventral frontoparietal attention networks, with a particular focus on attentional reorientation. We used an orientation-discrimination task where a spatial pre-cue indicated the target position with 80% validity. Healthy participants (n = 29) performed this task in two runs and were required to (re-)orient attention either only along the horizontal or the vertical meridian, while fMRI and behavioral measures were recorded. By using a General Linear Model for behavioral and fMRI data, Dynamic Causal Modeling for effective connectivity, and other predictive approaches, we found strong statistical evidence for a reorientation effect for horizontal and vertical runs. However, neither neural nor behavioral measures differed between vertical and horizontal reorienting. Moreover, models from one run successfully predicted the cueing condition in the respective other run. Our results suggest that activations in the dorsal and ventral attention networks represent higher-order cognitive processes related to spatial attentional (re-)orientating that are independent of directional tuning.",

Reinforcement learning (RL) models offer a framework to define changes in outcome expectations in a formal way by computing the prediction error (PE). This study quantifies the updating of expectations by PEs in SAD and investigates alterations in RL regions associated with PE signaling.\\n\\nMETHOD48 adult participants (24 diagnosed with SAD and 24 age-, gender-, and education- matched healthy controls (HC)) underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while learning from probabilistic feedback.

These findings provide the first evidence that PE signaling during social performance situations in SAD is associated with hypersensitive response signatures in DMPFC, a brain region associated with using others value standards as a proxy for ones own value standards. Dynamic Causal Modelling further revealed that RPE-modulated connectivity from ventral pallidum to DMPFC during observation was reduced in SAD.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThe present results corroborate a crucial role of DMPFC in SAD, which corresponds to dysfunctional expectations about others alleged performance standards that play a prominent role in current models of the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic changes in climate, land use and disturbance regimes, as well as introductions of non-native species can lead to the transformation of many ecosystems. The resulting novel ecosystems are usually characterized by species assemblages that have not occurred previously in a given area. Quantifying the ecological novelty of communities (i.e. biotic novelty) would enhance the understanding of environmental change. However, quantification remains challenging since current novelty metrics, such as the number and/or proportion of non-native species in a community, fall short of considering both functional and evolutionary aspects of biotic novelty. Here, we propose the Biotic Novelty Index (BNI), an intuitive and flexible multidimensional measure that combines (1) functional differences between native and non-native introduced species with (2) temporal dynamics of species introductions. We show that the BNI is an additive partition of Raos quadratic entropy, capturing the novel interaction component of the communitys functional diversity. Simulations show that the index varies predictably with the relative amount of functional novelty added by recently arrived species, and they illustrate the need to provide an additional standardized version of the index. We present a detailed R-code and two applications of the BNI by (1) measuring changes of biotic novelty of dry grassland plant communities along an urbanization gradient in a metropolitan region and (2) determining the biotic novelty of plant species assemblages at a national scale. Results illustrate the applicability of the index across scales and its flexibility in the use of data of different quality. Both case studies revealed strong connections between biotic novelty and increasing urbanization, a measure of abiotic novelty. We conclude that the BNI framework may help in building a basis for a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of global change.",

We consider the graph [Formula] whose vertices are taboo-free strings of length n and whose edges connect two taboo-free strings if their Hamming distance equals 1. Any (random) walk on this graph describes the evolution of a DNA sequence that avoids deleterious taboos. We describe the construction of the vertex set of [Formula]. Then we state conditions under which [Formula] and its suffix subgraphs are connected. Moreover, we provide a simple algorithm that can determine, for an arbitrary [Formula], if all these graphs are connected. We concluded that bacterial taboo-free Hamming graphs are nearly always connected, although 4 properly chosen taboos are enough to disconnect one of its suffix subgraphs.",

    "abstract": "Heterosis has been widely exploited in animal and plant breeding to enhance the productive traits of hybrid progeny of two breeds or two species. Although, there were multiple models for explaining the hybrid vigor, such as dominance and over-dominance hypothesis, its underlying molecular genetic mechanisms remain equivocal. The aim of this study is through comparing the different expression genes (DEGs) and different alternative splicing (DAS) genes to explore the mechanism of heterosis. Here, we performed a genome-wide gene expression and alternative splicing analysis of two heterotic crosses between donkey and horse in three tissues. The results showed that the DAS genes influenced the heterosis-related phenotypes in a unique than DEGs and about 10% DEGs are DAS genes. In addition, over 69.7% DEGs and 87.2% DAS genes showed over-dominance or dominance, respectively. Furthermore, the \\\"Muscle Contraction\\\" and \\\"Neuronal System\\\" pathways were significantly enriched both for the DEGs and DAS genes in muscle. TNNC2 and RYR1 genes may contribute to mules great endurance while GRIA2 and GRIN1 genes may be related with mules cognition. Together, these DEGs and DAS genes provide the candidates for future studies of the genetic and molecular mechanism of heterosis in mule.",

In this study, we dissected and compared the global transcriptome of these developmental zones in crop models barley and tomato. We employed a state of the art transcriptome analysis technique for deep profiling of expressed genes. This analysis resulted in highly reproducible quantitative expression profiles of 19,441 and 23,388 genes in barley and tomato, respectively. In barley, 16,834 genes were expressed both in root and shoot apices, whereas 1,081 genes were specific to root apex and 1,526 genes were active in shoot apex. With significant variations 20,154 genes were expressed in root and shoot apices of tomato of which 1,858 and 1,376 genes showed root and shoot specificities. Systematic analyses of these genes revealed distinct commonalties and divergence among the active genes for root and shoot development. A deeper insight in these data uncover tissue- and species specific genes, unique footprints of gene ontologies and divergence of auxins pathway genes in root and shoot apices of barley and tomato. These data provide a primary resource to understand intra- and inter-species genetic networks of root and shoot development as well as the evolution of genes in crop plants.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in high throughput sequencing analysis have enabled the characterization of cancer-driving fusions, improving our understanding of cancer development. Most fusion calling methods, however, examine either RNA or DNA information alone and are limited to a rigid definition of what constitutes a fusion. For this study we developed a pipeline that incorporates several fusion calling methods and considers both RNA and DNA to capture a more complete representation of the tumour fusion landscape. Interestingly, most of the fusions we identified were specific to RNA, with no evidence of corresponding genomic restructuring. Further, while the average total number of fusions in tumour and normal brain tissue samples is comparable, their overall fusion profiles vary significantly. Tumours have an over-representation of fusions occurring between coding genes, whereas fusions involving intergenic or non-coding regions comprised the vast majority of those in normals. Tumours were also more abundant in unique, sample-specific fusions compared to normals, though several fusions exhibited strong recurrence in the tumour type examined (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma; DIPG) and were absent from both normal tissues and other cancers. Intriguingly, tumours also show broad up- or down-regulation of spliceosomal gene expression, which significantly correlates with fusion number (p=0.007). Our results show that RNA-specific fusions are abundant in both tumour and normal tissue and are associated with spliceosomal gene dysregulation. RNA-specific fusions should be considered as a potential mechanism that may contribute to cancer formation initiation and maintenance alongside more traditional structural events.",

Using a combined chemico-genetic approach we identify histone H3K27 demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B as central regulators of human Th subsets. The prototypic KDM6 inhibitor GSK-J4 increases genome-wide levels of the repressive H3K27me3 chromatin mark and leads to suppression of the key transcription factor ROR{gamma}t during Th17 differentiation, whereas in mature Th17 cells an altered transcriptional program leads to a profound metabolic reprogramming with concomitant suppression of IL-17 cytokine levels and reduced proliferation. Single cell analysis reveals a specific shift from highly inflammatory cell subsets towards a resting state upon demethylase inhibition. The root cause of the observed anti-inflammatory phenotype in stimulated Th17 cells is reduced expression of key metabolic transcription factors, such as PPRC1 and c-myc. Overall, this leads to reduced mitochondrial biogenesis resulting in a metabolic switch with concomitant anti-inflammatory effects. These data are consistent with an opposing effect of GSK-J4 on Th17 T-cell differentiation pathways directly related to proliferation and effector cytokine profiles.",

    "abstract": "To date, our understanding of how species have shifted in response to recent climate warming has been based on a few studies with a limited number of species. Here we present a comprehensive, global overview of species distributional responses to changing climate across a broad variety of taxa (animals, plants, and fungi). We characterise species responses using a metric that describes the realised velocity of climate change: how closely species responses have tracked changing climate through time. In contrast to existing  climate velocity metrics that have focused on space, we focus on species and index their responses to a null expectation of change in order to examine drivers of inter-specific variation. Here we show that species are tracking climate on average, but not sufficiently to keep up with the pace of climate change. Further, species responses are highly idiosyncratic, and thus highlight that projections assuming uniform responses may be misleading. This is in stark contrast to species present-day and historical climate niches, which show strong evidence of the imprint of evolutionary history and functional traits. Our analyses are a first step in exploring the vast wealth of empirical data on species historic responses to recent climate change.",

    "abstract": "Agriculture, along with industry and household sector are three major sectors of human consumption. Agriculture has proved to be a major contributor to exceeding planetary boundaries. Here, we have explored the impact of agriculture in the Earth system processes, through eight dimensions of planetary boundaries or safe operating spaces: climate change (10.73%), freshwater use (91.56%), arable land use (37.27%), nitrogen use (95.77%), phosphorus use (87.28%), ecological footprint (19.42%), atmospheric pollution (2.52% - 38.08%) and novel entities. In this work, we have also shown role of agriculture to the socio-economic development dimensions: gender equality, employment and economic growth. We have shown that the safe operating limits for agriculture are going to decline by almost 55% (climate change), 300% (freshwater use), 50-55% (arable land use), 180% (nitrogen use), 265% (phosphorus use) and 20% (ecological footprint) in 2050, if the most inefficient way of consumption is chosen and continued. To alleviate the role of agriculture in transgressing planetary boundaries, it is indispensable to comprehend how many roles of agriculture is playing and where which target should be set to framework the national agricultural policies in coherence with attaining sustainable development goals of UN by 2030.",

    "abstract": "Herbaceous perennial species are receiving increased attention for their potential to provide both edible products and ecosystem services in agricultural systems. Many legumes (Fabaceae Lindl.) are of special interest due to nitrogen fixation carried out by bacteria in their roots and their production of protein-rich, edible seeds. However, herbaceous perennial legumes have yet to enter widespread use as pulse crops, and the response of wild, herbaceous, perennial species to artificial selection for increased seed yield remains under investigation. Here we compare cultivated and wild accessions of congeneric annual and herbaceous perennial legume species to investigate associations of lifespan and cultivation with seed size, germination, and first year vegetative growth patterns, and to characterize covariation among traits. We use \\\"cultivated\\\" to describe accessions with a history of human planting and use, which encompasses a continuum of domestication. Analyses focused on three annual and eight perennial Lupinus species, and three annual and four perennial Phaseolus species. We found a significant association of both lifespan and cultivation status with seed size (weight, area, length), germination proportion, node number, stem diameter, shoot dry mass, and root dry mass. Wild seed size was greater in annuals for Lupinus and greater for perennials in Phaseolus. Germination was lower in wild perennials than wild annuals in both genera, and vegetative allocation was roughly equivalent across lifespans in wild Phaseolus. Relative to wild forms, both cultivated annual and cultivated perennial accessions exhibited greater seed size, lower germination proportion, and larger overall plant size. Seed size traits were positively correlated with vegetative growth traits, and all biomass traits examined here were positively correlated. This study highlights some basic similarities and differences between annual and herbaceous perennial legumes, and provides insights into how perennial legumes might respond to artificial selection compared to annual species.",

It has long been proposed that viral deletion mutants that conditionally self-renew at the expense of the wild-type virus (i.e., Defective Interfering Particles, DIPs1) could constitute a long-term intervention that circumvents adherence challenges and has a high genetic barrier to resistance, echoing recent approaches2. Theories predict3, 4 that DIPs could be engineered into a therapy for HIV-1 (i.e., Therapeutic interfering particles or  TIPs) provided they stably persist in patients (R0>1) by spreading to new cells during active infection (hence, a self-replenishing antiviral). To date, DIPs amenable to such engineering have remained elusive for HIV-1. Here we report the discovery of an HIV-1 DIP and its subsequent engineering into a TIP. The TIP interferes with HIV-1 replication at multiple stages of the viral lifecycle, including genome packaging, virion maturation, and reverse transcription, essentially acting as a combination antiviral. In humanized mice, the TIP suppressed HIV-1 replication by ten-fold and significantly protected CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 mediated depletion. These data provide proof-of-concept for a class of biologic with the potential to circumvent significant barriers to HIV-1 control.",

    "abstract": "At the initial stage of the cryo-electron microcopy (cryo-EM) samples irradiated by electrons, the cryo-EM samples suffer from a rapid \\\"burst\\\" phase (first 3~4 e-/[A]2) of beam induced motion (BIM) which is too fast to be corrected by existing motion correction software, and lowers the quality of the initial frames. Therefore, these least radiation damaged, but ruined frames are commonly excluded or down-weighted during data processing, which reduces the undamaged signals in the reconstruction and decreases the reconstruction resolution by weakening the averaging power. Here, we show that increasing the freezing temperature of cryo-EM samples suppresses the BIM in this phase. The quality of initial frames is partially recovered after BIM correction and is better than that of subsequent frames in certain frames. Incorporating these initial frames into the reconstruction increases the resolution, at an equivalent of ~60% extra data. Moreover, these frames are least radiation damaged, thus preserves the high quality cryo-EM density of radiation sensitive residues. Such density is usually damaged or very weak in the canonical 3D reconstruction. In addition, we found that a different kind of radiation damage neglected previously occurs in the per-frame reconstruction after the exposure of 2.5 e-/[A]2. Such radiation damage distorts the density of atoms. The deformation can be avoided by only including the frames from the first 2.5 e-/[A]2 into the reconstruction. Overall, the high temperature freezing not only provides extra undamaged signal to the reconstruction, but also increases the resolution of the reconstruction.",

Despite the fact that this diversification is due to an eco-evolutionary feedback between consumers competing for shared resources, its consequences for food-web dynamics have received little attention. Here, I study a model of two consumers competing for two shared resources to examine how character displacement in consumer attack rates affects resource abundances and the resilience of food webs to perturbations. I found that character displacement always strengthened consumer-resource interactions whenever consumers competed for resources that occurred in different habitats. This increase in interaction strength resulted in lower resource abundances and less resilient food webs. This occurred under different evolutionary tradeoffs and in both simple and more realistic foraging scenarios. Taken together, my results show that the adaptive process of character displacement may come with the ecological cost of decreasing food-web resilience.",

Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors which promotes tumor cell growth, survival, metastasis and confers resistance to chemo and radiotherapies. Targeting hypoxic cells has been difficult. Moreover, inhibitors for the major transcription factors, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2 have not shown long-term efficacy in most cancers. We have previously shown that HIF-2 is essential for colon tumorigenesis. Using an unbiased screen, we show a significant increase in synthetic lethality of HIF-2 overexpressing tumor enteroids to oxidative cell death activators. The treatment with hypoxia mimetic FG4592 (Roxadustat), led to a robust increase in erastin-, RSL3-, and dimethyl fumarate-induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further, our in-vitro data shows that HIF-2 knock-down cells are completely resistant to these drugs. HIF activation promotes upregulation of lipid synthesis genes in vitro and in vivo leading to oxidative stress. Taken together, our results suggest that this intrinsic sensitivity towards oxidative stress associated with hypoxia could be utilized as a persistent and dynamic form of cell death for colon cancer treatment.",

Here we developed a genome editing in vivo rat model and a co-transfected in vitro cell model to investigate the pathogenic effect. In rat homozygous for the homologous mutation, ZP were absent in all of collected eggs. Further the growing and fully grown oocytes in the mutant ovaries completely lack a ZP but with detectable intracellular ZP1 protein. After mating with male rats, none of the mutant female rats got pregnant. Moreover, the co-transfected cell experiments and the ovarian experiments showed that the truncated ZP1 sequestered intracellularly ZP3 and ZP4 to impede their release outside, resulting in an intracellular accumulation of ZP1, ZP3 and ZP4, leading to absence of ZP in mutant oocytes. Our results clearly establish the causal role of ZP1 mutation on ZP defects and female infertility.\\n\\nSummary statementRat model mirrored completely the phenotypes observed in humans, infertility and abnormal eggs that lack a zona pellucida, through the negative effects of ZP1 mutation.",

    "abstract": "Poor response to platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy has remained a major hurdle in the management of high grade serous carcinoma of the ovary (HGSC). Recurrent HGSC is often treated with liposomal doxorubicin as a second line chemotherapy. Unfortunately, HGSC patients have not benefited from immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis. In a pre-clinical study evaluating the efficacy of a \\\"Stimulator of Interferon Genes\\\" (STING) agonist, we demonstrated the synergistic potential of STING pathway activation in enhancing response to carboplatin chemotherapy and sensitization to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Since carboplatin and doxorubicin exhibit distinct immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducing potential, we investigated the chemotherapy specific effect in the magnitude of response to exogenous STING pathway activation. Immunocompetent C57/BL6 mice were implanted with ID8-Trp53-/- cells followed by treatment with carboplatin or doxorubicin. Towards rationalized addition of STING agonist with or without PD-L1 blockade, we first determined the expression of 60 known ICD associated genes at an early time point following the initial treatment with carboplatin or doxorubicin with or without STING agonist. Doxorubicin treated tumours showed significantly higher expression of ICD genes, Cxcl10, Cd274, Isg15, Psmb9 and Calr. Expression changes were further amplified following the addition of STING agonist. Significantly higher expression of Cxcl10 and Isg15 were observed in the doxorubicin + STING agonist treated mice compared to carboplatin + STING agonist combination. Interestingly, Ccl5 gene expression was higher in the tumours from carboplatin or carboplatin and STING agonist combination treated mice compared to those treated with doxorubicin. Plasma cytokine analysis showed distinct profiles of CXCL10, CCL5, MCP-1 and IL6 post treatment with each chemotherapy type. Doxorubicin monotherapy treated mice showed significantly longer overall survival compared to their carboplatin counterparts with further increases following addition of either STING agonist or PD-L1 ICB. However, despite the stronger ICD inducing ability of doxorubicin, overall survival of mice treated with carboplatin + STING agonist + PD-L1 ICB was the longest. Findings from our pre-clinical study provide novel insights for rationalized combinations of immune sensitizing agents such as STING pathway activators to improve response of HGSC patients to chemotherapy and ICB in the primary and recurrent settings.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge in genetics is to be able to predict complex traits accurately. Despite recent advances, prediction accuracy for most complex traits remains low. Here, we used the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), a collection of 200 lines with whole-genome sequences and deep RNA sequencing data, to evaluate the usefulness of using high-quality gene expression levels compared to relying on genotypes for predicting three complex traits. We found that expression levels provided higher accuracy than genotypes for starvation resistance, similar accuracy for chill coma recovery, and lower accuracy for startle response. Models including both genotype and expressions levels did not outperform the best single component model. However, accuracy increased considerably for all the three traits when we included another layer of information, i.e., gene ontology (GO). We found that a limited number of GO terms, some of which had a clear biological interpretation, were strongly predictive of the traits. In summary, this study shows that integrating different sources of information can improve prediction accuracy, especially when large samples are not available.",

    "abstract": "This study demonstrates that independent additive effects of two human pharmaceuticals, the antibiotic trimethoprim and the artificial estrogen 17a-Ethinylestradiol (EE2), inhibit plant litter decomposition by aquatic microorganisms. The constant release of pharmaceuticals, such as these, has the potential to affect aquatic microbial metabolism and alter biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients. Here we advance the Tea Bag Index (TBI) for decomposition by using it in a series of contaminant exposure experiments testing how interactions between trimethoprim and EE2 affect aquatic microbial activity. The TBI is a citizen science tool used to test microbial activity by measuring the differential degradation of green and rooibos tea as proxies for respectively labile and recalcitrant litter decomposition. Exposure to either trimethoprim or EE2 decreased decomposition of green tea, suggesting additive effects upon microbial activity. Exposure to EE2 alone decreased rooibos tea decomposition. Consequently, trimethoprim and EE2 stabilized labile organic matter against microbial degradation and restricted decomposition. We propose that the method outlined could provide a powerful tool for testing the impacts of multiple interacting pollutants upon microbial activity, at a range of scales, across aquatic systems and over ecologically relevant time scales.",

We hypothesize that impaired flexibility in brain activity can lead to motor and cognitive symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD). To test this hypothesis, we studied the  functional repertoire - the number of distinct configurations of neural activity - using source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography in PD patients and controls. We found stereotyped brain dynamics and reduced flexibility in PD. The intensity of this reduction was proportional to symptoms severity, which can be explained by beta-band hyper-synchronization. Moreover, the basal ganglia were prominently involved in the abnormal patterns of brain activity. Our findings support the hypotheses that: symptoms in PD reflect impaired brain flexibility, this impairment preferentially involves the basal ganglia, and beta-band hypersynchronization is associated with reduced brain flexibility. These findings highlight the importance of extensive functional repertoires for behaviour and motor.",

While the SC is known to integrate input from a variety of brain regions, progress in understanding how these inputs contribute to SC-dependent functions has been hindered by the paucity of data on innervation patterns to specific types of SC neurons. Here, we use G-deleted rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic tracing to identify inputs to excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the intermediate and deep SC. We observed stronger and more numerous projections to excitatory than inhibitory SC neurons. However, a subpopulation of excitatory neurons thought to mediate behavioral output received weaker inputs, from far fewer brain regions, than the overall population of excitatory neurons. Additionally, extrinsic inputs tended to target rostral excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons more strongly than their caudal counterparts, and commissural SC neurons tended to project to similar rostrocaudal positions in the other SC. Our findings support the view that active intrinsic processes are critical to SC-dependent functions, and will enable the examination of how specific inputs contribute to these functions.",

This study tested the prediction that a case of acquired synaesthesia (LW) would display selectively elevated primary visual cortex excitability, as reflected in lower transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) phosphene thresholds, but no difference in motor thresholds, relative to controls. In contrast to this prediction, LWs phosphene threshold was well within the threshold range of controls.

    "abstract": "The calmodulin-binding transcription activator 3 (CAMTA3) is a repressor of immunity-related genes but an activator of cold-induced genes in plants. Post-transcriptional or -translational mechanisms have been proposed to control CAMTA3s role in the crosstalk between immune and chilling responses. Here, we show that treatment with the bacterial flg22 elicitor, but not cold stress, induces a phospho-mobility shift of CAMTA3 proteins. Correspondingly, CAMTA3 is directly phosphorylated by two flg22-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), MPK3 and MPK6, which triggers CAMTA3 nuclear export and destabilization. SR1IP1, a substrate E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor required for pathogen-induced CAMTA3 degradation, is shown here to be likely plasma-membrane-localized and therefore cannot physically interact with the nuclear CAMTA3. Despite the flg22-inducible re-localization of CAMTA3 to the cytoplasm, we failed to detect CAMTA3-SR1IP1 complexes. Hence, the role of SR1IP1 for CAMTA3 degradation needs to be re-evaluated. Surprisingly, flg22 elicitation can still induce nuclear export and phospho-mobility shift of a phospho-null CAMTA3 that cannot be phosphorylated by MAPKs, suggesting the participation of additional flg22-responsive kinase(s). A constitutively-active calcium-dependent protein kinase, CPK5, can stimulate a phospho-mobility shift in CAMTA3 similar to that induced by flg22. Although CPK5 can interact with CAMTA3, it did not directly phosphorylate CAMTA3, suggesting the requirement of a still unidentified downstream kinase or additional components. Overall, at least two flg22-responsive kinase pathways target CAMTA3 to induce degradation that presumably serves to remove CAMTA3 from target promoters and de-repress expression of defence genes.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryTreatment with flg22 activates two independent kinase pathways that effect CAMTA3 phosphorylation and degradation.",

More recently, we have shown that spray applications of CYP3RNA also protect barley from fungal infection via a process termed spray-induced gene silencing (SIGS). Thus, RNAi technology may have the potential to revolutionize plant protection in agriculture. Therefore, successful field application will require optimization of RNAi design necessary to maximize the efficacy of the RNA silencing construct for making RNAi-based strategies a realistic and sustainable approach.\\n\\nPrevious studies indicate that silencing is correlated with the number of siRNAs generated from a dsRNA precursor. To prove the hypothesis that silencing efficiency is correlated with the number of siRNAs processed out of the dsRNA precursor, we tested in a HIGS and SIGS approach dsRNA precursors of increasing length ranging from 400 nt to 1500 nt to assess gene silencing efficiency of individual FgCYP51 genes. Concerning HIGS-mediated disease control, we found that there is no significant correlation between the length of the dsRNA precursor and the reduction of Fg infection on CYP51-dsRNA expressing Arabidopsis plants. Importantly and in clear contrast to HIGS, we measured a decrease in SIGS-mediated Fg disease resistance that significantly correlates with the length of the dsRNA construct that was sprayed, indicating that the size of the dsRNA interferes with a sufficient uptake of dsRNAs by the fungus.",

    "abstract": "In the absence of effective antiviral therapy, HIV-1 evolves in response to the within-host environment, of which the immune system is an important aspect. During the earliest stages of infection, this process of evolution is very rapid, driven by a small number of CTL escape mechanisms. As the infection progresses, immune escape variants evolve under reduced magnitudes of selection, while competition between an increasing number of polymorphic alleles (i.e., clonal interference) makes it difficult to quantify the magnitude of selection acting upon specific variant alleles. To tackle this complex problem, we developed a novel multi-locus inference method to evaluate the role of selection during the chronic stage of within-host infection. We applied this method to targeted sequence data from the p24 and gp41 regions of HIV-1 collected from 34 patients with long-term untreated HIV-1 infection. We identify a broad distribution of beneficial fitness effects during infection, with a small number of variants evolving under strong selection and very many variants evolving under weaker selection. The uniquely large number of infections analysed granted a previously unparalleled statistical power to identify loci at which selection could be inferred to act with statistical confidence. Our model makes no prior assumptions about the nature of alleles under selection, such that any synonymous or non-synonymous variant may be inferred to evolve under selection. However, the majority of variants inferred with confidence to be under selection were non-synonymous in nature, and in nearly all cases were associated with either CTL escape in p24 or neutralising antibody escape in gp41. Sites inferred to be under selection in multiple hosts have high within-host and between-host diversity albeit not all sites with high between-host diversity were inferred to be under selection at the within-host level. Our identification of selection at sites associated with resistance to broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) highlights the need to fully understand the role of selection in untreated individuals when designing bNAb based therapies.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDuring the within-host evolution of HIV-1, the diversity of the viral population increases, with many beneficial variants competing against each other. This competition, known as clonal interference, makes the identification of variants under positive selection a challenging task. We here apply a novel method for the inference of selection to targeted within-host sequence data describing changes in the p24 and gp41 genes during HIV-1 infection in 34 patients. Our method adopts a parsimonious approach, assigning selection to the smallest number of variants necessary to explain the evolution of the system. The large size of our dataset allows for the confident identification of variants under selection, alleles at certain loci being repeatedly inferred as under selection within multiple individuals. While early CTL escape mutations have been identified to evolve under strong positive selection, we identify a distribution of beneficial fitness effects in which a large number of mutations are under weak selection. Variants that were confidently identified under selection were primarily found to be associated with either CTL escape in p24 or neutralising antibody escape in gp41, including sites associated with escape from broadly neutralising antibodies. We find that the most frequently selected loci have high diversity both within-host and at the between-host level.",

    "abstract": "Rwanda has about 4.5 million of indigenous chicken (IC) that are very low in productivity. To initiate any genetic improvement programme, IC needs to be accurately characterized. The key purpose of this study was to ascertain the genetic diversity of IC in Rwanda using microsatellite markers. Blood samples of IC sampled from 5 agro-ecological zones were collected from which DNA was extracted, amplified by PCR and genotyped using 28 microsatellite markers. A total of 325 (313 indigenous and 12 exotic) chicken were genotyped and revealed a total number of 305 alleles varying between 2 and 22 with a mean of 10.89 per locus. 186 distinct alleles and 60 private alleles were also observed. The frequency of private alleles was highest in samples from the Eastern region, whereas those from the North West had the lowest. The influx of genes was lower in the Eastern agro-ecological zone than the North West. The mean observed heterozygosity was 0.6155, whereas the average expected heterozygosity was 0.688. The overall inbreeding coefficient among the population was 0.040. Divergence from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was significant in 90% of loci in all the populations. The analysis of molecular variance revealed that about 92% of the total variation originated from variation within populations. Additionally, the study demonstrated that IC in Rwanda could be clustered into four gene groups. In conclusion, there was considerable genetic diversity in IC in Rwanda, which represents a crucial genetic resource that can be conserved or optimized through genetic improvement.",

Evolution of anhydrobiosis in a single representative of a large genus is associated with drastic changes in genome structure, including the emergence of new multimember gene families directly involved in desiccation tolerance. Among them, Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) proteins, which protect other proteins from aggregation caused by desiccation, are believed to originate via horizontal gene transfer from a bacterial donor. To obtain new insights on the biological background of the expanded 27-member LEA protein group in P. vanderplanki, we investigated the expression of corresponding genes in a P. vanderplanki-derived cell line, capable of anhydrobiosis, in a normal state and during induction of desiccation tolerance. We found that all LEA proteins genes identified in P. vanderplankis genome except PvLea16 and PvLea17 are also expressed in Pv11 cells. Their expression was elevated in response to anhydrobiosis-inducing trehalose treatment. Expression patterns of PvLea genes were well preserved in Pv11 cells in comparison to P. vanderplankis larvae both in the control group and during the anhydrobiosis cycle. We also investigated localization of LEA proteins in Pv11 cells and Sf9 cells and found a different level of conservation in intracellular localization of the protein expressed in mammalian and insect cells.",

    "abstract": "Amyloids are protein aggregates with a highly ordered spatial structure giving them unique physicochemical properties. Different amyloids not only participate in the development of numerous incurable diseases but control vital functions in Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. Plants are a poorly studied systematic group in the field of amyloid biology. Amyloid properties have not yet been demonstrated for plant proteins under native conditions in vivo. Here we show that seeds of garden pea Pisum sativum L. contain amyloid-like aggregates of storage proteins, the most abundant one, 7S globulin Vicilin, forms bona fide amyloids in vivo and in vitro. The Vicilin amyloid accumulation increases during seed maturation and wanes at germination. Amyloids of Vicilin resist digestion by gastrointestinal enzymes, persist in canned peas and exhibit toxicity for yeast and mammalian cells. Our finding for the first time reveals involvement of amyloid formation in the accumulation of storage proteins in plant seeds.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAround 14% of world dengue virus (DENV) cases occur in the Americas, the majority of them in Brazil. Although socioeconomic, environmental and behavioral correlates of dengue have been analyzed for different contexts, the role played by population mobility on DENV epidemics, especially at the local level, remains scant. This study assesses whether the daily pattern of population mobility is associated with DENV transmission in Campinas, a Brazilian major city with over 1.2 million inhabitants in Sao Paulo state.\\n\\nMethodology/Principal FindingsDENV notifications from 2007 to 2015 were geocoded at street level (n=114,884) and combined with sociodemographic and environmental data from the 2010 Population Census. Population mobility was extracted from the Origin-Destination Survey (ODS), carried out in 2011, and daily precipitation was obtained from satellite imagery. Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) regression models controlled by demographic and environmental factors revealed that high population mobility had a substantial positive effect on higher risk for DENV transmission. High income and residence in apartments were found to be protective against the disease, while unpaved streets, number of strategic points (such as scrapyards and tire repair shops), and precipitation were consistently risk factors for DENV infection.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceThe use of fine-scale geographical data can unravel transmission idiosyncrasies not evident from a coarse spatial analysis. Even in a major city like Campinas, the vast majority of population daily mobility occurs at short distances. Based on our results, public policies on DENV transmission control should dedicate special attention to local hubs of population mobility, especially during high transmission weeks and in high dengue incidence areas.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCurrently, about half of the world population is at risk of a dengue infection. Numerous studies have addressed the socioeconomic and environmental determinants of the disease. However, little is known about the role played by population mobility on dengue transmission, particularly at the local scale. This study aims at investigating this issue. Our hypothesis was that population movements are a prominent driving force for dengue diffusion locally. We investigated the case of Campinas, a municipality with over 1.2 million inhabitants in Brazil that recorded dengue epidemics in 2007, 2014 and 2015. Our study focused on the years 2007 to 2015, comprising more than 114 thousand cases, geocoded to the household address, and combined with socioeconomic, environmental and daily population mobility data. Our results showed that even controlling for demographic and environmental factors, population mobility was the most important predictor for dengue fever incidence.",
