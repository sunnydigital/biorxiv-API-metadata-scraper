    "abstract": "Brain responses vary considerably from moment to moment, even to identical sensory stimuli. This has been attributed to changes in instantaneous neuronal states determining the systems excitability. Yet the spatio-temporal organization of these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we test whether variability in stimulus-evoked activity can be interpreted within the framework of criticality, which postulates dynamics of neural systems to be tuned towards the phase transition between stability and instability as is reflected in scale-free fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity. Using a novel non-invasive approach in 33 male participants, we tracked instantaneous cortical excitability by inferring the magnitude of excitatory post-synaptic currents from the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential. Fluctuations of cortical excitability demonstrated long-range temporal dependencies decaying according to a power law across trials - a hallmark of systems at critical states. As these dynamics covaried with changes in pre-stimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), we establish a mechanistic link between ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability and argue that the co-emergence of common temporal power laws may indeed originate from neural networks poised close to a critical state. In contrast, no signatures of criticality were found in subcortical or peripheral nerve activity. Thus, criticality may represent a parsimonious organizing principle of variability in stimulus-related brain processes on a cortical level, possibly reflecting a delicate equilibrium between robustness and flexibility of neural responses to external stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementVariability of neural responses in primary sensory areas is puzzling, as it is detrimental to the exact mapping between stimulus features and neural activity. However, such variability can be beneficial for information processing in neural networks if it is of a specific nature, namely if dynamics are poised at a so-called critical state characterized by a scale-free spatio-temporal structure. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a link between signatures of criticality in ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability, which fills the long-standing gap between two major directions of research on neural variability: The impact of instantaneous brain states on stimulus processing on the one hand and the scale-free organization of spatio-temporal network dynamics of spontaneous activity on the other.",

This study differentiated these three species based on differences in lipid and protein profiles, as well explored sources of variation in our measurements. Significant spectral variation was observed between individual cells within a single culture, as well as between control cultures of a species obtained on different days. Despite this, we were able to differentiate between the three close-related species. Differences in the spectra were confirmed using principal component analysis. Understanding the interplay of underlying variation and the degree of induced spectral differences is essential for the deployment of FTIR measurements in both bulk cultures and for individual living cells.",

    "abstract": "Previous research established that clinical anxiety impairs decision making and that high trait anxiety interferes with learning rates. Less understood are the effects of temporary anxious states on learning and decision making in healthy populations. Here we follow proposals that anxious states in healthy individuals elicit a pattern of aberrant behavioural, neural, and physiological responses comparable with those found in anxiety disorders, particularly when processing uncertainty in unstable environments. In our study, both a state anxious and a control group learned probabilistic stimulus-outcome mappings in a volatile task environment while we recorded their electrophysiological (EEG) signals. By using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we assessed the effect of state anxiety on Bayesian belief updating with a focus on uncertainty estimates. State anxiety was associated with an underestimation of environmental and informational uncertainty, and an increase in uncertainty about volatility estimates. Anxious individuals deemed their beliefs about reward contingencies to be more precise and to require less updating, ultimately leading to impaired reward-based learning. We interpret this pattern as evidence that state anxious individuals are less tolerant to informational uncertainty about the contingencies governing their environment and more uncertain about the level of stability of the world itself. Further, we tracked the neural representation of belief update signals in the trial-by-trial EEG amplitudes. In control participants, both lower-level precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) about the reward outcomes and higher-level volatility-pwPEs were represented in the ERP signals with an anterior distribution. A different pattern emerged under state anxiety, where a neural representation of pwPEs was only found for updates about volatility. Expanding previous computational work on trait anxiety, our findings establish that temporary anxious states in healthy individuals impair reward-based learning in volatile environments, primarily through changes in uncertainty estimates and potentially a degradation of the neuronal representation of hierarchically-related pwPEs, considered to play a central role in current Bayesian accounts of perceptual inference and learning.",

    "abstract": "The non-activating allosteric modulator AZ1729, specific for free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R), transfers the orthosteric FFA2R agonists propionate and the P2Y2R specific agonist ATP into activating ligands that trigger an assembly of the neutrophil superoxide generating NADPH-oxidase. The homologous priming effect on the propionate response and the heterologous receptor cross-talk sensitized ATP response mediated by AZ1729 are functional characteristics shared with Cmp58, another non-activating allosteric FFA2R modulator. In addition, AZ1729 also turned Cmp58 into a potent activator of the superoxide generating neutrophil NADPH-oxidase, and in agreement with the allosteric modulation concept, the effect was reciprocal in that Cmp58 turned AZ1729 into a potent activating allosteric agonist. The activation signals down-stream of FFA2R when stimulated by the two interdependent allosteric modulators were biased in that, unlike for orthosteric agonists, the two complementary modulators together triggered an activation of the NADPH-oxidase, but not any transient rise in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+. In addition, following AZ1729/Cmp58 activation, signaling by the desensitized FFA2Rs was functionally selective in that the orthosteric agonist propionate could still induce a transient rise in intracellular Ca2+. The novel neutrophil activation and receptor down-stream signaling pattern mediated by the two cross-sensitizing allosteric FFA2R modulators represents a new regulatory mechanism that controls receptor signaling.\n\nSignificance StatementA novel activation mechanism of a G-protein coupled free fatty acid receptor (FFA2R), is synergistically triggered by two otherwise non-activating allosteric modulators in the absence of orthosteric agonists. The receptor down-stream signaling proved to be functionally selective (biased); a superoxide generating enzyme is assembled and activated without involvement of the Ca2+ signaling pathway. The novel activation mechanism and the receptor down-stream signaling pattern mediated by the two cross-sensitizing allosteric FFA2R modulators, represents a new regulatory mechanism for control of GPCR-signaling.",

    "abstract": "Giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) is an iconic conifer that lives in relic populations on the western slopes of the California Sierra Nevada. In these settings it is unusual among the dominant trees in that it associates with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi rather than ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, it is unclear whether differences in microbial associations extends more broadly to non-mycorrhizal components of the soil microbial community. To address this question we characterized microbiomes associated with giant sequoia and co-occurring sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) by sequencing 16S and ITS1 of the bulk soil community at two groves with distinct parent material. We found tree-associated differences were apparent despite a strong grove effect. Bacterial/archaeal richness was greater beneath giant sequoia than sugar pine, with a unique core community that was double the size. The tree species also harbored compositionally distinct fungal communities. This pattern depended on grove but was associated with a consistently elevated relative abundance of Hygrocybe species beneath giant sequoia. Compositional differences between host trees correlated with soil pH, calcium availability, and soil moisture. We conclude that the effects of giant sequoia extend beyond mycorrhizal mutualists to include the broader community, and that some but not all host tree differences are grove-dependent.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), an integrative framework using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to construct proxies for gene expression, have emerged as a promising method to investigate the biological mechanisms underlying associations between genotypes and complex traits. However, challenges remain in interpreting TWAS results, especially regarding their causality implications. In this paper, we describe a new computational framework, probabilistic TWAS (PTWAS), to detect associations and investigate causal relationships between gene expression and complex traits. We use established concepts and principles from instrumental variables (IV) analysis to delineate and address the unique challenges that arise in TWAS. PTWAS utilizes probabilistic eQTL annotations derived from multi-variant Bayesian fine-mapping analysis conferring higher power to detect TWAS associations than existing methods. Additionally, PTWAS provides novel functionalities to evaluate the causal assumptions and estimate tissue- or cell-type specific causal effects of gene expression on complex traits. These features make PTWAS uniquely suited for in-depth investigations of the biological mechanisms that contribute to complex trait variation. Using eQTL data across 49 tissues from GTEx v8, we apply PTWAS to analyze 114 complex traits using GWAS summary statistics from several large-scale projects, including the UK Biobank. Our analysis reveals an abundance of genes with strong evidence of eQTL-mediated causal effects on complex traits and highlights the heterogeneity and tissue-relevance of these effects across complex traits. We distribute software and eQTL annotations to enable users performing rigorous TWAS analysis by leveraging the full potentials of the latest GTEx multi-tissue eQTL data.",

    "abstract": "DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia (DYT1 dystonia), a rare autosomal dominant (AD) primary dystonia, is categorized as a monogenic disease. While it is a well-known AD inherited disease, the relatively low penetrance rate implicates potential modifiers in play for disease progression. In this report, an affected individual with TOR1A gene (c.907_909delGAG, p.E303del) variant, was identified along with three additional AD carriers in the family. Since we failed to find the second hit variant from TOR1A (D216H, F323_Y328del and F205I) and major binding proteins, including TOR1AIP1 and 2 or HSPA8 proteins, subsequent whole exome sequencing on the patient, the carriers and a non-carrier family member were performed to screen for candidate modifiers of TOR1A (E303del). The result reveals that this patient distinctly carries one copy of TOR1A gene (c.907_909delGAG, p.E303del) and one or two copy of SYNE2 gene (c.1721T>C, c.12001T>C, and c.12002G>A), encoding I574T, W4001R, and W4001Ter variants. We propose that these SYNE2 variants are linked to earlier disease onset in this patient by impacting the protein-protein interaction between TOR1A and SYNE2. Our study suggests SYNE2 gene maybe a culprit to lower the threshold for DYT1 dystonia progression and provides one novel gene target for further screening diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia.",

    "abstract": "The cell surface proteome, the surfaceome, is the interface for engaging the extracellular space in normal and cancer cells. Here we apply quantitative proteomics of N-linked glycoproteins to reveal how a collection of some 700 surface proteins is dramatically remodeled in an isogenic breast epithelial cell line stably expressing any of six of the most prominent proliferative oncogenes, including the receptor tyrosine kinases, EGFR and HER2, and downstream signaling partners such as KRAS, BRAF, MEK and AKT. We find that each oncogene has somewhat different surfaceomes but the functions of these proteins are harmonized by common biological themes including up-regulation of nutrient transporters, down-regulation of adhesion molecules and tumor suppressing phosphatases, and alteration in immune modulators. Addition of a potent MEK inhibitor that blocks MAPK signaling brings each oncogene-induced surfaceome back to a common state reflecting their strong dependence on the MAPK pathway to propagate signaling. Using a recently developed glyco-proteomics method of activated ion electron transfer dissociation (AI-ETD) we found massive oncogene-induced changes in 142 N-linked glycans and differential increases in complex hybrid glycans especially for KRAS and HER2 oncogenes. Overall, these studies provide a broad systems level view of how specific driver oncogenes remodel the surface glycoproteome in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible surface targets, and combinations thereof, for drug and biomarker discovery.\\n\\nSignificant statementThe cell surface glycoproteome (surfaceome) mediates interactions between the cell and the extracellular environment, and is a major target for immunotherapy in cancer. Using state-of-the-art proteomics methods, we compared how six neighboring proliferative oncogenes cause large and bidirectional expression of some 700 surface proteins and the 142 different glycans that decorate them. While each oncogene induces large and somewhat unique glycoproteomes relative to non-transformed cells, we find common functional consequences that are massively reversed by small molecule inhibition of the MAPK pathway. This large-scale comparative study provides important insights for how oncogenes remodel isogenic cells in a cell autologous fashion, and suggest possible new opportunities for antibody drug discovery in more complex tumor settings.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) and the localisation of histone modifications in the human genome can be quantified by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The resulting chromatin feature data has been successfully adopted for genome-wide enhancer identification by several unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods. However, the current methods predict different numbers and different sets of enhancers for the same cell type and do not utilise the pattern of the ChIP-seq coverage profiles efficiently.\n\nResultsIn this work, we propose a PRobabilistic Enhancer PRedictIoN Tool (PREPRINT) that assumes characteristic coverage patterns of chromatin features at enhancers and employs a statistical model to account for their variability. PREPRINT defines probabilistic distance measures to quantify the similarity of the genomic query regions and the characteristic coverage patterns. The probabilistic scores of the enhancer and non-enhancer samples are utilised to train a kernel-based classifier. The performance of the method is demonstrated on ENCODE data for two cell lines. The predicted enhancers are computationally validated based on the transcriptional regulatory protein binding sites and compared to the predictions obtained by state-of-the-art methods.\n\nConclusionPREPRINT performs favorably to the state-of-the-art methods, especially when requiring the methods to predict a larger set of enhancers. PREPRINT generalises successfully to data from cell type not utilised for training, and often the PREPRINT performs better than the previous methods. The PREPRINT enhancers are less sensitive to the choice of prediction threshold. PREPRINT identifies biologically validated enhancers not predicted by the competing methods. The enhancers predicted by PREPRINT can aid the genome interpretation in functional genomics and clinical studies.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/MariaOsmala/preprint\n\nContactmaria.osmala@aalto.fi",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe signalling pathways initiated by members of the transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF{beta}) family of cytokines control many metazoan cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and apoptosis. TGF{beta} signalling is therefore strictly regulated to ensure appropriate context-dependent physiological responses. In an attempt to identify novel regulatory components of the TGF{beta} signalling pathway, we performed a pharmacological screen using a cell line engineered to report the endogenous transcription of the TGF{beta}-responsive target gene PAI-1. The screen revealed that small-molecular inhibitors of salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) attenuate TGF{beta}-mediated transcription of PAI-1 without affecting receptor-mediated SMAD phosphorylation, SMAD complex formation or nuclear translocation. We provide evidence that genetic inactivation of SIK isoforms also attenuates TGF{beta}-dependent transcriptional responses. Pharmacological inhibition of SIKs using multiple small-molecule inhibitors potentiated apoptotic cell death induced by TGF{beta} stimulation. Our data therefore provides evidence for a novel function of SIKs in modulating TGF{beta}-mediated transcriptional and cellular responses.",

    "abstract": "The ventral visual pathway is crucially involved in integrating low-level visual features into complex representations for objects and scenes. At an intermediate stage of the ventral visual pathway, V4 plays a crucial role in supporting this transformation. Many V4 neurons are selective for shape segments like curves and corners, however it remains unclear whether these neurons are organized into clustered functional domains, a structural motif common across other visual cortices. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake macaques, we confirmed and localized cortical domains selective for curves or corners in V4. Single-cell resolution imaging confirmed that curve or corner selective neurons were spatially clustered into such domains. When tested with hexagonal-segment stimuli, we find that stimulus smoothness is the cardinal difference between curve and corner selectivity in V4. Combining cortical population responses with single neuron analysis, our results reveal that curves and corners are encoded by neurons clustered into functional domains in V4. This functionally-specific population architecture bridges the gap between the early and late cortices of the ventral pathway and may serve to facilitate complex object recognition.",

    "abstract": "Neural information processing is widely understood to depend on correlations in neuronal activity. However, whether correlation is favorable or not is contentious. Here, we sought to determine how correlated activity and information processing are related in cortical circuits. Using recordings of hundreds of spiking neurons in organotypic cultures of mouse neocortex, we asked whether mutual information between neurons that feed into a common third neuron increased synergistic information processing by the receiving neuron. We found that mutual information and synergistic processing were positively related at synaptic timescales (0.05-14 ms), where mutual information values were low. This effect was mediated by the increase in information transmission--of which synergistic processing is a component--that resulted as mutual information grew. However, at extrasynaptic windows (up to 3000 ms), where mutual information values were high, the relationship between mutual information and synergistic processing became negative. In this regime, greater mutual information resulted in a disproportionate increase in redundancy relative to information transmission. These results indicate that the emergence of synergistic processing from correlated activity differs according to timescale and correlation regime. In a low-correlation regime, synergistic processing increases with greater correlation, and in a high correlation regime, synergistic processing decreases with greater correlation.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn the present work, we address the question of whether correlated activity in functional networks of cortical circuits supports neural computation. To do so, we combined network analysis with information theoretic tools to analyze the spiking activity of hundreds of neurons recorded from organotypic cultures of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that, at timescales most relevant to direct neuronal communication, neurons with more correlated activity predicted greater computation, suggesting that correlated activity does support computation in cortical circuits. Importantly, this result reversed at timescales less relevant to direct neuronal communication, where even greater correlated activity predicted decreased computation. Thus, the relationship between correlated activity and computation depends on the timescale and the degree of correlation in neuronal interactions.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning optimizes flexible models to predict data. In scientific applications, there is a rising interest in interpreting these flexible models to derive hypotheses from data. However, it is unknown whether good data prediction guarantees accurate interpretation of flexible models. We test this connection using a flexible, yet intrinsically interpretable framework for modeling neural dynamics. We find that many models discovered during optimization predict data equally well, yet they fail to match the correct hypothesis. We develop an alternative approach that identifies models with correct interpretation by comparing model features across data samples to separate true features from noise. Our results reveal that good predictions cannot substitute for accurate interpretation of flexible models and offer a principled approach to identify models with correct interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Social play is a highly rewarding and motivated behaviour displayed by juveniles of many mammalian species. We hypothesized that the orexin/hypocretin (ORX) system is involved in the expression of juvenile social play behaviour because this system is interconnected with brain regions that comprise the social behaviour and mesocorticolimbic reward networks. We found that exposure to social play increased recruitment of ORX-A neurons in juvenile rats. Furthermore, central administration of ORX-A decreased social play duration, while central blockade of ORX-1 receptors differentially altered social play duration in juvenile rats with low versus high baseline levels of social play (increasing social play in low baseline social play individuals and decreasing social play in high baseline social play individuals). Together, our results provided the first evidence of a role for the ORX system in the modulation of juvenile social play behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Water is an essential component of many biochemical reactions. Deuterated water (D2O) has been used to study cell kinetics, protein synthesis, and metabolism. We hypothesized that rapidly proliferating cancer cells would become preferentially labeled with deuterium due to high metabolic activity, thus allowing imaging of biosynthetically labeled metabolites within tumors in vivo. We initiated systemic D2O labeling in two established tumor xenograft models, HT-29 and MiaPaCa-2 and imaged mice by deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (dMRSI). After 14 days of tumor growth and 7 days of in vivo labeling, a clear contrast was demonstrated between the xenograft and the contralateral control limb in both models. The origin of the contrast was traced to an aliphatic peak at 1.8 ppm, which was identified by ex vivo NMR analysis to originate from cholesterol and cholesterol esters. Cholesterol is important for tumor cell proliferation, signaling, and malignant transformation, while current methods to monitor cholesterol synthesis and accumulation are limited. This deuterated water labeling-imaging approach could complement current cancer imaging techniques, allowing not only imaging of uptake but also synthesis of cholesterol to elucidate effects on tumor cholesterol metabolism in vivo.",

However, this does not sufficiently explain the abnormal development of the cardiac valve, septum, and vasculature, known to originate from the endocardium. Here, using single-cell RNA profiling, induced pluripotent stem cells, and human fetal heart tissue with an underdeveloped left ventricle, we identified a developmentally impaired endocardial population in HLHS. The intrinsic endocardial deficits contributed to abnormal endothelial to mesenchymal transition, NOTCH signaling, and extracellular matrix organization, all of which are key factors in valve formation. Consequently, endocardial abnormalities conferred reduced proliferation and maturation of cardiomyocytes through a disrupted fibronectin-integrin interaction. Several recently described HLHS de novo mutations were associated with abnormal endocardial gene and FN1 regulation and expression. Our studies provide a rationale for considering endocardial function in future regenerative strategies for HLHS.",

Here, we report that L/L metabolism is observed in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells that enter a drug-tolerant \"idling state\" upon long-term MAPK inhibition (MAPKi). Consistently, using publicly available RNA-sequencing data of both cell lines and patient samples, we show that melanoma cells decrease their glycolysis and/or OXPHOS activity upon MAPKi and converge toward the L/L phenotype. L/L metabolism is unfavorable for tumor growth, yet supports successful cell division at ~50% rate.

However, it is highly fragmented, preventing the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information to fully elucidate walnut biological processes. Here we report the new chromosome-scale assembly of the walnut reference genome (Chandler v2.0) obtained by combining Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing with chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology. Relative to the previous reference genome, the new assembly features an 84.4-fold increase in N50 size, and the full sequence of all 16 chromosomal pseudomolecules, nine of which present telomere sequences at both ends. Using full-length transcripts from single-molecule real-time sequencing, we predicted 40,491 gene models, with a mean gene length higher than the previous gene annotations. Most of the new protein-coding genes (90%) are full-length, which represents a significant improvement compared to Chandler v1.0 (only 48%). We then tested the potential impact of the new chromosome-level genome on different areas of walnut research. By studying the proteome changes occurring during catkin development, we observed that the virtual proteome obtained from Chandler v2.0 presents fewer artifacts than the previous reference genome, enabling the identification of a new potential pollen allergen in walnut. Also, the new chromosome-scale genome facilitates in-depth studies of intraspecies genetic diversity by revealing previously undetected autozygous regions in Chandler, likely resulting from inbreeding, and 195 genomic regions highly differentiated between Western and Eastern walnut cultivars. Overall, Chandler v2.0 is a valuable resource to understand and explore walnut biology better.",

We propose that the key function of itch induced scratching is to physically disrupt the skin, serving as a \\\"mechanical adjuvant\\\" that amplifies and directs immune responses to the precise site of potential pathogen entry. As proof of principle, we show that the potent adjuvanticity of itch inducing Compound 48/80 is dependent on this agents ability to elicit scratching behavior.",

The stakeholders perceptions of antibiotic resistance and awareness of the One Health concept were also studied.\\n\\nMethodsThis is an interview study with thirteen informants. They represent policymakers, trade organisations, and veterinarians and farmers in the poultry industry. Interview transcripts were analysed using content analysis. The analysis continued until a latent theme emerged, and then the content was rearranged in four domains.\\n\\nFindingsA latent theme \\\"Working in unison\\\" emerged, based on the consistency expressed by the informants when they discussed antibiotic resistance, use of antibiotics and food animal production methods. The theme was built on four domains, representing the content of the interviews: Knowledge and engagement; Cooperation; Animal health concept; and Development in balance with economic prerequisites. The work for healthy animals started in Sweden already in the 1920-ies and continued step by step in cooperation and with support from the government. In 1986 Sweden became the first country to ban antibiotics for growth promotion. Veterinarians were considered important drivers of processes by spreading knowledge and working close to the farmers. Farmers felt involved in the development of production methods. The One Health concept was well known among stakeholders working at national level but not among veterinarians in production or farmers.\\n\\nConclusionsSweden has come far in work to contain antibiotic resistance in the animal sector by practicing restrictive use of antibiotics in food animal production. This practise is based on a long tradition of cooperation among stakeholders, from policymakers to farmers, and with a primary focus on animal health and welfare.",

We not only obtained an accurate human genetic map, but also found that the fluctuation of estimated recombination rate is reduced along the human genome when the sample size is increased. UK10K recombination activity is less concentrated than its subsets. Our results demonstrate how the sample size affects the estimated recombination rate, and analyses of a larger number of genomes result in a more precise estimation of recombination rate.",

    "abstract": "In transgenic research, selection markers have greatly facilitated the generation of transgenic animals. A prerequisite for a suitable selection marker to be used along with a test gene of interest is that the marker should not affect the phenotype of interest in transformed animals. One of the most common selection markers used in C. elegans transgenic approaches is the rol-6 co-injection marker, which induces a behavioral roller phenotype due to a cuticle defect but is not known to have other side effects. However, we found that the rol-6 co-injection marker can cause expression of GFP in the test sequence in a male-specific interneuron called CP09. We found that the rol-6 gene sequence included in the marker plasmid is responsible for this unwanted expression. Accordingly, the use of the rol-6 co-injection marker is not recommended when researchers intend to examine precise expression or perform functional studies especially targeting male C. elegans neurons. The rol-6 sequence region we identified can be used to drive a specific expression in CP09 neuron for future research.",

    "abstract": "Path integration is thought to rely on vestibular and proprioceptive cues yet most studies in humans involve primarily visual input, providing limited insight into their contributions. We developed a paradigm involving walking in an omnidirectional treadmill in which participants were guided on two legs of a triangle and then found their back way to origin. In Experiment 1, we tested a range of different triangle types while keeping distance relatively constant to determine the influence of spatial geometry. Participants overshot the angle they needed to turn and undershot the distance they needed to walk, with no consistent effect of triangle type. In Experiment 2, we manipulated distance while keeping angle relatively constant to determine how path integration operated over both shorter and longer distances. Participants underestimated the distance they needed to walk to the origin, with error increasing as a function of the walked distance. To attempt to account for our findings, we developed computational models involving vector addition, the second of which included terms for the influence of past trials on the current one. We compared against a previously developed model of human path integration, the Encoding Error model. We found that the vector addition models captured the tendency of participants to under-encode guided legs of the triangles and an influence of past trials on current trials. Together, our findings expand our understanding of body-based contributions to human path integration, further suggesting the value of vector addition models in understanding these important components of human navigation.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHow do we remember where we have been? One important mechanism for doing so is called path integration, which refers to the ability to track ones position in space with only self-motion cues. By tracking the direction and distance we have walked, we can create a mental arrow from the current location to the origin, termed the homing vector. Previous studies have shown that the homing vector is subject to systematic distortions depending on previously experienced paths, yet what influences these patterns of errors, particularly in humans, remains uncertain. In this study, we compare two models of path integration based on participants walking two legs of a triangle without vision and then completing the third leg based on their estimate of the homing vector. We found no effect of triangle shape on systematic errors, while path length scaled the systematic errors logarithmically, similar to Weber-Fechner law. While we show that both models captured participants behavior, a model based on vector addition best captured the patterns of error in the homing vector. Our study therefore has important implications for how humans track their location, suggesting that vector-based models provide a reasonable and simple explanation for how we do so.",

In foals the virus can facilitate secondary infections by Rhodococcus equi, important in morbidity and mortality in equines. A total of five genotypes of EHV were previously described in Brazil including EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-3, EHV-4 and EHV-5. EHV-2 genotype had only been previously described in Brazil in asymptomatic animals. We report the dead of 11 foals in Middle-west region of Brazil showing respiratory and neurological symptoms, as well as several abortions in mares from the same farm. Laboratory exams revealed neutrophilia leukocytosis. Necroscopic and histopathologic findings were suppurative bronchopneumonia and ulcerative enteritis. Molecular assays point to the absence of the bacteria Rhodococcus equi and other EHV. The presence of EHV-2 DNA was confirmed by sequencing in serum sample from one foal. This is the first confirmed outbreak of EHV-2 causing disease in Brazilian horses with confirmed presence of the virus. EHV-2 has been neglected and could be highlight the important role of EHV-2 in equine respiratory disease and spontaneous abortions in equid in Brazil.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEquid herpesvirus type 2 (EHV-2), a gammaherpesvirus, has been neglected and can cause respiratory infection, abortion and in extreme cases neurologic symptoms and dead.\\n\\nOutbreaks of EHV-2 never was described in Brazil and can be critical to losses in equid industry. Our report provides evidence for a direct link between the EHV-2 strain and the outbreak in foals. We proved the clinical, histopathological and phylogenetic analysis of segment of EHV-2 polymerase.\\n\\nIn summary, our study confirm that Gammaherpesvirus 2 is circulating in Brazil and the EHV-2 is a cause of the first outbreak in foals showing the important role of EHV-2 in equid respiratory disease.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is now globally recognised as the greatest threat to human health. Acinetobacter baumanniis (A. baumannii) clinical significance has been driven by its ability to obtain and transmit antimicrobial resistance factors. In South Africa, A. baumannii is a leading cause of healthcare associated infections (HAI). In this study, we investigated the genetic determinants of multi-drug resistant A. baumannii (MDRAB) at a teaching hospital in Pretoria, South Africa.\\n\\nOne hundred non repetitive isolates of A. baumannii were collected for the study at Dr George Mukhari Tertiary Laboratory (DGMTL). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the VITEK2 system (bioMerieux, France). The prevalence of common resistance associated genes and AdeABC efflux pump system associated genes were investigated using conventional PCR. Genetic relatedness of isolates was then determined using rep-PCR.\\n\\nSeventy (70) of 100 isolates collected were confirmed to be multi-drug resistant and were blaOXA51 positive. Phenotypically, the isolates where resistant to almost all tested antibiotics. However, one isolate showed intermediate susceptibility to tigecycline while all were susceptible to colistin. Oxacillinase encoding gene blaOXA-23 was the most detected at 99% and only 1% was positive for blaOXA-40. The PCR results for metallo-betalactamase (MBL) encoding genes showed that MBL blaVIM was the most frequently detected at 86% and blaSIM-1 at 3% was the least detected. Out of 70 isolates, 56 isolates had the required gene combination for an active efflux pump. The most prevalent clone was clone A at 69% of the isolates. Regarding treatment; colistin and tigecycline are the most effective against strains encountered at DGMTL as all tested carbapenems seem to have lost their effectiveness.\\n\\nThe major genotypic determinants for drug resistances are oxacillinases: blaOXA-51 (100%) and blaOXA-23 (99%). The study reports for the first time, blaOXA-40 and blaSIM-1 detection in A. baumannii in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) afflicts millions of people worldwide, and is caused by accumulated amyloid beta and tau pathology. Progression of tau pathology in AD may utilize prion mechanisms of propagation in which pathological tau aggregates released from one cell are taken up by neighboring or connected cells and act as templates for their own replication, a process termed \\\"seeding.\\\" In cultured cells we have modeled various aspects of pathological tau propagation, including uptake of aggregates, induced (naked) seeding by exogenous aggregates, seeding caused by Lipofectamine-mediated delivery to the cell interior, and chronic maintenance of aggregates in cells through mother-to-daughter transmission. The factors that regulate these processes are not well understood, and we hypothesized that AD risk modifier genes might play a role. We identified 22 genes strongly linked to AD via meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We used CRISPR/Cas-9 to individually knock out each in gene in HEK293T cells, and verified disruption using genomic sequencing. We then tested the effect of gene knockout in tau aggregate uptake, naked and Lipofectamine-mediated seeding, and aggregate maintenance in cultured cell lines. GWAS gene knockouts had no effect on these models of tau pathology. With obvious caveats due to the model systems used, these results imply that these 22 AD risk modifier genes do not directly modulate tau uptake, seeding, or aggregate maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is vital for survival. Yet, under environmentally challenging conditions such as starvation, animals suppress their need for sleep. Interestingly, starvation-induced sleep loss does not evoke a subsequent sleep rebound. Little is known about how starvation-induced sleep deprivation differs from other types of sleep loss, or why some sleep functions become dispensable during starvation. Here we demonstrate that downregulation of unpaired-2 (upd2, the Drosophila ortholog of leptin), is sufficient to mimic a starved-like state in flies. We use this  genetically starved state to investigate the consequences of a starvation signal on visual attention and sleep in otherwise well-fed flies, thereby sidestepping the negative side-effects of undernourishment. We find that knockdown of upd2 in the fat body is sufficient to suppress sleep while also increasing selective visual attention and promoting night-time feeding. Further, we show that this peripheral signal is integrated in the fly brain via insulin-expressing cells. Together, these findings identify a role for peripheral tissue-to-brain interactions in the simultaneous regulation of sleep and attention, to potentially promote adaptive behaviors necessary for survival in hungry animals.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySleep is important for maintaining both physiological (e.g., metabolic, immunological, and developmental) and cognitive processes, such as selective attention. Under nutritionally impoverished conditions, animals suppress sleep and increase foraging to locate food. Yet it is currently unknown how an animal is able to maintain well-tuned cognitive processes, despite being sleep deprived. Here we investigate this question by studying flies that have been genetically engineered to lack a satiety signal, and find that signaling from fat bodies in the periphery to insulin-expressing cells in the brain simultaneously regulates sleep need and attention-like processes.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has shown that humans can successfully identify letters that are constructed with a sparse array of dots, wherein the dot pattern reflects the strokes that would normally be used to fashion a given letter. In the present work the dots were briefly displayed, one at a time in sequence, varying the spatial order in which they were shown. A forward sequence was spatially ordered as though one were passing a stroke across the dots to connect them. Experiments compared this baseline condition to the following three conditions: a) the dot sequence was spatially ordered, but in the reverse direction from how letter strokes might normally be written; b) the dots in each stroke of the letter were displayed in a random order; c) the sequence of displayed dots were chosen for display from any location in the letter. Significant differences were found between the baseline condition and all three of the comparison conditions, with letter recognition being far worse for the random conditions than for conditions that provided consistent spatial ordering of dot sequences. These findings show that spatial order is critical for integration of shape cues that have been sequentially displayed.",

    "abstract": "Mastitis caused by Streptococcus uberis is a hazardous clinical disease in dairy animals. In this study, the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TLR-mediated signaling pathways in mastitis caused by S. uberis was investigated using mouse models and mammary epithelial cells (MECs). We used S. uberis to infect mammary glands of wild type, TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- mice and quantified the adaptor molecules in TLR signaling pathways, proinflammatory cytokines, tissue damage and bacterial count in mammary glands. When compared with TLR4 deficiency, TLR2 deficiency induced more severe pathological changes through myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88)-mediated signaling pathways during S. uberis infection. In MECs, TLR2 detected S. uberis infection and induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) to assist host control of secretion of inflammatory factors and elimination of intracellular S. uberis. Our results demonstrate that TLR2-mediated mROS have a significant effect on S. uberis-induced host defense responses in mammary glands as well as MECs.\n\nAuthor summaryS. uberis contributes significantly to global mastitis and remains a major obstacle for inflammation elimination due to its ability to form persistent infection in mammary tissue. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family plays a significant role in identifying infections of intracellular bacteria and further triggering inflammatory reactions in immune cells. However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which TLR is regulated, and whether MECs, as the main cells in mammary gland, are tightly involved in these processes is poorly understood. Here, we used S. uberis to infect mammary glands of wild type, TLR2-/-, TLR4-/- mice and MECs to assess pathogenesis, proinflammatory cytokines, ROS as well as mROS levels during infection. We found that during S.uberis infection, it is TLR2 deficiency that induced more severe pathological changes through MyD88-mediated signaling pathways. In addition, our work demonstrates that mROS mediated by TLR2 has an important role in host defense response to combat S. uberis infection in mammary glands as well as MECs.",

The semi-genetic or pharmacological targeting of senescent cells revealed that cellular senescence underlies many aspects of the aging-associated phenotype and diseases. We previously reported that cellular senescence contributes to aging- and disease-associated pulmonary dysfunction. We herein report that the elimination of Arf-expressing senescent cells ameliorates cigarette smoke-induced lung pathologies in mice. Cigarette smoke induced the expression of Ink4a and Arf in lung tissue with concomitant increases in lung tissue compliance and alveolar airspace. The elimination of Arf-expressing senescent cells prior to cigarette smoke exposure protected against these changes. Furthermore, the administration of cigarette smoke extract lead to pulmonary dysfunction, which was ameliorated by subsequent senescent cell elimination. Collectively, these results suggest that senescent cells are a potential therapeutic target for cigarette smoking-associated lung disease.",

    "abstract": "Virus resistance genes carried by wild plant species are valuable resources for plant breeding. The Rysto gene, conferring a broad spectrum of durable resistance, originated from Solanum stoloniferum and was introgressed into several commercial potato cultivars, including  White Lady, by classical breeding. Rysto was mapped to chromosome XII in potato, and markers used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes were identified. Nevertheless, there was no information on the identity of the Rysto gene. To begin to reveal the identification of Rysto, fine-scale genetic mapping was performed which, in combination with chromosome walking, narrowed down the locus of the gene to approximately 1 Mb. DNA sequence analysis of the locus identified six full-length NBS-LRR-type (short NLR-type) putative resistance genes. Two of them, designated TMV2 and TMV3, were similar to a TMV resistance gene isolated from tobacco and to Y-1, which co-segregates with Ryadg, the extreme virus resistance gene originated from Solanum andigena and localised to chromosome XI. Furthermore, TMV2 of  White Lady was found to be 95% identical at the genomic sequence level with the recently isolated Rysto gene of the potato cultivar  Alicja. In addition to the markers identified earlier, this work generated five tightly linked new markers which can serve potato breeding efforts for extreme virus resistance.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito Aedes aegypti has overcome all kinds of human being mosquito control attempts over the last century. Strategies for vector population control resorts to the use of synthetic insecticides, which can lead to problems of intoxication in humans and environmental contamination. We evaluated the effects of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), Ilex paraguariensis (mate-herb) and Ilex theezans (cauna-herb) extracts against A. aegypti larvae mortality. The bioassays were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions of temperature (27{+/-}3{degrees}C) and photoperiod (12h). Hydroalcoholic I. theezans leaves extract displayed better residual effect compared to I. paraguariensis fruit aqueous extract. Variation in larval mortality was also observed in the exposure periods (low after a few weeks). Low mortality after a few weeks may mean increased the food for mosquito in a oppose effect over time. The residual effect of Bti was observed during the 56 days of the study duration (100% of mortality). The strongest residual effect of I. theezans was probably due to the presence of chemical on its leaves, such coumarins, hemolytic saponins and cyanogenic glucosides, absent in I. paraguariensis. On the other hand, alternative methods to vector control present risks in a long term scale by reversal of larvicide effect into food resource. Our results contributed to the prospection of natural insecticides and open the possibility for subsequent studies of the use of plant extracts in field situations in a short time scale.",
