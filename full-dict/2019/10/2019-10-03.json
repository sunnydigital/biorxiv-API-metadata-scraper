    "abstract": "Hypoglycemia is a frequent complication of diabetes, limiting therapy and increasing morbidity and mortality. With recurrent hypoglycemia, the counter-regulatory response (CRR) to decreased blood glucose is blunted, resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness. The mechanisms leading to these blunted effects remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify, with in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and the tissue clearing capability of iDisco, that GHRH neurons represent a unique population of arcuate nucleus neurons activated by glucose deprivation in vivo. Repeated glucose deprivation reduces GHRH neuron activation and remodels excitatory and inhibitory inputs to GHRH neurons. We show low glucose sensing is coupled to GHRH neuron depolarization, decreased ATP production and mitochondrial fusion. Repeated hypoglycemia attenuates these responses during low glucose. By maintaining mitochondrial length with the small molecule, mdivi-1, we preserved hypoglycemia sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings present possible mechanisms for the blunting of the CRR, broaden significantly our understanding of the structure of GHRH neurons and for the fist time, propose that mitochondrial dynamics play an important role in hypoglycemia unawareness. We conclude that interventions targeting mitochondrial fission in GHRH neurons may offer a new pathway to prevent hypoglycemia unawareness in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in sequencing technology have resulted in the availability of genomes from organisms across the tree of life. Accurately interpreting the function of proteins in these genomes is a major challenge, as annotation transfer based on homology frequently results in misannotation and error propagation. This challenge is especially pressing for organisms whose genomes are directly obtained from environmental samples, as interpretation of their physiology and ecology is often based solely on the genome sequence. For complex protein (super)families containing a large number of sequences, classification can be used to determine whether annotation transfer is appropriate, or whether experimental evidence for function is lacking. Here we present a novel computational approach for de novo classification of large protein (super)families, based on clustering an alignment score matrix obtained by aligning all sequences in the family to a small subset of the data. We evaluate our approach on the enolase family in the Structure Function Linkage Database.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationASM-Clust is implemented in bash with helper scripts in perl.

    "abstract": "Evolution involves not only adaptation, but also the degradation of superfluous features. Many examples of degradation at the morphological level are known (vestigial organs, for instance). However, the impact of degradation on molecular evolution has been rarely addressed. Thioredoxins serve as general oxidoreductases in all cells. Here, we report extensive mutational analyses on the folding of modern and resurrected ancestral bacterial thioredoxins. Contrary to claims from recent literature, in vitro folding rates in the thioredoxin family are not evolutionary conserved, but span at least a [~]100-fold range. Furthermore, modern thioredoxin folding is often substantially slower than ancestral thioredoxin folding. Unassisted folding, as probed in vitro, thus emerges as an ancestral vestigial feature that underwent degradation, plausibly upon the evolutionary emergence of efficient cellular folding-assistance. More generally, our results provide evidence that degradation of ancestral features shapes, not only morphological evolution, but also the evolution of individual proteins.",

To identify pathways and tissues influencing T2D-relevant glycemic traits (fasting glucose [FG], fasting insulin [FI], two-hour glucose [2hGlu] and glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]), we investigated associations of exome-array variants in up to 144,060 individuals without diabetes of multiple ancestries. Single-variant analyses identified novel associations at 21 coding variants in 18 novel loci, whilst gene-based tests revealed signals at two genes, TF (HbA1c) and G6PC (FG, FI). Pathway and tissue enrichment analyses of trait-associated transcripts confirmed the importance of liver and kidney for FI and pancreatic islets for FG regulation, implicated adipose tissue in FI and the gut in 2hGlu, and suggested a role for the non-endocrine pancreas in glucose homeostasis. Functional studies demonstrated that a novel FG/FI association at the liver-enriched G6PC transcript was driven by multiple rare loss-of-function variants. The FG/HbA1c-associated, islet-specific G6PC2 transcript also contained multiple rare functional variants, including two alleles within the same codon with divergent effects on glucose levels.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate immune responses to injury by recognizing pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns. TLR4, the prototypic receptor for LPS, also mediates inflammation after O3, triggered by endogenous hyaluronan. Regulation of TLR4 signaling is incompletely understood. TLR5, the flagellin receptor, is expressed in alveolar macrophages, and regulates immune responses to environmental injury. Using in vivo animal models of TLR4-mediated inflammations (LPS, O3, hyaluronan), we show that TLR5 impacts the in vivo response to LPS, hyaluronan and O3. We demonstrate that immune cells of human carriers of a dominant negative TLR5 allele have decreased inflammatory response to O3 exposure ex vivo and LPS exposure in vitro. Using primary murine macrophages, we find that TLR5 physically associates with TLR4 and biases TLR4 signaling towards the MyD88 pathway. Our results suggest an updated paradigm for TLR4/TLR5 signaling.",

    "abstract": "Hypofunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to stress-related neuropsychiatric illnesses. Mechanisms leading to prefrontal hypoactivity remain to be determined. Prior evidence suggests that enhanced activity of parvalbumin (PV) expressing GABAergic interneurons (INs) play a role in chronic stress related pathologies. In this study, the role of PFC PV INs in stress related phenotypes were explored using Cre inducible inhibitory DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs). Mice were first tested in the tail suspension test (TST) to determine the effects of PV IN inhibition during acute stress. Following this, the long term impact of PV IN inhibition during chronic variable stress (CVS) was tested in the forced swim test (FST). Acute PV IN inhibition reduced active (struggling) and increased passive coping behaviors (immobility) in the TST. In contrast, inhibition of PV INs during CVS increased active and reduced passive coping behaviors in the FST. Moreover, chronic inhibition of PV INs attenuated CVS-induced changes in Fos expression in the prelimbic cortex, basolateral amygdala and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and also prevented adrenal hypertrophy and body weight loss associated with chronic stress. Our results suggest differential roles of PV INs to acute vs chronic stress, indicative of distinct biological mechanisms underlying acute vs. chronic stress responses. Our results also indicate a role for PV INs in driving chronic stress adaptation and support literature evidence suggesting cortical GABAergic interneurons as a therapeutic target in stress related diseases.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEStress related diseases are associated with prefrontal hypoactivity, the mechanism of which is currently not known. In this study we showed that by inhibiting prefrontal GABA-ergic Parvalbumin interneurons (PV INs) using DREADDs, we can attenuate some of chronic stress related phenotypes. Additionally, we showed that modulation of PV IN activity during acute vs chronic stress had opposing effects on stress coping strategies, suggesting different underlying mechanisms behind acute vs chronic stress paradigms. Our findings indicate that GABA-ergic PV INs may be involved in driving stress related phenotypes and thereby an important target for treatment of stress-related illnesses. Our data suggest that reducing PV IN activity to promote prefrontal output may be an effective treatment strategy for stress related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem resistance in Enterobacterales is a public health threat. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (encoded by alleles of the blaKPC family) is one of the commonest transmissible carbapenem resistance mechanisms worldwide. The dissemination of blaKPC has historically been associated with distinct K. pneumoniae lineages (clonal group 258 [CG258]), a particular plasmid family (pKpQIL), and a composite transposon (Tn4401). In the UK, blaKPC has caused a large-scale, persistent outbreak focused on hospitals in North-West England. This outbreak has evolved to be polyclonal and poly-species, but the genetic mechanisms underpinning this evolution have not been elucidated in detail; this study used short-read whole genome sequencing of 604 blaKPC-positive isolates (Illumina) and long-read assembly (PacBio)/polishing (Illumina) of 21 isolates for characterisation. We observed the dissemination of blaKPC (predominantly blaKPC-2; 573/604 [95%] isolates) across eight species and more than 100 known sequence types. Although there was some variation at the transposon level (mostly Tn4401a, 584/604 (97%) isolates; predominantly with ATTGA-ATTGA target site duplications, 465/604 [77%] isolates), blaKPC spread appears to have been supported by highly fluid, modular exchange of larger genetic segments amongst plasmid populations dominated by IncFIB (580/604 isolates), IncFII (545/604 isolates) and IncR replicons (252/604 isolates). The subset of reconstructed plasmid sequences also highlighted modular exchange amongst non-blaKPC and blaKPC plasmids, and the common presence of multiple replicons within blaKPC plasmid structures (>60%). The substantial genomic plasticity observed has important implications for our understanding of the epidemiology of transmissible carbapenem resistance in Enterobacterales, for the implementation of adequate surveillance approaches, and for control.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEAntimicrobial resistance is a major threat to the management of infections, and resistance to carbapenems, one of the \\\"last line\\\" antibiotics available for managing drug-resistant infections, is a significant problem. This study used large-scale whole genome sequencing over a five-year period in the UK to highlight the complexity of genetic structures facilitating the spread of an important carbapenem resistance gene (blaKPC) amongst a number of bacterial species that cause disease in humans. In contrast to a recent pan-European study from 2012-2013(1), which demonstrated the major role of spread of clonal blaKPC-Klebsiella pneumoniae lineages in continental Europe, our study highlights the substantial plasticity in genetic mechanisms underpinning the dissemination of blaKPC. This genetic flux has important implications for: the surveillance of drug resistance (i.e. making surveillance more difficult); detection of outbreaks and tracking hospital transmission; generalizability of surveillance findings over time and for different regions; and for the implementation and evaluation of control interventions.",

Recently, a few studies associated polymorphic TE insertions to mRNA levels of adjacent genes, but the biological significance of these associations, their replicability across cell types, and the mechanisms by which they may regulate genes remain largely unknown. Here we performed a TE-expression QTL analysis of 444 lymphoblastoid cell lines and 294 induced pluripotent stem cells using a newly developed set of genotypes for 2,806 polymorphic TE insertions. We identified 211 and 324 TE-eQTL acting in cis in each respective cell type. Approximately one fourth were shared across cell types with strongly correlated effects. Furthermore, analysis of chromatin accessibility QTL in a subset of the lymphoblastoid cell lines suggests that unfixed TEs often modulate the activity of enhancers and other distal regulatory DNA elements, which tend to lose accessibility when a TE inserts within them. We also document a case of an unfixed TE likely influencing gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Our study points to broad and diverse cis-regulatory effects of unfixed TEs in the human population and underscores their plausible contribution to phenotypic variation.",

We analyzed the relationship between the amplitude of the evoked potentials when viewing these faces and the accuracy of interoception. It was found that the amplitude of the late EP component (850 - 1106 ms) has a positive correlation with IAcc in the central and right parietal and occipital areas when perceiving ones own face. According to the localization of distributed sources of activity, it was found that the connection is localized in the right anterior upper temporal cortex. Thus, the association between exteroceptive perception of ones own face and IAcc occurs in the late period of EP.

    "abstract": "Biomass is an important indicator for monitoring vegetation degradation and productivity. This study tests the applicability of Hyperspectral Remote-Sensing in situ measurements for high-precision estimation aboveground biomass (AGB) on regional scales of Khorchin grassland landscape in Inner Mongolia, China. Field experiments were carried out which collected hyperspectral data with a portable visible/NIR hyperspectral spectrometer (SOC 710), and collected aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). Ground spectral models were then developed to estimate ANPP from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which was measured in the field following the same method as that of the Thematic Mapper(TM) from the Landsat 8 land imager (TM_NDVI). Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between ANPP and NDVI based on coefficients of determination (R2) and error analysis. The estimation of ANPP had unique optimal regression models. By comparing the different spectral inversion models, we selected an exponential model associating ANPP with NDVI (ANPP = 12.523*e3.370*(0.462*TM_NDVI+0.413), standard error = 24.74 g m-2, R2 = 0.636, P < 0.001). This study suggests that the model can be used to monitor the condition and estimate the productivity of grassland at regional scales. The results still show a high potential to map grassland degradation proxies on the ground hyperspectral model. Thus, this study presents biomass hyperspectral inversion technology to remotely detect and monitor grassland degradation and productivity at high precision.",

In this study, we evaluated the isolated and combined effects of warming and elevated CO2 concentration [CO2] during summer on the nutrient content, nutrient accumulation, nutrient use efficiency and growth of P. maximum under field conditions with adequate water supply. The temperature and [CO2] in the field were controlled by temperature free-air controlled enhancement and free-air CO2 enrichment systems, respectively. We tested two levels of canopy temperature: ambient temperature and 2{degrees}C above ambient temperature, as well as two levels of atmospheric [CO2]: ambient [CO2] (aCO2) and 200 ppm above ambient CO2 (eCO2). The experiment was established in a completely randomised design with four replications, in a 2x2 factorial scheme. After the pasture establishment, plants were exposed to the treatments for 30 days, with evaluations at 9, 16, 23 and 30 days after the treatments started. Results were dependent on the time of the evaluation, but in the last evaluation (beginning of the grazing), contents of N, K, Mg and S did not change as a function of treatments, P decreased as a function of warming, in [aCO2] and [eCO2], and Ca increased under [eCO2] combined with warming. There was an increase in root dry mass under warming treatment. Combined treatment increased N, Ca and S accumulation without a corresponding increase in the use efficiency of these same nutrients, indicating that the fertiliser dose should increase in the next decades due to human-induced climate change. Our short-term results suggest that the combination of high [CO2] and temperature will increase P. maximum productivity and that the nutritional requirement for N, Ca and S will increase.",

    "abstract": "Expert behavior is characterized by rapid information processing abilities, dependent on more structured schemata in long-term memory designated for their domain-specific tasks. From this understanding, expertise can effectively reduce cognitive load on a domain-specific task. However, certain tasks could still evoke different gradations of load even for an expert, e.g., when having to detect subtle anomalies in dental radiographs. Our aim was to measure pupil diameter response to anomalies of varying levels of difficulty in expert and student dentists visual examination of panoramic radiographs. We found that students pupil diameter dilated significantly from baseline compared to experts, but anomaly difficulty had no effect on pupillary response. In contrast, experts pupil diameter responded to varying levels of anomaly difficulty, where more difficult anomalies evoked greater pupil dilation from baseline. Experts thus showed proportional pupillary response indicative of increasing cognitive load with increasingly difficult anomalies, whereas students showed pupillary response indicative of higher cognitive load for all anomalies when compared to experts.",

    "abstract": "Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) is a devastating complication of diabetes and severely threatens the health of humankind. The plasminogen activator system and plasminogen (Plg) have multiple functional roles in tissue regeneration and extracellular matrix remodeling, which suggests that Plg may have a potentially pivotal role in anti-PDPN. In the present study, we explore whether an increased level of circulating Plg has positive effect on repairing abnormal pain perception in diabetic mice model. Our data demonstrated that additional Plg not only helps healing pain allodynia or hyperalgesia on the mice at the age of 8 weeks old in early PDPN, but more important, also has positive effects of regaining normal pain perception from hypoalgesia on the mice at ages of 14-15 or 24-25 weeks in advanced PDPN. Furthermore, our data also reveal a possible mechanism for Plgs contribution to rebuilding normal pain perception among db/db mice by promoting axonal myelination and regeneration of small nerve fiber in peripheral nervous system. Therefore, our data suggest that Plg show promise to become a drug candidate for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain.",

    "abstract": "Reusability is part of the FAIR data principle, which aims to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. One of the current efforts to increase the reusability of public genomics data has been to focus on the inclusion of quality metadata associated with the data. When necessary metadata are missing, most researchers will consider the data useless. In this study, we develop a framework to predict the missing metadata of gene expression datasets to maximize their reusability. We propose a new metric called Proportion of Cases Accurately Predicted (PCAP), which is optimized in our specifically-designed machine learning pipeline. The new approach performed better than pipelines using commonly used metrics such as F1-score in terms of maximizing the reusability of data with missing values. We also found that different variables might need to be predicted using different machine learning methods and/or different data processing protocols. Using differential gene expression analysis as an example, we show that when missing variables are accurately predicted, the corresponding gene expression data can be reliably used in downstream analyses.",

    "abstract": "There was an explosion in the amount of commercially available DNA in sequence repositories over the last decade. The number of such plasmids increased from 12,000 to over 300,000 among three of the largest repositories: iGEM, Addgene, and DNASU. The challenge in biodesign remains how to use these and other repository-based sequences effectively, correctly, and seamlessly. This work describes an approach to plasmid design where a plasmid is specified as a DNA sequence or list of features. The proposed software then finds the most cost-effective combination of synthetic and PCR-prepared repository fragments to build the plasmid via Gibson Assembly. It finds existing DNA sequences in user-specified and public DNA databases: iGEM, Addgene, and DNASU. Such a software application is introduced and characterized against all post-2005 iGEM composite parts and all Addgene vectors submitted in 2018 and found to reduce costs by 34% versus a purely synthetic plasmid design approach. The described software will improve current plasmid assembly workflows by shortening design times, improving build quality, and reducing costs.",

    "abstract": "As a crucial signaling pathway for interferon (IFN) production, the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) axis is usually the host target of viruses to enhance viral infection. To date, though immune evasion methods to contrapose IFN production have been characterized for a series of terrestrial viruses, the strategies employed by fish viruses remain unclear. Here, we report that all grass carp reovirus (GCRV) proteins encoded by segments S1 to S11 interact with fish RLR factors, specifically for mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein-TANK-binding kinase 1 (MAVS-TBK1) signaling transduction, leading to decreased IFN expression. First, the GCRV viral proteins blunted the MAVS-induced expression of IFN but had little effect on TBK1-induced IFN expression. Subsequently, interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that all GCRV viral proteins interacted with several RLR cascades, especially with TBK1. To further illustrate the mechanisms of these interactions between GCRV viral proteins and host RLRs, two of the viral proteins, NS79 (S4) and VP3 (S3), were selected as representative proteins for the study. The obtained data demonstrated that NS79 did not affect the stability of the host RLR protein, but was phosphorylated by gcTBK1, leading to the reduction of host substrate gcIRF3/7 phosphorylation. On the other hand, VP3 degraded gcMAVS and the degradation was significantly reversed by 3-MA. The biological effects of both NS79 and VP3 were consistently found to be related to the suppression of IFN expression and the promotion of viral evasion. Our findings shed light on the special evasion mechanism utilized by fish virus through IFN regulation, which might differ between fish and mammals.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe RLR signaling pathway is crucial for IFN induction when host cells are infected with virus and RLR factors are targeted by virus. To date, the evasion mechanisms of fish viruses remain mysterious. In this study, we reveal that all 11 GCRV proteins interact with fish RLR factors and suppress the activation of MAVS-TBK1 signaling transduction, leading to the reduction of IFN expression. Two viral proteins were employed as examples to investigate the different evasion mechanisms of GCRV. These findings reveal the novel countermeasures used by fish virus to avoid the host IFN response.",

Thus, in this study, the capacity of the Antibiochip (ELTEK spa), a microfluidic-based device, to measure the amount of E. coli in certain culture conditions, was evaluated. An Antibiochip is composed of V-shaped microchannels, and the amount of microparticles (such as microbes) is measured by the surface of the pellet after centrifugation. In the present study, different geometries, volumes and times were analyzed. When the best conditions were identified, serial dilutions of microbial cultures were tested to validate the linearity of the results. Then, with the use of wild E. coli strains isolated from medical samples, the relationship between bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics (gentamicin, amikacin and ceftriaxone) measured by standard methods and that measured by the Antibiochip was evaluated. In this report, the good quality performances of the methods, their linearity and the capacity to identify susceptible microbial strains after 60 minutes of incubation are shown. These results represent a novel approach for ultrarapid antibiograms in clinics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is a common, age-related, neurodegenerative disease that impairs a persons ability to perform day-to-day activities. Diagnosing AD is challenging, especially in the early stages. Many patients still go undiagnosed, partly due to the complex heterogeneity in disease progression. This highlights a need for early prediction of the disease course to assist its treatment and tailor therapy options to the disease progression rate. Recent developments in machine learning techniques provide the potential to not only predict disease progression and trajectory of AD but also to classify the disease into different etiological subtypes.\n\nMethods and findingsThe work shown here clusters participants in distinct and multifaceted progression subgroups of AD and discusses an approach to predict the progression rate from baseline diagnosis. We observed that the myriad of clinically reported symptoms summarized in the proposed AD progression space corresponds directly with memory and cognitive measures, which are routinely used to monitor disease onset and progression. Our analysis demonstrated accurate prediction of disease progression after four years from the first 12 months of post-diagnosis clinical data (Area Under the Curve of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92-1.0), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.88) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-1.0) for slow, moderate and fast progression rate patients respectively). Further, we explored the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the trajectory of an individual patients progression.\n\nConclusionThe machine learning techniques presented in this study may assist providers in identifying different progression rates and trajectories in the early stages of the disease, hence allowing for more efficient and personalized healthcare deliveries. With additional information about the progression rate of AD at hand, providers may further individualize the treatment plans. The predictive tests discussed in this study not only allow for early AD diagnosis but also facilitate the characterization of distinct AD subtypes relating to trajectories of disease progression. These findings are a crucial step forward for early disease detection. These models can be used to design improved clinical trials for AD research.",

    "abstract": "In 2017 over 550,000 estimated new cases of multi-drug/rifampicin resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) occurred, emphasizing a need for new treatment strategies. Linezolid (LZD) is a potent antibiotic for drug-resistant Gram-positive infections and is an effective treatment for TB. However, extended LZD use can lead to LZD-associated host toxicities, most commonly bone marrow suppression. LZD toxicities may be mediated by IL-1, an inflammatory pathway important for early immunity during M. tuberculosis infection. However, IL-1 can contribute to pathology and disease severity late in TB progression. Since IL-1 may contribute to LZD toxicity and does influence TB pathology, we targeted this pathway with a potential host-directed therapy (HDT). We hypothesized LZD efficacy could be enhanced by modulation of IL-1 pathway to reduce bone marrow toxicity and TB associated-inflammation. We used two animal models of TB to test our hypothesis, a TB-susceptible mouse model and clinically relevant cynomolgus macaques. Antagonizing IL-1 in mice with established infection reduced lung neutrophil numbers and partially restored the erythroid progenitor populations that are depleted by LZD. In macaques, we found no conclusive evidence of bone marrow suppression associated with LZD, indicating our treatment time may have been short enough to avoid the toxicities observed in humans. Though treatment was only 4 weeks (the FDA approved regimen at the time of study), we observed sterilization of the majority of granulomas regardless of co-administration of the FDA-approved IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Rn), also known as Anakinra. However total lung inflammation was significantly reduced in macaques treated with IL-1Rn and LZD compared to LZD alone. Importantly, IL-1Rn administration did not impair the host response against Mtb or LZD efficacy in either animal model. Together, our data support that inhibition of IL-1 in combination with LZD has potential to be an effective HDT for TB and the need for further research in this area.",
