    "abstract": "Systemic amyloidosis represents a class of disorders in which misfolded proteins are secreted by effector organs and deposited as proteotoxic aggregates at downstream target tissues. Despite being well-described clinically, the contribution of effector organs such as the liver to the pathogenesis of these diseases is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based model of hereditary transthyretin (TTR) amyloid disease (ATTR amyloidosis) in order to define the contributions of hepatic cells to the distal proteotoxicity of secreted TTR. To this end, we employ a gene correction strategy to generate isogenic, ATTR amyloidosis patient-specific iPSCs expressing either amyloidogenic or wild-type TTR. We further utilize this gene editing strategy in combination with single cell RNAseq to identify multiple hepatic proteostasis factors, including many components of adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways, whose expression correlates with the production of destabilized TTR variants in iPSC-derived hepatic cells. We further demonstrate that enhancing ER proteostasis within ATTR amyloidosis iPSC-derived hepatic lineages via stress-independent activation of aforementioned adaptive UPR signaling preferentially reduces the secretion of destabilized amyloidogenic TTR. Together, these results suggest the potential of the liver to chaperone-at-a-distance and impact pathogenesis at downstream target cells in the context of systemic amyloid disease, and further highlight the promise of UPR modulating therapeutics for the treatment of TTR-mediated and other amyloid diseases.",

We investigated the dynamics of expression of MTS1338, a small non-coding RNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in the mouse model in vivo, regulation of its expression in the ex vivo infected macrophages, and the consequences of its overexpression in bacterial cultures. Here we demonstrate that MTS1338 significantly contributes to host-pathogen interactions. Activation of the host immune system triggered NO-inducible up-regulation of MTS1338 in macrophage-engulfed mycobacteria. Constitutive overexpression of MTS1338 in cultured mycobacteria improved their survival in vitro under low pH conditions. MTS1338 up-regulation launched a spectrum of shifts in the transcriptome profile similar to those reported for M. tuberculosis adaptation to hostile intra-macrophage environment. Using the RNA-seq approach, we demonstrate that gene expression changes accompanying MTS1338 overexpression indicate reduction in translational activity and bacterial growth, which is consistent with entering the dormant state. Taken together, our results suggest a direct involvement on this sRNA in the interplay between mycobacteria and the host immune system during infectious process.",

Community support and behavioural changes are essential for the success of control interventions. This study aimed to explore beliefs, prevention attitudes and health care-seeking behaviours towards scabies in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau.\n\nMethodsData were collected through two methods. Community key informants (community members, community health workers, healthcare workers and traditional healers) were interviewed using snowball sampling. A questionnaire covering perceptions, attitudes and practices was administered to community members using random cluster sampling. Thematic analysis of qualitative data was applied to identify themes. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data analysis.\n\nResultsThere was a satisfactory awareness about scabies, but perceptions about disease causation and transmission were imprecise. Misconceptions about personal hygiene as the primary measure for scabies prevention were recurrent. Some participants recognised the importance of early treatment to interrupt transmission. Treatment of close contacts was not considered important. Costs were the main determining factor for treatment choice between traditional healer and the local health centre. Late presentation and delayed treatment were common and associated with poverty and stigmatisation. Scabies impaired quality of life by affecting social interactions, health, fitness to work and school attendance.\n\nConclusionsThere is a need to improve education, recognition, management and affordable access to treatment. Community education, healthcare workers training and skin NTDs integrated control programmes should address the challenges highlighted in this study.\n\nAuthors SummaryScabies is a common skin infection in low income settings. We conducted a study in Guinea-Bissau to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices about scabies. We conducted interviews with healthcare workers, traditional healers and community members and additionally used an oral-administered questionnaire with a larger sample of community residents. Most individuals had knowledge of scabies and were aware that person to person transmission occurred. However personal and environmental hygiene were both incorrectly identified as particularly important in the transmission of scabies. Cost played a major role in determining where individuals sought care and both poverty and disease associated stigma resulted in delays seeking care. There is a need to improve community and health care worker education about scabies and improve affordable access to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have implicated common and rare genetic variants as risk factors for late onset Alzheimers disease (AD, LOAD). Here, weighted burden analysis was applied to over 10,000 exome sequenced subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project. Analyses were carried out to investigate whether rare variants predicted to have a functional effect within a gene were more commonly seen in cases or in controls. Confirmatory results were obtained for TREM2, ABCA7 and SORL1. Additional support was provided for PSEN1 (p = 0.0002), which previously had been only weakly implicated in LOAD. There was suggestive evidence that functional variants in PIK3R1, WNT7A, C1R and EXOC5 might increase risk and that variants in TIAF1 and/or NDRG2 might have a protective effect. Overall, there was strong evidence (p = 5 x 10-6) that variants in tyrosine phosphatase genes reduce the risk of developing LOAD. Since PIK3R1 variants are expected to impair PI3K/Akt/GSK-3{beta} signalling while variants in tyrosine phosphatase genes would enhance it, these findings are in line with those from animal models suggesting that this pathway is protective against AD.",

    "abstract": "Tandem calponin homology (CH1-CH2) domains are common actin-binding domains in proteins that interact with and organize the actin cytoskeleton. Despite regions of high sequence similarity, CH1-CH2 domains can have remarkably different actin-binding properties, with disease-associated point mutants known to increase as well as decrease affinity for f-actin. To investigate features that affect CH1-CH2 affinity for f-actin in cells and in vitro, we perturbed the utrophin actin-binding domain by making point mutations at the CH1-CH2 interface, replacing the linker domain, and adding a PEG polymer to CH2. Consistent with a previous model describing CH2 as a steric negative regulator of actin binding, we find that utrophin CH1-CH2 affinity is both increased and decreased by modifications that change the effective  openness of CH1 and CH2 in solution. We also identified interface mutations that caused a large increase in affinity without changing solution  openness, suggesting additional influences on affinity. Interestingly, we also observe non-uniform sub-cellular localization of utrophin CH1-CH2 that depends on the N-terminal flanking region but not on bulk affinity. These observations provide new insights into how small sequence changes, such as those found in diseases, can affect CH1-CH2 binding properties.",

    "abstract": "The reliability of scientific results critically depends on reproducible and transparent data processing. Cross-subject and cross-study comparability of imaging data in general, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in particular, is contingent on the quality of registration to a standard reference space. In small animal MRI this is not adequately provided by currently used processing workflows, which utilize high-level scripts optimized for human data, and adapt animal data to fit the scripts, rather than vice-versa. In this fully reproducible article we showcase a generic workflow optimized for the mouse brain, alongside a standard reference space suited to harmonize data between analysis and operation. We introduce four separate metrics for automated quality control (QC), and a visualization method to aid operator inspection. Benchmarking this workflow against common legacy practices reveals that it performs more consistently, better preserves variance across subjects while minimizing variance across sessions, and improves both volume and smoothness conservation RMSE approximately 2-fold. We propose this open source workflow and the QC metrics as a new standard for small animal MRI registration, ensuring workflow robustness, data comparability, and region assignment validity, all of which are indispensable prerequisites for the comparability of scientific results across experiments and centers.",

    "abstract": "A rapidly growing number of studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have used resting-state fMRI to identify alterations of functional connectivity, with the hope of identifying clinical biomarkers or underlying neural mechanisms. However, results have been largely inconsistent across studies, and there is therefore a pressing need to determine the primary factors influencing replicability. Here, we used resting-state fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange to investigate two potential factors: denoising strategy and data site (which differ in terms of sample, data acquisition, etc.). We examined the similarity of both group-average functional connectomes and group-level differences (ASD vs. control) across 33 denoising pipelines and four independently-acquired datasets. The group-average connectomes were highly consistent across pipelines (r = 0.92{+/-}0.06) and sites (r = 0.88{+/-}0.02). However, the group differences, while still consistent within site across pipelines (r = 0.76{+/-}0.12), were highly inconsistent across sites regardless of choice of denoising strategies (r = 0.07{+/-}0.04), suggesting lack of replication may be strongly influenced by site and/or cohort differences. Across-site similarity remained low even when considering the data at a large-scale network level or when considering only the most significant edges. We further show through an extensive literature survey that the parameters chosen in the current study (i.e., sample size, age range, preprocessing methods) are quite representative of the published literature. These results highlight the importance of examining replicability in future studies of ASD, and, more generally, call for extra caution when interpreting alterations in functional connectivity across groups of individuals.",

    "abstract": "The temporal dynamics of stride-to-stride fluctuations in steady-state walking reveal important information about locomotor control and can be quantified using so-called fractal analyses, notably the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Gait dynamics are often collected during treadmill walking using 3-D motion capture to identify gait events from kinematic data. The sampling frequency of motion capture systems may impact the precision of event detection and consequently impact the quantification of stride-to-stride variability. This study aimed i) to determine if collecting multiple walking trials with different sampling frequency affects DFA values of spatiotemporal parameters during treadmill walking, and ii) to determine the reliability of DFA values across downsampled conditions. Seventeen healthy young adults walked on a treadmill while their gait dynamics was captured using different sampling frequency (60, 120 and 240 Hz) in each condition. We also compared data from the highest sampling frequency to downsampled versions of itself. We applied DFA to the following time series: step length, time and speed, and stride length, time and speed. Reliability between experimental conditions and between downsampled conditions were measured with 1) intraclass correlation estimates and their 95% confident intervals, calculated based on a single-measurement, absolute-agreement, two-way mixed-effects model (ICC 3,1), and 2) Bland-Altman bias and limits of agreement. Both analyses revealed a poor reliability of DFA results between conditions using different sampling frequencies, but a relatively good reliability between original and downsampled spatiotemporal variables. Collectively, our results suggest that using sampling frequencies of 120 Hz or 240 Hz provide similar results, but that using 60 Hz may alter DFA values. We recommend that gait kinematics should be collected at around 120 Hz, which provides a compromise between event detection accuracy and processing time.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic kinetic models of biological pathways are an important tool for understanding biological systems. Constructing kinetic models requires fitting the parameters to experimental data. However, parameter fitting on these models is a non-convex, non-linear optimization problem. Many algorithms have been proposed to addressing optimization for parameter fitting including globally convergent, population-based algorithms. The computational complexity of the this optimization for even modest models means that parallelization is essential. Past approaches to parameter optimization have focused on parallelizing a particular algorithm. However, this requires re-implementing the algorithm usinga distributed computing framework, which requires a significant investment of time and effort. There are two major drawbacks of this approach: First, the choice of best algorithm may depend on the model. Given the large variety of optimization algorithms available, it is difficult to re-implement every potentially useful algorithm. Second, when new advances are made in a given optimization algorithm, the parallel implementation must be updated to take advantage of these advantages. Thus, there is a continual burden placed on the parallel implementation. The drawbacks of re-implementing algorithms lead us to a different approach to parallelizing parameter optimization. Instead of parallelizing the algorithms themselves, we run many instances of the algorithm on single cores. This provides great flexibility as to the choice of algorithms by allowing us to reuse previous implementations. Also, it does not require the creation and maintenance of parallel versions of optimization algorithms. This approach is known as the island method. To our knowledge, the utility of the island method for parameter fitting in systems biology has not been previously demonstrated. For the parameter fitting problem, we allow islands to exchange information about their \\\"best\\\" solutions so that all islands leverage the discoveries of the few. This turns out to be avery effective in practice, leading to super-linear speedups. That is, if a single processor finds the optimal value of parameters in time t, then N processors exchanging information in this way find the optimal value much faster than t/N. We show that the island method is able to consistently provide good speedups for these problems. We also benchmark the island method against a variety of large, challenging kinetic models and show that it is able to consistently improve the quality of fit in less time than a single-threaded implementation.Our software is available at https://github.com/sys-bio/sabaody under a Apache 2.0 license.\\n\\nContactmailto:medjk@comcast.net",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPIn temperate forest ecosystems, the role of deer in litter decomposition, a key nutrient cycling process, remains debated. Deer may modify the decomposition process by affecting plant cover and thus modifying litter abundance. They can also alter litter quality through differential browsing and affect decomposer ability by changing soil abiotic properties and the nature of decomposer communities. We used two litterbag experiments in a quasi-experimental situation resulting from the introduction of Sitka black-tailed deer Odocoileus odocoileus sitkensis on forested islands of Haida Gwaii (Canada). We investigated the effects of deer on decomposition through their impacts on litter quality and on decomposer ability. After one year, the effect of deer on litter quality resulted in a lower rate of mass loss in litter from litterbags. This mass loss mainly reflected a 21 and 38 % lower rate of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) loss, respectively. Presence of deer resulted in lower decomposer ability for the rate of carbon loss, but not for nitrogen loss. The level of C loss after one year was 5% higher for litter decomposing on an island without deer. But the change in the rate of carbon loss explained by the effect of deer on decomposer ability was outweighed by the effect deer had on litter quality. Additional effects of deer on the decomposition process through feces deposition were significant but minor. These results question the role the large increase in deer populations observed in temperate forests at continental scales may play in broad scale patterns of C and N cycling.",

In spatially structured environments, dispersal can affect the probability of rescue. Here, we model an environment consisting of patches that degrade one after another, and we investigate the probability of rescue by a mutant adapted to the degraded habitat. We focus on the effects of dispersal and of immigration biases. We find that the probability of evolutionary rescue can undergo up to three phases: (i) starting from low dispersal rates, it increases with dispersal; (ii) at intermediate dispersal rates, it decreases; (iii) finally, at large dispersal rates, the probability of rescue increases again with dispersal, except if mutants are too counter-selected in not-yet-degraded patches. The probability of rescue is generally highest when mutant and wild-type individuals preferentially immigrate into patches that have already undergone environmental change. Additionally, we find that mutants that will eventually rescue the population most likely first appear in non-degraded patches, and that the relative contribution of standing genetic variation vs. de-novo mutations declines with increasing emigration rates. Overall, our results show that habitat choice, when compared to the often studied unbiased immigration scheme, can substantially alter the dynamics of population survival and adaptation to new environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNext-generation sequence (NGS) has rapidly developed in past years which makes whole-genome sequencing (WGS) becoming a more cost- and time-efficient choice in wide range of biological researches. We usually focus on some variant detection via WGS data, such as detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertion and deletion (Indel) and copy number variant (CNV), which playing an important role in many human diseases. However, the feasibility of CNV detection based on WGS by DNBSEQ platforms was unclear. We systematically analysed the genome-wide CNV detection power of DNBSEQ platforms and Illumina platforms on NA12878 with five commonly used tools, respectively.\\n\\nResultsDNBSEQ platforms showed stable ability to detect slighter more CNVs on genome-wide (average 1.24-fold than Illumina platforms). Then, CNVs based on DNBSEQ platforms and Illumina platforms were evaluated with two public benchmarks of NA12878, respectively. DNBSEQ and Illumina platforms showed similar sensitivities and precisions on both two benchmarks. Further, the difference between tools for CNV detection was analyzed, and indicated the selection of tool for CNV detection could affected the CNV performance, such as count, distribution, sensitivity and precision.\\n\\nConclusionThe major contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide for CNV detection based on WGS by DNBSEQ platforms for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) provides a promising target for microbial source tracking because it is unique to humans and universal across human individuals. We developed a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay, hCYTB484, targeting the cytochrome b gene of the human mtDNA and compared the performance of the hCYTB484 assay with a widely used assay targeting human-associated Bacteroides, the HF183/BacR287 assay. We also defined and validated the analytical limit of detection and analytical lower limit of quantification; these analytical limits determine the concentration levels above which samples are declared to be positive and quantifiable for the target, respectively. We found both assays to be highly specific (95%) against cow and pig feces; however, the hCYTB484 was more sensitive when tested against individual human feces from US, Bangladesh, and Mozambique (100% versus a mean of 51% across the 3 countries). To further compare the performance of the two assays, we utilized a receiver operating characteristic curve, showing that the hCYTB484 marker was widely distributed across human feces from the 3 different geographical regions tested and in higher quantities than the HF183/BacR287 marker. The higher performance of the hCYTB484 marker in individual feces is a desirable characteristic in the detection of fecal pollution from sources to which fewer individuals contribute, such as non-sewered types of sanitation that serve most of Earths population and carry the highest risk of exposure to fecal-oral pathogens.\\n\\nImportanceThe usefulness of an ideal human-specific, culture- and library-independent marker to the microbial source tracking field is reflected by the numerous efforts to develop such markers; however, thus far, microbial-based markers of this type have exhibited variable source-specificity across geographies and variable sensitivity across scales of fecal waste. Most of the worlds population is served by non-sewered forms of sanitation that also carry the highest risk of exposure to fecal-oral pathogens. This reality underscores the need for markers of human fecal contamination that have high sensitivity in fecal pollution sources to which fewer individuals contribute to, such as fecal sludges found in pit latrines. We show that human mtDNA-based methods can be highly source-specific and highly sensitive in smaller scales of fecal pollution, providing a useful addition to the microbial source tracking toolbox by complementing the variable performance of microbial-based markers.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin remodeling plays a critical role in tumor suppression as demonstrated by 20% of human cancers bearing inactivating mutations in SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex members. Mutations in different SWI/SNF subunits drive a variety of adult and pediatric tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancers, rhabdoid tumors, medulloblastomas, and ovarian cancers. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is an aggressive subtype of ovarian cancer occurring in young women. Nearly all (>98%) SCCOHTs have inactivating mutations in SMARCA4, which encodes 1 of 2 mutually exclusive catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. Less than half of SCCOHT patients survive 5 years despite aggressive surgery and multimodal chemotherapy. Empirical support for effective SCCOHT treatments is scarce, in part because of the poor understanding of SCCOHT tumorigenesis. To gain insight into the functional consequences of SWI/SNF subunit loss, we defined SWI/SNF composition and its protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) of SWI/SNF subunits in 3 SCCOHT cell lines. Comparing these results to a cell line containing a wild-type SWI/SNF complex, the interaction of most canonical core SWI/SNF subunits was observed in all SCCOHT cell lines at a lower abundance. The SCCOHT SWI/SNF also lacked ATPase module subunits and showed a drastic reduction in PBAF-specific subunit interactions. The wild-type and SCCOHT SWI/SNF subunits immunoprecipitated a shared set of 26 proteins, including core SWI/SNF subunits and RNA processing proteins. We observed 131 proteins exclusively interacting with the wild-type SWI/SNF complex including isoform-specific SWI/SNF subunits, members of the NuRD complex, and members of the MLL3/4 complex. We observed 60 PPIs exclusive to the SCCOHT residual SWI/SNF shared in at least 2 of the 3 SCCOHT cell lines, including many proteins involved in RNA processing. Differential interactions with the residual SWI/SNF complex in SCCOHT may further elucidate altered functional consequences of SMARCA4 mutations in these tumors as well as identify synthetic lethal targets that translate to other SWI/SNF-deficient tumors.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, predicting and even controlling evolutionary processes is a sought after goal in fields ranging from agriculture, artificial intelligence, astrobiology, oncology, and infectious diseases. However, our ability to predict evolution and plan such interventions in real populations is limited in part by our understanding of how spatial structure modulates evolutionary dynamics. Among current clinical assays applied to predict drug response in infectious diseases, for instance, many do not explicitly consider spatial structure and its influence on phenotypic heterogeneity, despite it being an inextricable characteristic of real populations. As spatially structured populations are subject to increased interference of beneficial mutants compared to their well-mixed counter-parts, among other effects, this population heterogeneity and structure may non-trivially impact drug response. In spatially-structured populations, the extent of this mutant interference is density dependent and thus varies with relative position within a meta-population in a manner modulated by mutant frequency, selection strength, migration speed, and habitat length, among other factors. In this study, we examine beneficial mutant fixation dynamics along the front of an asexual population expanding its range. We observe that multiple distinct evolutionary regimes of beneficial mutant origin-fixation dynamics are maintained at characteristic length scales along the front of the population expansion. Using an agent-based simulation of range expansion with mutation and selection in one dimension, we measure these length scales across a range of population sizes, selection strengths, and mutation rates. Furthermore, using simple scaling arguments to adapt theory from well-mixed populations, we find that the length scale at the tip of the front within which  local mutant fixation occurs in a successive mode decreases with increasing mutation rate, as well as population size in a manner predicted by our derived analytic expression. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings to real cellular populations, arguing that this conserved region of successive mutant fixation dynamics at the wave tip can be exploited by emerging evolutionary control strategies.",

    "abstract": "The foundation of bacterial cell cycle studies has long resided in two interconnected dogmas between biomass growth, DNA replication, and cell division during exponential growth: the SMK growth law that relates cell mass (a measure of cell size) to growth rate1, and Donachies hypothesis of a growth-rate-independent initiation mass2. These dogmas have spurred many efforts to understand their molecular bases and physiological consequences3-12. Most of these studies focused on fast-growing cells, with doubling times shorter than 60 min. Here, we systematically studied the cell cycle of E. coli for a broad range of doubling times (24 min to over 10 hr), with particular attention on steady-state growth. Surprisingly, we observed that neither dogma held across the range of growth rates examined. In their stead, a new linear relation unifying the slow- and fast-growth regimes was revealed between the cell mass and the number of cell divisions it takes to replicate and segregate a newly initiated pair of replication origins. This and other findings in this study suggest a single-cell division model, which not only reproduces the bulk relations observed but also recapitulates the adder phenomenon established recently for stochastically dividing cells13-15. These results allowed us to develop quantitative insight into the bacterial cell cycle, providing a firm new foundation for the study of bacterial growth physiology.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase III (pol III) transcribes multiple non-coding (nc) RNAs that are essential for cellular function. Pol III-dependent transcription is also engaged during certain viral infections, including the gammaherpesviruses ({gamma}HVs), where pol III-dependent viral ncRNAs promote pathogenesis. Additionally, several host ncRNAs are upregulated during {gamma}HV infection and play integral roles in pathogenesis by facilitating viral establishment and gene expression. Here, we sought to investigate how pol III promoters and transcripts are regulated during gammaherpesvirus infection using the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ({gamma}HV68) system. To compare the transcription of host and viral pol III-dependent ncRNAs, we analyzed a series of pol III promoters for host and viral ncRNAs using a luciferase reporter optimized to measure pol III activity. We measured promoter activity from the reporter gene at the translation level via luciferase activity and at the transcription level via RT-qPCR. We further measured endogenous ncRNA expression at single cell-resolution by flow cytometry. These studies demonstrated that lytic infection with {gamma}HV68 increased the transcription from multiple host and viral pol III promoters, and further identified the ability of accessory sequences to influence both baseline and inducible promoter activity after infection. RNA flow cytometry revealed the induction of endogenous pol III-derived ncRNAs that tightly correlated with viral gene expression. These studies highlight how lytic gammaherpesvirus infection alters the transcriptional landscape of host cells to increase pol III-derived RNAs, a process that may further modify cellular function and enhance viral gene expression and pathogenesis.\n\nIMPORTANCEGammaherpesviruses are a prime example of how viruses can alter the host transcriptional landscape to establish infection. Despite major insights into how these viruses modify RNA polymerase II-dependent generation of messenger RNAs, how these viruses influence the activity of host RNA polymerase III remains much less clear. Small non-coding RNAs produced by RNA polymerase III are increasingly recognized to play critical regulatory roles in cell biology and virus infection. Studies of RNA polymerase III dependent transcription are complicated by multiple promoter types and diverse RNAs with variable stability and processing requirements. Here, we characterized a reporter system to directly study RNA polymerase III-dependent responses during gammaherpesvirus infection and utilized single-cell flow cytometry-based methods to reveal that gammaherpesvirus lytic replication broadly induces pol III activity to enhance host and viral non-coding RNA expression within the infected cell.",

Multiple factors influence readthrough efficiency, including nonsense codon specificity and context. To determine whether nonsense codon position in a gene influences the extent of readthrough, we generated a series of LUC nonsense alleles and quantitated both readthrough and termination efficiencies at each nonsense codon in yeast cells lacking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) activity. Readthrough efficiency for premature termination codons (PTCs) manifested a marked dependence on PTC proximity to the mRNA 3-end, decreasing progressively across the LUC ORF but increasing with 3-UTR lengthening. These effects were eliminated, and translation termination efficiency decreased considerably, in cells harboring pab1 mutations.

    "abstract": "PURPOSEThe modern researcher is confronted with hundreds of published methods to interpret genetic variants. There are databases of genes and variants, phenotype-genotype relationships, algorithms that score and rank genes, and in silico variant effect prediction tools. Because variant prioritization is a multi-factorial problem, a welcome development in the field has been the emergence of decision support frameworks, which make it easier to integrate multiple resources in an interactive environment. Current decision support frameworks are typically limited by closed proprietary architectures, access to a restricted set of tools, lack of customizability, web dependencies that expose protected data, or limited scalability.\\n\\nMETHODSWe present OpenCRAVAT, a new open source, scalable decision support system for variant and gene prioritization. We have designed the resource catalog to be open and modular to maximize community and developer involvement, and as a result the catalog is being actively developed and growing every month. Resources made available via the store are well-suited for analysis of cancer, as well as Mendelian and complex diseases.\\n\\nRESULTSOpenCRAVAT offers both command line utility and dynamic GUI, allowing users to install with a single command, easily download tools from an extensive resource catalog, create customized pipelines, and explore results in a richly detailed viewing environment. We present several case studies to illustrate the design of custom workflows to prioritize genes and variants.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONOpenCRAVAT is distinguished from similar tools by its capabilities to access and integrate an unprecedented amount of diverse data resources and computational prediction methods, which span germline, somatic, common, rare, coding and non-coding variants.

    "abstract": "When stretched, cells cultured on 2D substrates share a universal softening and fluidization response that arises from poorly understood remodeling of well-conserved cytoskeletal elements. It is known, however, that the structure and distribution of the cytoskeleton is profoundly influenced by the dimensionality of a cells environment. Therefore, in this study we aimed to determine whether cells cultured in a 3D matrix share this softening behavior and to link it to cytoskeletal remodeling. To achieve this, we developed a high-throughput approach to measure the dynamic mechanical properties of cells and allow for sub-cellular imaging within physiologically relevant 3D microtissues. We found that fibroblast, smooth muscle and skeletal muscle microtissues strain softened but did not fluidize, and upon loading cessation, they regained their initial mechanical properties. Furthermore, microtissue prestress decreased with the strain amplitude to maintain a constant mean tension. This adaptation under an auxotonic condition resulted in lengthening. A filamentous actin cytoskeleton was required, and responses were mirrored by changes to actin remodeling rates and visual evidence of stretch-induced actin depolymerization. Our new approach for assessing cell mechanics has linked behaviors seen in 2D cultures to a 3D matrix, and connected remodeling of the cytoskeleton to homeostatic mechanical regulation of tissues.",

    "abstract": "mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase which acts a master regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Raptor, a scaffolding protein that recruits substrates to mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), is known to be phosphorylated during mitosis, but the significance of this phosphorylation remains largely unknown. Here we show that raptor expression and mTORC1 activity are dramatically reduced in mitotic arrested cells across a variety of cancer and normal cell lines. Prevention of raptor phosphorylation during mitosis resulted in reactivation of mTORC1 in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Importantly, expression of a non-phosphorylatable raptor mutant caused a dramatic reduction in cytotoxicity of the spindle poison Taxol. This effect was mediated via degradation of Programmed Cell Death Protein 4 (PDCD4), a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits eIF4A activity and is negatively regulated by the mTORC1/S6K pathway. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A was able to enhance the effects of taxol and restore sensitivity in Taxol resistant cancer cells. These findings indicate that the mTORC1/S6K/PDCD4/eIF4A axis has a pivotal role in death vs. slippage decision during prolonged mitotic arrest and may be exploited to gain a clinical benefit in treating cancers resistant to anti-mitotic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Non-segmented negative-stranded (NNS) RNA viruses, among them the virus that causes rabies (RABV), include many deadly human pathogens. The large polymerase (L) proteins of NNS-RNA viruses carry all the enzymatic functions required for viral mRNA transcription and replication: RNA polymerization, mRNA capping, cap methylation. We describe here a complete structure of RABV L bound with its phosphoprotein cofactor (P), determined by electron cryo-microscopy at 3.3 [A] resolution. The complex closely resembles vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) L-P, the one other known full-length NNS-RNA L protein structure, with key local differences (e.g., in L-P interactions). Like the VSV L-P structure, the RABV complex analyzed here represents a pre-initiation conformation. Comparison with the likely elongation state, seen in two partial structures of pneumovirus L-P complexes, suggests differences between priming/initiation and elongation complexes. Analysis of internal cavities within RABV L suggests distinct template and product entry and exit pathways during transcription and replication.",

    "abstract": "Individual excitatory neurons in visual cortex (V1) display remarkably stable mean firing rates over many days, even though these rates can differ by several orders of magnitude between neurons. When perturbed, each neurons firing rate is slowly regulated back to its pre-perturbation level, demonstrating that neurons maintain their mean firing rate around an individual firing rate set point (FRSP). To better understand the mechanisms that neurons within a single cell type use to maintain different FRSPs in vivo, we implemented a novel method of activity labeling that uses CaMPARI2, a fluorescent protein that undergoes Ca2+- and UV-dependent green-to-red photoconversion, to permanently label neurons in freely behaving mice based on their firing rates. We found that immediate early gene (IEG) expression was correlated with CaMPARI2 red/green ratio following an activity stimulation paradigm, and that neurons with greater photoconversion in vivo tended to have a higher firing rate ex vivo. In layer 4 (L4) pyramidal neurons in mouse monocular V1, which comprise a single transcriptional cell type, we found that high activity neurons had a left-shifted F-I curve, lower rheobase current, and decreased spike adaptation index relative to low activity neurons, demonstrating increased intrinsic excitability. Surprisingly, we found no difference in total excitatory or inhibitory synaptic current or in E/I ratio between high and low activity neurons. Thus, within a single cell type differences in intrinsic excitability and spike frequency adaptation can contribute to divergent activity set points. These results reveal that E/I ratio plays only a minor role in determining the firing rate set point of L4 pyramidal neurons, while intrinsic excitability is an important factor.",

    "abstract": "Plants uniquely have a family of proteins called extra-large G proteins (XLG) that share homology in their C-terminal half with the canonical G subunits; we carefully detail here that Arabidopsis XLG2 lacks critical residues requisite for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis which is consistent with our quantitative analyses. Based on microscale thermophoresis, Arabidopsis XLG2 binds GTP{gamma}S with an affinity 100-1000 times lower than that to canonical G subunits. This means that given the concentration range of guanine nucleotide in plant cells, XLG2 is not likely bound by GTP in vivo. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations provide a plausible mechanism for the poor nucleotide binding affinity of XLG2. Simulations indicate substantially stronger salt bridge networks formed by several key amino-acid residues of AtGPA1 which are either misplaced or missing in XLG2. These residues in AtGPA1 not only maintain the overall shape and integrity of the apoprotein cavity but also increase the frequency of favorable nucleotide-protein interactions in the nucleotide-bound state. Despite this loss of nucleotide dependency, XLG2 binds the RGS domain of AtRGS1 with an affinity similar to the Arabidopsis AtGPA1 in its apo-state and about 2 times lower than AtGPA1 in its transition state. In addition, XLG2 binds the G{beta}{gamma} dimer with an affinity similar to that of AtGPA1. XLG2 likely acts as a dominant negative G protein to block G protein signaling. We propose that XLG2, independent of guanine nucleotide binding, regulates the active state of the canonical G protein pathway directly by sequestering G{beta}{gamma} and indirectly by promoting heterodimer formation.",
