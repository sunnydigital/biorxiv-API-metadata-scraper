    "abstract": "Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) GABAergic interneurons mediate feedforward and feedback inhibition and have a key role in gamma oscillations and information processing. The importance of fast synaptic recruitment, action potential initiation and repolarization, and rapid synchronous GABA release by PV+ cells is well established. In contrast, the functional significance of PV+ cell NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which generate relatively slow postsynaptic currents, is unclear. Underlining their importance, several studies implicate PV+ cell NMDAR disruption in impaired network function and circuit pathologies. Here, we show that dendritic NMDARs underlie supralinear integration of feedback excitation from local pyramidal neurons onto mouse CA1 PV+ cells. Furthermore, by incorporating NMDARs at feedback connections onto PV+ cells in spiking networks, we show that these receptors enable cooperative recruitment of PV+ interneurons, strengthening and stabilising principal cell assemblies. Failure of this phenomenon provides a parsimonious explanation for cognitive and sensory gating deficits in pathologies with impaired PV+ NMDAR signalling.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCancers are routinely classified into subtypes according to various features, including histopathological characteristics and molecular markers. Previous genome-wide association studies have reported heterogeneous associations between loci and cancer subtypes. However, it is not evident what is the optimal modeling strategy for handling correlated tumor features, missing data, and increased degrees-of-freedom in the underlying tests of associations. We propose to test for genetic associations using a mixed-effect two-stage polytomous model score test (MTOP). In the first stage, a standard polytomous model is used to specify all possible sub-types defined by the cross-classification of the tumor characteristics. In the second stage, the subtype-specific case-control odds ratios are specified using a more parsimonious model based on the case-control odds ratio for a baseline subtype, and the case-case parameters associated with tumor markers. Further, to reduce the degrees-of-freedom, we specify case-case parameters for additional exploratory markers using a random-effect model. We use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to account for missing data on tumor markers. Through simulations across a range of realistic scenarios and data from the Polish Breast Cancer Study (PBCS), we show MTOP outperforms alternative methods for identifying heterogeneous associations between risk loci and tumor subtypes. The proposed methods have been implemented in a user-friendly and high-speed R statistical package called TOP (https://github.com/andrewhaoyu/TOP).",

    "abstract": "Curiosity is often portrayed as a desirable feature of human faculty. However, curiosity may come at a cost that sometimes puts people in a harmful situation. Here, with a set of behavioural and neuroimaging experiments using stimuli that strongly trigger curiosity (e.g., magic tricks), we examined the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the motivational effect of curiosity. We consistently demonstrated that across different samples, people were indeed willing to gamble, subjecting themselves to physical risks (i.e. electric shocks) in order to satisfy their curiosity for trivial knowledge that carries no apparent instrumental value. Also, this influence of curiosity shares common neural mechanisms with that of extrinsic incentives (i.e. hunger for food). In particular, we showed that acceptance (compared to rejection) of curiosity/incentive-driven gambles was accompanied by enhanced activity in the ventral striatum (when curiosity was elicited), which extended into the dorsal striatum (when participants made a decision).",

Here we show that distant correlations in the fragment length of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) recapitulate three-dimensional chromatin organization. The inferred organization is highly concordant with that measured by Hi-C in white blood cells from healthy donors, and is not explained by technical bias or sequence composition. Furthermore, the inferred organization reflects different genomic organization in the various cell types contributing to cfDNA, allowing identification and quantification of tissues of origin. This approach is concordant with previous methods, but with more complete representations of cfDNA.

    "abstract": "Disrupted sleep is a major feature of Alzheimers Disease (AD), often arising years before symptoms of cognitive decline. Prolonged wakefulness exacerbates the production of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) species, a major driver of AD progression, suggesting that sleep loss further accelerates AD through a vicious cycle. However, the mechanisms by which A{beta} affects sleep are unknown. We demonstrate in zebrafish that A{beta} acutely and reversibly enhances or suppresses sleep as a function of oligomer length. Genetic disruptions revealed that short A{beta} oligomers induce acute wakefulness through Adrenergic receptor b2 (Adrb2) and Progesterone membrane receptor component 1 (Pgrmc1), while longer A{beta} forms induce sleep through a pharmacologically tractable Prion Protein (PrP) signalling cascade. Our data indicate that A{beta} can trigger a bi-directional sleep/wake switch. Alterations to the brains A{beta} oligomeric milieu, such as during the progression of AD, may therefore disrupt sleep via changes in acute signalling events.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIAmyloid beta oligomers can drive either sleep or wakefulness, depending on their size\nC_LIO_LIWakefulness driven by short amyloid beta oligomers requires binding partners Adrenergic Beta Receptor 2 and Pgrmc1\nC_LIO_LILong amyloid beta oligomers drive sleep through interaction with Prion Protein\nC_LIO_LIThe in vivo sleep effects of amyloid beta can be pharmacologically blocked by targeting several steps of the Amyloid beta-Prion Protein signalling cascade.\nC_LI",

Here we used diffusion MRI (dMRI) for the in-vivo identification of the abnormally high proportion of crossing fibres found in the optic chiasm of people with albinism.\\n\\nMethodsIn 9 individuals with albinism and 8 controls high-resolution 3T dMRI data was acquired and analyzed with a set of methods for signal modeling [Diffusion Tensor (DT) and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)], tractography, and streamline filtering (LiFE, COMMIT, and SIFT2). The number of crossing and non-crossing streamlines and their weights after filtering entered ROC-analyses to compare the discriminative power of the methods based on the area under the curve (AUC). The dMRI results were cross-validated with fMRI estimates of misrouting in a subset of 6 albinotic individuals.\\n\\nResultsWe detected significant group differences in chiasmal crossing for both unfiltered DT (p=0.014) and CSD tractograms (p=0.0009) also reflected by AUC measures (for DT and CSD: 0.61 and 0.75, respectively), underlining the discriminative power of the approach. Estimates of crossing strengths obtained with dMRI and fMRI were significantly correlated for CSD (R2=0.83, p=0.012).

Proper DR can allow for effective noise removal and facilitate many downstream analyses that include cell clustering and lineage reconstruction. Unfortunately, despite the critical importance of DR in scRNAseq analysis and the vast number of DR methods developed for scRNAseq studies, however, few comprehensive comparison studies have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of different DR methods in scRNAseq.\\n\\nResultsHere, we aim to fill this critical knowledge gap by providing a comparative evaluation of a variety of commonly used DR methods for scRNAseq studies. Specifically, we compared 18 different DR methods on 30 publicly available scRNAseq data sets that cover a range of sequencing techniques and sample sizes. We evaluated the performance of different DR methods for neighborhood preserving in terms of their ability to recover features of the original expression matrix, and for cell clustering and lineage reconstruction in terms of their accuracy and robustness. We also evaluated the computational scalability of different DR methods by recording their computational cost.\\n\\nConclusionsBased on the comprehensive evaluation results, we provide important guidelines for choosing DR methods for scRNAseq data analysis.

In this study, we assess the consistency of the impacts of semi-natural areas and host crop fields in the landscape on bioagressor abundance in cultivated fields. Our approach relied on the analysis of systematic French epidemiosurveillance data spanning 9 years of observations over two third of the French territory. 30 majors bioagressors of arable crops (wheat, barley, maize, potato, oilseed rape and sugar beet) were jointly studied with landscape composition as described by official CAP data and woody vegetation maps. Beyond the simple correlation between landscape composition and bioagressors abundance, we controlled for the presence of the host crop the former years in the plot and for bioagressors former prevalence. Our findings highlighted that landscape simplification around a same crop does not in general favor epidemic outbreaks during the current growing season, but rather that its harmful effect lie in the season ahead. The effects of semi-natural areas were, however, very contrasted between organisms. This study used available tools and data to quantify automatically in an interpretable way the general impact of landscape components. Such findings have relevant implications for the design of bioagressor management strategies at the landscape scale.\n\nResumeLe paysage agricole est reconnu comme une echelle pertinente pour la gestion des bioagresseurs, insectes arthropodes et maladies cryptogamiques.

    "abstract": "Bayesian theories of cognition assume that people can integrate probabilities rationally. However, several empirical findings contradict this proposition: human probabilistic inferences are prone to systematic deviations from optimality. Puzzlingly, these deviations sometimes go in opposite directions. Whereas some studies suggest that people under-react to prior probabilities (base rate neglect), other studies find that people under-react to the likelihood of the data (conservatism). We argue that these deviations arise because the human brain does not rely solely on a general-purpose mechanism for approximating Bayesian inference that is invariant across queries. Instead, the brain is equipped with a recognition model that maps queries to probability distributions. The parameters of this recognition model are optimized to get the output as close as possible, on average, to the true posterior. Because of our limited computational resources, the recognition model will allocate its resources so as to be more accurate for high probability queries than for low probability queries. By adapting to the query distribution, the recognition model \\\"learns to infer.\\\" We show that this theory can explain why and when people under-react to the data or the prior, and a new experiment demonstrates that these two forms of under-reaction can be systematically controlled by manipulating the query distribution. The theory also explains a range of related phenomena: memory effects, belief bias, and the structure of response variability in probabilistic reasoning. We also discuss how the theory can be integrated with prior sampling-based accounts of approximate inference.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscription factors (TFs) are proteins that are fundamental to transcription and regulation of gene expression. Each TF may regulate multiple genes and each gene may be regulated by multiple TFs. TFs can act as either activator or repressor of gene expression. This complex network of interactions between TFs and genes underlies many developmental and biological processes and is implicated in several human diseases such as cancer. Hence deciphering the network of TF-gene interactions with information on mode of regulation (activation vs. repression) is an important step toward understanding the regulatory pathways that underlie complex traits. There are many experimental, computational, and manually curated databases of TF-gene interactions. In particular, high-throughput ChIP-Seq datasets provide a large-scale map or transcriptional regulatory interactions. However, these interactions are not annotated with information on context and mode of regulation. Such information is crucial to gain a global picture of gene regulatory mechanisms and can aid in developing machine learning models for applications such as biomarker discovery, prediction of response to therapy, and precision medicine.\\n\\nMethodsIn this work, we introduce a text-mining system to annotate ChIP-Seq derived interaction with such meta data through mining PubMed articles. We evaluate the performance of our system using gold standard small scale manually curated databases.\\n\\nResultsOur results show that the method is able to accurately extract mode of regulation with F-score 0.77 on TRRUST curated interaction and F-score 0.96 on intersection of TRUSST and ChIP-network.

    "abstract": "HP1 proteins are best known as markers of heterochromatin and gene silencing. Yet, they are also RNA-binding proteins and the HP1{gamma}/Cbx3 family member is present on transcribed genes together with RNA polymerase II, where it regulates co-transcriptional processes such as alternative splicing. To gain insight in the role of the RNA binding activity of HP1{gamma} in transcriptionally active chromatin, we have captured and analyzed RNAs associated with this protein. We find that HP1{gamma} specifically recognizes hexameric RNA motifs and coincidentally transposable elements of the SINE family. As these elements are abundant in introns, while essentially absent from exons, the HP1{gamma} RNA binding activity tethers unspliced pre-mRNA to chromatin via the intronic region and limits the usage of intronic cryptic splice sites. Thus, our data unveil novel determinants in the relationship between chromatin and co-transcriptional splicing.",

    "abstract": "Adult honey bees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity. While seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous studies have focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute bacterial loads. Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter bees, which live much longer than bees during the foraging season, and which are critical for colony survival. We quantified seven core members of the bee gut microbiota in a single colony over two years and characterized the community composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data shows that total bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and winter bees. Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest community -diversity, with a characteristic shift towards high levels of Bartonella and Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic bee experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed differences in bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut microbiota of winter bees is remarkably different from foragers and nurses. Considering the importance of winter bees for colony survival, future work should focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter bee health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli ST131 is a major cause of infection with extensive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) facilitated by widespread beta-lactam antibiotic use. This drug pressure has driven extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene acquisition and evolution in pathogens, so a clearer resolution of ST131s origin, adaptation and spread is essential. E. coli ST131s ESBL genes are typically embedded in mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that aid transfer to new plasmid or chromosomal locations, which are mobilised further by plasmid conjugation and recombination, resulting in a flexible ESBL, MGE and plasmid composition with a conserved core genome. We used population genomics to trace the evolution of AMR in ST131 more precisely by extracting all available high-quality Illumina HiSeq read libraries to investigate 4,071 globally-sourced genomes, the largest ST131 collection examined so far. We applied rigorous quality-control, genome de novo assembly and ESBL gene screening to resolve ST131s population structure across three genetically distinct Clades (A, B, C) and abundant subclades from the dominant Clade C. We reconstructed their evolutionary relationships across the core and accessory genomes using published reference genomes, long read assemblies and k-mer-based methods to contextualise pangenome diversity. The three main C subclades have co-circulated globally at relatively stable frequencies over time, suggesting attaining an equilibrium after their origin and initial rapid spread. This contrasted with their ESBL genes, which had stronger patterns across time, geography and subclade, and were located at distinct locations across the chromosomes and plasmids between isolates. Within the three C subclades, the core and accessory genome diversity levels were not correlated due to plasmid and MGE activity, unlike patterns between the three main clades, A, B and C. This population genomic study highlights the dynamic nature of the accessory genomes in ST131, suggesting that surveillance should anticipate genetically variable outbreaks with broader antibiotic resistance levels. Our findings emphasise the potential of evolutionary pangenomics to improve our understanding of AMR gene transfer, adaptation and transmission to discover accessory genome changes linked to novel subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Trk receptors are essential for the nervous system development. The molecular mechanism of TrkA activation by its ligand NGF is still unsolved. Recent data indicates that at endogenous levels most of TrkA is in an equilibrium monomer-dimer and the binding of NGF induces an increase of the dimer and oligomer forms of the receptor. An unsolved issue is the role of the transmembrane domain (TMD) in the dimerization of TrkA and the structural details of the TMD in the active dimer receptor. We found that TrkA-TMD can form dimers, identified the structural determinants of the dimer interface in the active receptor and validated this interface using site-directed mutagenesis together with functional and cell differentiation studies. Using in vivo crosslinking we identified a reordering of the extracellular juxtamembrane (JTM) region after ligand binding. Replacement of some residues in the JTM region with cysteine form ligand-independent active dimers and reveal a preferred dimer interface. In addition to that, insertion of leucine residues into the TMD helix induces a ligand-independent TrkA activation suggesting that a rotation of the TMD dimers could be behind TrkA activation by NGF. Altogether our data indicates that the transmembrane and juxtamembrane regions of the receptor play a key role in the dimerization and activation of TrkA by NGF.",

In the present study, we investigated whether the length of the object familiarization period (sample phase) improved subsequent novelty discrimination in the spontaneous object, place, and object-place-context (OPC) recognition tests in rats. In the OPC test, rats showed a significant novelty preference only when the familiarization period was 30 min but not when it was 5 min or 15 min. However, the rats exhibited a successful discrimination between the stayed and replaced objects under 15 min and 30 min familiarization period conditions in the place recognition test and between the novel and familiar objects under all conditions of 5, 15 and 30 min in the object recognition test. Our results suggest that the extension of the familiarization period improves performance in the spontaneous recognition paradigms, and a longer familiarization period is necessary for long-term associative recognition memory than for non-associative memory.",

    "abstract": "The gene regulatory network (GRN) of human cells encodes mechanisms to ensure proper functioning. However, if this GRN is dysregulated, the cell may enter into a disease state such as cancer. Understanding the GRN as a system can therefore help identify novel mechanisms underlying disease, which can lead to new therapies. Reliable inference of GRNs is however still a major challenge in systems biology.\\n\\nTo deduce regulatory interactions relevant to cancer, we applied a recent computational inference framework to data from perturbation experiments in squamous carcinoma cell line A431. GRNs were inferred using several methods, and the false discovery rate was controlled by the NestBoot framework. We developed a novel approach to assess the predictiveness of inferred GRNs against validation data, despite the lack of a gold standard. The best GRN was significantly more predictive than the null model, both in crossvalidated benchmarks and for an independent dataset of the same genes under a different perturbation design. It agrees with many known links, in addition to predicting a large number of novel interactions from which a subset was experimentally validated. The inferred GRN captures regulatory interactions central to cancer-relevant processes and thus provides mechanistic insights that are useful for future cancer research.\\n\\nData available at GSE125958Inferred GRNs and inference statistics available at https://dcolin.shinyapps.io/CancerGRN/ Software available at https://bitbucket.org/sonnhammergrni/genespider/src/BFECV/\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCancer is the second most common cause of death globally, and although cancer treatments have improved in recent years, we need to understand how regulatory mechanisms are altered in cancer to combat the disease efficiently.

Using a recent computational framework for inference together with a novel method for cross validation, we infer a reliable regulatory model of this system in a completely data driven manner, not reliant on literature or priors.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCRISPR/Cas has recently become a widely used genome editing tool in various organisms, including plants. Applying CRISPR/Cas often requires delivering multiple expression units into plant and hence there is a need for a quick and easy cloning procedure. The modular cloning (MoClo), based on the Golden Gate (GG) method, has enabled development of cloning systems with standardised genetic parts, e.g. promoters, coding sequences or terminators, that can be easily interchanged and assembled into expression units, which in their own turn can be further assembled into higher order multigene constructs.\\n\\nResultsHere we present an expanded cloning toolkit that contains ninety-nine modules encoding a variety of CRISPR/Cas-based nucleases and their corresponding guide RNA backbones. Among other components, the toolkit includes a number of promoters that allow expression of CRISPR/Cas nucleases (or any other coding sequences) and their guide RNAs in monocots and dicots. As part of the toolkit, we present a set of modules that enable quick and facile assembly of tRNA-sgRNA polycistronic units without a PCR step involved. We also demonstrate that our tRNA-sgRNA system is functional in wheat protoplasts.\\n\\nConclusionsWe believe the presented CRISPR/Cas toolkit is a great resource that will contribute towards wider adoption of the CRISPR/Cas genome editing technology and modular cloning by researchers across the plant science community.",

    "abstract": "Point scanning imaging systems (e.g. scanning electron or laser scanning confocal microscopes) are perhaps the most widely used tools for high resolution cellular and tissue imaging. Like all other imaging modalities, the resolution, speed, sample preservation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of point scanning systems are difficult to optimize simultaneously. In particular, point scanning systems are uniquely constrained by an inverse relationship between imaging speed and pixel resolution. Here we show these limitations can be mitigated via the use of deep learning-based super-sampling of undersampled images acquired on a point-scanning system, which we termed point-scanning super-resolution (PSSR) imaging. Oversampled, high SNR ground truth images acquired on scanning electron or Airyscan laser scanning confocal microscopes were  crappified to generate semi-synthetic training data for PSSR models that were then used to restore real-world undersampled images. Remarkably, our EM PSSR model could restore undersampled images acquired with different optics, detectors, samples, or sample preparation methods in other labs. PSSR enabled previously unattainable 2 nm resolution images with our serial block face scanning electron microscope system. For fluorescence, we show that undersampled confocal images combined with a multiframe PSSR model trained on Airyscan timelapses facilitates Airyscan-equivalent spatial resolution and SNR with [~]100x lower laser dose and 16x higher frame rates than corresponding high-resolution acquisitions. In conclusion, PSSR facilitates point-scanning image acquisition with otherwise unattainable resolution, speed, and sensitivity.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=116 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/740548v8_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (90K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbf19aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b2cc88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@921e1corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6c5af_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The human 22q11.2 chromosomal deletion is one of the strongest identified genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Although the deletion spans a number of genes, the contribution of each of these to the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DS) is not known. To investigate the effect of individual genes within this interval on the pathophysiology associated with the deletion, we analyzed their role in sleep, a behavior affected in virtually all psychiatric disorders, including the 22q11.2 DS. We identified the gene LZTR1 (night owl, nowl) as a regulator of sleep in Drosophila. Neuronal loss of nowl causes short and fragmented sleep, especially during the night. In humans, LZTR1 has been associated with Ras-dependent neurological diseases also caused by Neurofibromin-1 (Nf1) deficiency. We show that Nf1 loss leads to a night-time sleep phenotype nearly identical to that of nowl loss, and that nowl negatively regulates Ras and interacts with Nf1 in sleep regulation. We also show that nowl is required for metabolic homeostasis, suggesting that LZTR1 may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to obesity associated with the 22q11.2 DS. Furthermore, knockdown of nowl or Nf1 in GABA-responsive sleep-promoting neurons elicits the sleep-fragmentation phenotype, and this defect can be rescued by increased GABAA receptor signaling, indicating that Nowl promotes sleep by decreasing the excitability of GABA-responsive wake-driving neurons. Our results suggest that nowl/LZTR1 may be a conserved regulator of GABA signaling and sleep that contributes to the 22q11.2 DS.",

    "abstract": "Tumor segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is a critical step in providing objective measures of predicting aggressiveness and response to therapy in gliomas. It has valuable applications in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment planning of brain tumors. The purpose of this work was to develop a fully automated deep learning method for brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction. Well curated brain tumor cases with multi-parametric MR Images from the BraTS2019 dataset were used. A three-group framework was implemented, with each group consisting of three 3D-Dense-UNets to segment whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhancing tumor (ET). This method was implemented to decompose the complex multi-class segmentation problem into individual binary segmentation problems for each sub-component. Each group was trained using different approaches and loss functions. The output segmentations of a particular label from their respective networks from the 3 groups were ensembled and post-processed. For survival analysis, a linear regression model based on imaging texture features and wavelet texture features extracted from each of the segmented components was implemented. The networks were tested on the BraTS2019 validation dataset including 125 cases for the brain tumor segmentation task and 29 cases for the survival prediction task. The segmentation networks achieved average dice scores of 0.901, 0.844 and 0.801 for WT, TC and ET respectively. The survival prediction network achieved an accuracy score of 0.55 and mean squared error (MSE) of 119244. This method could be implemented as a robust tool to assist clinicians in primary brain tumor management and follow-up.",

    "abstract": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular homeostatic circuit regulating protein synthesis and processing in the ER by three ER-to-nucleus signaling pathways. One pathway is triggered by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), which splices the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, thereby enabling expression of XBP1s. Another UPR pathway activates the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Here we show that murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a prototypic {beta}-herpesvirus, harnesses the UPR to regulate its own life cycle. MCMV activates the IRE1-XBP1 pathway early post infection to relieve repression by XBP1u, the product of the unspliced XBP1 mRNA. XBP1u inhibits viral gene expression and replication by blocking the activation of the viral major immediate-early promoter by XBP1s and ATF6. These findings reveal a redundant function of XBP1s and ATF6 as activators of the viral life cycle, and an unexpected role of XBP1u as a potent repressor of both XBP1s and ATF6-mediated activation.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary transition between winglessness and a full-winged morphology requires selective advantage for intermediate forms. Conversely, repeated secondary wing reductions among the pterygotes indicates relaxation of such selection. However, evolutionary trajectories of such transitions are not well characterized. The stick insects (Phasmatodea) exhibit diverse wing sizes at both interspecific and intersexual levels, and thus provide a system for examining how selection on flight capability, along with other selective forces, drives the evolution of flight-related morphology. Here, we examine variation in relevant morphology for stick insects using data from 1100+ individuals representing 765 species. Although wing size varies along a continuous spectrum, taxa with either long or miniaturized wings are the most common, whereas those with intermediate-sized wings are relatively rare. In a morphological space defined by wing and body size, the aerodynamically relevant parameter termed wing loading (the average pressure exerted on the air by the wings) varies according to sex-specific scaling laws; volant but also flightless forms are the most common outcomes in both sexes. Using phylogenetically-informed analyses, we show that relative wing size and body size are inversely correlated in long-winged insects regardless of sexual differences in morphology and ecology. These results demonstrate the diversity of flight-related morphology in stick insects, and also provide a general framework for addressing evolutionary coupling between wing and body dimensions. We also find indirect evidence for a  fitness valley associated with intermediate-sized wings, suggesting relatively rapid evolutionary transitions between wingless and volant forms.",

    "abstract": "Difficulties with sociability include a tendency to avoid social contacts and activities, and to prefer being alone rather than being with others. While sociability is a continuously distributed trait in the population, decreased sociability represent a common early manifestation of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders such as Schizophrenia (SCZ), Bipolar Disorder (BP), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), and Alzheimers disease (AD). We aimed to investigate the genetic underpinnings of sociability as a continuous trait in the general population. In this respect, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a sociability score based on 4 social functioning-related self-report questions in the UK Biobank sample (n=342,461) to test the effect of individual genetic variants. This was followed by LD score analyses to investigate the genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders (SCZ, BP, MDD, ASDs) and a neurological disorder (AD) as well as related phenotypes (Loneliness and Social Anxiety). The phenotypic data indeed showed that the sociability score was decreased in individuals with ASD, (probable) MDD, BP and SCZ, but not in individuals with AD. Our GWAS showed 604 genome-wide significant SNPs, coming from 18 independent loci (SNP-based h2=0.06). Genetic correlation analyses showed significant correlations with SCZ (rg=0.15, p=9.8e-23), MDD (rg=0.68, p=6.6e-248) and ASDs (rg=0.27, p=4.5e-28), but no correlation with BP (rg=0.01, p=0.45) or AD (rg=0.04, p=0.55). Our sociability trait was also genetically correlated with Loneliness (rg=0.45, p=2.4e-8) and Social Anxiety (rg=0.48, p=0.002). Our study shows that there is a significant genetic component to variation in population levels of sociability, which is relevant to some psychiatric disorders (SCZ, MDD, ASDs), but not to BP and AD.",

    "abstract": "Posttranslational modification (PTM) of core circadian clock proteins, including Period2 (PER2), is required for proper circadian regulation. PER2 function is regulated by casein kinase 1 (CK1)-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination but little is known about other PER2 PTMs or their interaction with PER2 phosphorylation. We found that PER2 can be SUMOylated by both SUMO1 and SUMO2; however, SUMO1 versus SUMO2 conjugation had different effects on PER2 turnover and transcriptional suppressor function. SUMO2 conjugation facilitated PER2-{beta}-TrCP interaction leading to PER2 proteasomal degradation. In contrast, SUMO1 conjugation, mediated by E3 SUMO-protein ligase RanBP2, enhanced CK1-mediated PER2S662 phosphorylation and increased PER2 transcriptional suppressor function. PER2 K736 was critical for both SUMO1- and SUMO2-conjugation. A PER2K736R mutation was sufficient to alter circadian periodicity and reduce PER2-mediated transcriptional suppression. Together, our data revealed SUMO1 versus SUMO2 conjugation acts as an upstream determinant of PER2 phosphorylation and thereby affects the circadian regulatory system and circadian periodicity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic regulatory code that governs gene expression is a primary, yet challenging aspiration in molecular biology that opens up possibilities to cure human diseases and solve biotechnology problems. However, the fundamental question of how each of the individual coding and non-coding regions of the gene regulatory structure interact and contribute to the mRNA expression levels remains unanswered. Considering that all the information for gene expression regulation is already present in living cells, here we applied deep learning on over 20,000 mRNA datasets in 7 model organisms ranging from bacteria to Human. We show that in all organisms, mRNA abundance can be predicted directly from the DNA sequence with high accuracy, demonstrating that up to 82% of the variation of gene expression levels is encoded in the gene regulatory structure. Coding and non-coding regions carry both overlapping and orthogonal information and additively contribute to gene expression levels. By searching for DNA regulatory motifs present across the whole gene regulatory structure, we discover that motif interactions can regulate gene expression levels in a range of over three orders of magnitude. The uncovered co-evolution of coding and non-coding regions challenges the current paradigm that single motifs or regions are solely responsible for gene expression levels. Instead, we show that the correct combination of all regulatory regions must be established in order to accurately control gene expression levels. Therefore, the holistic system that spans the entire gene regulatory structure is required to analyse, understand, and design any future gene expression systems.",

    "abstract": "Parasitoid wasps rely primarily on venom to suppress the immune response and regulate the physiology of their host. Intraspecific variability of venom protein composition has been documented in some species, but its evolutionary potential is poorly understood. We performed an experimental evolution initiated with crosses of two lines of Leptopilina boulardi of different venom composition to generate variability and create new combinations of venom factors. The offspring were maintained for 10 generations on two strains of Drosophila melanogaster differing in resistance / susceptibility to the parasitoid lines. The venom composition of individuals was characterized by a semi-automatic analysis of 1D SDS-PAGE protein profiles whose accuracy was checked by Western blot analysis of well-characterized venom proteins. Results evidenced a rapid and differential evolution of the venom composition on both hosts and showed that the proteins beneficial on one host can be costly on the other. Overall, we demonstrated the capacity of rapid evolution of the venom composition in parasitoid wasps, important regulators of arthropod populations, suggesting a potential for adaptation to new hosts. Our approach also proved relevant in identifying, among the diversity of venom proteins, those possibly involved in parasitism success and whose role deserves to be deepened.\\n\\nKey ContributionThe venom protein composition of parasitoid wasps can evolve rapidly and differently depending on the host strain. Studying this evolution can help identify new venom proteins possibly involved in parasitism success on a given host.",

However, the significance of this high ATP level under physiological conditions and the mechanisms that maintain ATP remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and adenylate kinase (ADK) cooperated to maintain cellular ATP levels regardless of glucose levels. Single cell imaging of ATP-reduced yeast mutants revealed that ATP levels in these mutants repeatedly underwent stochastic and transient depletion, which induced the cytotoxic aggregation of endogenous proteins and pathogenic proteins, such as huntingtin and -synuclein. Moreover, pharmacological elevations in ATP levels in an ATP-reduced mutant prevented the accumulation of -synuclein aggregates and its cytotoxicity. The removal of cytotoxic aggregates depended on proteasomes, and proteasomal activity cooperated with AMPK or ADK to resist proteotoxic stresses. The present study is the first to demonstrate that cellular ATP homeostasis ensures proteostasis and revealed that suppressing the high volatility of cellular ATP levels prevented cytotoxic protein aggregation, implying that AMPK and ADK are important factors that prevent proteinopathies, such as neurodegenerative diseases.",

PROMPTs are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Similarly, active enhancer regions in animals initiate transcription of exosome-sensitive enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Previous studies based on nascent RNA approaches concluded that Arabidopsis thaliana does not produce PROMPTs. Here, we used steady-state RNA sequencing methods in mutants defective in nuclear RNA decay, including by the exosome, to reassess the existence of PROMPTs and eRNAs in A. thaliana. While PROMPTs are overall rare in A. thaliana, about 100 clear cases of exosome-sensitive PROMPTs and 113 loci producing eRNA-like transcripts were identified. In addition, we found [~]200 transcription start sites within 3-UTR-encoding regions that produce unspliced exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs covering much of the cognate pre-mRNA. A typical representative of this class of RNAs is the previously characterized non-coding RNA controlling the expression of the key seed dormancy regulator, DELAY OF GERMINATION1. Exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs are overrepresented in transcription factor genes, suggesting a potential for widespread control of gene expression. Lastly, we assess the use of alternative promoters in A. thaliana and compare the accuracy of existing TSS annotations.",

    "abstract": "Concerted evolution of the ribosomal DNA array has been studied in numerous eukaryotic taxa, yet is still poorly understood. rDNA genes are repeated dozens to hundreds of times in the eukaryotic genome [1] and it is believed that these arrays are homogenized through concerted evolution [2, 3] preventing the accumulation of intragenomic, and intraspecific, variation. However, numerous studies have reported rampant intragenomic and intraspecific variation in the rDNA array [4-10], contradicting our current understanding of concerted evolution. The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the rDNA cistron are the most commonly used DNA barcoding region in Fungi [11], and rely on concerted evolution to homogenize the rDNA array leading to a \\\"barcode gap\\\" [12]. Here we show that in Boletus edulis Bull., ITS intragenomic variation persists at low allele frequencies throughout the rDNA array, this variation does not correlate with genomic relatedness between populations, and rDNA genes may not evolve in a strictly concerted fashion despite the presence of unequal recombination and gene conversion. Under normal assumptions, heterozygous positions found in ITS sequences represent hybridization between populations, yet through allelic mapping of the rDNA array we found numerous heterozygous alleles to be stochastically introgressed throughout, presenting a dishonest signal of gene flow. Moreover, despite the signal of gene flow in ITS, our organisms were highly inbred, indicating a disconnect between true gene flow and barcoding signals. In addition, we show that while the mechanisms of concerted evolution are ongoing in pseudo-heterozygous individuals, they are not fully homogenizing the ITS array. Concerted evolution of the rDNA array may insufficiently homogenize the ITS gene, allowing for misleading signals of gene flow to persist, vastly complicating the use of the ITS locus for DNA barcoding in Fungi.",

The advantages of such stochastic properties have been proposed in several works, but the relationship and synergy between the stochasticities of neurons and synapses remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that these stochastic features can be inseparably integrated into a simple framework that provides a practical and biologically plausible learning algorithm that consistently accounts for various experimental results, including the most efficient power-law coding of the cortex. The derived algorithm overcomes many of the limitations of conventional learning algorithms of neural networks. As an experimentally testable prediction, we derived the slow retrograde modulation of the excitability of neurons from this algorithm. Because of the simplicity and flexibility of this algorithm, we anticipate that it will be useful in the development of neuromorphic devices and scalable AI chips, and that it will help bridge the gap between neuroscience and machine learning.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDChromatin organization is central to precise control of gene expression. In various eukaryotic spieces, domains of pervasive cis-chromatin interactions demarcate functional domains of the genomes. In nematode C. elegans, however, pervasive chromatin contact domains are limited to the dosage-compensated sex chromosome, leaving the principle of C. elegans chromatin organization unclear. Transcription Factor III C (TFIIIC) is a basal transcription factor complex for RNA Polymerase III, and is implicated in chromatin organization. TFIIIC binding without RNA Polymerase III co-occupancy, referred to as extra-TFIIIC binding, has been implicated in insulating active and inactive chromatin domains in yeasts, flies, and mammalian cells. Whether extra-TFIIIC sites are present and contribute to chromatin organization in C. elegans remains unknown.\n\nRESULTSWe identified 504 TFIIIC-bound sites absent of RNA Polymerase III and TATA-binding protein co-occupancy characteristic of extra-TFIIIC sites in C. elegans embryos. Extra-TFIIIC sites constituted half of all identified TFIIIC binding sites in the genome. Extra-TFIIIC sites formed dense clusters in cis. The clusters of extra-TFIIIC sites were highly over-represented within the distal arm domains of the autosomes that presented a high level of heterochromatin-associated histone H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). Furthermore, extra-TFIIIC clusters were embedded in the lamina-associated domains. Despite the heterochromatin environment of extra-TFIIIC sites, the individual clusters of extra-TFIIIC sites were devoid of and resided near the individual H3K9me3-marked regions.\n\nCONCLUSIONClusters of extra-TFIIIC sites were pervasive in the arm domains of C. elegans autosomes, near the outer boundaries of H3K9me3-marked regions. Given the reported activity of extra-TFIIIC sites in heterochromatin insulation in yeasts, our observation raised the possibility that TFIIIC may also demarcate heterochromatin in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "The traditional brain mapping approach has greatly advanced our understanding of the localized effect of the brain on behavior. However, the statistically significant brain regions identified by standard mass univariate models only explain minimal variance in behavior despite increased sample sizes and statistical power. This is potentially due to the generalizable explanatory signal in the brain being non-sparse, therefore not captured by the thresholded, localized model. Here we introduced the Bayesian polyvertex score (PVS-B), a whole-brain prediction framework that aggregates the effect sizes across all vertices to predict individual variability in behavior. The PVS-B estimates the posterior mean effect size at each vertex with mass univariate summary statistics and the correlation structure of the imaging phenotype, and weights the imaging phenotype of participants from an independent sample with these posterior mean effect sizes to estimate the generalizable effect of a brain-behavior association. Empirical data showed that the PVS-B was able to double the variance explained in general cognitive ability by an n-back fMRI contrast when compared to prediction models based on the mass univariate parameter estimates as well as models in which only vertices thresholded based on p-value were included. A fivefold improvement in variance explained by the PVS-B was observed using a stop signal task fMRI contrast to predict individual variability in the stop signal reaction time. We believe that the PVS-B can shed light on the multivariate investigation of brain-behavioral associations and will empower small scale neuroimaging studies with more reliable and accurate effect size estimates.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains a significant infectious lung disease that affects millions of patients worldwide. Despite numerous existing drug regimens for tuberculosis, Drug-Induced Liver Injury is a major challenge that limits the effectiveness of these therapeutics. Two drugs that form the backbone of the commonly administered quadruple antitubercular regimen, i.e. pyrazinamide (PZA) and isoniazid (INH), are associated with such hepatotoxicity. The problem is compounded by the lack of safe and effective alternatives to the antitubercular regimen. Consequently, current research largely focuses on exploiting the hepatoprotective effect of nutraceutical compounds as complementary therapy. Silibinin, a herbal product widely believed to protect against various liver diseases, potentially provides a useful solution given its hepatoprotective mechanisms. In our study, we identified silibinins role in mitigating PZA- and INH-induced hepatotoxicity and elucidated a deeper mechanistic understanding of silibinins hepatoprotective ability. 25 M silibinin preserved the viability of human foetal hepatocyte line LO2 when co-administered with 80 mM INH and decreased apoptosis induced by a combination of 40 mM INH and 10 mM PZA by reducing oxidative damage to mitochondria, proteins, and lipids. Taken together, this proof-of-concept forms the rational basis for the further investigation of silibinins hepatoprotective effect in subsequent preclinical studies and clinical trials.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/815241v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7dde5borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1914a77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aff684org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1616fa5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) is a pandemic clone that is evolving rapidly with increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance. Here, we investigated an outbreak of E. coli ST131 producing extended spectrum {beta}-lactamases (ESBLs) in a long-term care facility (LTCF) in Ireland by combining data from this LTCF (n=69) with other Irish (n=35) and global (n=690) ST131 genomes to reconstruct the evolutionary history and understand changes in population structure and genome architecture over time. This required a combination of short and long-read genome sequencing, de novo assembly, read mapping, ESBL gene screening, plasmid alignment and temporal phylogenetics. We found that clade C was the most prevalent (686 out of 794 isolates, 86%) of the three major ST131 clades circulating worldwide (A, B, C), and was associated with the presence of different ESBL alleles, diverse plasmids and transposable elements. Clade C was estimated to have emerged in [~]1985 and subsequently acquired different ESBL gene variants (blaCTX-M-14 vs blaCTX-M-15). An ISEcp1- mediated transposition of the blaCTX-M-15 gene further increased the diversity within Clade C. We discovered a local clonal expansion of a rare C2 lineage (C2_8) with a chromosomal insertion of blaCTX-M-15 at the mppA gene. This was acquired from an IncFIA plasmid. The C2_8 lineage clonally expanded in the Irish LTCF from 2006, displacing the existing C1 strain (C1_10) and highlighting the potential for novel ESBL-producing ST131 with a distinct genetic profile to cause outbreaks strongly associated with specific healthcare environments.\\n\\nImportanceExtraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) ST131 is adapting in the context of antibiotic exposure, resulting in a pandemic with distinct genetic subtypes. Here, we track the evolution of antibiotic-resistance gene variants originally discovered in an ExPEC ST131 outbreak that was identified in a LTCF in Ireland. Analysis of 794 global ST131 genomes show that subclade C1 was associated with the initial infection outbreak, but that a new lineage from subclade C2 successfully displaced C1. This genetically distinct C2 subclade with a chromosomal insertion of a key antibiotic-resistance gene had clonally expanded within the LTCF. We provide new insights into the timing of genetic events driving the diversification of C2 subclades to show that that outbreak C2 strain likely evolved elsewhere before spreading to the LTCF. This study highlights the scope of antibiotic-resistance gene rearrangement within ST131, reinforcing the need to integrate genomic, epidemiological and microbiological approaches to understand ST131 transmission.",

    "abstract": "C-Glucosides are resistant to glycoside hydrolase activity because the anomeric carbon of glucose is directly connected to aglycone via carbon-carbon bonding. A human intestinal bacterium strain PUE related to Dorea species can metabolize the isoflavone C-glucoside puerarin (daidzein 8-C-glucoside) to daidzein and glucose by more than three bacterial enzymes which have not been well-characterized. We previously reported that 3\\\"-oxo-puerarin is an essential reaction intermediate in enzymatic puerarin degradation and characterized a bacterial enzyme of DgpB-C complex which cleaved the C-glycosidic bond in 3\\\"-oxo-puerarin. However, the exact enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of C-3\\\" hydroxyl in puerarin has not been identified, and the other metabolite corresponding to the precursor of D-glucose, derived from the sugar moiety in 3\\\"-oxo-puerarin in the cleaving reaction catalyzed by the DgpB-C complex, remains unknown.\\n\\nIn this study, we demonstrated that recombinant DgpA, a Gfo/Idh/MocA family oxidoreductase, catalyzed puerarin oxidation in the presence of 3-oxo-glucose as the hydride accepter. In addition, enzymatic C-deglycosylation of puerarin was achieved by a combination of recombinant DgpA, DgpB-C complex, and 3-oxo-glucose. Furthermore, the metabolite derived from the sugar moiety in 3\\\"-oxo-puerarin cleaving reaction catalyzed by DgpB-C complex was characterized as 1,5-anhydro-D-erythro -hex-1-en-3-ulose, suggesting that the C-glycosidic linkage is cleaved through a {beta}-elimination like mechanism.\\n\\nImportanceOne important role of the gut microbiota is to metabolize dietary nutrients and supplements such as flavonoid glycosides. Ingested glycosides are metabolized by intestinal bacteria to more absorbable aglycones and further degradation products which show beneficial effects in humans. Although numerous glycoside hydrolases that catalyze O-deglycosylation have been reported, enzymes responsible for C-deglycosylation are still limited. In this study, we characterized enzymes involved in C-deglycosylation of puerarin from a human intestinal bacterium PUE. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the expression, purification and characterization of an oxidoreductase involved in C-glucoside degradation. This study provides new insights for the elucidation of mechanisms of enzymatic C-deglycosylation.",

These are the only known kinetochore linker proteins across eukaryotes. Linker proteins are structurally less conserved than their outer kinetochore counterparts. Here, we demonstrate the recurrent loss of most inner kinetochore CCAN, including certain linker proteins during evolution in the fungal phylum of Basidiomycota. By studying the kinetochore interactome, a previously undescribed linker protein, bridgin was identified in the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, a human fungal pathogen. In vivo and in vitro functional analyses of bridgin reveal that it binds to the outer kinetochore and centromere chromatin simultaneously to ensure accurate kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Unlike known linker proteins, bridgin is recruited by the outer kinetochore. Homologs of bridgin were identified outside fungi. These results showcase a divergent strategy, with a more ancient origin than fungi, to link the outer kinetochore to centromeric chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Topoisomerase II (Topo II), a well-conserved double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-specific decatenase, processes dsDNA catenanes resulting from DNA replication during mitosis. Topo II defects lead to an accumulation of ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs), a type of chromosome non-disjunction. Topo II has been reported to resolve DNA anaphase threads, possibly accounting for the increase in UFB frequency upon Topo II inhibition. We hypothesized that the excess UFBs might also result, at least in part, from an impairment of the prevention of UFB formation by Topo II. We found that Topo II inhibition promotes UFB formation without affecting UFB resolution during anaphase. Moreover, we showed that Topo II inhibition promotes the formation of two types of UFBs depending on cell-cycle phase. Topo II inhibition during S-phase compromises complete DNA replication, leading to the formation of UFB-containing unreplicated DNA, whereas Topo II inhibition during mitosis impedes DNA decatenation at metaphase-anaphase transition, leading to the formation of UFB-containing DNA catenanes. Thus, Topo II activity is essential to prevent UFB formation in a cell-cycle dependent manner, but dispensable for UFB resolution during anaphase.",

    "abstract": "The Antarctic green alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241 (UWO241) was isolated from the deep photic zone of a permanently Antarctic ice-covered lake. Adaptation to permanent low temperatures, hypersalinity, and extreme shade has resulted in survival strategies in this halotolerant psychrophile. One of the most striking phenotypes of UWO241 is an altered photosystem I (PSI) organization and constitutive PSI cyclic electron flow (CEF). To date, little attention has been paid to CEF during long-term stress acclimation and the consequences of sustained CEF in UWO241 are not known. In this study, we combined photobiology, proteomics, and metabolomics to understand the underlying role of sustained CEF in high salinity stress acclimation. High salt-grown UWO241 exhibited increased thylakoid proton motive flux and an increased capacity for NPQ. A Bestrophin-like Cl- channel was identified in the whole cell proteomes and transcriptome of UWO241 which likely supports ion homeostasis during high transthylakoid pH. Under high salt, a significant proportion of the upregulated enzymes were associated with the Calvin Benson Bassham Cycle (CBB), secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and protein translation. Two key enzymes of the Shikimate pathway, DAHP synthase and chorismate synthase, were also upregulated, as well as indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of L-tryptophan and indole acetic acid. In addition, several compatible solutes (glycerol, proline and sucrose) accumulated to high levels in high salt-grown UWO241 cultures. We suggest that UWO241 maintains constitutively high CEF with associated PSI-cytb6f supercomplex to support robust growth and strong photosynthetic capacity under a constant growth regime of low temperatures and high salinity.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. With almost 50% of traumatic brain injuries being related to axonal damage, understanding the nature of cellular level impairment is crucial. Experimental observations have so far led to the formulation of conflicting theories regarding the cellular primary injury mechanism. Disruption of the axolemma, or alternatively cytoskeletal damage has been suggested mainly as injury trigger. However, mechanoporation thresholds of generic membranes seem not to overlap with the axonal injury deformation range and microtubules appear too stiff and too weakly connected to undergo mechanical breaking. Here, we aim to shed a light on the mechanism of primary axonal injury, bridging finite element and molecular dynamics simulations. Despite the necessary level of approximation, our models can accurately describe the mechanical behavior of the unmyelinated axon and its membrane. More importantly, they give access to quantities that would be inaccessible with an experimental approach. We show that in a typical injury scenario, the axonal cortex sustains deformations large enough to entail pore formation in the adjoining lipid bilayer. The observed axonal deformation of 10-12% agree well with the thresholds proposed in the literature for axonal injury and, above all, allow us to provide quantitative evidences that do not exclude pore formation in the membrane as a result of trauma. Our findings bring to an increased knowledge of axonal injury mechanism that will have positive implications for the prevention and treatment of brain injuries.",

Here, we show that PTC-3 is a cholesterol transporter. ptc-3(RNAi) leads to accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and defects in ER structure and lipid droplet formation. These phenotypes were accompanied by a reduction in acyl chain (FA) length and desaturation. ptc-3(RNAi)-induced lethality, fat storage and ER morphology defects were rescued by reducing dietary cholesterol. We provide evidence that cholesterol accumulation modulates the function of nuclear hormone receptors such as of the PPAR homolog NHR-49 and NHR-181, and affects FA composition.

    "abstract": "Signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is a histological subtype of gastric cancer that has distinct features in cellular morphology, epidemiology and clinicopathology compared with adenocarcinomas (ACs). Lacking of systematically molecular overview to this disease made a slow progress in diagnosis and therapy for SRCC. In the present proteomics study, the gastric tissues were collected from tumor and adjacent regions including 14 SRCC and 34 AC cases, and laser capture microdissection (LCM) was employed to eradicate cellular heterogeneity of the tissues. Over 6,000 proteins were quantified through data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS). The quantitative profiles of proteomes in tumor tissues, either AC or SRCC, were dramatically different from that in the corresponding adjacencies, whereas the SRCC proteomes appeared not distinguishable to the AC proteomes via hierarchical clustering. However, focusing on univariate analysis and pathway enrichment unrevealed that some proteins and pathways bared the differences between SRCC and ACs. Importantly, the abundance changes for a bulk of proteins involved in complement cascade were highly associated with SRCC but not so sensitive to the AC status. A hypothesis, therefore, was proposed that the complement cascade was evoked in the SRCC microenvironment upon infiltration, while the SRCC cells survived from the complement cytotoxicity by secreting negative regulators. Moreover, an attempt was made to seek appropriate cell model for gastric SRCC, through proteomic comparison of the 15 gastric cell lines and the gastric tumors. The prediction upon supervised classifier suggested none of these gastric cell lines qualified in mimic to SRCC.",

Studies quantifying the association between brain structure and cognition do not always assess regional cortical morphology relative to global brain measures and typically rely on mass univariate statistics or ROI-based analyses. After controlling for global brain measures, it is possible to detect a residual regionalisation pattern indicating the size or thickness of different regions relative to the total cortical surface area or mean thickness. Individual variability in regionalisation may be important for understanding and predicting between subject variability in cognitive performance. Here we sought to determine whether the relative configuration of cortical architecture across the whole cortex was associated with cognition using a novel multivariate omnibus statistical test (MOSTest) in 10,145 children aged 9-10 years from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. MOSTest is better powered to detect associations that are widely distributed across the cortex compared to methods that assume sparse associations. We then quantified the magnitude of the association between vertex-wise cortical morphology and cognitive performance using a linear weighted sum across vertices, based on the estimated vertex-wise effect sizes. We show that the relative pattern of cortical architecture, after removing the effects of global brain measures, predicted unique variance associated with cognition across different imaging modalities and cognitive domains.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis paper demonstrates a significant advance in our understanding of the relationship between cortical morphology and individual variability in cognition. There is increasing evidence that brain-behaviour associations are distributed across the cortex. Using the unprecedented sample from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and a novel application of a multivariate statistical approach (MOSTest), we have discovered specific distributed regionalization patterns across the cortex associated with cognition across multiple cognitive domains. This furthers our understanding of the relationship between brain structure and cognition, namely that these associations are not sparse and localized as assumed with traditional neuroimaging analyses. This multivariate method is extremely versatile and can be used in several different applications.",

    "abstract": "A growing literature supports the existence of interactions between emotion and action in the brain, and the central participation of the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) in this regard. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we sought to investigate the role of self-relevance during such interactions by varying the context in which threating pictures were presented (with guns pointed towards or away from the observer). Participants performed a simple visual detection task following exposure to such stimuli. Except for voxelwise tests, we adopted a Bayesian analysis framework which evaluated evidence for the hypotheses of interest, given the data, in a continuous fashion. Behaviorally, our results demonstrated a valence by context interaction such that there was a tendency of speeding up responses to targets after viewing threat pictures directed towards the participant. In the brain, interaction patterns that paralleled those observed behaviorally were observed most notably in the middle temporal gyrus, supplementary motor area, precentral gyrus, and anterior insula. In these regions, activity was overall greater during threat conditions relative to neutral ones, and this effect was enhanced in the directed towards context. A valence by context interaction was observed in the aMCC too, where we also observed a correlation (across participants) of evoked responses and reaction time data. Taken together, our study revealed the context-sensitive engagement of motor-related areas during emotional perception, thus supporting the idea that emotion and action interact in important ways in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a catastrophic epilepsy of childhood, characterized by cognitive impairment, severe seizures and increased risk for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs, emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that modulation of the endocanniboid system could be therapeutic in these patients. Here we used a validated zebrafish model of DS, scn1lab homozygous mutants, to screen a commercially available library containing 370 synthetic cannabinoid (SC) compounds for compounds effective in reducing spontaneous seizures. Primary phenotype-based screening was performed using a locomotion-based assay in 96-well plates, and a secondary local field potential recording assay was then used to confirm suppression of electrographic epileptiform events. Identified SCs with anti-seizure activity, in both assays, included five SCs structurally classified as indole-based cannabinoids: JWH 018 N-(5-chloropentyl) analog, JWH 018 N-(2-methylbutyl) isomer, 5-fluoro PB-22 5-hydroxyisoquinoline isomer, 5-fluoro ADBICA, and AB-FUBINACA 3-fluorobenzyl isomer. Our approach demonstrates that two-stage phenotype-based screening in a zebrafish model of DS successfully identifies synthetic cannabinoids with anti-seizure activity, and supports further investigation of SCs for refractory epilepsies.",

Speech-in-noise perception varies widely--and people who are worse at speech-in-noise perception are also worse at fundamental auditory grouping, as assessed by figure-ground tasks. Here, we examined the cortical processes that link difficulties with speech-in-noise perception to difficulties with figure-ground perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found strong evidence that the earliest stages of the auditory cortical hierarchy (left core and belt areas) are similarly disinhibited when speech-in-noise and figure-ground tasks are more difficult (i.e., at target-to-masker ratios corresponding to 60% than 90% thresholds)--consistent with increased cortical gain at lower levels of the auditory hierarchy. Overall, our results reveal a common neural substrate for these basic (figure-ground) and naturally relevant (speech-in-noise) tasks--which provides a common computational basis for the link between speech-in-noise perception and fundamental auditory grouping.",

Furthermore, they are also highly expert-dependent and rely on the assumption that study participants can express their preferences consciously and explicitly. Here we suggested an EEG-based approach to evaluate perceived product similarity in a cross-modal taste-visual task. Two candidate neurometrics measured from Fz electrode were tested: the amplitude of N430-620 from evoked response potentials (ERP) and the power of induced gamma oscillations during 400-600 ms period after visual stimulus presentation. Both suggested metrics showed a strong correlation with the perceived similarity scores at both individual and group levels, however N430-630 had greater inter-subject variability making it less suitable for practical applications. The results based on the power of induced gamma oscillations (N=18) not only reflected the results from traditional hall-tests (N=200) but also allowed better discrimination between different food products.",

    "abstract": "Local translation regulates the formation of appropriate connectivity in the developing nervous system. However, the localization and molecular mechanisms underlying this translation within growth cones is not well understood. Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a multi-functional ribosomal scaffolding protein that interacts with {beta}-actin mRNA. We recently showed that RACK1 localizes to and regulates the formation of point contacts, which are adhesion sites that control growth cone motility. This suggests that local translation occurs at these adhesion sites that are important for axonal pathfinding, but this has not been investigated. Here, we show that RACK1 is required for BDNF-induced local translation of {beta}-actin mRNA in growth cones. Furthermore, the ribosomal binding function of RACK1 regulates point contact formation, and axon growth and guidance. We also find that local translation of {beta}-actin occurs at point contacts. Taken together, we show that adhesions are a targeted site of local translation within growth cones, and RACK1 is critical to the formation of point contacts and appropriate neural development. These data provide further insight into how and where local translation is regulated, and thereby leads to appropriate connectivity formation in the developing nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Head motion remains a challenging confound in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of both children and adults. Most pediatric neuroimaging labs have developed experience-based, child-friendly standards concerning e.g. the maximum length of a session or the time between mock scanner training and actual scanning. However, it is unclear which factors of child-friendly neuroimaging approaches are effective in reducing head motion. Here, we investigate three main factors including (i) time lag of mock scanner training to the actual scan, (ii) prior scan time, and (iii) task engagement in a dataset of 77 children (aged 6-13) and 64 adults (aged 18-35) using a multilevel modeling approach. In children, distributing fMRI data acquisition across multiple same-day sessions reduces head motion. In adults, motion is reduced after inside-scanner breaks. Despite these positive effects of splitting up data acquisition, motion increases over the course of a study as well as over the course of a run in both children and adults. Our results suggest that splitting up fMRI data acquisition is an effective tool to reduce head motion in general. At the same time, different ways of splitting up data acquisition benefit children and adults.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIn children, fMRI data acquisition split into multiple sessions reduces head motion\nC_LIO_LIIn adults, fMRI data acquisition split by inside-scanner breaks reduces head motion\nC_LIO_LIIn both children and adults, motion increases over the duration of a study\nC_LIO_LIIn both children and adults, motion increases over the duration of a run\nC_LI",

While designing the protocol, most researchers refer to electronic databases and extract protocol elements using a keyword search. However, state-of-the-art retrieval systems only offer text-based searches for user-entered keywords. In this study, we present an interactive retrieval system with a context-dependent and protocol-element-selection function for successfully designing a clinical trial protocol. To do this, we first introduce a database for a protocol retrieval system constructed from individual protocol data extracted from 184,634 clinical trials and 13,210 frame structures of clinical trial protocols. The database contains various semantic information that enables the protocols to be filtered during the search operation. Based on the database, we developed a web application called the clinical trial protocol database system (CLIPS; available at https://corus.kaist.edu/clips), which enables an interactive search by utilizing protocol elements. CLIPS provides the options to select the next element according to the previous element in the form of a connected tree, thus enabling an interactive search for combinations of protocol elements. The validation results show that our method achieves better performance than existing databases in predicting phenotypic features.",

Here, we use helminth parasites to high-light how little is known about parasite diversity, and how insufficient our current approach will be to describe the full scope of life on Earth. Using the largest database of host-parasite associations and one of the worlds largest parasite collections, we estimate a global total of roughly 100,000 to 350,000 species of helminth endoparasites of vertebrates, of which 85% to 95% are unknown to science. The parasites of amphibians and reptiles remain the most poorly described, but the majority of undescribed species are likely parasites of birds and bony fish. Missing species are disproportionately likely to be smaller parasites of smaller hosts in undersampled countries. At current rates, it would take centuries to comprehensively sample, collect, and name vertebrate helminths. While some have suggested that macroecology can work around existing data limitations, we argue that patterns described from a small, biased sample of diversity arent necessarily reliable, especially as host-parasite networks are increasingly altered by global change. In the spirit of moon-shots like the Human Genome Project and the Global Virome Project, we consider the idea of a Global Parasite Project: a global effort to transform parasitology and inventory parasite diversity at an unprecedented pace.",

Using a discovery, replication and meta-analysis study design, methylation differences were identified using epigenome-wide association analysis and differentially methylated region (DMR) approaches. Results were explored using pathway and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses.\n\nRESULTSWe obtained replicated evidence for DNA methylation differences in a ~169kb region, which encompasses part of APOE and several upstream genes. Meta-analytic approaches identified DNA methylation differences outside of APOE: differentially methylated positions were identified in DHCR24, LDLR and ABCG1 (2.59 x 10-100[&le;]P[&le;]2.44 x 10-8) and DMRs were identified in SREBF2 and LDLR (1.63 x 10-4[&le;]P[&le;]3.01 x 10-2).

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the way microscopy images of cells are processed. Deep learning network architectures have a large number of parameters, thus, in order to reach high accuracy, they require massive amount of annotated data. A common way of improving accuracy builds on the artificial increase of the training set by using different augmentation techniques. A less common way relies on test-time augmentation (TTA) which yields transformed versions of the image for prediction and the results are merged. In this paper we describe incorporating the test-time argumentation prediction method into two major segmentation approaches used in the single-cell analysis of microscopy images, namely semantic segmentation using U-Net and instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN models. Our findings show that even using only simple test-time augmentations, such as rotation or flipping and proper merging methods, will result in significant improvement of prediction accuracy. We utilized images of tissue and cell cultures from the Data Science Bowl (DSB) 2018 nuclei segmentation competition and other sources. Additionally, boosting the highest-scoring method of the DSB with TTA, we could further improve and our method has reached an ever-best score at the DSB.",

    "abstract": "Camera traps and acoustic recording devices are essential tools to quantify the distribution, abundance and behavior of mobile species. Varying detection probabilities among device locations must be accounted for when analyzing such data, which is generally done using occupancy models. We introduce a Bayesian Time-dependent Observation Model for Camera Trap data (Tomcat), suited to estimate relative event densities in space and time. Tomcat allows to learn about the environmental requirements and daily activity patterns of species while accounting for imperfect detection. It further implements a sparse model that deals well will a large number of potentially highly correlated environmental variables. By integrating both spatial and temporal information, we extend the notation of overlap coefficient between species to time and space to study niche partitioning. We illustrate the power of Tomcat through an application to camera trap data of eight sympatrically occurring duiker Cephalophinae species in the savanna - rainforest ecotone in the Central African Republic and show that most species pairs show little overlap. Exceptions are those for which one species is very rare, likely as a result of direct competition.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) frequently suffer from spatial memory impairment and wandering behavior, but brain circuits causing such symptoms remain largely unclear. In healthy brains, spatially-tuned hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells represent distinct spike patterns in different environments, a circuit function called \"remapping\" that underlies pattern separation of spatial memory. We investigated whether knock-in expression of mutated amyloid precursor protein deteriorates the remapping of place cells and grid cells. We found that the remapping of CA1 place cells was disrupted although their spatial tuning was only mildly diminished. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) were impaired, sending severely disrupted remapping signals to the hippocampus. Furthermore, fast gamma oscillations were disrupted in both CA1 and MEC, resulting in impaired fast gamma coupling in the MEC[-&gt;]CA1 circuit. These results point to the link between grid cell impairment and remapping disruption as a circuit mechanism causing spatial memory impairment in AD.",

    "abstract": "The spatial-temporal relationship between cells, extracellular matrices and mineral deposits is fundamental for an improved understanding mineralization mechanisms in vertebrate tissues. By utilizing focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy with serial surface imaging, normally mineralizing avian tendons have been studied with nanometer resolution in three dimensions with volumes exceeding tens of microns in range. These parameters are necessary to yield fine ultrastructural details while encompassing tissue domains sufficient to provide a comprehensive overview of the interrelationships between the tissue structural constituents. Investigation reveals a novel complex cellular network in highly mineralized tendon aspects, where [~]100 nm diameter canaliculi emanating from cell (tenocyte) lacunae surround extracellular collagen fibril bundles. Canaliculi are linked to smaller channels of [~]40 nm diameter, occupying spaces between fibrils. Close to the tendon mineralization front, calcium-rich globules appear between the fibrils and, with time, mineral propagates along and within collagen. These close associations between tenocytes, canaliculi, small channels, collagen and mineral suggest a new concept for the mineralization process, where ions and/or mineral precursors may be transported through spaces between fibrils before they crystallize along the surface of and within the fibrils.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe basic mechanism by which vertebrate collagenous tissues are mineralized is still not fully elucidated, despite the importance of this process for skeletal formation and regeneration. Through three-dimensional imaging of the cellular network together with the extracellular matrix and mineral deposits, the present work investigates normally mineralizing avian leg tendon as a model system for vertebrates in general. The data support a mechanism where mineral ions and possible mineral precursors are initially present in interfibrillar collagen spaces and are subsequently translocated to neighboring collagen fibrils. Mineral particles then nucleate in association with collagen to form the well known collagen-mineral composite material of the skeleton.",

    "abstract": "The use of synthetic RNA for therapeutics requires that the in vitro synthesis process be robust and efficient. The technology used for the synthesis of these in vitro-transcribed mRNAs, predominantly using phage RNA polymerases (RNAPs), is well established. However, transcripts synthesized with RNAPs are known to display an immune-stimulatory activity in vivo, that is often undesirable. Previous studies have identified double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a major by-product of the in vitro transcription (IVT) process, as a trigger of cellular immune responses. Here we describe the characterization of a high-temperature IVT process using thermostable T7 RNAPs to synthesize functional mRNAs that demonstrate reduced immunogenicity without the need for a post-synthesis purification step. We identify features that drive the production of two kinds of dsRNA by-products--one arising from 3 extension of the run-off product and one formed by the production of antisense RNAs--and demonstrate that at a high temperature, T7 RNAP has reduced 3-self extension of the run-off product. We show that template-encoded poly-A tailing does not affect 3-self extension but reduces the formation of the antisense RNA by-products and that combining high-temperature IVT with template-encoded poly-A tailing prevents formation of both kinds of by-products.",

    "abstract": "Unwanted memories often enter conscious awareness when we confront reminders. People vary widely in their talents at suppressing such memory intrusions; however, the factors that govern suppression ability are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that successful memory control requires sleep. Following overnight sleep or total sleep deprivation, participants attempted to suppress intrusions of emotionally negative and neutral scenes when confronted with reminders. The sleep-deprived group experienced significantly more intrusions (unsuccessful suppressions) than the sleep group. Deficient control over intrusive thoughts had consequences: whereas in rested participants suppression reduced behavioural and psychophysiological indices of negative affect for aversive memories, it had no such salutary effect for sleep-deprived participants. Our findings raise the possibility that sleep deprivation disrupts prefrontal control over medial temporal lobe structures that support memory and emotion. These data point to an important role of sleep disturbance in maintaining and exacerbating psychiatric conditions characterised by persistent, unwanted thoughts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent, various human health disorders including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases are noticed among human populations. Currently, genetic and proteomic approaches are highly reported to detect metabolic disorders that also include inborn error of metabolisms. These existing detection methods are faced with cost issue and time consuming factors. Therefore, metabolites as biomarkers are one of potential avenues to detect metabolic disorders. Further, exploitation of urine as potential source of metabolite biomarkers, there are limitation in this area of research due to abundance of non-metabolite components such as proteins and nucleic acids. Hence, methods and processes are required to precisely fractionate metabolites from urine of inborn error of metabolism patients and then identified by analytical tools such as LC-HRMS and GC-MS.\\n\\nMethodsSterile filtered urine samples (750 {micro}l) mixed with (250 {micro}l) loading buffer were electrophoresed on VTGE that uses acrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:1) as matrix of 15%. Further, vertical tube gel electrophoresis (VTGE) technique combined with LC-HR-MS to identify metabolites that are known as the biomarkers of metabolic disorders was carried out.\\n\\nResults and DiscussionThe authors provide evidence on the use of novel VTGE coupled with LC-HRMS to detect metabolites among metabolic disorders. Data suggest the applicability of VTGE coupled with LC-HRMS technique to detect metabolites such as 2-methyluridine, 2-Methylglutaric acid, 2-Methyl citric acid, 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid in case of metabolic disorders.\\n\\nConclusionThis preliminary work is suggested to be extended to large clinical samples to validate application of this method to detect metabolic disorders including inborn error of metabolisms.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the most aggressive malignancy of the brain. Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 (AGTR1) upregulation has been associated with proliferative and infiltrative properties of glioma cells. However, the underlying mechanism of AGTR1 upregulation in GBM is still unexplored. To understand the post-transcriptional regulation of AGTR1 in GBM, we screened 3untranslated region (3UTR) of AGTR1 by using prediction algorithms for binding of miRNA. Interestingly, miR-155 showed conserved binding on the 3UTR of AGTR1, subsequently confirmed by AGTR1-3UTR-luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, stable miR-155 overexpressing GBM cells show decrease in AGTR1-mediated cell proliferation, invasion, foci formation and anchorage-independent growth. Strikingly, immunodeficient mice implanted with stable miR-155 overexpressing SNB19 cells show remarkable reduction ([~]95%) in tumor burden compared to control. Notably, miR-155 attenuates NF-{kappa}B signaling downstream of AGTR1 leading to reduced CXCR4 and AGTR1 levels. Mechanistically, miR-155 mitigates AGTR1-mediated, angiogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, stemness, ERK/MAPK signaling and promotes apoptosis. Similar effects in cell-based assays were observed by using pharmacological inhibitor of I{kappa}B Kinase (IKK) complex. Taken together, we established that miRNA-155 post-transcriptionally regulates AGTR1 expression, abrogates AGTR1/NF-{kappa}B/CXCR4 signaling axis and elicits pleiotropic anticancer effects. This study opens new avenues for using IKK inhibitors and miRNA-155 replacement therapies for the treatment of AGTR1-positive malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell transcriptomics is advancing discovery of the molecular determinants of cell identity, while spurring development of novel data analysis methods. Stochastic mathematical models of gene regulatory networks help unravel the dynamic, molecular mechanisms underlying cell-to-cell heterogeneity, and can thus aid interpretation of heterogeneous cell-states revealed by single-cell measurements. However, integrating stochastic gene network models with single cell data is challenging. Here, we present a method for analyzing single-cell gene-pair coexpression patterns, based on biophysical models of stochastic gene expression and interaction dynamics. We first developed a high-computational-throughput approach to stochastic modeling of gene-pair coexpression landscapes, based on numerical solution of gene network Master Equations. We then comprehensively catalogued coexpression patterns arising from tens of thousands of gene-gene interaction models with different biochemical kinetic parameters and regulatory interactions. From the computed landscapes, we obtain a low-dimensional \"shape-space\" describing distinct types of coexpression patterns. We applied the theoretical results to analysis of published single cell RNA sequencing data and uncovered complex dynamics of coexpression among gene pairs during embryonic development. Our approach provides a generalizable framework for inferring evolution of gene-gene interactions during critical cell-state transitions.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing interest in the mental life of individuals who cannot communicate verbally, objective and non-invasive tests of covert cognition are still sparse. In this study, we assessed the ability of neurotypical children to understand and follow task instructions by measuring neural responses through functional transcranial Doppler ultrasound (fTCD). We recorded blood flow velocity for the two brain hemispheres of twenty children (aged 9 to 12) while they performed either a language task or a visuospatial memory task, on identical visual stimuli. We extracted measures of neural lateralisation for the two tasks separately to investigate lateralisation, and we compared the left-minus-right pattern of activation across tasks to assess task-following. At the group level, we found that neural responses were left-lateralised when children performed the language task, and not when they performed the visuospatial task. However, with statistically robust analyses and controlled paradigms, significant lateralisation in individual children was less frequent than expected from the literature. Nonetheless, the pattern of hemispheric activation for the two tasks allowed us to confirm task-following in the group of participants, as well as in over half of the individuals. This provides a promising avenue for a covert and inexpensive test of children\u2019s ability to covertly follow task instructions and perform different mental tasks on identical stimuli.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

We used transcriptomics of paired whole bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to compare the effect of HIV at the lung mucosal surface and in the peripheral blood. The large majority of HIV-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were specific to either the peripheral or lung mucosa compartments (1,307/1,404, 93%). Type I interferon signaling was the dominant signature of DEGs in HIV-positive blood with a less dominant and qualitatively distinct type I interferon gene set expression pattern in HIV-positive BAL. DEGs in the HIV-positive BAL were significantly enriched for infiltration with cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Higher expression of representative transcripts and proteins in BAL CD8+ T cells during HIV infection, including IFNG (IFN-{gamma}), GZMB (Granzyme B) and PDCD1 (PD-1), was confirmed by cell-subset specific transcriptional analysis and flow cytometry. Thus, we report that a whole transcriptomic approach revealed qualitatively distinct effects of HIV in blood and bronchoalveolar compartments. Further work exploring the impact of distinct type I interferon programs and CD8+ T cells infiltration of the lung mucosa during HIV infection may provide novel insights into HIV-induced susceptibility to respiratory pathogens.",

    "abstract": "GMP synthetase catalyzes the substitution of the C2 oxo-group of the purine base in XMP with an amino-group generating GMP, the last step in the biosynthesis of GMP. This reaction involves a series of catalytic events that include hydrolysis of Gln generating ammonia in the glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) domain, activation of XMP to adenyl-XMP intermediate in the ATP pyrophosphatase (ATPPase) domain and reaction of ammonia with the intermediate to generate GMP. Inherent to the functioning of GMP synthetases is bidirectional domain crosstalk, which leads to allosteric activation of the GATase domain by substrates binding to the ATPPase domain, synchronization of the two catalytic events and tunnelling of ammonia from the GATase to the ATPPase domain. Herein, we have taken recourse to the analysis of structures of GMP synthetases, site-directed mutagenesis and, steady-state and transient kinetic assays on the Plasmodium falciparum enzyme to decipher the molecular basis of catalysis in the ATPPase domain and domain crosstalk. The results map the residues critical for catalysis in the ATPPase domain to the helices 11 and 12 that are located at the interdomain interface, and the lid-loop that follows 11. This apart, perturbing interdomain interactions involving residues on 11 and 12 impairs GATase activation. These results imply that this arrangement of helices at the domain interface with residues that play roles in ATPPase catalysis as well as domain crosstalk enables coupling ATPPase catalysis with GATase activation. Overall, the study enhances our understanding of GMP synthetases, which are drug targets in many infectious pathogens.",

    "abstract": "In order to ensure the long-term in vitro and in vivo functionality of cell-seeded 3D scaffolds, an effective and reliable method to control cell seeding efficiency and distribution is crucial. Static seeding on 3D additive manufactured scaffolds made of synthetic polymers still remains challenging, as it often results in poor cell attachment, high cell sedimentation and non-uniform cell distribution, due to gravity and to the intrinsic macroporosity and surface chemical properties of the scaffolds. In this study, the bio-inert macromolecules dextran and Ficoll were used for the first time as temporary supplements to alter the viscosity and density of the seeding media, respectively, and improve the static seeding output. The addition of these macromolecules drastically reduced the cell sedimentation velocities, allowing for homogeneous cell attachment to the scaffold filaments. Both dextran- and Ficoll-based seeding methods supported human mesenchymal stromal cells viability and osteogenic differentiation post-seeding. Interestingly, the improved cell distribution led to increased matrix production and mineralization compared to scaffolds seeded by conventional static method. These results suggest a simple and universal method for an efficient seeding of 3D additive manufactured scaffolds, independent of their material and geometrical properties, and applicable for bone and various other tissue regeneration.",

Three compounds, (-)-drimenol, (+)-albicanol, and (1R,2R,4aS,8aS)-2-hydroxy-2,5,5,8a-tetramethyl-decahydronaphthalene-1-carbaldehyde (4) showed strong activity against C. albicans. (-)-Drimenol, the strongest inhibitor of the three, (at concentrations of 8 - 64 g/ml, causing 100% death of fungi), acts not only against C. albicans as a fungicidal manner, but also inhibits other fungi such as Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis, Blastomyces, Fusarium, Rhizopus, Saksenaea and FLU resistant strains of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis and C. auris. These observations suggest drimenol is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent. At high concentration (100 g/ml), drimenol caused a rupture of the fungal cell wall/membrane. In a nematode model of C. albicans infection, drimenol rescued the worms from C. albicans-mediated death, indicating drimenol is tolerable and bioactive in a metazoan. Genome-wide fitness profiling assays of both S. cerevisiae (nonessential homozygous and essential heterozygous) and C. albicans (Tn-insertion mutants) collections revealed putative genes and pathways affected by drimenol. Using a C. albicans mutants spot assay, the Crk1 kinase associated gene products, Ret2, Cdc37, and novel putative targets orf19.759, orf19.1672, and orf19.4382 were revealed to be the potential targets of drimenol.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) modeling of the human microbiome has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Progress has been made towards developing ML models that predict health outcomes using bacterial abundances, but inconsistent adoption of training and evaluation methods call the validity of these models into question. Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs; n=490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1 and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an AUROC of 0.695 [IQR 0.651-0.739] but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 [IQR 0.625-0.735], trained faster (12 min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability.\n\nImportanceDiagnosing diseases using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these models is likely over-optimistic. Moreover, there is a trend towards using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step towards developing more reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of human health but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.",

    "abstract": "In classical biology, different taxonomic categories are all decided based on empirical rules established on learning knowledge. In taxonomy, different classification systems are of diversified rules. One biology is often in different categories, although the concepts related to taxonomic categories are the same to each other. Whether there exist some absolute standards to classify biology, and to give unalterable results. This is of greatly scientific meaning. Common and variation, that is heredity and variation are the most elemental information in biology, and exist at multiply biology material levels. In this paper a generalized biological heredity and variation information theory was proposed based on previous works. Three typical heredity and variation models were analyzed by using this theory. They are unique asymmetric variation model, symmetric two variation model and extreme radial variation model. In the maximum information states, two biological constants Pg1 = 0.69 and Pg2=0.61 and a boundary similarity function were obtained. These Pg and Pg function can be defined as the three theoretically taxonomic category criteria of biological system. For 29 samples belonging to four kind plants, their chemical fingerprint -- infrared (IR) fingerprint spectra (FPS) were analyzed depending on the theoretical criteria. The correct classification ratio was 96.6%. The results showed these samples could be ideally classified. A suggestion was proposed that biology should be absolutely classified relying on the three intrinsic theoretical criteria.",

    "abstract": "Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development. We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas unpaved roads were more important in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species.",

    "abstract": "Before and after surgery melanoma patients harbor elevated levels of extracellular vesicles in plasma (pEV), but their cellular origin is obscure. Here we suggest that these pEV are secreted in part by tumor cells, but particularly by liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which strongly suppressed tumor cell activity. As the cellular origin of pEV is difficult to determine, we mimicked the interaction of tumor cells with liver cells and PBMC in vitro, and compared newly secreted EV-associated miRNAs and protein factors with those detected in melanoma patients pEV. The results identified factors that could be associated either with tumor cell activity or the counteracting immune system and liver cells. Notably, the presence/absence of these factors correlated with the clinical stage and tumor relapse. Our study provides new insights into the innate immune defense against tumor cells and implies that residual tumor cells may be more active than previously thought.\\n\\nSummary blurbPlasma extracellular vesicles (pEV) in melanoma patients are a mix of cancer cell-suppressive vesicles from liver cells and PBMC, but derive also from residual cancer cells.",

In the present study, we have investigated the TOR pathway in the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Inhibition of TOR activity by rapamycin affects conidia germination and hyphal growth highlighting the conserved mechanism of susceptibility to rapamycin. Interestingly, the secreted protein content is also affected by the rapamycin treatment. Finally, homologs of the components of TOR pathway can be identified in P. chrysosporium. Altogether, those results indicate that the TOR pathway of P. chrysosporium plays a central role in this fungus.",

    "abstract": "Myricetin, a flavonoid found in the plant kingdom, has previously been identified as a food molecule with beneficial effects against obesity. This property has been related with its potential to inhibit lipase, the enzyme responsible of fat digestion. In this study we investigate the interaction between myricetin and lipase under simplified intestinal conditions from a colloidal point of view. The results show that myricetin form aggregates in aqueous medium and under simplified intestinal condition, where it was found that lipase is in its monomeric form. Although lipase inhibition by myricetin at a molecular level has been reported previously, the results of this study suggest that myricetin aggregates inhibit lipase by a sequestering mechanism as well. The size of these aggregates was determined to be in the range of a few nm to >200 nm.",

    "abstract": "Environmental variables are some of the factors that more impact on Aedes aegypti, vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses. In this study, the Ae. aegypti oviposition activity was related to satellite and meteorological variables, in Cordoba City (Argentina). Eggs were collected using ovitraps placed throughout the city from 2009 to 2012, replaced them weekly. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were developed with negative binomial distributions of errors, modeling average number of eggs collected weekly as a function of satellite and meteorological variables with time lags. The best model included a vegetation index, vapor pressure of water, precipitation and photoperiod, lagged between 3 and 4 weeks. By each increment unit in vegetation index, vapor pressure (hPa) and light hour, the average number of eggs increases by 72%, 20% and 29%, respectively, in the following 3 or 4 weeks. In addition, the average number of eggs decreases a 50% in the following month by each millimeter of rain. The results evince the relevant importance of the vegetation, maybe due to the shade that provide to the containers as breeding habitat of this species and the shelter for adults. On the other hand, the negative effect of precipitation could be a consequence of abundant rainfalls that fulfill containers avoiding females to lay eggs in there. Although no significant effect of the photoperiod on the vector abundance has been detected in the north of the country, in Cordoba City an important effect is observed when it is presented together with other variables, producing different effects of these variables in different regions. Lastly, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of the minimum temperature in temperate zones, since it would be a limiting factor that prevents the Ae. aegypti oviposition activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRadiographic signs of osteoarthritis (OA) are frequent in knees without symptoms. The long-term impact of these findings is not completely elucidated. We wanted to evaluate whether radiographic or clinical baseline findings are associated with the risk of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in knees without symptomatic OA but with clinical OA of the other knee during a mean follow-up period of 15 years.\n\nMethodsA follow-up analysis was performed in 100 persons with unilateral, clinical knee OA according to the ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria, who participated in a clinical trial between 2000 and 2002. Baseline radiographs of the contralateral, non-symptomatic knee were available in 88 participants at follow-up. Data on TKA procedures were extracted from the Danish National Patient Register at follow-up. Radiographic and clinical findings were analyzed for associations with subsequent TKA.\n\nResultsAt follow-up, 40% had received a TKA in their non-symptomatic knee. The risk of TKA was significantly associated with baseline joint space narrowing (risk ratio (RR) 1.6 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.4 to 1.9)), osteophytes (RR 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.8)) and subchondral sclerosis (RR 2.4 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.7)). Among the clinical findings, only baseline body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with the risk of TKA (RR 1.4 (95& CI 1.1 to 1.8)).\n\nConclusionsRadiographic OA changes and BMI at baseline were significantly associated with the long-term risk of TKA in persons without symptomatic knee OA but with symptomatic OA in the contralateral knee, implying that radiographic OA findings are important prognostic factors regardless of symptoms.",

Here, we report correlative analyses of blood and tissue specimens for signals of immune activation in trial subjects.\\n\\nMethodsAmong 10 dogs treated with palliative radiotherapy (RT) and intra-tumoral adoptive NK transfer, we performed ELISA on serum cytokines, flow cytometry for immune phenotype of PBMCs, and PCR on tumor tissue for immune-related gene expression. We then queried The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to evaluate the association of cytotoxic/immune-related gene expression with human sarcoma survival.\\n\\nResultsUpdated survival analysis revealed five 6-month survivors, including one dog who lived 17.9 months. Using feeder line co-culture for NK expansion, we observed maximal activation of dog NK cells on day 17 - 19 post isolation with near 100% expression of granzyme B and NKp46 and high cytotoxic function in the injected NK product. Among dogs on trial, we observed a trend for higher baseline serum IL-6 to predict worse lung metastasis-free and overall survival (P=0.08). PCR analysis revealed low absolute gene expression of CD3, CD8, and NKG2D in untreated OSA. Among treated dogs, there was marked heterogeneity in the expression of immune-related genes pre- and post-treatment, but increases in CD3 and CD8 gene expression were higher among dogs that lived > 6 months compared to those who did not. Analysis of the TCGA confirmed significant differences in survival among human sarcoma patients with high and low expression of genes associated with greater immune activation and cytotoxicity (CD3e, CD8a, IFN-{gamma}, perforin, and CD122/IL-2 receptor beta).\\n\\nConclusionsUpdated results from a first-in-dog clinical trial of palliative RT and autologous NK cell immunotherapy for OSA illustrate the translational relevance of companion dogs for novel cancer therapies. Similar to human studies, analyses of immune markers from canine serum, PBMCs, and tumor tissue are feasible and provide insight into potential biomarkers of response and resistance.",
