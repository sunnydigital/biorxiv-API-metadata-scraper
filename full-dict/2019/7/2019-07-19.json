    "abstract": "There is an overwhelming archeological and genetic evidence that modern speech apparatus was acquired by hominins by 600,000 years ago1. On the other hand, artifacts signifying modern imagination, such as (1) composite figurative arts, (2) bone needles with an eye, (3) construction of dwellings, and (4) elaborate burials arose not earlier than 70,000 years ago2. It remains unclear (1) why there was a long gap between acquisition of modern speech apparatus and modern imagination, (2) what triggered the acquisition of modern imagination 70,000 years ago, and (3) what role language might have played in this process. Our research into evolutionary origin of modern imagination has been driven by the observation of a temporal limit for the development of a particular component of imagination. Modern children not exposed to recursive language in early childhood never acquire the type of active constructive imagination called Prefrontal Synthesis (PFS). Unlike vocabulary and grammar acquisition, which can be learned throughout ones lifetime, there is a strong critical period for the development of PFS and individuals not exposed to recursive language in early childhood can never acquire PFS as adults. Their language will always lack understanding of spatial prepositions and recursion that depend on the PFS ability. In a similar manner, early hominins would not have been able to learn recursive language as adults and, therefore, would not be able to teach recursive language to their children. Thus, the existence of a strong critical period for PFS acquisition creates an evolutionary barrier for behavioral modernity. An evolutionary mathematical model suggests that a synergistic confluence of three events (1) a genetic mutation that extended the critical period by slowing down the prefrontal cortex development simultaneously in two or more children, (2) invention of recursive elements of language, such as spatial prepositions, by these children and (3) their dialogic communications using these recursive elements, resulted in concurrent conversion of a non-recursive communication system of their parents to recursive language and acquisition of PFS around 70,000 years ago.",

    "abstract": "The core diagnostic criteria for autism comprise two symptom domains - social and communication difficulties, and unusually repetitive and restricted behaviour, interests and activities. There is some evidence to suggest that these two domains are dissociable, yet, this hypothesis has not been tested using molecular genetics. We test this using a GWAS of a non-social autistic trait, systemizing (N = 51,564), defined as the drive to analyse and build systems. We demonstrate that systemizing is heritable and genetically correlated with autism. In contrast, we do not identify significant genetic correlations between social autistic traits and systemizing. Supporting this, polygenic scores for systemizing are significantly positively associated with restricted and repetitive behaviour but not with social difficulties in autistic individuals. These findings strongly suggest that the two core domains of autism are genetically dissociable, and point at how to fractionate the genetics of autism.",

    "abstract": "In human post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a major psychiatry challenge is how diverse stress reactions emerge after a protracted symptom-free period. Here, we study the behavioral development in mice isolated after observing an aggressive encounter inflicted upon their pair-housed partners and compared the results with those in multiple control paradigms. Compared with mice plainly isolated, mice isolated following the acute witnessing social stress gradually developed a wide range of long-term differences of their physiological conditions, spontaneous behaviors, and social interactions, including paradoxical results if interpreted in traditional ways. To address this developmental diversity, we applied fine-scale behavioral analysis to standard behavioral tests and showed that the seemingly sudden emergent behavioral differences developed gradually. Mice showed different developmental patterns in different zones of a behavior testing apparatus. However, the results of the fine-scale analysis together with state-space behavioral characterization allow a consistent interpretation of the seemingly conflicting observations among multiple tests. Interestingly, these behavioral differences were not observed if the aggressive encounter happened to a stranger mouse. Additionally, traumatized mice showed rebound responses to their partners after the long separation. In contrast, mice pair-housed with their attacked partners after the aggressive encounters still showed a difference in social interactions, while a difference in spontaneous behaviors did not occur. Accordingly, we propose that social relationship is the single common factor underlying the otherwise independent development of behavioral differences in this mouse paradigm and that the gained insights could have parallels in human PTSD development.",

    "abstract": "Cortical collapse factors affect microtubule (MT) dynamics at the plasma membrane. They play important roles in neurons, as suggested by inhibition of axon growth and regeneration through the Arf activator Efa6 in C. elegans, and by neurodevelopmental disorders linked to the mammalian kinesin Kif21A. How cortical collapse factors influence axon growth is little understood. Here we studied them, focussing on the function of Drosophila Efa6 in experimentally and genetically amenable fly neurons. First, we show that Drosophila Efa6 can inhibit MTs directly without interacting molecules via an N-terminal 18 amino acid motif (MT elimination domain/MTED) that binds tubulin and inhibits microtubule growth in vitro and cells. If N-terminal MTED-containing fragments are in the cytoplasm they abolish entire microtubule networks of mouse fibroblasts and whole axons of fly neurons. Full-length Efa6 is membrane-attached, hence primarily blocks MTs in the periphery of fibroblasts, and explorative MTs that have left axonal bundles in neurons. Accordingly, loss of Efa6 causes an increase of explorative MTs: in growth cones, they enhance axon growth, in axon shafts, explorative MTs cause excessive branching, as well as atrophy through perturbations of MT bundles. Efa6 over-expression causes the opposite phenotypes. Taken together, our work conceptually links molecular and sub-cellular functions of cortical collapse factors to axon growth regulation and reveals new roles in axon branching and in the prevention of axonal atrophy. Furthermore, the MTED delivers a promising tool that can be used to inhibit MTs in a compartmentalised fashion when fusing it to specifically localising protein domains.\\n\\nSummary statementThe cortical collapse factor Efa6 inhibits microtubule polymerising outside axonal bundles. Thereby it limits axon growth and branching, but preserves microtubule bundle organisation crucial for axon maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Coherent neuronal dynamics play an important role in complex cognitive functions. Optogenetic stimulation promises to provide new ways to test the functional significance of coherent neural activity. However, the mechanisms by which optogenetic stimulation drives coherent dynamics remain unclear, especially in the non-human primate brain. Here, we perform computational modeling and experiments to study the mechanisms of optogenetic-stimulation-driven coherent neuronal dynamics in non-human primates. Neural responses arise from stimulation-evoked temporal windows of excitatory and inhibitory activity. The temporal properties of the E-I windows generate coherent neuronal dynamics at varied frequencies and depend on optogenetic stimulation parameters. Experimental results agree with parameter dependent predictions from the computational models. These results demonstrate that responses to optogenetic stimulation are governed by local circuit properties that alter the timing of E-I activity. Transient imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory activity may provide a general mechanism for generating coherent neuronal dynamics.",

Although SCs are heterogeneous and different subpopulations have been identified, it remains unknown if a specific subpopulation of muscle SCs selectively decreases during aging.

Mechanistically, we show that transcription of G-CSF (Csf3) gene in myofibers is regulated by MyoD in a metabolism-dependent manner and the myofibers-secreted G-CSF acts as a metabolic niche factor required for establishing and maintaining the Pax7Hi SC subpopulation in adult and physiological aged mice by promoting the asymmetric division of Pax7Hi and Pax7Mi SCs.

However, studies for simultaneously evaluating enterotype-dependent impacts of CR on the gut microbiota and blood amino acids in nonobese individuals are still limited.\\n\\nHere, 41 nonobese individuals received a 3-week CR diet with approximately 50% fewer calories than normal diet. We measured their BMI and blood amino acid concentration, along with the gut microbiota before and after the intervention. In this trial, 28 Enterotype Bacteroides (ETB) subjects and 13 Enterotype Prevotella (ETP) subjects were identified before the intervention. Short-term CR dietary intervention decreased the body mass index (BMI) in most subjects but varied in subjects with different enterotypes. ETP subjects exhibited significantly higher BMI loss ratio than the ETB subjects. CR additionally induced substantial enterotype-independent changes in blood amino acids, but only minor changes in gut microbial composition.\\n\\nWe further built a prediction model based on baseline relative abundances of 7 gut microbial species showing high performance in predicting CR-associated BMI loss ratio. Among them, the relative abundance of ETB-enriched Clostridium bolteae and C. ramosum were negatively correlated with BMI loss ratio while the relative abundance of Dorea longicatena which was slightly enriched in ETP subjects, was positively correlated with BMI loss ratio.\\n\\nTogether, our work points out that the individual variation of BMI loss after CR could be partially correlated with different microbial composition and highlights the potential application for microbiome stratification in personalized nutrition intervention.",

A3R antagonists have been described as potential treatments for numerous diseases including asthma. Given the similarity between ARs orthosteric binding sites, obtaining highly selective antagonists is a challenging but critical task.\n\nExperimental approach39 potential A3R, antagonists were screened using agonist-induced inhibition of cAMP. Positive hits were assessed for AR subtype selectivity through cAMP accumulation assays. The antagonist affinity was determined using Schild analysis (pA2 values) and fluorescent ligand binding. Further, a likely binding pose of the most potent antagonist (K18) was determined through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and consistent calculated binding free energy differences between K18 and congeners, using a homology model of A3R, combined with mutagenesis studies.\n\nKey ResultsWe demonstrate that K18, which contains a 3-(dichlorophenyl)-isoxazole group connected through carbonyloxycarboximidamide fragment with a 1,3-thiazole ring, is a specific A3R (<1 {micro}M) competitive antagonist. Structure-activity relationship investigations revealed that loss of the 3-(dichlorophenyl)-isoxazole group significantly attenuated K18 antagonistic potency. Mutagenic studies supported by MD simulations identified the residues important for binding in the A3R orthosteric site. Finally, we introduce a model that enables estimates of the equilibrium binding affinity for rapidly disassociating compounds from real-time fluorescent ligand-binding studies.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsThese results demonstrate the pharmacological characterisation of a selective competitive A3R antagonist and the description of its orthosteric binding mode.

Using a first-principles carbon balance model with a prescribed live woody biomass turnover, applied at a forest research site where multidecadal measurements are available for comparison, we show that if turnover is fast the accumulation of respiring biomass is low and respiration depends primarily on photosynthesis; while if turnover is slow the accumulation of respiring biomass is high and respiration depends primarily on biomass. But the first scenario is inconsistent with evidence for substantial carryover of fixed carbon between years, while the second implies far too great an increase in respiration during stand development - leading to depleted carbohydrate reserves and an unrealistically high mortality risk. These two mutually incompatible hypotheses are thus both incorrect. Respiration is not linearly related either to photosynthesis or to biomass, but it is more strongly controlled by recent photosynthates (and reserve availability) than by total biomass.",

    "abstract": "The plasma membrane of cells exhibits phase behavior that allows transient concentration of specific proteins and lipids, giving rise to functionally dynamic and diverse nanoscopic domains. This phase behavior is observable in giant plasma membrane-derived vesicles, in which microscopically visible, liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) lipid domains form upon a shift to low temperatures. The extent such phase behavior exists in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cells remains unclear. To explore the phase behavior of the ER membrane in cells, we used hypotonic cell swelling to generate Large Intra-Cellular Vesicles (LICVs) from the ER in cells. ER LICVs retained their lumenal protein content, could be retubulated into an ER network, and maintained stable inter-organelle contacts, where protein tethers are concentrated at these contacts. Notably, upon temperature reduction, ER LICVs underwent reversible phase separation into microscopically-visible Lo and Ld lipid domains. The Lo lipid domains marked ER contact sites with other organelles. These findings demonstrate that LICVs provide an important model system for studying the biophysical properties of intracellular organelles in cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementPrior work has demonstrated that the plasma membrane can phase separate into microscopically visible Lo and Ld domains with distinct lipid and protein content. However, such behavior on the ER membrane has not been experimentally observed, even though the ER contacts every organelle of the cell, exchanging lipids and metabolites in a highly regulated manner at these contacts. We find here that hypotonic treatment generates Large Intra-Cellular Vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum and other membrane-bound organelles in cells, enabling the study of phase behavior on the ER membrane. We show that ER membranes can be reversibly phase separated into microscopically-observable, Lo and Ld domains. ER LICVs also maintained stable inter-organelle contact sites in cells, with organelle tethers concentrated at these contacts.",

Thus, determining the dynamic distribution of proteins is essential to understand neuronal processes. Fluorescence imaging, in particular super-resolution microscopy, has become invaluable to investigate subcellular protein distribution. However, these approaches suffer from the limited ability to efficiently and reliably label endogenous proteins. We developed ORANGE: an Open Resource for the Application of Neuronal Genome Editing, that mediates targeted genomic integration of fluorescent tags in neurons. This toolbox includes a knock-in library for in-depth investigation of endogenous protein distribution, and a detailed protocol explaining how knock-in can be developed for novel targets. In combination with super-resolution microscopy, ORANGE revealed the dynamic nanoscale organization of endogenous neuronal signaling molecules, synaptic scaffolding proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors. Thus, ORANGE enables quantitation of expression and distribution for virtually any protein in neurons at high resolution and will significantly further our understanding of neuronal cell biology.",

    "abstract": "YidC, a bacterial member of the YidC/Alb3/Oxa1 insertase family, mediates membrane protein assembly and insertion. Cytoplasmic loops are known to have functional significance in membrane proteins such as YidC. Employing microsecond-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the crystallographically unresolved C2 loop plays a crucial role in the structural dynamics of Bacillus halodurans YidC2. We have modeled the C2 loop and used allatom MD simulations to investigate the structural dynamics of YidC2 in its apo form, both with and without the C2 loop. The C2 loop was found to stabilize the entire protein and particularly the C1 region. C2 was also found to stabilize the alpha-helical character of the C-terminal region. Interestingly, the highly polar or charged lipid head groups of the simulated membranes were found to interact with and stabilize the C2 loop. These findings demonstrate that the crystallographically unresolved loops of membrane proteins could be important for the stabilization of the protein despite the apparent lack of structure, which could be due to the absence of the relevant lipids to stabilize them in crystallographic conditions.",

Here, we present a generic, 14-residues long, N-terminal tag for GCE-based labeling of proteins in live mammalian cells. Using this tag, we generated a library of GCE-based organelle markers, demonstrating the applicability of the tag for labeling a plethora of proteins and organelles. Finally, we show that the HA epitope, used as a backbone in our tag, can be substituted with other epitopes and, in some cases, can be completely removed, reducing the tag length to 5 residues.

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver the past recent years, Vibrio cholerae has been associated with outbreaks in Sub Saharan Africa, notably in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study aimed to determine the genetic relatedness of isolates responsible for cholera outbreaks in eastern DRC between 2014 and 2017, and their potential spread to bordering countries.\\n\\nMethods/Principal findingsPhenotypic analysis and whole genome sequencing (WGS) were carried out on 78 clinical isolates of V. cholerae associated with cholera in eastern provinces of DRC between 2014 and 2017. SNP-based phylogenomic data show that most isolates (73/78) were V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor with CTX-3 type prophage. They fell within the third transmission wave of the current seventh pandemic El Tor (7PET) lineage and were contained in the introduction event (T)10 in East Africa. These isolates clustered in two sub-clades corresponding to Multiple Locus Sequence Types (MLST) profiles ST69 and the newly assigned ST515, the latter displaying a higher genetic diversity. Both sub-clades showed a distinct geographic clustering, with ST69 isolates mostly restricted to Lake Tanganyika basin and phylogenetically related to V. cholerae isolates associated with cholera outbreaks in western Tanzania, whereas ST515 isolates were disseminated along the Albertine Rift and closely related to isolates in South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia. Other V. cholerae isolates (5/78) were non-O1/non-O139 without any CTX prophage and no phylogenetic relationship with already characterized non-O1/non-O139 isolates.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceCurrent data confirm the association of both DRC O1 7PET (T)10 sub-clades ST69 and ST515 with recurrent outbreaks in eastern DRC and at regional level over the past 10 years. Interestingly, while ST69 is predominantly a locally endemic sequence type, ST515 became adaptable enough to expand across DRC neighboring countries.\\n\\nAuthors summaryCholera is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. After originating in Asia, the disease spread across sub-Saharan Africa, notably Democratic Republic of the Congo. The aim of our study was to assess the transmission pattern of V. cholerae strains prevailing in eastern DRC, and determine their genetic relatedness to strains from other African countries and other parts of the world. Between 2014 and 2017, we isolated V. cholerae from fecal samples of patients with acute diarrhea in eastern DRC, and subsequently examined the DNA of the bacteria. The results show that they all clustered in two genetic groups (ST69 and ST515) falling within the third transmission wave of the current seventh pandemic El Tor (7PET) lineage and T10 introduction event in East Africa. The genetic signature of ST515 may be involved in its adaptation to environmental conditions found in eastern DRC, and contribute to its extended geographic distribution. Indeed, unlike the locally endemic ST69, ST515 is spreading extensively through DRC cross-border countries such as South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. This plainly justifies a regional strategy to strengthen the fight against cholera in eastern Africa.",

    "abstract": "RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription termination is regulated by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD). Using disruption-compensation (DisCo) protein-protein interaction network analysis, interaction changes were observed within the termination machinery as a consequence of deletion of the serine 5 RNAPII CTD phosphatase Rtr1. Interactions between RNAPII and the cleavage factor IA (CF1A) subunit Pcf11 were reduced in rtr1{Delta}, whereas interactions with the CTD and RNA-binding termination factor Nrd1 were increased. These changes could be the result of altered interactions between the termination machinery and/or increased levels of premature termination of RNAPII. Transcriptome analysis in rtr1{Delta} cells found decreased pervasive transcription and a shift in balance of expression of sense and antisense transcripts. Globally, rtr1{Delta} leads to decreases in noncoding RNAs that are linked to the Nrd1, Nab3 and Sen1 (NNS)-dependent RNAPII termination pathway. Genome-wide analysis of RNAPII and Nrd1 occupancy suggests that loss of RTR1 leads to increased termination at noncoding genes and increased efficiency of snRNA termination. Additionally, premature termination increases globally at protein-coding genes where NNS is recruited during early elongation. The effects of rtr1{Delta} on RNA expression levels were erased following deletion of the exosome subunit Rrp6, which works with the NNS complex to rapidly degrade terminated noncoding RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that Rtr1 restricts the NNS-dependent termination pathway in WT cells to prevent premature RNAPII termination of mRNAs and ncRNAs. Additionally, Rtr1 phosphatase activity facilitates low-level elongation of noncoding transcripts that impact the transcriptome through RNAPII interference.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMany cellular RNAs including those that encode for proteins are produced by the enzyme RNA Polymerase II. In this work, we have defined a new role for the phosphatase Rtr1 in the regulation of RNA Polymerase II progression from the start of transcription to the 3 end of the gene where the nascent RNA from protein-coding genes is typically cleaved and polyadenylated. Deletion of the gene that encodes RTR1 leads to changes in the interactions between RNA polymerase II and the termination machinery. Rtr1 loss also causes early termination of RNA Polymerase II at many of its target gene types including protein coding genes and noncoding RNAs. Evidence suggests that the premature termination observed in RTR1 knockout cells occurs through the termination factor and RNA binding protein Nrd1 and its binding partner Nab3. Additionally, many of the prematurely terminated noncoding RNA transcripts are degraded by the Rrp6-containing nuclear exosome, a known component of the Nrd1-Nab3 termination coupled RNA degradation pathway. These findings suggest that Rtr1 normally promotes elongation of RNA Polymerase II transcripts through preventation of Nrd1-directed termination.",

    "abstract": "The type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is responsible for releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiomyocytes, subsequently leading to muscle contraction. Here, we report four cryo-EM structures of porcine RyR2 bound to distinct modulators that collectively provide mechanistic insight into RyR2 regulation. Ca2+ alone induces a contraction of the Central domain that facilitates the dilation of S6 bundle, but is insufficient to open the pore. The small molecule agonist PCB95 helps Ca2+ to overcome the barrier for opening. FKBP12.6 induces a relaxation of the Central domain that decouples it from the S6 bundle, stabilizing RyR2 in a closed state. Caffeine locks the Central domain in a constitutively contracted state, while further addition of ATP opens the channel by strengthening the coupling between the U-motif and S6. Our study marks an important step towards mechanistic understanding of the complicated regulation of this key channel whose aberrant activity engenders life-threatening cardiac disorders.",

The groups were used in a model of the extracorporeal biliary perfusion system with bacterial infection, and the experiment was terminated when the stent was completely blocked. Changes of bile characteristics before and after the experiment, patency time, and amount of bile sludge deposition were compared between the groups. The t-test and analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.\\n\\nResultsIn the bare stent group, contact angles of bile were about 80.4 degrees and 79.8 degrees before and after the experiment, respectively. There was no change in the effect of bile aversion after the experiment between the groups (P < 0.05). In the coated stent group, contact angles of bile changed from 143.3 degrees before the experiment to 135.7 degrees after the experiment; the effect of the coating decreased significantly after the experiment (P > 0.05). The patency times were 8 weeks and 23 weeks in the bare and coated stent groups, respectively (P > 0.05). Depositions of biliary mud were 47 mg and 13 mg in the bare and coated stent groups, respectively (P > 0.05).\\n\\nConclusionThe superhydrophobic, oleophobic-coated biliary stent can repel bile better and play a role in preventing bile sludge deposition in the extracorporeal biliary perfusion system.",

    "abstract": "TASK channels are unusual members of the two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channel family, with unique and unexplained physiological and pharmacological characteristics. TASKs are found in neurons1,2, cardiomyocytes3-5 and vascular smooth muscle cells6 where they are involved in regulation of heart rate7, pulmonary artery tone6,8, sleep/wake cycles9 and responses to volatile anaesthetics9-12. K2P channels regulate the resting membrane potential, providing background K+ currents controlled by numerous physiological stimuli13,14. Unlike other K2P channels, TASK channels have the capacity to bind inhibitors with high affinity, exceptional selectivity and very slow compound washout rates. These characteristics make the TASK channels some of the the most easily druggable potassium channels, and indeed TASK-1 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and atrial fibrillation (Afib)15 (The DOCTOS and SANDMAN Trials). Generally, potassium channels have an intramembrane vestibule with a selectivity filter above and a gate with four parallel helices below. However, K2P channels studied to date all lack a lower gate. Here we present the structure of TASK-1, revealing a unique lower gate created by interaction of the two crossed C-terminal M4 transmembrane helices at the vestibule entrance, which we designate as an \\\"X-gate\\\". This structure is formed by six residues (V243LRFMT248) that are essential for responses to volatile anaesthetics11, neuro-transmitters16 and G-protein coupled receptors16. Interestingly, mutations within the X-gate and surrounding regions drastically affect both open probability and activation by anaesthetics. Structures of TASK-1 with two novel, high-affinity blockers, shows both inhibitors bound below the selectivity filter, trapped in the vestibule by the X-gate, thus explaining their exceptionally low wash-out rates. Thus, the presence of the X-gate in TASK channels explains many aspects of their unusual physiological and pharmacological behaviour, which is invaluable for future development and optimization of TASK modulators for treatment of heart, lung and sleep disorders.",

However, the perspectives of skilled providers on respectful maternal care have not been extensively studied. Midwives knowledge of respectful maternity care is critical in designing any interventive measures to address the menace of disrespect and abuse in maternity care. Therefore, the present study sought to explore the views of midwives on respectful maternity care at a Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana.\\n\\nMethodsPhenomenological qualitative research design was employed in the study. Data were generated through individual in-depth interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data saturation was reached with fifteen midwives. Open Code 4.03 was used to manage and analyse the data.\\n\\nFindingsThe midwives understanding of respectful maternity care was comprised of the following components: non-abusive care, consented care, confidential care, non-violation of childbearing womens basic human rights, and non-discriminatory care. Probing questions to solicit midwives opinions on an evidenced-based component of respectful maternity care generated little information, suggesting that the midwives have a gap in knowledge regarding this component of respectful maternity care.\\n\\nConclusionMidwives reported an understanding of most components of respectful maternity care, but their gap in knowledge on evidenced-based care requires policy attention and in-service training. To understand the extent to which this gap in knowledge can be generalized for midwives across Ghana to warrant a redesign of the national midwifery curriculum, the authors recommend a nationwide cross-sectional quantitative study.",

In addition, the consequences of performing chronic exercise have not been sufficiently studied in contrast to the effects of acute bouts of exercise. Our findings shed light on the effects that chronic exercise elicits on several immune cell subpopulations, from the innate to the adaptive immunity. For this study male Wistar rats performed treadmill running 5 times a week for a period of 10 weeks, speed and duration in each exercise bout was gradually increased until reaching 40 minutes at 15 m/min. Our results showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+, T{gamma}{delta}, and CD45 RA+ cells) and also indicate an alteration in the cannabinoid receptors expression in some of these cells subsets. Although functional assays did not reveal any variation in total immunoglobulin production or NK cells cytotoxic activity, proliferative capability of total splenocytes increased in trained rats. Our results further support the notion that exercise affects the immunological system and extends the description of underlying mechanisms mediating such effects. Altogether, our results contribute to the understanding of the benefits of exercise on the practitioners general health.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial near-infrared stimulation (tNIRS) has been proposed as a tool to modulate cortical excitability. However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear where the heating effects on the brain tissue needs investigation due to increased near-infrared (NIR) absorption by water and fat. Moreover, the risk of localized heating of tissues (including the skin) during optical stimulation of the brain tissue is a concern. The challenge in estimating localized tissue heating is due to the light interaction with the tissues constituents, which is dependent on the combination ratio of the scattering and absorption properties of the constituent. Here, apart from tissue heating that can modulate the cortical excitability (\\\"photothermal effects\\\"); the other mechanism reported in the literature is the stimulation of the mitochondria in the cells which are active in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. In the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the complex IV, also named as the cytochrome c oxidase(CCO), is the unit four with three copper atoms. The absorption peaks of CCO are in the visible (420-450nm and 600-700nm) and the near-infrared (760-980nm) spectral region which have been shown to be promising for low level light therapy (LLLT), also known as \\\"photobiomodulation\\\". While much higher CCO absorption peaks in the visible spectrum can be used for the photobiomodulation of the skin, 810nm has been proposed for the non-invasive brain stimulation (using tNIRS) due to the optical window in the NIR spectral region. In this article, we applied a computational approach to delineate the \\\"photothermal effects\\\" from the \\\"photobiomodulation,\\\" i.e., to estimate the amount of light absorbed individually by each chromophore in the brain tissue (with constant scattering) and the related tissue heating. Photon migration simulations were performed for motor cortex tNIRS based on a prior work that used a 500mW cm-2 light source placed on the scalp. We simulated photon migration at 630nm and 700nm (red spectral region) and 810nm (near-infrared spectral region). We found a temperature increase in the scalp below 0.25 {degrees} C and a minimal temperature increase in the gray matter less than 0.04 {degrees} C at 810nm. Similar heating was found for 630nm and 700nm used for LLLT, so photothermal effects are postulated to be unlikely in the brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "Various computational and statistical approaches have been proposed to uncover the mutational patterns of rapidly evolving influenza viral genes. Nonetheless, the approaches mainly rely on sequence alignments which could potentially lead to spurious mutations obtained by comparing sequences from different clades that coexist during particular periods of time. To address this issue, we propose a phylogenetic tree-based pipeline that takes into account the evolutionary structure in the sequence data. Assuming that the sequences evolve progressively under a strict molecular clock, considering a competitive model that is based on a certain Markov model, and using a resampling approach to obtain robust estimates, we could capture statistically significant single-mutations and co-mutations during the sequence evolution. Moreover, by considering the results obtained from analyses that consider all paths and the longest path in the resampled trees, we can categorize the mutational sites and suggest their relevance. Here we applied the pipeline to investigate the 50 years of evolution of the HA sequences of influenza A/H3N2 viruses. In addition to confirming previous knowledge on the A/H3N2 HA evolution, we also demonstrate the use of the pipeline to classify mutational sites according to whether they are able to enhance antigenic drift, compensate other mutations that enhance antigenic drift, or both.",

Here we extend this \\\"BAC TG-EMBED\\\" approach. First, we report a toolkit of endogenous promoters capable of driving transgene expression over a 0.01-5 fold expression range relative to the CMV promoter, allowing fine-tuning of relative expression levels of multiple reporter genes expressed on a single BAC. Second, we show small variability in both the expression level and long-term expression stability of a reporter gene embedded in BACs containing either transcriptionally active or inactive genomic regions, making choice of BACs more flexible. Third, we describe an intriguing phenomenon in which BAC transgenes are maintained as episomes in a large fraction of stably selected clones. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of BAC TG-EMBED by simultaneously labeling three nuclear compartments in 94% of stable clones using a multi-reporter DHFR BAC, constructed with a combination of synthetic biology and BAC recombineering tools. Our extended BAC TG-EMBED method provides a versatile platform for achieving reproducible, stable simultaneous expression of multiple transgenes maintained either as episomes or stably integrated copies.",

However, its functional role has not been identified yet in reptiles. Here we characterized the Mis gene in Chinese soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis (P. sinensis), a typical reptilian species exhibiting ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes. The mRNA of Mis was initially expressed in male embryonic gonads by stage 15, preceding gonadal sex differentiation, and exhibited male-specific expression pattern throughout embryogenesis. Moreover, Mis was rapidly up-regulated during female-to-male sex reversal induced by aromatase inhibitor letrozole. Most importantly, Mis loss of function by RNA interference led to complete feminization of genetic male (ZZ) gonads, suppression of the testicular marker Sox9, and upregulation of the ovarian regulator Cyp19a1. Conversely, overexpression of Mis in ZW embryos resulted in female-to-male sex reversal, characterized by the formation of testis structure, ectopic activation of Sox9, and a remarkable decline in Cyp19a1. Collectively, these findings provide the first solid evidence that Mis is both necessary and sufficient to drive testicular development in a reptilian species, P. sinensis, highlighting the significance of the TGF-{beta} pathway in reptilian sex determination.",

    "abstract": "Among primates, susceptibility to yellow fever (YFV), a single-stranded (ss) RNA virus, ranges from complete resistance to high susceptibility. Howler monkeys (genus Alouatta) are the most susceptible to YFV. In order to identify Alouatta-specific genetic factors that may be responsible for their susceptibility, we collected skin samples from howler monkey museum specimens of the species A. caraya and A. guariba clamitans. We compared the rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous (dN/dS) changes of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8, the two genes responsible for detecting all ssRNA viruses, across the Primate order. Overall, we found that the TLR7 gene is under stronger purifying selection in howler monkeys compared to other New World and Old World primates, but TLR8 is under the same selective pressure. When we evaluated dN/dS at each codon, we found six codons under positive selection in Alouatta TLR8 and two codons under positive selection in TLR7. The changes in TLR7 are unique to A. guariba clamitans and are found in functionally important regions likely to affect detection of ssRNA viruses by TLR7/TLR8, as well as downstream signaling. These amino acid differences in A. guariba clamitans may play a role in YFV susceptibility. These results have implications for identifying genetic factors affecting YFV susceptibility in primates.",

    "abstract": "Despite the availability of seasonal vaccines and antiviral medications, influenza virus continues to be a major health concern and pandemic threat due to the continually changing antigenic regions of the major surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA). One emerging strategy for the development of more efficacious seasonal and universal influenza vaccines is structure-guided design of nanoparticles that display conserved regions of HA, such as the stem. Using the H1 HA subtype to establish proof of concept, we found that an alpha-helical fragment (helix-A) from the conserved stem region can be displayed on nanoparticles. The stem region of HA on these nanoparticles is immunogenic and the nanoparticles are biochemically robust in that heat exposure did not destroy the particles and immunogenicity was retained. Furthermore, H1-nanoparticles protected mice from lethal challenge with H1N1 influenza virus. Importantly, antibodies elicited by these nanoparticles demonstrated homosubtypic and heterosubtypic cross-reactivity. The helix-A stem nanoparticle design represents a novel approach to display several hundred copies of non-trimeric conserved HA stem epitopes on vaccine nanoparticles. This design concept provides a new approach to universal influenza vaccine development strategies and opens up opportunities for the development of nanoparticles with broad coverage over many antigenically diverse influenza HA subtypes.\\n\\nSignificanceInfluenza virus is a public health issue that affects millions of people globally each year. Commercial influenza vaccines are based on the hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein, which can change antigenically every year, demanding the manufacture of newly matched vaccines annually. HA stem epitopes have a higher degree of conservation than HA molecules contained in conventional vaccine formulations and we demonstrate that we are able to design nanoparticles that display hundreds of HA stem fragments on nanoparticles. These designed nanoparticles are heat-stable, elicit antibodies to the HA stem, confer protection in mouse challenge models, and show cross-reactivity between HA subtypes. This technology provides promising opportunities to improve seasonal vaccines, develop pandemic preparedness vaccines, and facilitate the development of a universal influenza vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Microbes ubiquitously inhabit animals and plants, often affecting their hosts phenotype. As a result, even in a constant genetic background, the hosts phenotype may evolve through indirect selection on the microbiome.  Microbiome engineering offers a promising novel approach for attaining desired host traits but has been attempted only a few times. Building on the known role of the microbiome on development in fruit flies, we attempted to evolve earlier eclosing flies by selecting on microbes in the growth media. We carried out parallel evolution experiments in no- and high-sugar diets by transferring media associated with fast-developing fly lines over the course of four rounds of selection. In each round, we used sterile eggs from the same inbred population, and assayed fly mean eclosion times. Ultimately, flies eclosed seven to twelve hours earlier, depending on the diet, but selection had no effect. 16S sequencing showed that the microbiome did evolve, particularly in the no sugar diet, with an increase in alpha diversity over time. Thus, while microbiome evolution did affect host eclosion times, these effects were incidental. Instead, any experimentally enforced selection effects were swamped by independent microbial evolution. These results imply that selection on host phenotypes must be strong enough to overcome other selection pressures simultaneously operating on the microbiome. The independent evolutionary trajectories of the host and the microbiome may limit the extent to which indirect selection on the microbiome can ultimately affect host phenotype. Random-selection lines accounting for independent microbial evolution are essential for experimental microbiome engineering studies.",

    "abstract": "Lakes and reservoirs contribute substantially to atmospheric concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Lacustrine sediments produce large amounts of methane, which accumulate in oxygen-depleted hypolimnia of stratified lakes. Due to climate change and progressing eutrophication, the number of lakes with hypolimnetic methane storage may increase in the future. However, whether stored methane eventually reaches the atmosphere during lake overturn is a matter of controversy and depends critically on the response of the methanotroph assemblage. We show that the methanotroph assemblage in a mixing lake underwent both a substantial bloom and ecological succession. As a result, the methane oxidation capacity of the mixed layer kept pace with the methane supplied from the hypolimnion and most of the stored methane was oxidized. This previously unknown aspect of freshwater methanotroph ecology represents an effective mechanism limiting methane transfer from lakes to the atmosphere.",

Mutations in HSP27 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. A particularly severe form of the disease is triggered by the P182L mutation within the highly conserved IxI/V motif of HSP27. Here, we observed that the P182L variant of HSP27 lacks the ability to prevent the aggregation of client proteins and formed significantly larger oligomers both in vitro and in vivo. NMR spectroscopy revealed that the P182L IxI/V motif binds its -crystallin domain with significantly lower association rate, and thus affinity, rendering the binding site more available for other interactors. We identified 22 IxI/V-containing proteins that are known to interact with HSP27 and could therefore bind with enhanced affinity to the P182L variant. We validated this hypothesis through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, revealing that the IxI/V motif-bearing co-chaperone BAG3 indeed binds with higher affinity to the P182L variant. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the impact of the P182L mutation on HSP27, and highlight the general importance of the IxI/V motif and its role in protein-protein interaction networks.",

The carboxysome self-assembles from thousands of individual proteins into icosahedral-like particles with a dense enzyme cargo encapsulated within a proteinaceous shell. In the case of the -carboxysome, there is little molecular insight into protein-protein interactions which drive the assembly process. Here we show that the N-terminus of CsoS2, an intrinsically disordered protein found in the -carboxysome, possesses a repeated peptide sequence that binds Rubisco. X-ray structural analysis of the peptide bound to Rubisco reveals a series of conserved electrostatic interactions that are only made with properly assembled hexadecameric Rubisco. Although biophysical measurements indicate this single interaction is weak, its implicit multivalency induces high-affinity binding through avidity. Taken together, our results indicate CsoS2 acts as an interaction hub to condense Rubisco and enable efficient -carboxysome formation.",

    "abstract": "Traces of archaic hominin DNA persist in the human gene pool, but are systematically depleted around genes and other functionally important genomic regions. This suggests that many Neandertal and Denisovan alleles had harmful effects on hybrid fitness. We hypothesized that if some harmful effects were mediated by gene dysregulation in specific tissues, alleles previously flagged as archaic using a conditional random field (CRF) should be depleted from those tissues regulatory enhancers compared to \"control\" alleles matched for allele frequency and the strength of background selection. By this metric, both Neandertal and Denisovan variation appear depleted from enhancers, particularly enhancers that show pleiotropic activity across tissues. This depletion is driven by young archaic SNPs that the CRF confidently identifies as private to Neandertals or Denisovans; older variants that were likely present in both archaic species are not depleted from enhancers. We found that enhancer pleiotropy is not only a predictor of archaic SNP depletion, but also a predictor of intolerance to new mutations as measured by both phastCons scores and the frequency spectrum of African variation. In other respects, however, the landscape of selection against young archaic alleles appears qualitatively different from the landscape of ordinary purifying selection, suggesting that archaic alleles had a different distribution of fitness effects from ordinary new mutations. Most strikingly, fetal brain and muscle are the tissues most depleted of young archaic variation in their regulatory regions, but only brain enhancers appear commensurately intolerant to new mutations. In contrast, fetal muscle enhancers show no evidence of elevated purifying selection relative to other enhancers. This suggests that epistatic incompatibility between human and archaic alleles is needed to explain the degree of archaic variant depletion from fetal muscle enhancers, perhaps due to divergent selection for higher muscle mass in archaic hominins compared to humans.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke induces rapid loss in bone mineral density that is up to 13 times greater than during normal aging, leading to a markedly increased risk of fracture. Little is known about skeletal changes following stroke beyond density loss. In this study we use a mild-moderate middle cerebral artery occlusion model to determine the effects of ischemic stroke without bedrest on bone microstructure, dynamic bone formation, and tissue composition. Twenty-seven 12-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice received either a stroke or sham surgery and then either received daily treadmill exercise or remained sedentary for four weeks. All mice were ambulatory immediately following stroke, and limb coordination during treadmill exercise was unaffected by stroke, indicating similar mechanical loading across limbs for both stroke and sham groups. Stroke did not directly detriment microstructure, but exercise only stimulated adaptation in the sham group, not the stroke group, with increased bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness in the sham distal femoral metaphysis. Stroke differentially decreased cortical area in the affected limb relative to the unaffected limb of the distal femoral metaphysis, as well as endosteal bone formation rate in the affected tibial diaphysis. Although exercise failed to improve bone microstructure following stroke, exercise increased mineral-to-matrix content in stroke but not sham. Together, these results show that stroke inhibits exercise-induced changes to femoral microstructure but not tibial composition, even without changes to gait. Similarly, affected-unaffected limb differences in cortical bone structure and bone formation rate in ambulatory mice show that stroke affects bone health even without bedrest.",

    "abstract": "We expand the standard FRAP model introduced by Axelrod et al. in 1976. Our goal is to capture some common artifacts observed in the fluorescence measurements obtained with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) in biofilms: 1) linear drift, 2) exponential decrease (due to bleaching during the measurements), 3) stochastic Gaussian noise, and 4) uncertainty in the exact time point of the onset of fluorescence recovery. In order to fit the resulting stochastic model to data from FRAP measurements and to estimate all unknown model parameters, we apply a suitably adapted Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In this way, a more accurate estimation of the diffusion coefficient of the fluorophore is achieved. The method was tested on data obtained from FRAP measurements on a cultivated biofilm.\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEDiffusion and mass transport in biofilms is presumed to play an important role in the resistance against antimicrobial agents and the secretion thereof. FRAP measurements give insight into these transport processes. In this article, the authors expand the standard FRAP model by a blackbox part which addresses some artifacts commonly observed in the measurements. This is done in order to improve the estimations of diffusion coefficients considerably, aiming at a more comprehensive description of diffusion processes inside the biofilm. We expect that the methods are transferable to FRAP measurements on materials other than biofilms.",

SYNE21 mRNA uses an alternative transcription start site and encodes an N-terminal deleted 62 kDa nesprin-21 isoform, which can act as a dominant-negative on nuclear-cytoskeleton connectivity. Western blot and qPCR assays confirmed that AF risk alleles of both SNPs were associated with lower expression of nesprin-21 in human LAA tissues. Reporter gene transfections demonstrated that the risk vs. reference alleles of rs1152591 and rs1152595 had decreased enhancer activity. SYNE2 siRNA knockdown (KD) or nesprin-21 overexpression studies in human stem cell-derived induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) resulted in ~12.5 % increases in the nuclear area compared to controls (p<0.001). Atomic force microscopy demonstrated that SYNE2 KD or nesprin-21 overexpression led to 57.5% or 33.2% decreases, respectively, in nuclear stiffness compared to controls (p< 0.0001).\\n\\nConclusionsAF-associated SNPs rs1152591 and rs1152595 downregulate the expression of SYNE21, increasing nuclear-cytoskeletal connectivity and nuclear stiffness.

Generally, Mav infection is treated with 2-3 antimicrobial drugs for at least 12 months. Identification of genes essential for Mav growth may yield novel strategies for improving curative therapy. We have generated saturating genome-wide transposon mutant pools in a commonly used laboratory strain of Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAC109) and developed a computational technique for classifying annotated genomic features as essential (ES), growth defect (GD), growth advantage (GA), or no-effect (NE) based on the in vitro effect of disruption by transposon. We identified 270 features as ES with 230 of these overlapping with ES features in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These results may be useful for identifying drug targets or for informing studies requiring genetic manipulation of Mycobacterium avium, which should seek to avoid disrupting ES features to ensure bacterial viability.\\n\\nImportanceMycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis is an emerging cause of morbidity in vulnerable populations in many countries. It is known to be particularly difficult to treat, often requiring years of antibiotic therapy.

    "abstract": "Bacterial genomes harbor cryptic prophages that have lost genes required for induction, excision from host chromosomes, or production of phage progeny. Escherichia coli K12 strains contain a cryptic prophage Qin that encodes a small RNA, DicF, and small protein, DicB, that have been implicated in control of bacterial metabolism and cell division. Since DicB and DicF are encoded in the Qin immunity region, we tested whether these gene products could protect the E. coli host from bacteriophage infection. Transient expression of the dicBF operon yielded cells that were ~100-fold more resistant to infection by {lambda} phage than control cells, and the phenotype was DicB-dependent. DicB specifically inhibited infection by {lambda} and other phages that use ManYZ membrane proteins for cytoplasmic entry of phage DNA. In addition to blocking ManYZ-dependent phage infection, DicB also inhibited the canonical sugar transport activity of ManYZ. Previous studies demonstrated that DicB interacts with MinC, an FtsZ polymerization inhibitor, causing MinC localization to mid-cell and preventing Z ring formation and cell division. In strains producing mutant MinC proteins that do not interact with DicB, both DicB-dependent phenotypes involving ManYZ were lost. These results suggest that DicB is a pleiotropic regulator of bacterial physiology and cell division, and that these effects are mediated by a key molecular interaction with the cell division protein MinC.\\n\\nImportanceTemperate bacteriophages can integrate their genomes into the bacterial host chromosome and exist as prophages whose gene products play key roles in bacterial fitness and interactions with eukaryotic host organisms. Most bacterial chromosomes contain \\\"cryptic\\\" prophages that have lost genes required for production of phage progeny but retain genes of unknown function that may be important for regulating bacterial host physiology. This study provides such an example - where a cryptic prophage-encoded product can perform multiple roles in the bacterial host and influence processes including metabolism, cell division, and susceptibility to phage infection. Further functional characterization of cryptic prophage-encoded functions will shed new light on host-phage interactions and their cellular physiological implications.",

    "abstract": "Faithful duplication of genomic DNA relies not only on the fidelity of DNA replication itself, but also on fully functional DNA repair and homologous recombination machinery. We report a molecular mechanism responsible for deciding homologous recombinational repair pathways during replication dictated by binding of RecO and RecG to SSB in E.coli. Using a RecG-yfp fusion protein, we found that RecG-yfp foci appeared only in the {Delta}recG, {Delta}recO and {Delta}recA, {Delta}recO double mutants. Surprisingly, foci were not observed in wild-type {Delta}recG, or double mutants where recG and either recF or, separately recR were deleted. In addition, formation of RecG-yfp foci in the {Delta}recO::kanR required wildtype ssb, as ssb-113 could not substitute. This suggests that RecG and RecO binding to SSB is competitive. We also found that the UV resistance of recO alone mutant increased to certain extent by supplementing RecG. In an ssb-113 mutant, RecO and RecG worked following a different pattern. Both RecO and RecG were able to participate in repairing UV damages when grown at permissive temperature, while they could also be involved in making DNA double strand breaks when grown at nonpermissive temperature. So, our results suggested that differential binding of RecG and RecO to SSB in a DNA replication fork in Escherichia coli.may be involved in determining whether the SDSA or DSBR pathway of homologous recombinational repair is used.\\n\\nAuthor summarySingle strand DNA binding proteins (SSB) stabilize DNA holoenzyme and prevent single strand DNA from folding into non-B DNA structures in a DNA replication fork. It has also been revealed that SSB can also act as a platform for some proteins working in DNA repair and recombination to access DNA molecules when DNA replication fork needs to be reestablished. In Escherichia coli, several proteins working primarily in DNA repair and recombination were found to participate in DNA replication fork resumption by physically interacting with SSB, including RecO and RecG etc. However the hierarchy of these proteins interacting with SSB in Escherichia coli has not been well defined. In this study, we demonstrated a differential binding of RecO and RecG to SSB in DNA replication was used to establish a RecO-dependent pathway of replication fork repair by abolishing a RecG-dependent replication fork repair. We also show that, RecG and RecO could randomly participate in DNA replication repair in the absence of a functional SSB, which may be responsible for the generation of DNA double strand breaks in an ssb-113 mutant in Escherichia coli.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained for object recognition have been widely used to account for visually-driven neural responses in both the human and primate brains. However, because of the generality and complexity of the task of object classification, it is often difficult to make precise inferences about neural information processing using CNN representations from object classification despite the fact that these representations are effective for predicting brain activity. To better understand underlying the nature of the visual features encoded in different brain regions of the human brain, we predicted brain responses to images using fine-grained representations drawn from 19 specific computer vision tasks. Individual encoding models for each task were constructed and then applied to BOLD5000--a large-scale dataset comprised of fMRI scans collected while observers viewed over 5000 naturalistic scene and object images. Because different encoding models predict activity in different brain regions, we were able to associate specific vision tasks with each region. For example, within scene-selective brain regions, features from 3D tasks such as 3D keypoints and 3D edges explain greater variance as compared to 2D tasks--a pattern that replicates across the whole brain. Using results across all 19 task representations, we constructed a \\\"task graph\\\" based on the spatial layout of well-predicted brain areas from each task. We then compared the brain-derived task structure with the task structure derived from transfer learning accuracy in order to assess the degree of shared information between the two task spaces. These computationally-driven results--arising out of state-of-the-art computer vision methods--begin to reveal the task-specific architecture of the human visual system.",

To avoid unfavorable conditions, plants have evolved safeguard mechanisms for seed germination. Here, we report a novel function of the Arabidopsis MADS-box transcription factor ARABIDOPSIS NITRATE REGULATED 1 (ANR1) in seed germination. ANR1 knockout mutant is insensitive to ABA, salt, and osmotic stress during the seed germination and early seedling development stages, whereas ANR1-overexpressing lines are hypersensitive. ANR1 is responsive to ABA and abiotic stresses and upregulates the expression of ABI3 to suppress seed germination. ANR1 and ABI3 have similar expression pattern during seed germination. Genetically, ABI3 acts downstream of ANR1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and yeast-one-hybrid assays showed that ANR1 could bind to the ABI3 promoter to regulate its expression. In addition, ANR1 acts synergistically with AGL21 to suppress seed germination in response to ABA as evidenced by anr1 agl21 double mutant. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the ANR1 plays an important role in regulating seed germination and early post-germination growth. ANR1 and AGL21 together constitutes a safeguard mechanism for seed germination to avoid unfavorable conditions.",

Though durable remissions are possible, MM is considered incurable, with relapse occurring in almost all patients. There has been limited data reported on the lipid metabolism changes in plasma cells during MM progression. Here, we evaluated the feasibility of concurrent lipidomics and proteomics analyses from patient plasma cells, and report these data on a limited number of patient samples, demonstrating the feasibility of the method, and establishing hypotheses to be evaluated in the future.\n\nMethodsPlasma cells were purified from fresh bone marrow aspirates using CD138 microbeads. Proteins and lipids were extracted using a bi-phasic solvent system with methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether, and water. Untargeted proteomics, untargeted and targeted lipidomics were performed on 7 patient samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two comparisons were conducted: high versus low risk; relapse versus newly diagnosed. Proteins and pathways enriched in the relapsed group was compared to a public transcriptomic dataset from Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium reference collection (n=222) at gene and pathways level.\n\nResultsFrom one million purified plasma cells, we were able to extract material and complete untargeted ([~]6000 and [~]3600 features in positive and negative mode respectively) and targeted lipidomics (313 lipids), as well as untargeted proteomics analysis ([~]4100 reviewed proteins). Comparative analyses revealed limited differences between high and low risk groups (according to the standard clinical criteria), hence we focused on drawing comparisons between the relapsed and newly diagnosed patients. Untargeted and targeted lipidomics indicated significant down-regulation of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in relapsed MM. Although there was limited overlap of the differential proteins/transcripts, 76 significantly enriched pathways in relapsed MM were common between proteomics and transcriptomics data. Further evaluation of transcriptomics data for lipid metabolism network revealed enriched correlation of PC, ceramide, cardiolipin, arachidonic acid and cholesterol metabolism pathways to be exclusively correlated among relapsed but not in newly-diagnosed patients.\n\nConclusionsThis study establishes the feasibility and workflow to conduct integrated lipidomics and proteomics analyses on patient-derived plasma cells.

    "abstract": "In vivo laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has previously been used to quantify blood perfusion accurately at a single timepoint in the murine tibial metaphysis. However, this procedure entailed substantial disruption to soft tissues overlying the bone and caused notable localized inflammation for several weeks after the procedure, impeding serial measurements in the same mouse. In this study, we tested a less invasive technique to measure perfusion in the tibia with LDF and validated that it can be used serially in the same mouse without causing inflammation or gait perturbations. Twenty 14-week-old C57Bl/6J mice were evenly divided into groups that either had daily treadmill exercise or remained sedentary. Within these activity groups, mice were evenly subdivided into groups that received LDF measurements either weekly or only once at the study endpoint. Bone perfusion was measured with LDF in the anteromedial region of the right tibial metaphysis. Serum concentrations of interleukin 6, incision site wound area, and interlimb coordination during gait were measured weekly for four weeks. Tibial perfusion did not differ significantly between exercise and sedentary groups within the weekly or endpoint-only LDF groups at any timepoint. Perfusion was significantly increased in the third week in the weekly LDF group relative to measurements in the second and fourth weeks. Ligation of the femoral artery caused consistent, rapid reductions in tibial perfusion, validating that LDF is sensitive to changes in tibial blood supply. Weekly LDF procedures did not adversely affect gait, as interlimb coordination during treadmill locomotion was similar between weekly and endpoint-only LDF groups at every timepoint. Images of the incision site show wound closure within one week, and serum concentrations of interleukin 6 were not significantly different between weekly and endpoint-only groups. Together, these findings demonstrate that our minimally invasive LDF technique can be used for serial in vivo measurements of intraosseous blood perfusion without inducing localized inflammation or negatively affecting gait patterns in mice.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIModified, minimally invasive laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) technique was validated for serial measures of tibial perfusion in mice.\\nC_LIO_LIWeekly LDF procedures did not induce inflammation or alter gait patterns that could confound metrics of interest in bone studies.\\nC_LIO_LILigation of the femoral artery confirmed the LDF technique measures functional perfusion within the bone.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We report for first time about tropical seagrass meadows association with mangrove ecosystems and its effect on seagrass population dynamics off India in Andaman Sea. Two sites of Neil island, i.e. site 1, associated with mangroves and site 2 without mangroves were selected. Quadrat sampling (n=5) were used to collect sediment and seagrass samples. Reconstruction techniques were used to derive population age structure. T. hemprichii population was found mostly with sandy substrate at both sites, with silt consisting very low fraction at site 1. Density, biomass, productivity and morphometric features of T. hemprichii were significantly higher at site1. Reproductive density was higher at site 1, whereas reproductive effort to produce fruits were higher at site 2. The rhizome (vertical+ horizontal) production rates were higher at site 1 and the vertical elongation rate was higher at site 2. Plastochrome interval for site1 and 2 were 25.49 and 26.80 days respectively leading to formation of 14.31 and 13.62 leaves per year. T. hemprichii population at site 1 had four years of longevity and higher younger plants compared to site 2. The long-term average recruitment and present recruitment rate were higher at site 1 compared to site 2, resulting in steady state growth of the overall population at site 1. Higher number of younger plants suggests fitness of the T. hemprichii population at site 1, which increases the ecological significance of mangrove ecosystems have on seagrass population dynamics. This association should be considered for better management and conservation practices of coastal seascapes under global change scenarios.",

    "abstract": "C. elegans consumes bacteria which can supply essential vitamins and cofactors especially for mitochondrial functions ancestrally related to bacteria. Therefore, we screened the Keio E. coli knockout library for mutations that induce a C. elegans mitochondrial damage response gene. We identified 45 E. coli mutations that induce a the C. elegans hsp-6::gfp response gene. Surprisingly, four of these E. coli mutations that disrupt the import or removal of iron from the bacterial siderophore enterobactin were lethal in combination with C. elegans mutations that disrupt particular iron-sulfur proteins of the electron transport chain. Bacterial mutations that fail to synthesize enterobactin are not synthetic lethal with these C. elegans mitochondrial mutants; it is the enterobactin-iron complex that is lethal in combination with the C. elegans mitochondrial mutations. Antioxidants suppress this inviability, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by the mutant mitochondria in combination with the bacterial enterobactin-iron complex.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe animal mitochondrion has a bacterial origin and continues to have a dialogue with the bacterial metabolisms of their microbiome. We identified 45 E. coli gene disruptions that induce a C. elegans mitochondrial damage response gene. Four of these E. coli mutations that disrupt the import or retrieval of iron from the siderophore enterobactin were synthetic lethal with C. elegans mitochondrial mutants. Antioxidants strongly suppressed the inviability of C. elegans mitochondrial mutants grown on the E. coli enterobactin siderophore utilization or import mutants. We hypothesize that reactive oxygen species are produced by C. elegans mitochondrial mutations and that this non-lethal ROS triggers ferric-chelated enterobactin to induce dramatically increased ROS, which leads to lethality.",

    "abstract": "The explosion of microbial genome sequences in public databases allows for large-scale population genomic studies of bacterial species, such as Escherichia coli. In this study, we examine and classify more than one hundred thousand E. coli and Shigella genomes. After removing outliers, a semi-automated Mash-based analysis of 10,667 assembled genomes reveals 14 distinct phylogroups. A representative genome or medoid identified for each phylogroup serves as a proxy to classify more than 95,000 unassembled genomes. This analysis shows that most sequenced E. coli genomes belong to 4 phylogroups (A, C, B1 and E2(O157)). Authenticity of the 14 phylogroups described is supported by pangenomic and phylogenetic analyses, which show differences in gene preservation between phylogroups. A phylogenetic tree constructed with 2,613 single copy core genes along with a matrix of phylogenetic profiles is used to confirm that the 14 phylogroups change at different rates of gene gain/loss/duplication. The methodology used in this work is able to identify previously uncharacterized phylogroups in E. coli species. Some of these new phylogroups harbor clonal strains that have undergone a process of genomic adaptation to the acquisition of new genomic elements related to virulence or antibiotic resistance. This is, to our knowledge, the largest E. coli genome dataset analyzed to date and provides valuable insights into the population structure of the species.",

    "abstract": "Patient suffering of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) often complain that subjective time seems to  drag with respect to physical time. This may point towards a generalized dysfunction of temporal processing in MDD. In the present study, we investigated temporal preparation in MDD. \\\"Temporal preparation\\\" refers to an increased readiness to act before an expected event; consequently, reaction time should be reduced. MDD patients and age-matched controls were required to make a saccadic eye movement between a central and an eccentric visual target after a variable duration preparatory period. We found that MDD patients produced a larger number of premature saccades, saccades initiated prior to the appearance of the expected stimulus. These saccades were not temporally controlled; instead, they seemed to reflect increased oculomotor impulsivity. In contrast, the latency of visually-guided saccades was strongly influenced by temporal preparation in controls; significantly less so, in MDD patients. This observed reduced temporal preparation in MDD was associated with a faster decay of short-term temporal memory. Moreover, in patients producing a lot of premature responses, temporal preparation to early imperative stimuli was increased. A reduction in premature saccades, however, was associated with reduced temporal preparation to late imperative stimuli.\\n\\nIn conclusion, reduced temporal preparation and short-term temporal memory in the oculomotor domain supports the hypothesis that temporal processing was altered in MDD patients. These observed deficits could reflect other underlying aspects of abnormal time experience in MDD.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchy is a candidate organizing principle of ethology, where actions grouped into higher order chunks combine in specific ways to generate adaptive behavior. However, demonstrations of hierarchical organization in behavior have been scarce. Moreover, it remains unclear how such underlying organization allows for behavioral flexibility. Here we uncover the hierarchical and flexible nature of Caenorhabditis elegans behavior. By describing worm locomotion as a sequence of discrete postural templates, we identified chunks containing mutually substitutable postures along the dynamics. We then elucidated the rules governing their interactions. We found that stereotypical roaming can be described by a specific sequence of postural chunks, which exhibit flexibility at the lowest postural level. The same chunks get combined differently to produce dwelling, capturing non-stereotypical actions across timescales. We show that worm foraging is organized hierarchically --a feature not explainable via Markovian dynamics--, and derive a context-free grammar governing its behavior --which is different than a regular grammar, or a hidden Markov chain. In sum, in making the analogy with human language concrete (but not literal) our work demonstrates, in line with the foundational insights of classical ethologists, that spontaneous behavior is orderly flexible. Once more, investigating the humble nematode suggests that everything human has its roots in lower animal behavior.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/708891v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (25K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@168e648org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e6b2eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ed3ecdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b60741_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\\n\\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "The percentage of MDSC population in peripheral blood is significantly increased in lung cancer patients. The accumulation of MDSC contributes to the development of a tumour-associated immune suppressive environment. But the mechanism mediating MDSC accumulation in lung cancer patients is elusive. We found that exosomes from Lewis lung cancer cells (LLC-Exo) can be taken up by the mice bone marrow cells and then promote MDSC expansion, which enhance tumour growth. Mechanistically, during the induction of MDSC from the bone marrow cells, miR-21a from LLC-Exo can stimulate BM cells to produce more IL-6 by inhibiting pdcd4 expression post-transcriptionally. Autocrine IL-6 induces tyrosine 705(Y705) of STAT3 to be phosphorylated during MDSC expansion. LLC-Exo with miR-21a deletion lost its ability to stimulate IL-6 production, STAT3 activation and MDSC expansion. These results demonstrate that lung cancer cell-derived exosomes promote functional MDSC expansion through activation of miR-21a/PDCD4/IL-6/STAT3 pathway.",

    "abstract": "White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is a legume that produces seeds recognized for their high protein content and good nutritional value (lowest glycemic index of all grains, high dietary fiber content, and zero gluten or starch)1-5. White lupin can form nitrogen-fixing nodules but has lost the ability to form mycorrhizal symbiosis with fungi6. Nevertheless, its root system is well adapted to poor soils: it produces cluster roots, constituted of dozens of determinate lateral roots that improve soil exploration and phosphate remobilization7. As phosphate is a limited resource that comes from rock reserves8, the production of cluster roots is a trait of interest to improve fertilizers efficiency. Using long reads sequencing technologies, we provide a high-quality genome sequence of a modern variety of white lupin (2n=50, 451 Mb), as well as de novo assemblies of a landrace and a wild relative. We describe how domestication impacted soil exploration capacity through the early establishment of lateral and cluster roots. We identify the APETALA2 transcription factor LaPUCHI-1, homolog of the Arabidopsis morphogenesis coordinator9, as a potential regulator of this trait. Our high-quality genome and companion genomic and transcriptomic resources enable the development of modern breeding strategies to increase and stabilize yield and to develop new varieties with reduced allergenic properties (caused by conglutins10), which would favor the deployment of this promising culture.",

    "abstract": "Honey and ghee is an important constituent of our diet. Honey contain about 200 components in its which play an important role as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, wound healing and sunburn, etc. Ghee has also many essential constituents such as phospholipids, PUFA, fat- soluble vitamins, etc. It is mention in Charak Samhita that equal ratio of honey and ghee when taken in food become toxic to health. This study was designed to explore the mechanism of toxicity through the biochemical and histological parameter. For this study, 24 Charles foster rats were taken and divided into four groups (n=6) normal, honey, ghee, and honey+ghee (1:1). After 60 days rats were sacrificed. Weight loss, Hair loss and red patches on ear were found on honey+ghee fed rats. LFT, amadori test, AGE, UV, glucose, DPP-4 and LPO were found significantly increased in honey+ghee group. SOD, Catalase, GSH, ABTS+, GLP-1, GIP-1, ACB and HB were found significantly decreased in honey+ghee group. No changes were found in RFT. H&E show normal morphology in kidney, intestine, and pancreas but mild inflammation was found in liver tissue. We conclude that the equal mixture of honey and ghee shows toxic effect. Increased formation of hydroxymethyl furfural, amadori product, DPP-4 activity and low incretins (GLP-1, GIP-1) activity resulting high postprandial hyperglycemic response are collectively responsible for oxidative stress-mediated toxicity of the mixture of honey and ghee in equal ratio.",

    "abstract": "Most of the energy fluxes supporting animal performance flow through mitochondria. Hence, inter-individual differences in performance might be rooted in inter-individual variations in mitochondrial function and density. Furthermore, because the energy required by an individual often changes across life stages, mitochondrial function and density are also expected to show within-individual variation (i.e. plasticity). No study so far has repeatedly measured mitochondrial function and density in the same individuals to simultaneously test for within-individual repeatability and plasticity of mitochondrial traits. Here, we repeatedly measured mitochondrial DNA copy number (a proxy of density) and respiration rates from blood cells of female pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) at the incubation and chick-rearing stages. Mitochondrial density and respiration rates were all repeatable (R = [0.45-0.80]), indicating high within-individual consistency in mitochondrial traits across life-history stages. Mitochondrial traits were also plastic, showing a quick (i.e. 10 days) down-regulation from incubation to chick-rearing in mitochondrial density, respiratory activity, and cellular regulation by endogenous substrates and/or ATP demand. These downregulations were partially compensated by an increase in mitochondrial efficiency at the chick-rearing stage. Therefore, our study provides clear evidence for both short-term plasticity and high within-individual consistency in mitochondrial function and density during reproduction in a wild bird species.",

    "abstract": "Frigid temperatures of the Southern Ocean are known to be an evolutionary driver in Antarctic fish. For example, many fish have reduced red blood cell (RBC) concentration to minimize vascular resistance. Via the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin, RBCs contain the vast majority of the bodys iron, which is known to be a limiting nutrient in marine ecosystems. Since lower RBC levels also lead to reduced iron requirements, we hypothesized that low iron availability was an additional evolutionary driver of Antarctic fish speciation. Antarctic Icefish of the family Channichthyidae are known to have extreme alteration of iron metabolism due to loss of two iron-binding proteins, hemoglobin and myoglobin, and no RBCs. Loss of hemoglobin is considered a maladaptive trait allowed by relaxation of predator selection, since extreme adaptations are required to compensate for the loss of oxygen-carrying capacity. However, iron dependency minimization may have driven hemoglobin loss instead of a random evolutionary event. Given the variety of functions that hemoglobin serves in the endothelium, we suspected the protein corresponding to the 3 truncated Hb fragment (Hb-3f) that was not genetically excluded by icefish, may still be expressed as a protein. Using whole mount confocal microscopy, we show that Hb-3f is expressed in the vascular endothelium of icefish retina, suggesting this Hb fragment may still serve an important role in the endothelium. These observations support a novel hypothesis that iron minimization could have influenced icefish speciation with the loss of the iron-binding portion of Hb in Hb-3f, as well as hemoglobin {beta} and myoglobin.",

    "abstract": "Model based methods for genetic clustering of individuals such as those implemented in structure or ADMIXTURE allow to infer individual ancestries and study population structure. The underlying model makes several assumptions about the demographic history that shaped the analysed genetic data. One assumption is that all individuals are a result of K homogeneous ancestral populations that are all well represented in the data, while another assumption is that no drift happened after the admixture event. The histories of many real world populations do not conform to that model, and in that case taking the inferred admixture proportions at face value might be misleading. We propose a method to evaluate the fit of admixture models based on estimating the correlation of the residual difference between the true genotypes and the genotypes predicted by the model. When the model assumptions are not violated, the residuals from a pair of individuals are not correlated. In case of a bad fit, individuals with similar demographic histories have a positive correlation of their residuals. Using simulated and real data, we show how the method is able to detect a bad fit of inferred admixture proportions due to using an insufficient number of clusters K or to demographic histories that deviate significantly from the admixture model assumptions, such as admixture from ghost populations, drift after admixture events and non-discrete ancestral populations. We have implemented the method as an open source software that can be applied to both unphased genotypes and next generation sequencing data.",

Early diagnosis has proven to greatly increase the chances of slowing down the diseases progression.

Unfortunately, many contemporary machine learning techniques fail to reveal details about how they reach their conclusions, a property considered fundamental when providing a diagnosis. This is one reason why we introduce our Personalisable Clinical Decision Support System PECLIDES that provides a clear insight into the decision making process on top of the diagnosis. Our algorithm enriches the fundamental work of Masheyekhi and Gras in data integration, personal medicine, usability, visualisation and interactivity.\\n\\nOur decision support system is an operation of translational medicine. It is based on random forests, is personalisable and allows a clear insight into the decision making process. A well-structured rule set is created and every rule of the decision making process can be observed by the user (physician). Furthermore, the user has an impact on the creation of the final rule set and the algorithm allows the comparison of different diseases as well as regional differences in the same disease1.",

For this purpose, the intrinsic TatB activity of isolated pea thylakoids was inhibited by affinity-purified antibodies and substituted by supplementing the assays with TatB protein either obtained by in vitro translation or purified after heterologous expression in E. coli. Tat transport activity of such reconstituted thylakoids, which was analyzed with the authentic Tat substrate pOEC16, reached routinely 20 - 25% of the activity of mock-treated thylakoid vesicles analysed in parallel. In contrast, supplementation of the assays with the purified antigen comprising all but the N-terminal transmembrane helix of thylakoidal TatB did not result in Tat transport reconstitution which confirms that transport relies strictly on the activity of the TatB protein added and is not due to restoration of the intrinsic TatB activity by antibody release. Unexpectedly, even a mutant TatB protein (TatB,E10C) assumed to be incapable of assembling into the TatBC receptor complex showed low but considerable transport reconstitution underlining the sensitivity of the approach and its suitability for further functional mutant analyses. Finally, quantification of TatB demand suggests that TatA and TatB are required in approximately equimolar amounts to achieve Tat-dependent thylakoid transport.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory has been developed primarily under the implicit assumption of an infinite population. We rigorously analyze a standard model for the evolution of cooperation (the multi-player snowdrift game) and show that in many situations in which there is a cooperative evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) if the population is infinite, there is no cooperative ESS if the population is finite (no matter how large). In these cases, contributing nothing is a globally convergently stable finite-population ESS, implying that apparent evolution of cooperation in such games is an artifact of the infinite population approximation. The key issue is that if the size of groups that play the game exceeds a critical proportion of the population then the infinite-population approximation predicts the wrong evolutionary outcome (in addition, the critical proportion itself depends on the population size). Our results are robust to the underlying selection process.",

    "abstract": "The use of animal infection models is essential to understand microbial pathogenesis and to develop and test treatments. Insects, and 2D and 3D tissue models are increasingly being used as surrogate for mammalian models. However, there are concerns whether these models recapitulate the complexity of host-pathogen interactions. Here, we developed the ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model of infection using porcine lungs to investigate Klebsiella pneumoniae-triggered pneumonia as model of respiratory infections. The porcine EVLP model recapitulates features of K. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia lung injury. This model is also useful to assess the pathogenic potential of K. pneumoniae as we observed that the attenuated Klebsiella capsule mutant strain caused less pathological tissue damage with a concomitant decrease in the bacterial burden compare to lungs infected with the wild type. The porcine EVLP model allows assessment of inflammatory responses following infection; similar to the mouse pneumonia model, we observed an increase of il-10 in the lungs infected with the wild type and an increase of ifn-{gamma} in lungs infected with the capsule mutant. This model also allows monitoring phenotypes at the single-cell level. Wild-type K. pneumoniae skews macrophages towards an M2-like state. In vitro experiments probing pig bone marrow-derived macrophages uncovered the role of the M2 transcriptional factor STAT6, and that Klebsiella-induced il10 expression is controlled by p38 and ERK. Klebsiella-induced macrophage polarization is dependent on the capsule. Altogether, this study support the utility of the EVLP model using pig lungs as platform to investigate the infection biology of respiratory pathogens.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEThe implementation of infection models that approximate human disease is essential to understand infections and for testing new therapies before they enter into clinical stages. Rodents are used in most of pre-clinical studies, although the differences between mouse and man have fuelled the conclusion that murine studies are unreliable predictors of human outcomes. Here, we have developed a whole lung porcine model of infection using the established ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) system established to re-condition human lungs for transplant. As a proof-of-principle, we provide evidence demonstrating that infection of the porcine EVLP with the human pathogen K. pneumoniae recapitulates the known features of Klebsiella-triggered pneumonia. Moreover, our data revealed the porcine EVLP model is useful to reveal features of the virulence of K. pneumoniae including the manipulation of immune cells. Altogether, this study supports the utility of the EVLP model using pig lungs as surrogate host for assessing respiratory infections.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-tolerant persister bacteria involve frequent treatment failures, relapsing infections and the need for extended antibiotic treatment. Taking persisters into account in susceptibility assays is thus an essential success factor in antibacterial drug discovery. The virulence of the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae is tightly linked to its propensity for persistence, but current susceptibility screening on this gram-negative respiratory pathogen relies on permissive epithelial cells. To establish an improved antichlamydial susceptibility assay allowing the analysis of both actively growing and persister bacteria, we studied C. pneumoniae clinical isolate CV-6 infection kinetics in THP-1 macrophages by qPCR and quantitative culture. Indicated by the steady increase of chlamydial genome copy numbers and infectious progeny as well as the failure of azithromycin to eradicate the intracellular forms of the bacterium, the macrophages were found to harbor a subpopulation of persister C. pneumoniae cells. The potential of the assay for the discovery of anti-persister molecules against intracellular bacteria was demonstrated by the identification of the differential effects of two dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans on C. pneumoniae infection. While schisandrin reverted C. pneumoniae persistence and promoted productive infection, schisandrin C was superior to azithromycin in eradicating the C. pneumoniae infection. The phenotypic switch was associated with the suppression of cellular glutathione pools, implying that targeting glutathione homeostasis may provide a novel means for intracellular bacteria resuscitation. In conclusion, these data highlight the value of macrophages over permissive cell lines in anti-persister agent discovery on intracellular bacteria and targeting host cell redox status to fight persistent infections.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the world. However due to a changing legal landscape, and rising interest in therapeutic utility, there is an increasing trend in (long-term) use and possibly, cannabis impairment. Importantly, a growing body of evidence suggests regular cannabis users develop tolerance to the impairing, as well as the rewarding, effects of the drug. However, the neuroadaptations that may underlie cannabis tolerance remain unclear. Therefore, this double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over study assessed the acute influence of cannabis on brain and behavioral outcomes in two distinct cannabis user groups. Twelve occasional (OUs) and 12 chronic (CUs) cannabis users received acute doses of cannabis (300 g/kg THC) and placebo, and underwent ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In OUs, cannabis induced significant neurometabolic alterations in reward circuitry, namely decrements in functional connectivity and increments in striatal glutamate concentrations, which were associated with increases in subjective high and decreases in performance on a sustained attention task. Such changes were absent in CUs. The finding that cannabis altered circuitry and distorted behavior in OUs, but not CUs, suggests reduced responsiveness of the reward circuitry to cannabis intoxication in chronic users Taken together, the results suggest a pharmacodynamic mechanism for the development of tolerance to cannabis impairment.",

    "abstract": "Early cortical processing of visual information has long been investigated by describing the response properties such as receptive fields or orientation selectivity of individual neurons to moving gratings. However, thanks to recent technological advances, it has been become easier to record from larger neuronal populations which allow us to analyse the population responses to probe visual information processing at the population level. In the end, it is unlikely that sensory processing is a single-neuron effort but that of an entire population. Here we show how different stimulus types evoke distinct binary activity patterns (words) of simultaneous events on different sites in the anaesthetised mouse. Spontaneous activity and natural scenes indicated lower word distribution divergences than each to drifting gratings. Accounting for firing rate differences, spontaneous activity was linked to more unique patterns than stimulus-driven responses. Multidimensional scaling conveyed that pattern probability distributions clustered for spatial frequencies but not for directions. Further, drifting gratings modulated the Shannon entropy estimated on spatial patterns in a similar fashion as classical directional and spatial frequency tuning functions of neurons. This was supported by a distinct sublinear relationship between Shannon entropy and mean population firing rate.",

    "abstract": "Predicting phenology is essential for adapting varieties to different environmental conditions and for crop management. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how well different crop modeling groups can predict phenology. Multiple evaluation studies have been previously published, but it is still difficult to generalize the findings from such studies since they often test some specific aspect of extrapolation to new conditions, or do not test on data that is truly independent of the data used for calibration. In this study, we analyzed the prediction of wheat phenology in Northern France under observed weather and current management, which is a problem of practical importance for wheat management. The results of 27 modeling groups are evaluated, where modeling group encompasses model structure, i.e. the model equations, the calibration method and the values of those parameters not affected by calibration. The data for calibration and evaluation are sampled from the same target population, thus extrapolation is limited. The calibration and evaluation data have neither year nor site in common, to guarantee rigorous evaluation of prediction for new weather and sites. The best modeling groups, and also the mean and median of the simulations, have a mean absolute error (MAE) of about 3 days, which is comparable to the measurement error. Almost all models do better than using average number of days or average sum of degree days to predict phenology. On the other hand, there are important differences between modeling groups, due to model structural differences and to differences between groups using the same model structure, which emphasizes that model structure alone does not completely determine prediction accuracy. In addition to providing information for our specific environments and varieties, these results are a useful contribution to a knowledge base of how well modeling groups can predict phenology, when provided with calibration data from the target population.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) are highly specialized across vascular beds. However, given their interspersed anatomic distribution, comprehensive characterization of the molecular basis for this heterogeneity in vivo has been limited. By applying endothelial-specific translating ribosome affinity purification (EC-TRAP) combined with high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis, we identified pan EC-enriched genes and tissue-specific EC transcripts, which include both established markers and genes previously unappreciated for their presence in ECs. In addition, EC-TRAP limits changes in gene expression following EC isolation and in vitro expansion, as well as rapid vascular bed-specific shifts in EC gene expression profiles as a result of the enzymatic tissue dissociation required to generate single cell suspensions for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or single cell RNA sequencing analysis. Comparison of our EC-TRAP to published single cell RNA sequencing data further demonstrates considerably greater sensitivity of EC-TRAP for the detection of low abundant transcripts. Application of EC-TRAP to examine the in vivo host response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed the induction of gene expression programs associated with a native defense response, with marked differences across vascular beds. Furthermore, comparative analysis of whole tissue and TRAP-selected mRNAs identified LPS-induced differences that would not have been detected by whole tissue analysis alone. Together, these data provide a resource for the analysis of EC-specific gene expression programs across heterogeneous vascular beds under both physiologic and pathologic conditions.\\n\\nSignificanceEndothelial cells (ECs), which line all vertebrate blood vessels, are highly heterogeneous across different tissues. The present study uses a genetic approach to specifically tag mRNAs within ECs of the mouse, thereby allowing recovery and sequence analysis to evaluate the EC-specific gene expression program directly from intact organs. Our findings demonstrate marked heterogeneity in EC gene expression across different vascular beds under both normal and disease conditions, with a more accurate picture than can be achieved using other methods. The data generated in these studies advance our understanding of EC function in different blood vessels and provide a valuable resource for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Preventing terminal differentiation is important in the development and progression of many cancers including melanoma. Recent identification of the BMP ligand GDF6 as a novel melanoma oncogene showed GDF6-activated BMP signaling suppresses differentiation of melanoma cells. Previous studies have identified roles for GDF6 orthologs during early embryonic and neural crest development, but have not identified direct regulation of melanocyte development by GDF6. Here, we investigate the BMP ligand gdf6a, a zebrafish ortholog of human GDF6, during the development of melanocytes from the neural crest. We establish that the loss of gdf6a or inhibition of BMP signaling during neural crest development disrupts normal pigment cell development, leading to an increase in the number of melanocytes and a corresponding decrease in iridophores, another neural crest-derived pigment cell type in zebrafish. This shift occurs as pigment cells arise from the neural crest and depends on mitfa, an ortholog of MITF, a key regulator of melanocyte development that is also targeted by oncogenic BMP signaling. Together, these results indicate that the oncogenic role ligand-dependent BMP signaling plays in suppressing differentiation in melanoma is a reiteration of its physiological roles during melanocyte development.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveEnteroendocrine cells (EECs) of the gastro-intestinal tract sense gut luminal factors and release peptide hormones or serotonin (5-HT) to coordinate energy uptake and storage. Our goal is to decipher the gene regulatory networks controlling EECs specification from enteroendocrine progenitors. In this context, we studied the role of the transcription factor Rfx6 which had been identified as the cause of Mitchell-Riley syndrome characterized by neonatal diabetes and congenital malabsorptive diarrhea. We previously reported that Rfx6 was essential for pancreatic beta cell development and function, however, the role of Rfx6 in EECs differentiation remained to be elucidated.\\n\\nMethodsWe examined the molecular, cellular and metabolic consequences of constitutive and conditional deletion of Rfx6 in the embryonic and adult mouse intestine. We performed single cell and bulk RNA-Seq to characterize EECs diversity and identify Rfx6-regulated genes.\\n\\nResultsRfx6 is expressed in the gut endoderm; later it is turned on in, and restricted to, enteroendocrine progenitors and persists in hormone-positive EECs. In the embryonic intestine, the constitutive lack of Rfx6 leads to gastric heterotopia, suggesting a role in the maintenance of intestinal identity. In the absence of intestinal Rfx6, EECs differentiation is severely impaired both in the embryo and adult. However, the number of serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells and mucosal 5-HT content are increased. Concomitantly, Neurog3-positive enteroendocrine progenitors accumulate. Combined analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA-Seq data revealed that enteroendocrine progenitors differentiate in two main cell trajectories, the enterochromaffin (EC) cells and the Peptidergic Enteroendocrine (PE) cells, whose differentiation programs are differentially regulated by Rfx6. Rfx6 operates upstream of Arx, Pax6 and Isl1 to trigger the differentiation of peptidergic EECs such as GIP-, GLP-1- or CCK-secreting cells. On the contrary, Rfx6 represses Lmx1a and Tph1, two genes essential for serotonin biosynthesis. Finally, we identified transcriptional changes uncovering adaptive responses to the prolonged lack of enteroendocrine hormones and leading to malabsorption and lower food efficiency ratio in Rfx6-deficient mouse intestine.\\n\\nConclusionThese studies identify Rfx6 as an essential transcriptional regulator of EECs specification and shed light on the molecular mechanisms of intestinal failures in human RFX6-deficiencies such as Mitchell-Riley syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of global trade, hundreds of species have colonized territories outside of their native range. Some of these species proliferate at the expense of native ecosystems, i.e., have become invasive. Invasive species constitute powerful in situ experimental systems to study fast adaptation and directional selection on short ecological timescales. They also present promising case studies for ecological and evolutionary success in novel environments.\\n\\nWe seize this unique opportunity to study genomic substrates for ecological success and adaptability to novel environments in a vertebrate. We report a highly contiguous long-read based genome assembly for the most successful temperate invasive fish, the benthic round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and analyse gene families that may promote its impressive ecological success.\\n\\nOur approach provides novel insights from the large evolutionary scale to the small species-specific scale. We describe expansions in specific cytochrome P450 enzymes, a remarkably diverse innate immune system, an ancient duplication in red light vision accompanied by red skin fluorescence, evolutionary patterns in epigenetic regulators, and the presence of genes that may have contributed to the round gobys capacity to invade cold and salty waters.\\n\\nA recurring theme across all analyzed gene families are gene expansions. This suggests that gene duplications may promote ecological flexibility, superior performance in novel environments, and underlie the impressive colonization success of the round goby. Gobiidae generally feature fascinating adaptations and are excellent colonizers. Further long-read genome approaches across the goby family may reveal whether the ability to conquer new habitats relates more generally to gene copy number expansions.",

    "abstract": "Conservation agencies entrusted with recovery of iconic mammals may exaggerate population trends without adequate scientific evidence. Recently, such populations were termed as  political populations in the conservation literature. We surmise that political populations emerge when agencies are pressured to report abundances at large spatial scales for species that are difficult to survey. Indian tiger conservation agencies use an experimental approach called double-sampling using index-calibration models. A recent, mathematical, study demonstrated the unreliability of this approach in the context of Indias tigers. Yet, this approach continues to be applied and even promoted by global tiger conservation agencies in other tiger range countries. In this article, we aim to: (1) discuss the ecological oddities emerging from results of Indias national tiger surveys, (2) demystify the mathematics underlying the problems of this survey methodology and (3) confront these findings with results from Indias recent national tiger survey of 2014. Our analyses show that the predictions of tiger abundance using sign-based indices reported in the 2014 survey in fact vary greatly and can be severely misleading and confirming the presence of high sampling-based overdispersion and parameter covariance. We call for species conservation initiatives to implement monitoring methods that are designed to clearly answer, a priori, scientific or management objectives instead of potentially implementing them as reactions to extraneous, social or fund raising pressures.",

Overactive SMO signaling is oncogenic and is therefore a clinically established drug target. Here, we establish a nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET)-based ligand binding assay for SMO providing a sensitive and high throughput-compatible addition to the toolbox of GPCR pharmacologists.\\n\\nExperimental ApproachIn the NanoBRET-based binding assay, SMO is N terminally tagged with nanoluciferase (Nluc) and binding of BODIPY-cyclopamine is assessed by quantifying resonance energy transfer between receptor and ligand. The assay allows kinetic analysis of ligand-receptor binding in living HEK293 cells and competition binding experiments using commercially available SMO ligands (SANT-1, cyclopamine-KAAD, SAG1.3 and purmorphamine).\\n\\nKey ResultsThe NanoBRET binding assay for SMO is sensitive and superior to purely fluorescence-based binding assays. BODIPY-cyclopamine showed complex binding parameters suggesting separate binding sites.\\n\\nConclusions and ImplicationsThe NanoBRET ligand binding assay for SMO provides a fast, sensitive and reliable alternative to assess SMO ligand binding. Furthermore, this assay is sufficiently sensitive to dissect a SANT-1-sensitive and a SANT-1-insensitive cyclopamine binding site in the 7TM core, and will be important to further dissect and understand the molecular pharmacology of Class F receptors.\\n\\nWhat is already knownCyclopamine targets SMO as antagonist and fluorescently-labelled cyclopamine has been used for fluorescence-based binding assays for SMO. Structural analysis has suggested two binding sites on SMO, one in the receptor core and one the CRD.\\n\\nWhat this study addsWe established a NanoBRET-based binding assay for SMO with superior sensitivity compared to fluorescence-based assays. This assay allows distinction of two separate binding sites for BODIPY-cyclopamine on SMO in live cells in real time.\\n\\nWhat is the clinical significanceThe assay is a valuable complement for drug discovery efforts and will support a better understanding of Class F GPCR pharmacology.",

Many computational methods produce clone phylogenies from population bulk sequencing data collected from multiple tumor samples. These clone phylogenies are used to infer mutation order and clone origin times during tumor progression, rendering the selection of the appropriate clonal deconvolution method quite critical. Surprisingly, absolute and relative accuracies of these methods in correctly inferring clone phylogenies have not been consistently assessed.\\n\\nMethodsWe evaluated the performance of seven computational methods in producing clone phylogenies for simulated datasets in which clones were sampled from multiple sectors of a primary tumor (multi-region) or primary and metastatic tumors in a patient (multi-site). We assessed the accuracy of tested methods metrics in determining the order of mutations and the branching pattern within the reconstructed clone phylogenies.\\n\\nResultsThe accuracy of the reconstructed mutation order varied extensively among methods (9% - 44% error). Methods also varied significantly in reconstructing the topologies of clone phylogenies, as 24% - 58% of the inferred clone groupings were incorrect. All the tested methods showed limited ability to identify ancestral clone sequences present in tumor samples correctly. The occurrence of multiple seeding events among tumor sites during metastatic tumor evolution hindered deconvolution of clones for all tested methods.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall, CloneFinder, MACHINA, and LICHeE showed the highest overall accuracy, but none of the methods performed well for all simulated datasets and conditions.",

    "abstract": "Variation in the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes is crucial for fighting pathogen assault. Because new alleles confer a selective advantage, MHC should readily introgress between species, even under limited hybridization. Using replicated transects through two hybrid zones between strongly reproductively isolated newts, we demonstrated recent and ongoing MHC introgression. Its extent correlated with the age of contact. In the older zone, MHC similarity between species within transects exceeded that of between transects within species, implying pervasive introgression - a massive exchange of MHC genes, not limited to specific variants. In simulations, the observed pattern emerged under the combined action of balancing selection and hybridization, but not when these processes acted separately. Thus, massive introgression at advanced stages of divergence can introduce novel and restore previously lost MHC variation, boosting the adaptive potential of hybridizing taxa. In consequence, MHC genes may be the last to stop introgressing between incipient species.",

Novel therapeutic concepts are especially desired to target and eliminate resistant AML stem cells. Here we show that AML stem cells harbor the plasticity to switch from a low-cycling, chemotherapy resistant state into an actively proliferating state associated with treatment response. We used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells from patients with high risk or relapsed AML, which were lentivirally transduced for marker expression, stained with the proliferation-sensitive dye Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), and re-transplanted into next-recipient mice. A rare subpopulation of AML cells displayed reduced proliferation in vivo, associated with increased treatment resistance. The proportion of AML cells with stem cell potential was identical in both, the highly and lowly proliferative sub-fraction. In re-transplantation experiments, proliferation behavior proved reversible, and AML stem cells were able to switch between a high and low proliferation state. Our data indicate that AML stem cells display functional plasticity in vivo, which might be exploited for therapeutic purposes, to prevent AML relapse and ultimately improve the prognosis of patients with AML.",

    "abstract": "H3K4me3 is a near-universal histone modification found predominantly at the 5 region of genes, with a well-documented association with gene activity. H3K4me3 has been ascribed roles as both an instructor of gene expression and also a downstream consequence of expression, yet neither has been convincingly proven on a genome-wide scale. Here we test these relationships using a combination of bioinformatics, modelling and experimental data from budding yeast in which the levels of H3K4me3 have been massively ablated. We find that loss of H3K4me3 has no effect on the levels of nascent transcription or transcript in the population. Moreover, we observe no change in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, mRNA export or turnover, or in protein levels, or cell-to-cell variation of mRNA. Loss of H3K4me3 also has no effect on the large changes in gene expression patterns that follow galactose induction. Conversely, loss of RNA polymerase from the nucleus has no effect on the pattern of H3K4me3 deposition and little effect on its levels, despite much larger changes to other chromatin features. Furthermore, large genome-wide changes in transcription, both in response to environmental stress and during metabolic cycling, are not accompanied by corresponding changes in H3K4me3. Thus, despite the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene activity, neither appear to be necessary to maintain levels of the other, nor to influence their changes in response to environmental stimuli. When we compare gene classes with very different levels of H3K4me3 but highly similar transcription levels we find that H3K4me3-marked genes are those whose expression is unresponsive to environmental changes, and that their histones are less acetylated and dynamically turned-over. Constitutive genes are generally well-expressed, which may alone explain the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene expression, while the biological role of H3K4me3 may have more to do with this distinction in gene class.",

In a hypothesis generation setting, choosing an experiment well means choosing an experiment whose results are interesting or novel.

Specifically, we consider the task faced by a scientific consortium such as the National Institutes of Health ENCODE Consortium, whose goal is to characterize all of the functional elements in the human genome. Given a list of possible cell types or tissue types (\\\"biosamples\\\") and a list of possible high throughput sequencing assays, we ask \\\"Which experiments should ENCODE perform next?\\\" We demonstrate how to represent this task as an optimization problem, where the goal is to maximize the information gained in each successive experiment. Compared with previous work that has addressed a similar problem, our approach has the advantage that it can use imputed data to tailor the selected list of experiments based on data collected previously by the consortium. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed method in simulations, and we provide a general software framework, named Kiwano, for selecting genomic and epigenomic experiments.",

Laminar in-vivo multi-electrode array recordings here reveal previously elusive structure in the representation of visual patterns in the mouse visual cortex, with temporo-nasally drifting gratings eliciting consistently highest neuronal responses across cortical layers and columns, whilst upward moving gratings reliably evoked the lowest activities. We suggest this bias in direction selectivity to be behaviourally relevant as objects moving into the visual field from the side or behind may pose a predatory threat to the mouse whereas upward moving objects do not. We found furthermore that direction preference and selectivity was affected by stimulus spatial frequency, and that spatial and directional tuning curves showed high signal correlations decreasing with distance between recording sites. In addition, we show that despite this bias in direction selectivity, it is possible to decode stimulus identity and that spatiotemporal features achieve higher accuracy in the decoding task whereas spike count or population counts are sufficient to decode spatial frequencies implying different encoding strategies.\\n\\nSignificance statementWe show that temporo-nasally drifting gratings (i.e. opposite the normal visual flow during forward movement) reliably elicit the highest neural activity in mouse primary visual cortex, whereas upward moving gratings reliably evoke the lowest responses. This encoding may be highly behaviourally relevant, as objects approaching from the periphery may pose a threat (e.g. predators), whereas upward moving objects do not. This is a result at odds with the belief that mouse primary visual cortex is randomly organised. Further to this biased representation, we show that direction tuning depends on the underlying spatial frequency and that tuning preference is spatially correlated both across layers and columns and decreases with cortical distance, providing evidence for structural organisation in mouse primary visual cortex.",

Here, we report meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies on emotion regulation, or memory control, and link neural commonalities to transcriptional commonalities using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). Based on 95 fMRI studies, we reveal a role of the right inferior parietal lobule embedded in a frontal-parietal-insular network during emotion and memory control, which is similarly recruited during response inhibition. These co-activation patterns also overlap with the networks associated with \"inhibition\", \"cognitive control\", and \"working memory\" when consulting the Neurosynth. Using the AHBA, we demonstrate that emotion and memory control-related brain activity patterns are associated with transcriptional profiles of a specific set of \"inhibition-related\" genes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these \"inhibition-related\" genes reveal associations with the neuronal transmission and risk for major psychiatric disorders as well as seizures and alcoholic dependence. In summary, this study identified a neural network and a set of genes associated with inhibitory control across emotion regulation, memory control. These findings facilitate our understanding of the neurobiological correlates of inhibitory control and may contribute to the development of novel brain stimulation and pharmacological interventions.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a key event in the etiology of AD. We have previously modeled amyloid-beta (A{beta})-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain by expressing human A{beta} peptide specifically in neurons (GRU102). Here, we focus on a deeper analysis of these metabolic changes associated with A{beta}-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Integrating metabolomics, transcriptomics, biochemical studies and computational modeling, we identify alterations in Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle metabolism following even low-level A{beta} expression. In particular, GRU102 show reduced activity of a rate-limiting TCA cycle enzyme, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These defects are associated with elevation of protein carbonyl content specifically in mitochondria. Importantly, metabolic failure occurs before any significant increase in global protein aggregate is detectable. Treatment with an antidiabetes drug, Metformin, reverses A{beta}-induced metabolic defects, reduces protein aggregation and normalizes the lifespan of GRU102. Our results point to metabolic dysfunction as an early and causative event in AD pathology and a promising target for intervention.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of receptive field (RF) properties is fundamental to understanding the neural basis of sensory and cognitive behaviour. The combination of non-invasive imaging, such as fMRI, with biologically inspired neural modeling has enabled the estimation of population RFs directly in humans. However, current approaches require making numerous a priori assumptions, so these cannot reveal unpredicted properties, such as fragmented RFs or subpopulations. This is a critical limitation in studies on adaptation, pathology or reorganization. Here, we introduce micro-probing (MP), a technique for fine-grained and assumption free characterisation of subpopulation RFs. Without specific stimuli or adapted models, MP mapped the bilateral RFs characteristic of observers with a congenital pathway disorder. Moreover, in healthy observers, MP revealed voxels that capture the activity of multiple neuronal subpopulations. Thus, MP provides a versatile framework to visualize, analyze and model, without restrictions, the diverse RFs of cortical subpopulations in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "We recently identified the CDC25A phosphatase as a key actor in proliferation and differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia which expresses the FLT3-ITD mutation. In this paper we demonstrate that CDC25A level is controlled by a complex STAT5/miR-16 transcription and translation pathway working downstream of this receptor. First, we established by CHIP analysis that STAT5 is directly involved in FLT3-ITD-dependent CDC25A gene transcription. In addition, we determined that miR-16 expression is repressed by FLT3-ITD activity, and that STAT5 participates in this repression. In accordance with these results, miR-16 expression was significantly reduced in a panel of AML primary samples carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation when compared with FLT3wt cells. The expression of a miR-16 mimic reduced CDC25A protein and mRNA levels, and RNA interference-mediated down modulation of miR-16 restored CDC25A expression in response to FLT3-ITD inhibition. Finally, decreasing miR-16 expression partially restored the proliferation of cells treated with the FLT3 inhibitor AC220, while the expression of miR-16 mimic stopped this proliferation and induced monocytic differentiation of AML cells. In summary, we identified a FLT3-ITD/STAT5/miR-16/CDC25A axis essential for AML cell proliferation and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Genome stability relies on proper coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis, where dynamic microtubules capture and faithfully segregate chromosomes into daughter cells. The role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in controlling these processes however remains largely unexplored. To identify lncRNAs with mitotic functions, we performed a high-content RNAi imaging screen targeting more than 2,000 human lncRNAs. By investigating major hallmarks of cell division such as chromosome segregation, mitotic duration and cytokinesis, we discovered numerous lncRNAs with functions in each of these processes. The chromatin-associated lncRNA, linc00899, was selected for in-depth studies due to the robust mitotic delay observed upon its depletion. Transcriptome analysis of linc00899-depleted cells together with gain-of-function and rescue experiments across multiple cell types identified the neuronal microtubule-binding protein, TPPP/p25, as a target of linc00899. Linc00899 binds the genomic locus of TPPP/p25 and suppresses its transcription through a cis-acting mechanism. In cells depleted of linc00899, the consequent upregulation of TPPP/p25 alters microtubule dynamics and is necessary and sufficient to delay mitosis. Overall, our comprehensive screen identified several lncRNAs with roles in genome stability and revealed a new lncRNA that controls microtubule behaviour with functional implications beyond cell division.",

    "abstract": "Lexical decision is an important paradigm in studies of visual word recognition yet the underlying mechanisms supporting the activity are not well understood. While most models of visual word recognition focus on orthographic processing as the primary locus of the lexical decision, a number of behavioural studies have suggested a flexible role for semantic processing regulated by the similarity of the nonword foil to real words. Here we developed a computational model that interactively combines visual-orthographic, phonological and semantic processing to perform lexical decisions. Importantly, the model was able to differentiate words from nonwords by dynamically integrating measures of polarity across the key processing layers. The model was more reliant on semantic information when nonword foils were pseudowords as opposed to consonant strings. Moreover, the model was able to capture a range of standard reading effects in lexical decision. Damage to the model also resulted in reading patterns observed in patients with pure alexia, phonological dyslexia, and semantic dementia, demonstrating for the first time that both normal and neurologically-impaired lexical decision can be addressed in a connectionist computational model of reading.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus is delineated by the nuclear envelope (NE), which is a double membrane barrier composed of the inner and outer nuclear membranes as well as a ~40 nm wide lumen. In addition to its barrier function, the NE acts as a critical signaling node for a variety of cellular processes which are mediated by protein complexes within this subcellular compartment. While fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) is a powerful tool for characterizing protein complexes in living cells, it was recently demonstrated that conventional FFS methods are not suitable for applications in the NE because of the presence of slow nuclear membrane undulations. We previously addressed this challenge by developing time-shifted mean-segmented Q (tsMSQ) analysis and applied it to successfully characterize protein homo-oligomerization in the NE. However, many NE complexes, such as the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, are formed by heterotypic interactions, which single-color tsMSQ is unable to characterize. Here, we describe the development of dual-color (DC) tsMSQ to analyze NE hetero-protein complexes built from proteins that carry two spectrally distinct fluorescent labels. Experiments performed on model systems demonstrate that DC tsMSQ properly identifies hetero-protein complexes and their stoichiometry in the NE by accounting for spectral crosstalk and local volume fluctuations. Finally, we applied DC tsMSQ to study the assembly of the LINC complex, a hetero-protein complex composed of Klarsicht/ANC-1/SYNE homology (KASH) and Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN) proteins, in the NE of living cells. Using DC tsMSQ, we demonstrate the ability of the SUN protein SUN2 and the KASH protein nesprin-2 to form a hetero-complex in vivo. Our results are consistent with previously published in vitro studies and demonstrate the utility of the DC tsMSQ technique for characterizing NE hetero-protein complexes.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceProtein complexes found within the nuclear envelope (NE) play a vital role in regulating cellular functions ranging from gene expression to cellular movement. However, the assembly state of these complexes within their native environment remains poorly understood, which is compounded by a general lack of fluorescence techniques suitable for quantifying the oligomeric state of NE protein complexes. This study aims at addressing this issue by introducing dual-color time-shifted mean-segmented Q analysis as a fluorescence fluctuation method specifically designed to identify the average oligomeric state of hetero-protein complexes within the NE of living cells.",

The exploration of this diversity can be used both to develop new brewing applications and to enlighten our understanding of the dynamics of yeast evolution in the wild. Here, we integrate whole genome sequence and phenotypic data of 200 S. eubayanus strains, the largest collection to date. S. eubayanus has a multilayered population structure, consisting of two major populations that are further structured into six subpopulations. Four of these subpopulations are found exclusively in the Patagonian region of South America; one is found predominantly in Patagonia and sparsely in Oceania and North America; and one is specific to the Holarctic ecozone. S. eubayanus is most abundant and genetically diverse in Patagonia, where some locations harbor more genetic diversity than is found outside of South America. All but one subpopulation shows isolation-by-distance, and gene flow between subpopulations is low. However, there are strong signals of ancient and recent outcrossing, including two admixed lineages, one that is sympatric with and one that is mostly isolated from its parental populations. Despite S. eubayanus extensive genetic diversity, it has relatively little phenotypic diversity, and all subpopulations performed similarly under most conditions tested. Using our extensive biogeographical data, we constructed a robust model that predicted all known and a handful of additional regions of the globe that are climatically suitable for S. eubayanus, including Europe. We conclude that this industrially relevant species has rich wild diversity with many factors contributing to its complex distribution and biology.",

However, the neural circuit mechanism underlying this crucial brain function, referred to as motor planning, remains unclear. Here, we employ projection-specific imaging and perturbation methods to investigate the direct pathway linking two key nodes in the motor planning network, the secondary motor cortex (M2) and the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), in mice performing a memory-dependent perceptual decision task. We find dynamic coding of choice information in SC-projecting M2 neurons during motor planning and execution, and disruption of this information by inhibiting M2 terminals in SC selectively impaired decision maintenance. Furthermore, cell-type-specific optogenetic circuit mapping shows that M2 terminals modulate both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons with balanced synaptic strength. Together, our results reveal the dynamic recruitment of the premotor-collicular pathway as a circuit mechanism for motor planning.",

As recovery mechanisms are still debated, we characterize functional reorganization with multimodal MRI in two children operated on the right hemisphere (RH). We found that interhemispheric functional connectivity was abolished in both patients. The healthy left hemispheres (LH) displayed focal hyperperfusion in motor and limbic areas, and preserved network-level organization. The disconnected RHs were hypoperfused despite sustained network-level organization. Functional connectivity was increased in the left thalamo-cortical loop and between the cerebelli. The classification probability of the RH corresponding to a minimally conscious state was smaller than for the LH. We conclude that after hemispherotomy, neurological rehabilitation is sustained by cortical disinhibition and reinforcement of connectivity driven by subcortical structures in the remaining hemisphere. Our results highlight the effect of vascularization on functional connectivity and raise inquiries about the conscious state of the isolated hemisphere.",

    "abstract": "Nerve regeneration after injury must occur in a timely fashion to restore function. Unfortunately, current methods (e.g., electrophysiology) provide limited information following trauma, resulting in delayed management and suboptimal outcomes. Herein, we evaluated the ability of diffusion MRI to monitor nerve regeneration after injury/repair. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three treatment groups (sham=21, crush=23, cut/repair=19) and ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was performed 1-12 weeks post-surgery. Behavioral data showed a distinction between crush and cut/repair nerves at 4 weeks. This was consistent with DTI, which found that thresholds based on the ratio of radial and axial diffusivities (RD/AD=0.40{+/-}0.02) and fractional anisotropy (FA=0.53{+/-}0.01) differentiated crush from cut/repair injuries. By the 12th week, cut/repair nerves whose behavioral data indicated a partial recovery were below the RD/AD threshold (and above the FA threshold), while nerves that did not recover were on the opposite side of each threshold. Additional morphometric analysis indicated that DTI-derived normalized scalar indices report on axon density (RD/AD: r=-0.54, p<1e-3; FA: r=0.56, p<1e-3). Interestingly, higher-order DKI analyses did not improve our ability classify recovery. These findings suggest that DTI can distinguish successful/unsuccessful nerve repairs and potentially identify cases that require reoperation.",

This protein is also involved in the non-canonical activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 system, a major oxidative stress response pathway. Here we show a role of Neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1), an autophagy receptor structurally similar to p62/SQSTM1, in the p62-liquid droplet formation and the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. The overexpression of NBR1 blocked selective degradation of p62/SQSTM1 through autophagy and promoted the accumulation and phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 in liquid-like bodies, which is required for the activation of Nrf2. NBR1 was induced in response to oxidative stress, and then the p62-mediated Nrf2 activation was up-regulated. Conversely, loss of Nbr1 suppresses not only the formation of p62/SQSTM1-liquid droplets but also p62-dependent Nrf2 activation during oxidative stress. Taken together, our results show that NBR1 mediates p62/SQSTM1-liquid droplet formation to activate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.",
