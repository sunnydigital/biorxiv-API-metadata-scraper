    "abstract": "High yield is an important objective of cell factory. One or several genes cloned into the bacterial may make the synthetic pathway much more optimal, so can increase the yield. But the global benefit enzymes are rare, which can increase the yields of many chemical products for a cell factory such as E.coli. Two of these kinds of global benefit enzymes are the famous enzymes, D-fructose-6-phosphate D-erythrose-4-phosphate-lyase and D-Xylulose 5-phosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, of non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) published in Nature, which can improve the utilization ratio of carbon. We expect to find other global benefit enzymes. We use an integrated model, which integrated in silico model of E.coli and KEGG. By computation, we analyze the effect of adding each reaction from KEGG on the theoretical yields of several products with E.coli and find 83 enzymes that may be potentially global benefit enzymes. By comparison, we find about 30 of the 83 enzymes are better in improving the theoretical yields than the two enzymes of NOG.\\n\\nIn order to compare the global benefit enzymes with NOG, as an example, we select \\\"Glycerol:NADP+ oxidoreductase\\\" (GNO) which can increase the supply of NADPH in E.coli. But To increase the supply of reducing power, such as NADPH will probably increase the yield of chemicals in a cell factory. We use flux balance analysis method to testify our assumption. By comparing the maximum yields of 80 products produced by E.coli with respectively using GNO and NOG, we find GNO has better performance in the product production of E.coli. So GNO is a global benefit enzyme which can increase the yields of many chemical products in E.coli.",

    "abstract": "Males and females often produce distinct responses to the same sensory stimuli. How such differences arise - at the level of sensory processing or in the circuits that generate behavior - remains largely unresolved across sensory modalities. We address this issue in the acoustic communication system of Drosophila. During courtship, males generate time-varying songs, and each sex responds with specific behaviors. We characterize male and female behavioral tuning for all aspects of song, and show that feature tuning is similar between sexes, suggesting sex-shared song detectors drive divergent behaviors. We then identify higher-order neurons in the Drosophila brain, called pC2, that are tuned for multiple temporal aspects of one mode of the males song, and drive sex-specific behaviors. We thus uncover neurons that are specifically tuned to an acoustic communication signal and that reside at the sensory-motor interface, flexibly linking auditory perception with sex-specific behavioral responses.",

    "abstract": "Coccidioides spp. are dimorphic, pathogenic fungi that can cause severe human and animal disease. Like the other primary fungal pathogens, animal infection results in a morphologic transformation from the environmental mycelial phase to a tissue phase, known as a spherule. The sequencing and annotation of Coccidioides spp. and the genomes of several nonpathogenic Onygenales species allows comparisons that provide clues about the Coccidioides spp. genes that might be involved in pathogenesis. The analysis in this study is a gene by gene orthology comparison. Although there were few differences in the size of genes families in the Coccidioides spp.-specific group compared to the genes shared by Coccidioides spp. and nonpathogenic Onygenales, there were a number of differences in the characterization of the two types of genes. Many more Coccidioides spp.-specific genes are up-regulated expression in spherules. Coccidioides spp.-specific genes more often lacked functional annotation and were more often classified as orphan genes. Analysis by random forest machine learning confirmed that high numbers of orthologs and high levels of expression in hyphae were predictive of common genes, while high levels of expression in spherules and more nonsynonymous predicted Coccidioides spp.-specific genes. Review of individual genes in the Coccidioides spp.-specific group identified a histidine kinase, two thioredoxin genes, a calmodulin gene and ureidoglycolate hydrolase. Hopefully, identification of these genes will be useful for pursuing potential Coccidioides spp. virulence genes in the future.",

    "abstract": "O_LIAbiotic and biotic stresses related to climate change have been associated to increased crown defoliation, decreased growth and a higher risk of mortality in many forest tree species, but the impact of stresses on tree reproduction and forest regeneration remains understudied. At dry, warm margin of species distributions, flowering, pollination and seed maturation processes are expected to be affected by drought, late frost and other stresses, eventually resulting in reproduction failure. Moreover, inter-individual variations in reproductive performances versus other performances (growth, survival) could have important consequences on populations dynamics.\\nC_LIO_LIWe investigated the relationships between individual crown defoliation, growth and reproduction in a drought-prone population of European beech, Fagus sylvatica. We used a spatially explicit mating model and marker-based parentage analyses to estimate effective female and male fecundities of 432 reproductive trees, which were also monitored for basal area increment and crown defoliation over nine years.\\nC_LIO_LIFemale and male fecundities markedly varied among individuals, more than did growth. Both female fecundity and growth decreased with increasing crown defoliation and competition and increased with size. Male fecundity only responded to competition, and decreased with increasing competition. Moreover, the negative effect of defoliation on female fecundity was size-dependent, with a slower decline in female fecundity with increasing defoliation for the large individuals. Finally, a trade-off between growth and female fecundity was observed in response to defoliation: some large trees maintained significant female fecundity at the expense of reduced growth in response to defoliation, while some other defoliated trees rather maintained high growth at the expense of reduced female fecundity.\\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. Our results suggest that while decreasing their growth, some large defoliated trees still contribute to reproduction through seed production and pollination. This non-coordinated decline of growth and fecundity at individual-level in response to stress may compromise the evolution of stress-resistance traits at population level, and increase forest tree vulnerability.\\nC_LI",

It also enables the study of gene expression variability across individual cells within a homogenous cell population. Feature selection algorithms have been used to select biologically meaningful genes while controlling for sampling noise. An easy-to-use application for feature selection on scRNA-seq data requires integration of functions for data filtering, normalization, visualization, and enrichment analyses. Graphic user interfaces (GUIs) are desired for such an application.\n\nResultsWe used native Matlab and App Designer to develop scGEApp for feature selection on singlecell gene expression data. We specifically designed a new feature selection algorithm based on the 3D spline fitting of expression mean (), coefficient of variance (CV), and dropout rate (rdrop), making scGEApp a unique tool for feature selection on scRNA-seq data. Our method can be applied to single-sample or two-sample scRNA-seq data, identify feature genes, e.g., those with unexpectedly high CV for given  and rdrop of those genes, or genes with the most feature changes. Users can operate scGEApp through GUIs to use the full spectrum of functions including normalization, batch effect correction, imputation, visualization, feature selection, and downstream analyses with GSEA and GOrilla.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/jamesjcai/scGEApp\n\nContact: jcai@tamu.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Chromatin conformation capture technologies (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of topologically associated domains (TADs), the fundamental building blocks of the genome. Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding regulatory interactions within the genome. Existing tools for TAD calling frequently require tunable parameters, are sensitive to biases such as sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data, and are computationally inefficient. Furthermore, the choice of TAD callers within the R/Bioconductor ecosystem is limited. To address these challenges, we frame the problem of TAD detection in a spectral clustering framework. Our SpectralTAD R package has automatic parameter selection, robust to sequencing depth, resolution and sparsity of Hi-C data, and detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TAD structure. Using simulated and real-life Hi-C data, we show that SpectralTAD outperforms rGMAP and TopDom, two state-of-the-art R-based TAD callers. TAD boundaries that are shared among multiple levels of the hierarchy were more enriched in relevant genomic annotations, e.g., CTCF binding sites, suggesting their higher biological importance. In contrast, boundaries of primary TADs, defined as TADs which cannot be split into sub-TADs, were found to be less enriched in genomic annotations, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation. In summary, we present a simple, fast, and user-friendly R package for robust detection of TAD hierarchies supported by biological evidence. SpectralTAD is available on https://github.com/dozmorovlab/SpectralTAD and Bioconductor (submitted).",

    "abstract": "One of the key challenges in the field of genetics is the inference of haplotypes from next generation sequencing data. The MinION Oxford Nanopore sequencer allows sequencing long reads, with the potential of sequencing complete genes, and even complete genomes of viruses, in individual reads. However, MinION suffers from high error rates, rendering the detection of true variants difficult. Here we propose a new statistical approach named AssociVar, which differentiates between true mutations and sequencing errors from direct RNA/DNA sequencing using MinION. Our strategy relies on the assumption that sequencing errors will be dispersed randomly along sequencing reads, and hence will not be associated with each other, whereas real mutations will display a non-random pattern of association with other mutations. We demonstrate our approach using direct RNA sequencing data from evolved populations of the MS2 bacteriophage, whose small genome makes it ideal for MinION sequencing. AssociVar inferred several mutations in the phage genome, which were corroborated using parallel Illumina sequencing. This allowed us to reconstruct full genome viral haplotypes constituting different strains that were present in the sample. Our approach is applicable to long read sequencing data from any organism for accurate detection of bona fide mutations and inter-strain polymorphisms.",

Studies suggest that TGP impacts population dynamics and evolution of phenotype, but these impacts will depend on how long an environmental effect can persist across generations and whether multigenerational effects are cumulative. Here we tested the impact of both grand-parental and parental environments on offspring reaction norm in a prey-predator system. We exposed three generations of Physa acuta snails without and with predator-cues according to a full factorial design and measured offspring inducible defenses. We found that both grand-parental and parental exposure to predator cues impacted offspring anti-predator defenses, but their effects were not cumulative and depended on the defenses considered. We also highlighted that grand-parental environment could alter reaction norm of offspring shell thickness, demonstrating an interaction between the grand-parental TGP and the within-generational WGP plasticity. We called for more studies covering the combine effects of multigenerational environments.",

Here we ask: to what extent can the course of morphogenesis be modulated and controlled by an external electric field? We show that above a critical amplitude, an external electric field can halt morphogenesis in Hydra regeneration. Moreover, above this critical amplitude, the electric field can even lead to reversal dynamics: a fully developed Hydra folds back into its incipient spheroid morphology. The potential to renew morphogenesis is re-exposed when the field is reduced back to amplitudes below criticality. These dynamics are accompanied by modulations of the Wnt3 activity, a central component of the head organizer in Hydra. Reversal of morphogenesis is shown to be triggered by enhanced epithelial electrical excitations, accompanied by intensified calcium activity, indicating that electrical processes play an instructive role to a level that can direct developmental trajectories. Reversal of morphogenesis by external fields, calls for extending its framework beyond programmatic, forward-driven, hierarchical processes.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has advanced our understanding of how brain microstructure evolves over development. However, the proliferation of multi-shell diffusion imaging sequences has coincided with notable advances in the modeling of neuronal diffusion patterns, such as Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and Laplacian-regularized Mean Apparent Propagator MRI (MAPL). The relative utility of these newer diffusion models for understanding brain maturation remains sparsely investigated. Additionally, despite evidence that motion artifact is a major confound for studies of development, the relative vulnerability of these models to in-scanner motion has not been described. Accordingly, in a sample of 123 youth (ages 12-30) we evaluated DTI, NODDI, and MAPL for associations with age and in-scanner head motion at multiple scales, including mean white matter values, voxelwise analyses, and tractography-based structural brain networks. Our results reveal that multi-shell diffusion imaging sequences can be leveraged to robustly characterize neurodevelopment, even within the framework of DTI. However, these metrics of diffusion are variably impacted by motion, highlighting the importance of modeling choices for studies of movement-prone populations. Our findings suggest that while traditional DTI is sensitive to neurodevelopmental trends, contemporary modeling techniques confer key advantages for neurodevelopmental inquiries.",

    "abstract": "Bacteroides fragilis constitutes a significant part of the normal human gut microbiota and can also act as an opportunistic pathogen. Antimicrobial resistance and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes are increasing, and prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility based on sequence information could support targeted antimicrobial therapy in a clinical setting. Complete identification of insertion sequence (IS) elements carrying promoter sequences upstream of resistance genes is necessary for prediction of antimicrobial resistance. However, de novo assemblies from short reads alone are often fractured due to repeat regions and the presence multiple copies of identical IS elements. Identification of plasmids in clinical isolates can aid in the surveillance of the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance and comprehensive sequence databases support microbiome and metagenomic studies. Here we test several short-read, hybrid and long-lead assembly pipelines by assembling the type strain B. fragilis CCUG4856T (=ATCC25285=NCTC9343) with Illumina short reads and long reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing. Hybrid assembly with Unicycler, using quality filtered Illumina reads and Filtlong filtered and Canu corrected ONT reads produced the assembly of highest quality. This approach was then applied to six clinical multidrug resistant B. fragilis isolates and, with minimal manual finishing of chromosomal assemblies of three isolates, complete, circular assemblies of all isolates were produced. Eleven circular, putative plasmids were identified in the six assemblies of which only three corresponded to a known cultured Bacteroides plasmid. Complete IS elements could be identified upstream of antimicrobial resistance genes, however there was not complete correlation between the absence of IS elements and antimicrobial susceptibility. As our knowledge on factors that increase expression of resistance genes in the absence of IS elements is limited, further research is needed prior to implementing antimicrobial resistance prediction for B. fragilis from whole genome sequencing.\\n\\nREPOSITORIESSequence files (MinION reads de-multiplexed with Deepbinner and basecalled with Albacore in fast5 format and Illumina MiSeq reads in fastq format) and final genome assemblies have been deposited to NCBI/ENA/DDBJ under Bioproject accessions PRJNA525024, PRJNA244942, PRJNA244943, PRJNA244944, PRJNA253771, PRJNA254401, and PRJNA254455\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTBacterial whole genome sequencing is increasingly used in public health, clinical, and research laboratories for typing, identification of virulence factors, phylogenomics, outbreak investigation and identification of antimicrobial resistance genes. In some settings, diagnostic microbiome amplicon sequencing or metagenomic sequencing directly from clinical samples is already implemented and informs treatment decisions. The prospect of prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility based on resistome identification holds promises for shortening time from sample to report and informing treatment decisions. Databases with comprehensive reference sequences of high quality are a necessity for these purposes. Bacteroides fragilis is an important part of the human commensal gut microbiota and is also the most commonly isolated anaerobic bacterium from non-faecal clinical samples but few complete genome assemblies are available through public databases. The fragmented assemblies from short read de novo assembly often negate the identification of insertion sequences upstream of antimicrobial resistance gens, which is necessary for prediction of antimicrobial resistance from whole genome sequencing. Here we test multiple assembly pipelines with short read Illumina data and long read data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencing to select an optimal pipeline for complete genome assembly of B. fragilis. However, B. fragilis is a highly plastic genome with multiple inversive repeat regions, and complete genome assembly of six clinical multidrug resistant isolates still required minor manual finishing for half the isolates.

    "abstract": "We introduce an approach to reconstruction of simultaneous multi-slice (SMS)-fMRI data that improves statistical efficiency. The method incorporates regularization to adjust temporal smoothness in a spatially varying, encoding-dependent manner, reducing the g-factor noise amplification per temporal degree of freedom. This results in a net improvement in tSNR and GLM efficiency, where the efficiency gain can be derived analytically as a function of the encoding and reconstruction parameters. Residual slice leakage and aliasing is limited when fMRI signal energy is dominated by low frequencies. Analytical predictions, simulated and experimental results demonstrate a marked improvement in statistical efficiency in the temporally regularized reconstructions compared to conventional slice-GRAPPA reconstructions, particularly in central brain regions. Furthermore, experimental results confirm that residual slice leakage and aliasing errors are not noticeably increased compared to slice-GRAPPA reconstruction. This approach to temporally regularized image reconstruction in SMS-fMRI improves statistical power, and allows for explicit choice of reconstruction parameters by directly assessing their impact on noise variance per degree of freedom.",

Malassezia biofilm formation at the skin surface has not yet been addressed.\n\nObjectiveThe present study aimed to evaluate Malassezia interaction with a reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) model.\n\nMethodsMalassezia clinical isolates were previously isolated from volunteers with pityriasis versicolor and seborrheic dermatitis. Yeasts of two strains of M. furfur and M. sympodialis were inoculated onto the SkinEthic RHE. The tissues were processed for light microscopy, wide-field fluorescence microscopy and scanning-electron microscopy.\n\nResultsColonization of the RhE surface with aggregates of Malassezia yeasts entrapped in a multilayer sheet with variable amount of extracellular matrix was unveiled by imaging techniques following 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours of incubation. Whenever yeasts were suspended in RPMI medium supplemented with lipids, the biofilm substantially increased with a dense extracellular matrix in which the yeast cells were embedded (not seen in control samples). Slight differences were found in the biofilm architectural structure between the two tested species.\n\nConclusionSkin isolates of M. furfur and M. sympodialis were capable of forming biofilm in vitro at the epidermal surface simulating in vivo conditions. Following 24 hours of incubation, without added lipids, rudimental matrix was barely visible, conversely to the reported at plastic surfaces. The amount of biofilm apparently increased progressively from 48 to 96 hours. A structural heterogeneity of biofilm between species was found with higher entrapment by a denser and more gelatinous extracellular matrix in M. furfur biofilm.",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of global trade, hundreds of species have colonized territories outside of their native range. Some of these species proliferate at the expense of native ecosystems, i.e., have become invasive. Invasive species constitute powerful in situ experimental systems to study fast adaptation and directional selection on short ecological timescales. They also present promising case studies for ecological and evolutionary success in novel environments.\\n\\nWe seize this unique opportunity to study genomic substrates for ecological success and adaptability to novel environments in a vertebrate. We report a highly contiguous long-read based genome assembly for the most successful temperate invasive fish, the benthic round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and analyse gene families that may promote its impressive ecological success.\\n\\nOur approach provides novel insights from the large evolutionary scale to the small species-specific scale. We describe expansions in specific cytochrome P450 enzymes, a remarkably diverse innate immune system, an ancient duplication in red light vision accompanied by red skin fluorescence, evolutionary patterns in epigenetic regulators, and the presence of genes that may have contributed to the round gobys capacity to invade cold and salty waters.\\n\\nA recurring theme across all analyzed gene families are gene expansions. This suggests that gene duplications may promote ecological flexibility, superior performance in novel environments, and underlie the impressive colonization success of the round goby. Gobiidae generally feature fascinating adaptations and are excellent colonizers. Further long-read genome approaches across the goby family may reveal whether the ability to conquer new habitats relates more generally to gene copy number expansions.",

    "abstract": "In light of recent studies, many of the cytoplasmic posttranscriptional mRNA processing steps take place in highly specialized microdomains referred to as cytoplasmic bodies. These evolutionarily conserved microdomains are sites of regulation for both mRNA translation and degradation. It has been shown that in the larch microsporocyte cytoplasm, there is a significant pool of Sm proteins not related to snRNP complexes. These Sm proteins accumulate within distinct cytoplasmic bodies (S-bodies) that also contain mRNA. Sm proteins constitute an evolutionarily ancient family of small RNA-binding proteins. In eukaryotic cells, these molecules are involved in pre-mRNA splicing. The latest research indicates that in addition to this well-known function, Sm proteins could also have an impact on mRNA at subsequent stages of its life cycle. The aim of this work was to verify the hypothesis that canonical Sm proteins are part of the cytoplasmic mRNP complex and thus function in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in plants.",

    "abstract": "Many tissue-specific stem cells require quiescence to sustain stem cell pool and maintain lifelong tissue integrity. It remains unclear whether protein quality control is required for stem cells in quiescence when RNA content, protein synthesis and metabolic activities are significantly reduced. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) is required to preserve the function of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). The Sel1L/Hrd1 ERAD genes are enriched in the quiescent and inactive HSCs, and conditional knockout of Sel1L in hematopoietic tissues drives HSCs to hyper-proliferation which leads to reduced self-renewal and HSC depletion. ERAD deficiency induces a non-apoptotic ER stress and activates unfolded protein response (UPR). Furthermore, Sel1L knockout leads to mTOR activation, and mTOR inhibition rescues the HSC defects in Sel1L knockout mice. Protein quality control is, therefore, tightly regulated and actively engaged in quiescent HSCs. Sel1L/Hrd1 ERAD maintains HSC quiescence and self-renewal via restricting mTOR activity.",

Respondents indicated that total number of publications, number of publications per year, and journal name recognition were the most valued factors in RPT. Older and tenured respondents (most likely to serve on RPT committees) were less likely to value journal prestige and metrics for publishing, while untenured respondents were more likely to value these factors.

HSV encodes a SUMO-targeted Ubiquitin ligase ICP0 that degrades PML NBs to alleviate the repression. The molecular mechanism used by ICP0 to target PML NBs is unclear. For reasons unknown, the growth of HSV is dependent on the ATM/Chk2 pathway. Here we identify a bonafide SUMO-Interacting motif in ICP0 (SLS4) that is essential and sufficient to target SUMOylated proteins in PML NBs like PML and Sp100. Phosphorylation of SLS4 creates new salt-bridges between SUMO and SLS4, increases the SUMO/SLS4 affinity and switches ICP0 into a potent STUbL. We also report that ICP0 exploits the kinase Chk2 to phosphorylate SLS4 and enhance its STUbL activity. Our results uncover how a viral STUbL counters antiviral response by exploiting an unprecedented mechanism involving three post-translational modifications; ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "The scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family of proteins comprise more than 20 membrane-associated and secreted molecules. Characterised by the presence of one or more copies of the ~110 amino acid SRCR domain, this class of proteins have widespread functions as anti-microbial molecules, scavenger- and signalling-receptors. Despite the high level of structural conservation of SRCR domains, no molecular basis for ligand interaction has been described. The SRCR protein SALSA, also known as dmbt1/gp340, is a key player in mucosal immunology. Based on detailed structures of the SALSA SRCR domains 1 and 8, we here reveal a novel universal ligand binding mechanism for SALSA ligands. The binding interface incorporates a dual cation binding site, which is highly conserved across the SRCR super family. Along with the well-described cation dependency on most SRCR domain-ligand interactions, our data suggest that the binding mechanism described for the SALSA SRCR domains is applicable to all SRCR domains. We thus propose to have identified in SALSA a conserved functional mechanism for ligand recognition by the SRCR class of proteins.",

Yet reaction kinetics are highly dependent on uncontrollable environmental conditions such as temperature. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which budding yeast influence reaction rates through adjustment of intracellular viscosity. This \\\"viscoadaptation\\\" is achieved by production of two carbohydrates, trehalose and glycogen, which combine to create a more viscous cellular environment in which biomolecules retain solubility. We demonstrate that viscoadaptation functions as both an acute response to temperature increase as well as a homeostatic mechanism, allowing cells grown at temperatures spanning from 22{degrees}C to 40{degrees}C to maintain equivalent rates of intracellular diffusion and diffusion-controlled chemical reactions. Multiple conditions that lower ATP trigger viscoadaptation, suggesting that viscoadaptation may be a general cellular response to low energy. Viscoadaptation reveals viscosity to be a tunable property of cells through which they can regulate diffusion-controlled processes dynamically in response to a changing environment.",

    "abstract": "Bioluminescence, or the production of light by living organisms via chemical reaction, is widespread across Metazoa. Culture of bioluminescent organisms from diverse taxonomic groups is important for determining the biosynthetic pathways of bioluminescent substrates, which may lead to new tools for biotechnology and biomedicine. Some bioluminescent groups may be cultured, including some cnidarians, ctenophores, and brittle stars, but those use luminescent substrates (luciferins) obtained from their diets, and therefore are not informative for determination of the biosynthethic pathways of the luciferins. Other groups, including terrestrial fireflies, do synthesize their own luciferin, but culturing them is difficult, and the biosynthetic pathway for firefly luciferin remains unclear. An additional independent origin of endogenous bioluminescence is found within ostracods from the family Cypridinidae, which use their luminescence for defense and, in Caribbean species, for courtship displays. Here, we report the first complete life cycle of a luminous ostracod (Vargula tsujii Kornicker & Baker, 1977, the California Sea Firefly) in the laboratory. We also describe the late-stage embryogenesis of Vargula tsujii and discuss the size classes of instar development. We find embryogenesis in V. tsujii ranges from 25-38 days, and this species appears to have five instar stages, consistent with ontogeny in other cypridinid lineages. We estimate a complete life cycle at 3-4 months. We also present the first complete mitochondrial genome for Vargula tsujii. Bringing a luminous ostracod into laboratory culture sets the stage for many potential avenues of study, including learning the biosynthetic pathway of cypridinid luciferin and genomic manipulation of an autogenic bioluminescent system.",

Homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength is essential for the maintenance of brain functions and engages both global and cell autonomous level processes. We used Crispr/Cas9-mediated somatic knockouts, overexpression, neuronal activity recordings and translatome sequencing, to examine the contribution of Fxr1 to cell-autonomous homeostatic synaptic scaling and global-level sleep homeostasis. Our findings indicate that Fxr1 is downregulated during scaling and sleep deprivation via a Gsk3{beta} dependent mechanism. In both conditions, downregulation of Fxr1 is essential for the homeostatic modulation of synaptic strength. Furthermore, overexpression of Fxr1 during sleep deprivation results in altered EEG signatures and reverts changes of translatome profiles. These findings indicate that Fxr1 represents a shared signaling hub linking cell autonomous homeostatic plasticity and system level sleep homeostasis with potential implications for neuropsychiatric illnesses.",

However, the molecular composition and precise sub-junctional organization of the AJC and its associated polarity regulators are still not well defined. Here we used the peroxidase APEX2 for quantitative proximity proteomics (QPP) and electron microscopy (EM) imaging to generate a nanometer-scale spatio-molecular map of the apical-lateral border in fully polarized MDCK-II cells. Using Par3 and Pals1 as surrogates for QPP we present a spatially resolved network of [~]800 junction-associated proteins. The network dissects TJ and AJ components and provides strong evidence that TJ are composed of distinct apical and basal subdomains. Moreover, we find that Pals1 and its binding partners PatJ, Lin7c and Crumbs3 define a hitherto unidentified membrane compartment apical of TJ, which we coin the vertebrate marginal zone (VMZ). The VMZ is physically associated with HOMER scaffolding proteins, regulators of apical exocytosis, and membrane-proximal HIPPO pathway proteins. Taken together our work defines the spatial and molecular organization of the apical-lateral border in fully polarized mammalian epithelial cells, reveals an intriguing molecular and spatial conservation of invertebrate and vertebrate cell polarity protein domains, and provides a comprehensive resource of potentially novel regulators of cell polarity and the mammalian AJC.",

    "abstract": "Inferring gene regulatory networks from high-throughput  omics data has proven to be a computationally demanding task of critical importance. Frequently the classical methods breakdown due to the curse of dimensionality, and popular strategies to overcome this are typically based on regularized versions of the classical methods. However, these approaches rely on loss functions that may not be robust and usually do not allow for the incorporation of prior information in a straightforward way. Fully Bayesian methods are equipped to handle both of these shortcomings quite naturally, and they offer potential for improvements in network structure learning. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct gene regulatory networks from time series gene expression data, such as those common in perturbation experiments of biological systems. The proposed methodology utilizes global-local shrinkage priors for posterior selection of regulatory edges and relaxes the common normal likelihood assumption in order to allow for heavy-tailed data, which was shown in several of the cited references to severely impact network inference. We provide a sufficient condition for posterior propriety and derive an efficient MCMC via Gibbs sampling in the Appendix. We describe a novel way to detect multiple scales based on the corresponding posterior quantities. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our approach in a simulation study and compare it with existing methods on real data from a T-cell activation study.",

    "abstract": "In biological systems, polymeric materials block the movement of some macromolecules while allowing the selective passage of others. In some cases, binding enables selective transport, while in others the most inert particles appear to transit most rapidly. To study the general principles of filtering, we develop a model motivated by features of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) which are highly conserved and could potentially be applied to other biological systems. The NPC allows selective transport of proteins called transport factors which transiently bind to disordered, flexible proteins called FG Nups. While the NPC is tuned for transport factors and their cargo, we show that a single feature is sufficient for selective transport: the bound-state motion resulting from transient binding to flexible filaments. Interchain transfer without unbinding can further improve selectivity, especially for crosslinked chains. We generalize this observation to model nanoparticle transport through mucus and show that bound-state motion accelerates transport of transient nanoparticle application, even with clearance by mucus flow. Our model provides a framework to control binding-induced selective transport in bipolymeric materials.",

    "abstract": "Several studies around the world have shown that the proportion of migrant species in bird communities increases toward the poles as a result of greater climatic seasonality and a considerable annual variation of resources. In this context, urban areas may impose a barrier to bird migrants given their buffered seasonality of resources and human disturbance. The aim of this study is to analyze the global pattern of migrant species proportion in urban green areas, considering the effects of climatic seasonality as well as the effects of urbanization. Data of bird communities in urban green areas were gathered through a search of scientific articles, book chapters, and thesis. Datasets that included a list of observed species, the numbers of parks surveyed and other methodological characteristics were considered for the analysis. Then, generalized linear models were used to relate the proportion of migratory species in each dataset to environmental and methodological variables that controlled for different sampling effort among studies. A total of 32 cities from four continents were analyzed. As expected, the migrant proportion increased with the annual range of temperature and precipitation and was higher in the Northern Hemisphere. However, the proportion of migrants decreased with the population size of cities but increased in those datasets with the highest maximum size of green areas surveyed. Although the global pattern of migrant proportion in urban green areas follows a similar pattern than those found in natural areas, the results obtained suggest that urbanization have a negative impact on this global pattern by reducing the proportion of migrant species in large cities. Moreover, green area loss in cities may impact negatively the proportion of migrant species.",

In this process, the mechanism controlling cell cycle progression has to be robust against inherent noise in the system.

The modeling approach leverages, in a single multi-scale model, the advantages of two regimes: 1) the computational efficiency of a deterministic approach, and 2) the accuracy of stochastic simulations. Our results show that this hybrid stochastic model achieves high computational efficiency while generating simulation results that match very well with published experimental measurements.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing the therapeutic potential of immunoglobulin M (IgM) is of considerable interest in immunotherapy due to its complement-activating and cell-agglutinating abilities. Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab are monoclonal antibody drugs used in therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer but exhibit significantly different binding affinities as IgM when compared to the original IgG1 form. While the affinity of Pertuzumab IgM to the HER2 extracellular domain is about one order of magnitude higher than IgG1 in experiments, it was recently reported that Trastuzumab IgM and IgG have similar equilibrium dissociation constants to one another. We now perform an integrative multiscale simulation study in order to understand the structural basis for the differences in behavior between the two antibodies, based on complete antibody assemblies. We show that Pertuzumab IgM is able to utilize all of its V-regions to engage HER2 in a more stable mode than Trastuzumab IgM due to steric clashes between the large globular HER2 domains when bound to Trastuzumab. This is subsequently validated by confirming that Pertuzumab IgM inhibits proliferation in HER2 over-expressing live cells more effectively than its IgG1 counterpart. Given the widespread clinical use of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab, elucidating the molecular details of antibody-antigen interaction may help guide the choice of epitopes for future design and selection of improved therapeutic antibody isotypes.",

    "abstract": "Circovirus, comprising one capsid protein, is the smallest nonenveloped virus and induces lymphopenia. Circovirus can be used to explore the cell adhesion mechanism of nonenveloped viruses. We developed a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to directly visualize the capsids conformational feature. The capsid underwent reversible dynamic transformation between three conformations. The cell surface receptor heparan sulfate (HS) altered the dynamic equilibrium of the capsid to the high-FRET state, revealing the HS binding region. Neutralizing antibodies restricted capsid transition to a low-FRET state, masking the HS binding domain. The lack of positively charged amino acids in the HS binding site reduced cell surface affinity and attenuated virus infectivity via conformational changes. These intrinsic characteristics of the capsid suggested that conformational dynamics is critical for the structural changes occurring upon cell surface receptor binding, supporting a dynamics-based mechanism of receptor binding.\\n\\nImportanceViral proteins were commom working as ligand to interacte with cell surface glycosaminoglycan receptors to achieve the virus attachment, during which the conformational dynamics of the protein ligand are also vital for the binding properties. In this study, PCV2 capsid and heparin sulfate were used to study the protein conformational dynamics of nonenveloped and icosahedral circovirus capsid during triggering to cell surface receptor. we demonstrated the PCV2 capsid could acts as a dynamic machine, spontaneously adopting multiple conformations with reversible interconversion and intrinsic conformational features could be regulated by glycosaminoglycan receptors and neutralizing antibodies.

The entire protein secretion machine is composed of several substructures that organize into a holostructure or injectisome. The core component of the injectisome is the needle complex, which houses the export apparatus that serves as a gate for the passage of the secreted proteins through the bacterial inner membrane. Here we describe a high-resolution structure of the export apparatus of the Salmonella type III secretion system in association with the needle complex and the underlying bacterial membrane, both in isolation and in situ. We show the precise location of the core export apparatus components within the injectisome and bacterial envelope and demonstrate that their deployment results in major membrane remodeling and thinning, which may be central for the protein translocation process. We also show that InvA, a critical export apparatus component, forms a multi-ring cytoplasmic conduit that provides a pathway for the type III secretion substrates to reach the entrance of the export gate. Combined with structure-guided mutagenesis, our studies provide major insight into potential mechanisms of protein translocation and injectisome assembly.",

The function of the TCR proteins CSB, CSA and UVSSA and the manner in which the core DNA repair complex, including transcription factor IIH (TFIIH), is recruited are largely unknown. Here, we define the assembly mechanism of the TCR complex in human isogenic knockout cells. We show that TCR is initiated by RNAPIIo-bound CSB, which recruits CSA through a newly identified CSA-interaction motif (CIM). Once recruited, CSA facilitates the association of UVSSA with stalled RNAPIIo. Importantly, we find that UVSSA is the key factor that recruits the TFIIH complex in a manner that is stimulated by CSB and CSA. Together these findings reveal a sequential and highly cooperative assembly mechanism of TCR proteins and reveal the mechanism for TFIIH recruitment to DNA damage-stalled RNAPIIo to initiate repair.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are frequently used as donor templates for genome editing by homologous recombination. Although modification rates are typically under 1%, they are greatly enhanced by targeted double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs). A recent report described clade F AAVs mediating high-efficiency homologous recombination-based editing in the absence of DSBs. The clade F vectors included AAV9 and a series isolated from human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). We evaluated these vectors by packaging homology donors into AAV9 and an AAVHSC capsid and examining their ability to insert GFP at the CCR5 or AAVS1 loci in human HSPCs and cell lines. As a control we used AAV6, which effectively edits HSPCs, but only when combined with a targeted DSB. Each AAV vector promoted GFP insertion in the presence of matched CCR5 or AAVS1 zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), but none supported detectable editing in the absence of the nucleases. Rates of editing with ZFNs correlated with transduction efficiencies for each vector, implying no differences in the ability of donor sequences delivered by the different vectors to direct genome editing. Our results therefore do not support that clade F AAVs can perform high efficiency genome editing in the absence of a DSB.",

For instance, the emergence of scaling laws in the aggregated probability distribution of patch lifetimes can be associated to critical phenomena, in which the correlation length among system units tends to diverge. Nevertheless, an aggregated approach is biased by patch-level variability, a fact that can blur the interpretation of the data. Here, I propose a weakly-coupled metapopulation model to show how patch variability can solely trigger qualitatively different lifetime probability distribution at the aggregated level. In a generalized approach, I obtain a two-way connection between the variability of a certain patch property (e.g. carrying capacity, environment condition or connectivity) and the aggregated lifetime probability distribution. Furthermore, for a particular case, assuming that scaling laws are observed at the aggregated-level, I speculate the heterogeneity that could be behind it, relating the qualitative features the variability (mean, variance and concentration) to the scaling exponents. In this perspective, the application points to the possibility of equivalence between heterogeneous weakly-coupled metapopulations and homogeneous ones that exhibit critical behavior.",

    "abstract": "A common goal in evolutionary biology is to discern the mechanisms that produce the astounding diversity of morphologies seen across the tree of life. Aposematic species, those with a conspicuous phenotype coupled with some form of defense, are excellent models to understand the link between vivid color pattern variations, the natural selection shaping it, and the underlying genetic mechanisms underpinning this variation. Mimicry systems in which multiple species share the same conspicuous phenotype can provide an even better model for understanding the mechanisms of color production in aposematic species, especially if comimics have divergent evolutionary histories. Here we investigate the genetic mechanisms by which vivid color and pattern are produced in a Mullerian mimicry complex of poison frogs. We did this by first assembling a high-quality de novo genome assembly for the mimic poison frog Ranitomeya imitator. This assembled genome is 6.8 Gbp in size, with a contig N50 of 300 Kbp and 93% of expected tetrapod genes. We then leveraged this genome to conduct gene expression analyses throughout development of four color morphs of R. imitator and two color morphs from both R. fantastica and R. variabilis which R. imitator mimics. We identified a large number of pigmentation and patterning genes that are differentially expressed throughout development, many of them related to melanocyte development, melanin synthesis, iridophore development, and guanine synthesis. In addition, we identify the pteridine synthesis pathway (including genes such as qdpr and xdh) as a key driver of the variation in color between morphs of these species. Finally, we hypothesize that genes in the keratin family are important for producing different structural colors within these frogs.",
