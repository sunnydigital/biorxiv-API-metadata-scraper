    "abstract": "Forest ecosystems are increasingly challenged by extreme events, e.g. drought, storms, pest and pathogenic fungi outbreaks, causing severe ecological and economical losses. Understanding the genetic basis of adaptive traits in tree species is of key importance to preserve forest ecosystems, as genetic variation in a trait (i.e. heritability) determines its potential for human-mediated or evolutionary change. Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), a conifer widely distributed in southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa, grows under contrasted environmental conditions promoting local adaptation. Genetic variation at adaptive phenotypes, including height, growth phenology and susceptibility to two fungal pathogens (Diplodia sapinea and Armillaria ostoyae) and an insect pest (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), were assessed in a range-wide clonal common garden of maritime pine. Broad-sense heritability was significant for height (0.219), growth phenology (0.165-0.310) and pathogen susceptibility (necrosis length caused by D. sapinea, 0.152; and by A. ostoyae, 0.021) measured after inoculation under controlled conditions, but not for pine processionary moth incidence in the common garden. The correlations of trait variation among populations revealed contrasting trends for pathogen susceptibility to D. sapinea and A. ostoyae with respect to height. Taller trees showed longer necrosis length caused by D. sapinea while shorter trees were more affected by A. ostoyae. Moreover, maritime pine populations from areas with high summer temperatures and frequent droughts were less susceptible to D. sapinea but more susceptible to A. ostoyae. Finally, an association study using 4,227 genome-wide SNPs revealed several loci significantly associated to each trait (range of 3-26), including a possibly disease-induced translation initiation factor, eIF-5. This study provides important insights to develop genetic conservation and breeding strategies integrating species responses to biotic stressors.",

    "abstract": "Capillary Morphogenesis Gene 2 protein (CMG2) is a transmembrane, integrin-like receptor and the primary receptor for the anthrax toxin. In addition to its role as an anthrax toxin receptor, CMG2 has been repeatedly shown to play a role in angiogenic processes. However, the molecular mechanism mediating observed CMG2-related angiogenic effects has not been fully elucidated. Previous studies have found that CMG2 binds type IV collagen (Col-IV), a key component of the vascular basement membrane, as well as other ECM proteins. Currently, no link has been made between these CMG2-ECM interactions and angiogenesis; however, ECM fragments are known to play a role in regulating angiogenesis. Here, we further characterize the CMG2-Col-IV interaction and explore the effect of this interaction on angiogenesis. Using a peptide array, we observed that CMG2 preferentially binds peptide fragments of the NC1 (non-collagenous domain 1) domains of Col-IV. These domains are also known as the fragments arresten (from the 1 chain) and canstatin (from the 2 chain) and have documented antiangiogenic properties. A second peptide array was probed to map a putative binding epitope. A top hit from the initial array, a canstatin-derived peptide, binds to the CMG2 ligand-binding von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain with sub-micromolar affinity (peptide S16, Kd = 400 {+/-} 200 nM). This peptide competes with anthrax protective antigen (PA) for CMG2 binding, and does not bind CMG2 in the presence of EDTA. Together these data suggest that, like PA, S16 interacts with CMG2 at the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) of its vWA domain. We demonstrate that CMG2 specifically mediates endocytic uptake of S16, since CMG2-/- endothelial cells show markedly reduced S16 uptake, without reducing total endocytosis. Furthermore, we show that S16 reduces endothelial migration but not cell proliferation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a Col IV-derived anti-angiogenic peptide acts via CMG2, suggesting a possible link between CMG2-Col IV interactions and angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are terminal, degradative organelles of the endosomal pathway that undergo repeated fusion-fission cycles with themselves, endosomes, phagosomes, and autophagosomes. Lysosome number and size depends on balanced fusion and fission rates. Thus, conditions that favour fusion over fission can reduce lysosome numbers while enlarging their size. Conversely, favouring fission over fusion may cause lysosome fragmentation and increase their numbers. PIKfyve is a phosphoinositide kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate to modulate lysosomal functions. PIKfyve inhibition causes an increase in lysosome size and reduction in lysosome number, consistent with lysosome coalescence. This is thought to proceed through reduced lysosome reformation and/or fission after fusion with endosomes or other lysosomes. Previously, we observed that photo-damage during live-cell imaging prevented lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition. Thus, we postulated that lysosome fusion and/or fission dynamics are affected by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we show that ROS generated by various independent mechanisms all impaired lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition and accelerated lysosome fragmentation during re-activation. However, depending on the ROS species or mode of production, lysosome dynamics were affected distinctly. H2O2 impaired lysosome motility and reduced lysosome fusion with phagosomes, suggesting that H2O2 reduces lysosome fusogenecity. In comparison, inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, glutathione, and thioredoxin that produce superoxide, did not impair lysosome motility but instead promoted clearance of actin puncta on lysosomes formed during PIKfyve inhibition. Additionally, actin depolymerizing agents prevented lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition. Thus, we discovered that ROS can generally prevent lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition using distinct mechanisms depending on the type of ROS.",

    "abstract": "Protein-correlation-profiling (PCP), in combination with quantitative proteomics, has emerged as a high-throughput method for the rapid identification of dynamic protein complexes in native conditions. While PCP has been successfully applied to soluble proteomes, characterization of the membrane interactome has lagged, partly due to the necessary use of detergents to maintain protein solubility. Here, we apply the peptidisc, a  one-size fits all membrane mimetic, for the capture of the Escherichia coli cell envelope proteome and its high-resolution fractionation in the absence of detergent. Analysis of the SILAC-labeled peptidisc library via PCP allows generation of over 4900 possible binary interactions out of >700,000 random associations. Using well-characterized membrane protein systems such as the SecY translocon, the Bam complex and the MetNI transporter, we find our dataset very useful for identifying transient and surprisingly novel protein interactions. For example, we discover a trans-periplasmic super-complex comprising subunits of the Bam and Sec translocons, including membrane-bound chaperones YfgM and PpiD. We identify RcsF and OmpA as bone fide interactors of BamA, and we show that interaction of MetQ with the ABC transporter MetNI depends on its N-terminal lipid anchor. We also discover NlpA as a novel interactor of MetNIQ. Most of these interactions are largely undetected by standard detergent-based purification. Together, the peptidisc workflow applied to the proteomic field is emerging as a promising novel approach to characterize membrane protein interactions under native expression conditions and without genetic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Ticks are strict hematophagous arthropods and are the most important vectors of pathogens affecting both domestic and wild animals worldwide. Moreover, they are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of human pathogens. Hard tick feeding is a slow process--taking up to several days for repletion prior to detachment--and necessitates extended control over the host response. The success of the feeding process depends upon injection of saliva by tick, which not only controls host haemostasis and wound healing, but also subverts the host immune response to avoid tick rejection during this long-lasting process. In turn, the manipulation of the host immune response creates a favourable niche for the survival and propagation of diverse tick-borne pathogens transmitted during feeding. Here, we report on the molecular and biochemical features and functions of IrSPI, an Ixodes ricinus salivary serine protease inhibitor involved in blood meal acquisition. Our results show that IrSPI harbours the typical conformational fold of Kunitz type I serine protease inhibitors and that it functionally inhibits the elastase and, to a lesser extent, chymotrypsin. We also show that IrSPI is injected into the host during feeding. Crucially, we found that IrSPI has no impact on tissue factor pathway-induced coagulation, fibrinolysis, apoptosis, or angiogenesis, but a strong effect on immune cells. IrSPI affects antigen-presenting macrophages by hampering IL-5 production. In addition, IrSPI represses proliferation of mitogen-stimulated CD4+ cells. The inhibition of T cell proliferation was associated with marked reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Our study contributes valuable knowledge to tick-host interactions and provides insights that could be further exploited to design anti-tick vaccines targeting this immunomodulator implicated in successful I. ricinus tick feeding.\\n\\nAuthor summaryTicks are the most important vector influencing both human and animal health in Europe, where Ixodes ricinus is the most abundant tick species. Ticks feed on animal or human blood for an extended period, during which their saliva allows both feeding and pathogen transmission by interfering with native host responses. A better understanding of tick-host-pathogen interactions is central to the discovery of improved control methods. Within this context, we previously identified IrSPI as an I. ricinus salivary molecule implicated in both tick feeding and bacterial transmission. This serine protease inhibitor was almost characterised as an elastase inhibitor, and here, we show IrSPI overexpression in several tick organs--especially salivary glands--during blood feeding. We demonstrate that IrSPI is injected into the host through saliva, and despite having no impact on endothelial cell angiogenesis or apoptosis during blood feeding, we report an immunomodulatory role, whereby CD4+ T lymphocyte proliferation is repressed and where the cytokine secretion pattern of both splenocytes and macrophages is modified. Our study provides new insights into the complex armament developed by ticks to overcome the host response, and uncovers a potential vaccine target for disruption of feeding processes and pathogen transmission.",

We collected the surveillance data of 164 countries from 2010 to 2018 using the FluNet database. Data for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the U.S. were collected from the Fluview database. This cross-correlation study identified the time lag between the two time-series. Deep learning was performed to forecast ILI, total influenza, A, and B viruses after 26 weeks in the U.S. The seasonal influenza patterns in Australia and Chile showed a high correlation with those of the U.S. 22 weeks and 28 weeks earlier, respectively. The R2 score of DNN models for ILI for validation set in 2015-2019 was 0.722 despite how hard it is to forecast 26 weeks ahead. Our prediction models forecast that the ILI for the U.S. in 2018-2019 may be later and less severe than those in 2017-2018, judging from the influenza activity for Australia and Chile in 2018. It allows to estimate peak timing, peak intensity, and type-specific influenza activities for next season at 40th week. The correlation for seasonal influenza among Australia, Chile, and the U.S. could be used to decide on influenza vaccine strategy six months ahead in the U.S.",

    "abstract": "Benthic cyanobacterial proliferations in rivers are have been reported with increasing frequency worldwide. In the Eel and Russian rivers of California, more than a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin toxicosis since 2000. Periphyton proliferations in these rivers comprise multiple cyanobacterial taxa capable of cyanotoxin production, hence there is uncertainty regarding which taxa are producing toxins. In this study, periphyton samples dominated by the cyanobacterial genera Anabaena spp. and Microcoleus spp. and the green alga Cladophora glomerata were collected from four sites in the Eel River catchment and one site in the Russian River. Samples were analysed for potential cyanotoxin producers using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in concert with Sanger sequencing. Cyanotoxin concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry, and anatoxin quota determined using droplet digital PCR. Sequencing indicated Microcoleus sp. and Nodularia sp. were the putative producers of anatoxins and nodularins, respectively, regardless of the dominant taxa in the mat. Anatoxin concentrations in the mat samples varied from 0.1 to 18.6 g g-1 and were significantly different among sites (p < 0.01, Wilcoxon test); however, anatoxin quotas were less variable (< 5-fold). Dihydroanatoxin-a was generally the most abundant variant in samples comprising 38% to 71% of the total anatoxins measured. Mats dominated by the green alga C. glomerata contained both anatoxins and nodularin-R at concentrations similar to those of cyanobacteria-dominated mats. This highlights that even when cyanobacteria are not the dominant taxa in periphyton, these mats may still pose a serious health risk and indicates that more widespread monitoring of all mats in a river are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Identifying and controlling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a high priority for researchers and public health officials. One critical component of this control effort is timely detection of emerging or increasing resistance using surveillance programs. Currently, detection of temporal changes in AMR relies mainly on analysis of the proportion of resistant isolates based on the dichotomization of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. In our work, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian latent class mixture model that incorporates a linear trend for the mean log2MIC of the non-resistant population. By introducing latent variables, our model addressed the challenges associated with the AMR MIC values, compensating for the censored nature of the MIC observations as well as the mixed components indicated by the censored MIC distributions. Inclusion of linear regression with time as a covariate in the hierarchical structure allowed modelling of the linear creep of the mean log2MIC in the non-resistant population. The hierarchical Bayesian model was accurate and robust as assessed in simulation studies. The proposed approach was illustrated using Salmonella enterica I,4,[5],12:i:- treated with chloramphenicol and ceftiofur in human and veterinary samples, revealing some significant linearly increasing patterns from the applications. Implementation of our approach to the analysis of an AMR MIC dataset would provide surveillance programs with a more complete picture of the changes in AMR over years by exploring the patterns of the mean resistance level in the non-resistant population. Our model could therefore serve as a timely indicator of a need for antibiotic intervention before an outbreak of resistance, highlighting the relevance of this work for public health. Currently, however, due to extreme right censoring on the MIC data, this approach has limited utility for tracking changes in the resistant population.",

    "abstract": "Across a broad spectrum of memory tasks, retention is superior following a night of sleep compared to a day of wake. However, this result alone does not clarify whether sleep merely slows the forgetting that would otherwise occur as a result of information processing during wakefulness, or whether sleep actually consolidates memories, protecting them from subsequent retroactive interference. Two influential studies (Ellenbogen, et al., 2006, 2009) suggested that sleep protects memories against the subsequent retroactive interference that occurs when participants learn new yet overlapping information (interference learning). In these studies, interference was much less detrimental to memory following a night of sleep compared to a day of wakefulness, a finding that provided strong evidence that sleep supports this important aspect of memory consolidation. In the current well-powered replication study, we repeated the protocol of Ellenbogen, et al. (2009) and, additionally, we examined the impact of intrinsic motivation on performance in sleep and wake participants. We were unable to replicate the finding that sleep protects memories against retroactive interference, with the detrimental effects of interference learning being essentially the same in wake and sleep participants. We also found that while intrinsic motivation benefitted task acquisition it was not a modulator of sleep-wake differences in memory processing. These finding of this replication study draw into question the claim that sleep protects memories against the effects of retroactive interference, and moreover, they highlight the importance of replicating key findings in the study of sleeps impact on memory processing before drawing strong conclusions that drive the direction of future research.",

    "abstract": "Osteomyelitis, or bone infection, is often induced by antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains of bacteria. Although debridement and long-term administration of antibiotics are the gold standard for osteomyelitis treatment, the increase in prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains limits the ability of clinicians to effectively treat infection. Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that effectively lyse bacteria, have gained recent attention for their high specificity, non-toxicity, and the low likelihood of resistance development by pathogens. Previously, we have shown that CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing techniques could be utilized to expand bacteriophage host range and enhance bactericidal activity through modification of the tail fiber protein, as well as improve safety with removal of major virulence genes. In a dermal infection study, these CRISPR-Cas9 phages reduced bacterial load relative to unmodified phage. Thus, we hypothesized this bacteriophage would be effective to mitigate infection from a biofilm forming S. aureus strain in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, qualitative fluorescent imaging demonstrated superiority of phage to conventional vancomycin and fosfomycin antibiotics against S. aureus biofilm. Quantitative antibiofilm effects increased over time for fosfomycin, phage, and fosfomycin-phage (dual) therapeutics delivered via alginate hydrogel. We developed an in vivo rat model of osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection that was reproducible and challenging and enabled longitudinal monitoring of infection progression. Using this model, phage (with and without fosfomycin) delivered via alginate hydrogel were successful in reducing soft tissue infection but not bone infection, based on bacteriological, histological, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Notably, the efficacy of phage at mitigating soft tissue infection was equal to that of high dose fosfomycin. Future research may utilize this model as a platform for evaluation of therapeutic type and dose, and alternate delivery vehicles for osteomyelitis mitigation.",

For aminoglycoside resistance, rmtB was positive for 31.7% of the isolates, of which 30% were co-harboring carbapenemases. Further, the FimH types and virulence gene profile positively correlated with the SNP based phylogeny, which also revealed the evolution of MDR clones among the study population with temporal accumulation of SNPs. The predominant clone was ST167 (blaNDM lineage) followed by ST405 (global clone ST131 equivalent) and ST410 (fast spreading high risk clone).\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first report on the whole genome analysis of MDR E. coli lineages circulating in India.

    "abstract": "Sleep is a fundamental homeostatic process within the animal kingdom. Although various brain areas and cell types are involved in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, it is still unclear how different pathways between neural populations contribute to its regulation. Here we address this issue by investigating the behavior of a simplified network model upon synaptic weight manipulations. Our model consists of three neural populations connected by excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Activity in each population is described by a firing-rate model, which determines the state of the network. Namely wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or non-REM (NREM) sleep. By systematically manipulating the synaptic weight of every pathway, we show that even this simplified model exhibits non-trivial behaviors: for example, the wake-promoting population contributes not just to the induction and maintenance of wakefulness, but also to sleep induction. Although a recurrent excitatory connection of the REM-promoting population is essential for REM sleep genesis, this recurrent connection does not necessarily contribute to the maintenance of REM sleep. The duration of NREM sleep can be shortened or extended by changes in the synaptic strength of the pathways from the NREM-promoting population. In some cases, there is an optimal range of synaptic strengths that affect a particular state, implying that the amount of manipulations, not just direction (i.e., activation or inactivation), needs to be taken into account. These results demonstrate pathway-dependent regulation of sleep dynamics and highlight the importance of systems-level quantitative approaches for sleep-wake regulatory circuits.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySleep is essential and ubiquitous across animal species. Over the past half-century, various brain areas, cell types, neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides have been identified as part of a sleep-wake regulating circuitry in the brain. However, it is less explored how individual neural pathways contribute to the sleep-wake cycle. In the present study, we investigate the behavior of a computational model by altering the strength of connections between neuronal populations. This computational model is comprised of a simple network where three neuronal populations are connected together, and the activity of each population determines the current state of the model, that is, wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep or non-REM (NREM) sleep. When we alter the connection strength of each pathway, we observe that the effect of such alterations on the sleep-wake cycle is highly pathway-dependent. Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms of sleep-wake regulation, and our computational approach can complement future biological experiments.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis in advanced cholestatic and end-stage liver disease is related to low bone formation. Previous studies have demonstrated the deleterious consequences of lithocholic acid (LCA) and bilirubin on osteoblastic cells. These effects are partially or completely neutralized by ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We have assessed the differential gene expression of osteoblastic cells under different culture conditions. The experiments were performed in human osteosarcoma cells (Saos-2) cultured with LCA 10 M), bilirubin (50 M) or UDCA (10 and 100 M) at 2 and 24 hours. Expression of 87 genes related to bone metabolism and other signalling pathways were assessed by TaqMan micro fluidic cards. Several genes were up-regulated by LCA, most of them pro-apoptotic (BAX, BCL10, BCL2L13, BCL2L14), but also MGP (matrix Gla protein), BGLAP (osteocalcin), SPP1 (osteopontin) and CYP24A1, and down-regulated bone morphogenic protein genes (BMP3 and BMP4) and DKK1 (Dickkopf-related protein 1). Parallel effects were observed with bilirubin, which up-regulated apoptotic genes and CSF2 (colony-stimulating factor 2) and down-regulated antiapoptotic genes (BCL2 and BCL2L1), BMP3, BMP4 and RUNX2. UDCA 100 M had specific consequences since differential expression was observed, up-regulating BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, CALCR (calcitonin receptor), SPOCK3 (osteonectin), BGLAP (osteocalcin) and SPP1 (osteopontin), and down-regulating pro-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, most of the differential expression changes induced by both LCA and bilirubin were partially or completely neutralized by UDCA. Conclusion: Our observations reveal novel target genes, whose regulation by retained substances of cholestasis may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of osteoporosis in cholestatic and end-stage liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation of IDUA gene. IDUA codes for -L-iduronidase (IDUA), a lysosomal hydrolase that degrades glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate. GAGs are structural and signalling molecules that have a crucial role in controlling a variety of cell functions and their interaction with extracellular matrix. Because of GAGs widespread action in cellular metabolism, MPS I is a progressive and disabling multisystemic disorder. Nowadays, the therapies availability allowed patients to reach the adult life and the consequences of the disease in their reproductive system is still little known. We aimed to investigate whether IDUA disruption influences sexual behaviour and sexual steroid production in male and female MPS I mice. We used 3 and 6-month-old male and 3-month-old female Idua+/_ and Idua-/- mice to evaluate typical rodent copulatory behaviours. In males we observed the frequency and latency of mounts, intromissions and ejaculations. In females we evaluated the lordosis quotient. We also analysed the locomotor capacity of mice in the open field test, since copulatory behaviour requires mobility. We also quantified steroidal hormonal levels in plasmatic samples. We detected an increase in the latencies of intromissions in male copulatory behaviour of Idua-/- males when compared to Idua+/_. However, the number of intromissions was not statistically different between groups. No parameter of female sexual behaviour was statistically different between control and knockout females. In both sexes, we detected diminished mobility in Idua-/- mice. Plasma hormone levels did not differ between Idua+/_ and Idua-/- mice, both in males and females. We concluded that in the considered time point of MPS I progression, mice are able to perform sexual behaviour, but the male performance may be influenced due to the motor disability predicted to MPS I.",

    "abstract": "DNA barcoding is highly effective for identifying specimens once a reference sequence library is available for the species assemblage targeted for analysis. Despite the great need for an improved capacity to identify the insect pests of crops, the use of DNA barcoding is constrained by the lack of a well-parameterized reference library. The current study begins to address this limitation by developing a DNA barcode reference library for the pest aphids of Pakistan. It also examines the affinities of these taxa with conspecific taxa from other geographic regions based on both conventional taxonomy and Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). A total of 809 aphids were collected from 123 plant species at 87 sites across Pakistan. Morphological study and DNA barcoding allowed 774 specimens to be identified to one of 42 species while the others were placed to a genus or subfamily. The 801 sequences obtained from these specimens were assigned to 52 BINs whose monophyly were supported by neighbor-joining (NJ) clustering and Bayesian inference. The 42 species were assigned to 41 BINs with 38 showing BIN concordance; one species (Rhopalosiphum padi) was assigned to two BINs, while two others (Aphis affinis, Aphis gossypii) were assigned to the same BIN, while one species (Aphis astragalina) lacked a qualifying sequence. The 42 Linnaean species were represented on BOLD by 7,870 records from 69 countries. Combining these records with those from Pakistan produced to 60 BINs with 12 species showing a BIN split and three a BIN merger. Geo-distance correlations showed that intraspecific divergence values for 18 of 37 species were not affected by the distance between populations. Forty four of the 52 BINs from Pakistan had counterparts in 73 countries across six continents, documenting the broad distributions of pest aphids.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis shed light on the quantitative adaptive responses of feeding behaviour of Cattle (C) and Small Ruminants (SR), facing variations of sward characteristics, notably of sward height (SH, 18. 7 {+/-} 13.9 cm) and herbage bulk density (HBD, 1.73 {+/-} 1.30 kg DM / m3). All responses expressed a plateau stressing an adaptive limit with extreme values of SH and HBD. The minimum plateau of BR (46.9 {+/-} 14.6 min-1) is around 40 min-1, while IR values (different for C and SR, respectively 69.1 {+/-} 38.1 vs. 99.9 {+/-} 45.7 g/min/kg BW) ranged between a minimum and maximum plateau around 50 and 100 g/min/kg BW. Two other pasture management factors affect IR, namely forage allowance (10.16 {+/-} 6.0, DM % BW) and daily proportion of time spent grazing (0.30 {+/-} 0.08). The results obtained confirm the specifically key role of BM (1.80 {+/-} 127 mg DM/kg BW) on IR. The regressions are IR=145 (1-exp (-b BM), b being equal respectively for C and SR and C to 0.44 vs. 0.54. This literature review has also revealed fundamental differences in behaviour between C and SR although no study to date has attempted to compare them simultaneously. SR have to chew more (2.7 {+/-} 1.2 vs. 1.6 {+/-} 0.5 JM/bite) to ingest the same amount of DM per bite than C, expressed in relation to BW, which allow them to ingest slightly quickly.\\n\\nImplicationsThis article, following the previous one of Boval and Sauvant (2019), proposes a quantitative appraisal of the ingestive behaviour of grazing ruminants, based on studies published over 40 years, as well as well robust average values and relationships, considering inter- and intra-study effects and animal species specificities. This knowledge should contribute to a better overall understanding of the behavioural adaptation of ruminants at pasture, to the identification of key threshold values and appropriate parameters of interest to be considered, and to improve the efficiency and sensitivity of automatic devices, which are booming in the context of precision livestock farming at pasture.",

A prior knowledge-aided machine learning model was proposed, trained and tested on the transcriptomic profiles with matched CNA data of 9,740 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using brain tumors as a proof-of-concept study, CNAPE achieved over 90% accuracy in the prediction of arm-level CNAs. Prediction performance for 12 gene-level CNAs (commonly altered genes in glioma) was also evaluated, and CNAPE achieved reasonable accuracy.

    "abstract": "Variability in cell populations is frequently observed in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Intrinsic differences within populations of cells, such as differences in cell sizes or differences in rates of cell motility, can be present even within a population of cells from the same cell line. We refer to this variability as cell heterogeneity. Mathematical models of cell migration, for example, in the context of tumour growth and metastatic invasion, often account for both undirected (random) migration and directed migration that is mediated by cell-to-cell contacts and cell-to-cell adhesion. A key feature of standard models is that they often assume that the population is composed of identical cells with constant properties. This leads to relatively simple single-species homogeneous models that neglect the role of heterogeneity. In this work, we use a continuum modelling approach to explore the role of heterogeneity in spatial spreading of cell populations. We employ a three-species heterogeneous model of cell motility that explicitly incorporates different types of experimentally-motivated heterogeneity in cell sizes: (i) monotonically decreasing; (ii) uniform; (iii) non-monotonic; and (iv) monotonically increasing distributions of cell size. Comparing the density profiles generated by the three-species heterogeneous model with density profiles predicted by a more standard single-species homogeneous model reveals that when we are dealing with monotonically decreasing and uniform distributions a simple and computationally efficient single-species homogeneous model can be remarkably accurate in describing the evolution of a heterogeneous cell population. In contrast, we find that the simpler single-species homogeneous model performs relatively poorly when applied to non-monotonic and monotonically in-creasing distributions of cell sizes. Additional results for heterogeneity in parameters describing both undirected and directed cell migration are also considered, and we find that similar results apply.",

    "abstract": "Molecular and bioinformatics tools for research are very important for biodiversity characterization in contaminated environments due the presence of a high percentage of nonculturable microorganisms. The wide use of pesticides in agriculture exposes microbiomes to stressful and selective conditions that demand survival strategies such as biofilm formation. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the bacterial population structure in planktonic and biofilm communities of water that was used for washing the packaging of herbicides and stored for six months in tanks. This substance is highly contaminated waste. Samples of water and biofilms from tanks and biofilms developed for short times in flasks were used for DNA isolation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The physicochemical conditions imposed by water used for washing the containers were inadequate for killing the bacterial genera identified according to water and wastewater standards. The variation in population structure and diversity was lower in the planktonic samples than in the biofilm samples, indicating a possible combination of genetic drift and subsequent selection of individuals surviving under stressful water conditions, such as heating and contact with agrochemicals, over a six-month period. The biofilm formation in water tanks contaminated with pesticides enabled the survival of bacterial genera harboring the essential processes for adaptation to these environments; the presence of these processes was determined according to descriptions obtained from the genomic databases. This study suggests the potential of bacterial genera identified in biofilms obtained from tanks to adapt to contaminated environments through their metabolic complexity. Thus, herbicide biodegradation kinetics can be accessed through a culturable collection obtained from these communities.",

    "abstract": "Although somatic hybridization (SH) has been proposed as a means of accelerating rust pathogen virulence evolution in the absence of sexual recombination, previous studies are limited to the laboratory and none have revealed how this process happens. Using long-read sequencing, we generated dikaryotic phased genomes and annotations for three Australian field-collected isolates of the wheat leaf rust pathogen (Puccinia triticina; Pt), including a putative asexual hybrid (Pt64) and two putative parental isolates (Pt104 and Pt53; 132-141 Mb,155-176 contigs, N50 of 1.9-2.1 Mb). The genetic dissection based on the high-quality phased genomes including whole-genome alignments, phylogenetic and syntenic analyses along with short-read sequencing of 27 additional Pt isolates convergently demonstrated that Pt64, which rendered several commercial hybrid wheat cultivars susceptible to leaf rust, arose from SH between isolates within the Pt53 and Pt104 lineages. Parentage analysis demonstrated the role of mitotic crossover in the derivation of both nuclei of Pt64. Within HD mating type genes, the distinct specificity regions in Pt64 and the distinct phylogenetic pattern of the remaining admixed isolates suggested high genetic variation in specificity-related regions on the b locus intrinsically associated with the SH. This study not only provided a fundamental platform for investigating genomic variation underlying virulence evolution in one of the most devastating wheat pathogens, but also offered an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of naturally occurring SH. This asexual mechanism can be broadly exploited by any dikaryotic pathogen to accelerate virulence evolution, and understanding this process is both urgent and crucial for sustainable pathogen control.\\n\\nImportanceStrategies to manage plant rust pathogens are challenged by the constant emergence of new virulence. Although somatic hybridization has been proposed as a means by which rusts could overcome host resistance rapidly and cause crop loss, there is very little evidence of this process in nature and the mechanisms underlying it are not known. This study generated and analysed the first dikaryotic phased genomes of the wheat leaf rust pathogen, identifying an isolate as a hybrid and for the first time unveiling parasexuality via mitotic crossover in a rust pathogen. The erosion of the resistance of several hybrid wheat cultivars in agriculture by the hybrid rust has important implications for breeding efforts targeting durable resistance and sustained rust control.",

In this white paper, we describe Neuralinks first steps toward a scalable high-bandwidth BMI system. We have built arrays of small and flexible electrode \\\"threads\\\", with as many as 3,072 electrodes per array distributed across 96 threads. We have also built a neurosurgical robot capable of inserting six threads (192 electrodes) per minute. Each thread can be individually inserted into the brain with micron precision for avoidance of surface vasculature and targeting specific brain regions. The electrode array is packaged into a small implantable device that contains custom chips for low-power on-board amplification and digitization: the package for 3,072 channels occupies less than (23 x 18.5 x 2) mm3. A single USB-C cable provides full-bandwidth data streaming from the device, recording from all channels simultaneously. This system has achieved a spiking yield of up to 70% in chronically implanted electrodes.

While past electroencephalography (EEG) studies have considered both auditory and visual stimuli, the extent to which these results generalize to music--a temporally structured stimulus for which the brain has evolved specialized circuitry--is less understood. Here we investigated neural correlation during natural music listening by recording dense-array EEG responses from N = 48 adult listeners as they heard real-world musical works, some of which were temporally disrupted through shuffling of short-term segments (measures), reversal, or randomization of phase spectra. We measured neural correlation across responses (inter-subject correlation) and between responses and stimulus envelope fluctuations (stimulus-response correlation) in the time and frequency domains. Stimuli retaining basic musical features evoked significantly correlated neural responses in all analyses. However, while unedited songs were self-reported as most pleasant, time-domain correlations were highest during measure-shuffled versions. Frequency-domain measures of correlation (coherence) peaked at frequencies related to the musical beat, although the magnitudes of these spectral peaks did not explain the observed temporal correlations. Our findings show that natural music evokes significant inter-subject and stimulus-response correlations, and suggest that the neural correlates of musical engagement may be distinct from those of enjoyment.",

    "abstract": "Lung injury activates quiescent stem and progenitor cells to regenerate alveolar structures. The sequence and coordination of transcriptional programs during this process has largely remained elusive. Using single cell RNA-seq, we first generated a whole-organ birds-eye view on cellular dynamics and cell-cell communication networks during mouse lung regeneration from [~]30,000 cells at six timepoints. We discovered an injury-specific progenitor cell state characterized by Krt8 in flat epithelial cells covering alveolar surfaces. The number of these cells peaked during fibrogenesis in independent mouse models, as well as in human acute lung injury and fibrosis. Krt8+ progenitors featured a highly distinct connectome of receptor-ligand pairs with endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. To  sky dive into epithelial differentiation dynamics, we sequenced >30,000 sorted epithelial cells at 18 timepoints and computationally derived cell state trajectories that were validated by lineage tracing genetic reporter mice. Airway stem cells within the club cell lineage and alveolar type-2 cells underwent transcriptional convergence onto the same Krt8+ progenitor cell state, which later resolved by terminal differentiation into alveolar type-1 cells. We derived distinct transcriptional regulators as key switch points in this process and show that induction of TNF-alpha/NFkappaB, p53, and hypoxia driven gene expression programs precede a Sox4, Ctnnb1, and Wwtr1 driven switch towards alveolar type-1 cell fate. We show that epithelial cell plasticity can induce non-gradual transdifferentiation, involving intermediate progenitor cell states that may persist and promote disease if checkpoint signals for terminal differentiation are perturbed.",

However, little studies focused to the deleterious role of Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD) associated TREM2 variants. In order to get insights into the contributions of these variants in neurodegeneration, we investigated the influences of three well-known NHD associated TREM2 mutations (Y38C, T66M and V126G) on the loss-of-function by using conventional molecular dynamics simulation. Compared to the wild type, the mutants produced substantial differences in the collective motions in the loop regions, which not only promotes structural remodelling in complementarity-determining region 2 (CDR2) loop but also in CDR1 loop, through changing the inter and intra-loop hydrogen bonding network. In addition, the structural studies from free energy landscape showed that Y38, T66 and V126 are crucial for maintaining structural features of CDR1 and CDR2 loops, while their mutation at this position produced steric clash and thus contributes to the structural impact and loss of ligand binding. These results revealed that the presence of the mutations in TREM2 ectodomain induced flexibility and promotes structural alterations. Dynamical scenarios, which are provided by the present study, may be critical to our understanding of the role of the three TREM2 mutations in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "De novo genome assembly provides comprehensive, unbiased genomic information and makes it possible to gain insight into new DNA sequences not present in reference genomes. Many de novo human genomes have been published in the last few years, leveraging a combination of inexpensive short-read and single-molecule long-read technologies. As long-read DNA sequencers become more prevalent, the computational burden of generating assemblies persists as a critical factor. The most common approach to long-read assembly, using an overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm, requires all-to-all read comparisons, which quadratically scales in computational complexity with the number of reads. We assert that recently achievements in sequencing technology (i.e. with accuracy ~99% and read length ~10-15k) enables a fundamentally better strategy for OLC that is effectively linear rather than quadratic. Our genome assembly implementation, Peregrine uses sparse hierarchical minimizers (SHIMMER) to index reads thereby avoiding the need for an all-to-all read comparison step. Peregrine can assemble 30x human PacBio CCS read datasets in less than 30 CPU hours and around 100 wall-clock minutes to a high contiguity assembly (N50 > 20Mb). The continued advance of sequencing technologies coupled with the Peregrine assembler enables routine generation of human de novo assemblies. This will allow for population scale measurements of more comprehensive genomic variations -- beyond SNPs and small indels -- as well as novel applications requiring rapid access to de novo assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Transcription-factor (TF) proteins recognize specific genomic sequences, despite an overwhelming excess of non-specific DNA, to regulate complex gene expression programs1-3. While there have been significant advances in understanding how DNA sequence and shape contribute to recognition, some fundamental aspects of protein-DNA binding remain poorly understood2,3. Many DNA-binding proteins induce changes in the DNA structure outside the intrinsic B-DNA envelope. How the energetic cost associated with distorting DNA contributes to recognition has proven difficult to study and measure experimentally because the distorted DNA structures exist as low-abundance conformations in the naked B-DNA ensemble4-10. Here, we use a novel high-throughput assay called SaMBA (Saturation Mismatch-Binding Assay) to investigate the role of DNA conformational penalties in TF-DNA recognition. The approach introduces mismatched base-pairs (i.e. mispairs) within TF binding sites to pre-induce a variety of DNA structural distortions much larger than those induced by changes in Watson-Crick sequence. Strikingly, while most mismatches either weakened TF binding (~70%) or had negligible effects (~20%), approximately 10% of mismatches increased binding and at least one mismatch was found that increased the binding affinity for each of 21 examined TFs. Mismatches also converted sites from the non-specific affinity range into specific sites, and high-affinity sites into \\\"super-sites\\\" stronger than any known canonical binding site. These findings reveal a complex binding landscape that cannot be explained based on DNA sequence alone. Analysis of crystal structures together with NMR and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that many of the mismatches that increase binding induce distortions similar to those induced by TF binding, thus pre-paying some of the energetic cost to deform the DNA. Our work indicates that conformational penalties are a major determinant of protein-DNA recognition, and reveals mechanisms by which mismatches can recruit TFs and thus modulate replication and repair activities in the cell11,12.",

Furthermore, local membrane protrusions only form following local decreases in membrane proximal F-actin density.

AutoSP3 eliminates hands-on time and minimizes the risk of error, reduces variability in protein quantification and improves longitudinal performance and reproducibility. We demonstrate the distinguishing ability of autoSP3 to process low-input samples, reproducibly quantifying 500-1000 proteins from 100-1000 cells (<100 ng protein). Furthermore, we applied this approach to a cohort of clinical FFPE pulmonary adenocarcinoma (ADC) samples, and recapitulate their separation into known histological growth patterns based on proteome profiles.

Examination of Sox9 expression reveals that Sox9 is expressed in BPs of developing ferret and human, but not mouse neocortex. Functional studies by conditional Sox9 expression in the mouse BP lineage demonstrate increased BP proliferation, reduced Tbr2 and induction of Olig2 expression, indicative of premature gliogenesis. Conditional Sox9 expression also results in cell non-autonomous stimulation of BP proliferation followed by increased production of upper-layer neurons.

    "abstract": "Diatoms are a major component of phytoplankton, believed to be responsible for around 20% of the annual primary production on Earth. As abundant and ubiquitous organisms, they are known to establish biotic interactions with many other members of the plankton. Through analysis of co-occurrence networks derived from the Tara Oceans expedition that take into account the importance of both biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the spatial distributions of species, we show that only 13% of diatom pairwise associations are driven by environmental conditions, whereas the vast majority are independent of abiotic factors. In contrast to most other plankton groups, at a global scale diatoms display a much higher proportion of negative correlations with other organisms, particularly towards potential predators and parasites, suggesting that their biogeography is constrained by top down pressure. Genus level analyses indicate that abundant diatoms are not necessarily the most connected, and that species-specific abundance distribution patterns lead to negative associations with other organisms. In order to move forward in the biological interpretation of co-occurrence networks, an open access extensive literature survey of diatom biotic interactions was compiled, of which 18.5% were recovered in the computed network. This result reveals the extent of what likely remains to be discovered in the field of planktonic biotic interactions, even for one of the best known organismal groups.\\n\\nImportanceDiatoms are key phytoplankton in the modern ocean involved in numerous biotic interactions, ranging from symbiosis to predation and viral infection, which have considerable effects on global biogeochemical cycles. However, despite recent large-scale studies of plankton, we are still lacking a comprehensive picture of the diversity of diatom biotic interactions in the marine microbial community. Through the ecological interpretation of both inferred microbial association networks and available knowledge on diatom interactions compiled in an open access database, we propose an eco-systems level understanding of diatom interactions in the ocean.",

    "abstract": "Recombination generates genetic diversity but the number of crossovers per meiosis is limited in most species. Previous studies showed that increasing recombination can enhance response to selection. However, such studies did not assume a specific method of modifying recombination. Our objective was to test whether two methods used to increase recombination in plants could increase the genetic gain in a population undergoing genomic selection. The first method, in Oryza sativa, used a mutant of anti-crossover genes to increase global recombination without affecting the recombination landscape. The second one uses the ploidy level of a cross between Brassica rapa and Brassica napus to increase the recombination particularly in pericentromeric regions. These recombination landscapes were used to model recombination while quantitative trait loci positions were based on the actual gene distribution. We simulated selection programs with initially a cross between two inbred lines, for two species. Increased recombination enhanced the response to selection. The amount of enhancement in the cumulative gain largely depended on the species and the number of quantitative trait loci (2, 10, 20, 50, 200 or 1000 per chromosome). Genetic gains were increased up to 30% after 20 generations. Furthermore, modifying the recombination landscape was the most effective: the gain was larger by 25% with the first method and 33% with the second one in B. rapa, and 15% compared to 11% in O. sativa. Thus, increased recombination enhances the genetic gain in genomic selection for long-term selection programs, with visible effects after four to five generations.",

    "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Escherichia coli have been historically managed with oral antibiotics including the cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The use of these agents is being compromised by the increase in extended spectrum {beta}-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, mostly caused by the emergence and clonal expansion of E. coli multilocus sequence typing (ST) 131. In addition, ESBL isolates show co-resistance to many of oral agents. Management of UTIs caused by ESBL and fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms is becoming increasingly challenging to treat outside of the hospital setting with clinicians having to resort to intravenous agents. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of ESBL phenotypes and genotypes among UTI isolates of E. coli collected in the US during 2017 as well as the impact of co-resistance to oral agents such as the fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The national prevalence of ESBL phenotypes of E. coli was 15.7% and was geographically distributed across all nine Census regions. Levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistance rates were [&ge;] 24% among all isolates and this co-resistance phenotype was considerably higher among isolates showing an ESBL phenotype ([&ge;] 59.2%) and carrying blaCTX-M-15 ([&ge;] 69.5%). The agents with the highest potency against UTI isolates of E. coli, including ESBL isolates showing cross-resistance across oral agents, were the intravenous carbapenems. The results of this study indicate that new oral options with the spectrum and potency similar to the intravenous carbapenems would address a significant unmet need for the treatment of UTIs in an era of emergence and clonal expansion of ESBL isolates resistant to several classes of antimicrobial agents, including oral options.",

    "abstract": "Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a broad-spectrum antiseptic widely used in community and clinical contexts for many years, recently acquiring higher relevance in nosocomial infections control worldwide. Despite of this, CHX tolerance has been poorly understood among Enterococcus faecium, one of the leading agents causing nosocomial infections. This study provides new phenotypic and molecular data for a better identification of CHX tolerant E. faecium subpopulations in community and clinical contexts. MICCHX distribution of 106 E. faecium suggested the occurrence of tolerant subpopulations in diverse sources (human, animal, food, environment) and phylogenomic backgrounds (clades A1/A2/B), with predominance in clade A1. They carried a specific variant of 2CS-CHXT operon, here identified. It encodes a glucose and an amino-acid-polyamine-organocation family transporters, besides the DNA-binding-response-regulator ChtR with a P102H mutation previously described in only CHX tolerant clade A1 E. faecium, and the ChtS sensor. Combined data from normal MIC distribution and 2CS-CHXT operon characterization supports a tentative epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) of 8 mg/L to CHX, useful to detect tolerant E. faecium populations in future surveillance studies. The spread of tolerant E. faecium in diverse epidemiological backgrounds alerts for a prudent use of CHX in multiple contexts.\\n\\nImportanceChlorhexidine is one of the substances included in the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines which comprises the safest and most effective medicines needed in global health systems. Although it has been widely applied as a disinfectant and antiseptic since the 1950s in healthcare (skin, hands, mouthwashes, eye drops), its use in hospitals to prevent nosocomial infections has increased worldwide in recent years. Here we provide a comprehensive study on chlorhexidine tolerance among Enterococcus faecium, one of the leading nosocomial agents worldwide, and identified a novel 2CS-CHXT operon as a signature of tolerant strains occurring in diverse phylogenomic groups. Finally, our data allowed to propose a tentative epidemiological cut-off of 8 mg/L, useful to detect tolerant E. faecium populations in future surveillance studies in community and clinical contexts.",

Their central function is to produce cellular energy through the OXPHOS system, and functional alterations provoke so-called mitochondrial OXPHOS diseases. It is estimated that several hundred mitochondrial proteins have unknown functions. Very recently, C6orf203 was described to participate in mitochondrial transcription under induced mitochondrial DNA depletion stress conditions. Here, we describe another role for C6orf203, specifically in OXPHOS biogenesis under regular culture conditions. HEK293T C6orf203-Knockout (KO) cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing showed both reduced grow in galactose, as a carbon source, and in their oxygen consumption capability, strongly suggesting an OXPHOS dysfunction. C6orf203-KO also provoked a depletion of OXPHOS proteins and decreased the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. C6orf203 was present in high molecular weight complexes compatible with mitoribosomes, and in vivo labelling of de novo mitochondrial proteins synthesis revealed that C6orf203-KO severely but not completely affected the translation of mitochondrial mRNAs. Taken together, we describe herein a new function for C6orf203, making it a potential OXPHOS disease-related candidate.",

    "abstract": "A Drosophila egg chamber is comprised of a germline cyst surrounded by a tightly-organised epithelial monolayer, the follicular epithelium (FE). Loss of integrin function from the FE disrupts epithelial organisation at egg chamber termini, but the cause of this phenotype remains unclear. Here we show that the {beta}-integrin Myospheroid (Mys) is only required during early oogenesis when the pre-follicle cells form the FE. mys mutants disrupt both the formation of a monolayered epithelium at egg chamber termini and the morphogenesis of the stalk between adjacent egg chambers, which develops through the intercalation of two rows of cells into a single-cell wide stalk. Secondary epithelia, like the FE, have been proposed to require adhesion to the basement membrane to polarise. However, Mys is not required for pre-follicle cell polarisation, as both follicle and stalk cells localise polarity factors correctly, despite being mispositioned. Instead, loss of integrins causes pre-follicle cells to basally constrict, detach from the basement membrane and become internalised. Thus, integrin function is dispensable for pre-follicle cell polarity but is required to maintain cellular organisation and cell shape during morphogenesis.",

Neural crest, a multipotent stem cell population, is thought to be specified from the ectoderm, but its varied contributions defy canons of segregation potential and challenges its embryonic origin. Aiming to resolve this conflict, we have assayed the earliest specification of neural crest using blastula stage chick embryos. Specification assays on isolated chick epiblast explants identify an intermediate region specified towards the neural crest cell fate. Furthermore, low density culture suggests that the specification of intermediate cells towards the neural crest lineage is independent of contact mediated induction. Finally, we have validated the regional identity of the intermediate region towards the neural crest cell fate using fate map studies in blastula stage chick embryos. Our results suggest a model of neural crest specification at blastula stage, with restricted ectoderm and mesoderm capacities.",

Spinal pathologies such as idiopathic back pain, vertebral compression fractures and intervertebral disc failure affect millions of people world-wide. Animal models can help us to understand the disease process, and zebrafish are increasingly used as they are highly genetically tractable, their spines are axially loaded like humans, and they show similar pathologies to humans during ageing. However biomechanical models for the zebrafish are largely lacking. Here we describe the results of loading intact zebrafish spinal motion segments on a material testing stage within a micro Computed Tomography machine. We show that vertebrae and their arches show predictable patterns of deformation prior to their ultimate failure, in a pattern dependent on their position within the segment. We further show using geometric morphometrics which regions of the vertebra deform the most during loading, and that Finite Element models of the trunk subjected reflect the real patterns of deformation and strain seen during loading and can therefore be used as a predictive model for biomechanical performance.",

While Illumina(R) and Ion Torrent(R) sequencing platforms are used extensively for generating viral RNA genome sequences, there is limited data comparing different platforms. We evaluated the Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM and Ion Torrent S5 platforms using a panel of sixteen specimens containing picornaviruses and human caliciviruses (noroviruses and sapoviruses). The specimens were processed, using combinations of three library preparation and five sequencing kits, to assess the quality and completeness of assembled viral genomes, and an estimation of cost per sample to generate the data was calculated. The choice of library preparation kit and sequencing platform was found to impact the breadth of genome coverage and accuracy of consensus viral genomes. The Ion Torrent S5 outperformed the older Ion Torrent PGM platform in data quality and cost, and generated the highest proportion of reads for enterovirus D68 samples. However, indels at homopolymer regions impacted the accuracy of consensus genome sequences. For lower throughput sequencing runs (i.e., Ion Torrent 510 or Illumina MiSeq Nano V2), the cost per sample was lower on the MiSeq platform, whereas with higher throughput runs (Ion Torrent 530 or Illumina MiSeq V2) the cost per sample was comparable.

Dynamic changes in gases are important cues for plants to sense environmental perturbations, such as submergence. In Arabidopsis thaliana, changes in oxygen and nitric oxide (NO) control the stability of ERFVII transcription factors. ERFVII proteolysis is regulated by the N-degron pathway and mediates adaptation to flooding-induced hypoxia. However, how plants detect and transduce early submergence signals remains elusive. Here we show that plants can rapidly detect submergence through passive ethylene entrapment and use this signal to pre-adapt to impending hypoxia. Ethylene can enhance ERFVII stability prior to hypoxia by increasing the NO-scavenger PHYTOGLOBIN1. This ethylene-mediated NO depletion and consequent ERFVII accumulation pre-adapts plants to survive subsequent hypoxia. Our results reveal the biological link between three gaseous signals for the regulation of flooding survival and identifies novel regulatory targets for early stress perception that could be pivotal for developing flood-tolerant crops.",

A common approach to analyse these models are elementary flux modes (EFMs), which correspond to minimal functional units in the network. Already for medium-sized networks, it is often impossible to compute the set of all EFMs, due to their huge number. From a practical point of view, this might also not be necessary because a subset of EFMs may already be sufficient to answer relevant biological questions. In this article, we study MEMos or minimum sets of EFMs that can generate all possible steady-state behaviours of a metabolic network. The number of EFMs in a MEMo may be by several orders of magnitude smaller than the total number of EFMs. Using MEMos, we can compute generating sets of EFMs in metabolic networks where the whole set of EFMs is too large to be enumerated.",

    "abstract": "The Viking maritime expansion from Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) marks one of the swiftest and most far-flung cultural transformations in global history. During this time (c. 750 to 1050 CE), the Vikings reached most of western Eurasia, Greenland, and North America, and left a cultural legacy that persists till today. To understand the genetic structure and influence of the Viking expansion, we sequenced the genomes of 442 ancient humans from across Europe and Greenland ranging from the Bronze Age (c. 2400 BC) to the early Modern period (c. 1600 CE), with particular emphasis on the Viking Age. We find that the period preceding the Viking Age was accompanied by foreign gene flow into Scandinavia from the south and east: spreading from Denmark and eastern Sweden to the rest of Scandinavia. Despite the close linguistic similarities of modern Scandinavian languages, we observe genetic structure within Scandinavia, suggesting that regional population differences were already present 1,000 years ago. We find evidence for a majority of Danish Viking presence in England, Swedish Viking presence in the Baltic, and Norwegian Viking presence in Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland. Additionally, we see substantial foreign European ancestry entering Scandinavia during the Viking Age. We also find that several of the members of the only archaeologically well-attested Viking expedition were close family members. By comparing Viking Scandinavian genomes with present-day Scandinavian genomes, we find that pigmentation-associated loci have undergone strong population differentiation during the last millennia. Finally, we are able to trace the allele frequency dynamics of positively selected loci with unprecedented detail, including the lactase persistence allele and various alleles associated with the immune response. We conclude that the Viking diaspora was characterized by substantial foreign engagement: distinct Viking populations influenced the genomic makeup of different regions of Europe, while Scandinavia also experienced increased contact with the rest of the continent.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance results from several pathophysiologic mechanisms, including chronic tissue inflammation and defective insulin signaling. Pancreatic {beta}-cells hypersecretion (hyperinsulinemia), is a central hallmark of peripheral insulin resistance. However, the underlying mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia perpetuates towards the development of insulin resistance remains unclear and is still a bigger therapeutic challenge. Here, we found hyperinsulinemia triggers inflammation and insulin resistance by stimulating TLR4-driven inflammatory cascades. We show that hyperinsulinemia activates the TLR4 signaling through HMGB1, an endogenous TLR4 ligand emanating from hyperinsulinemia exposed immune cells and peripheral organs like adipose tissue and liver. Further, our observation suggests hyperinsulinemia ensuring hyperacetylation, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shuttling and release of HMGB1 into the extracellular space. HMGB1 was also found to be elevated in serum of T2DM patients. We found that extracellular HMGB1 plays a crucial role to promote proinflammatory responses and provokes systemic insulin resistance. Importantly, in-vitro and in-vivo treatment with naltrexone, a TLR4 antagonist led to an anti-inflammatory phenotype with protection from hyperinsulinemia mediated insulin resistance. In-vitro treatment with naltrexone directly enhanced SIRT1 activity, blocked the release of HMGB1 into extracellular milieu, suppressed release of proinflammatory cytokines and ultimately led to insulin-sensitizing effects. These observations elucidate a regulatory network between pancreatic {beta}-cells, macrophage and hepatocytes and assign an unexpected role of TLR4 - HMGB1 signaling axis in hyperinsulinemia mediated systemic insulin resistance.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Many regulatory networks involve (possibly partially) redundant cis-regulatory elements. These elements are commonly referred to as shadow enhancers and have been assumed to mainly originate by sequence duplication. An alternative mechanism that has not been examined involves the independent exaptation of transposons. Here, we identified 2,117 and 2,787 pairs of shadow enhancers in the human and mouse genomes, respectively, and found that 34% and 18% of these pairs derive from transposons. Moreover, we show that virtually all the enhancer partners of these transposon-derived shadow enhancer pairs are independent exaptations from different transposon types and hypothesize that the increase in the expression and tissue-specificity of their targets as compared to those of non-shadow enhancers facilitates their fixation in the genome. Finally, we provide evidence that the regulatory redundancy observed in many mammalian regulatory networks is predominantly driven by convergent evolution, since shadow enhancers are hardly ever conserved across species.",

    "abstract": "Response inhibition refers to the suppression of prepared or initiated actions. Typically, the go/no-go task (GNGT) or the stop signal task (SST) are used interchangeably to capture individual differences in response inhibition. Yet, there is some controversy if these tasks assess similar inhibitory processes. We extracted the time-courses of sensory, motor, attentional, and cognitive control networks by group independent component (G-ICA) analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data from both tasks. Additionally, electromyography (EMG) from the responding effector muscles was recorded to detect the timing of response inhibition. The results indicated that inhibitory performance in the GNGT may be comparable to response selection mechanisms, reaching peripheral muscles at around 316 ms. In contrast, inhibitory performance in the SST is achieved via biasing of the sensory-motor system in preparation for stopping, followed by fast sensory, motor and frontal integration during outright stopping. Inhibition can be detected at the peripheral level at 140 ms after stop stimulus presentation. The GNGT and the SST therefore seem to recruit widely different neural dynamics, implying that the interchangeable use of superficially similar inhibition tasks in both basic and clinical research is unwarranted.",

This observations led contemporary theory to suggest multiple component processes contribute to patterns of ongoing thought. The present study used EEG to seek support for these component-process accounts by examining the neural correlates of deliberate and spontaneous task unrelated thought. EEG activity was compared prior to reports of ongoing thought during a test of sustained attention. Event-related potentials, such as the P3, were attenuated during off-task states, regardless of whether they were intentional or not. In contrast, increased alpha power and cortical phase-locking were linked to deliberate off-task thoughts, while reductions of evoked sensory response were prevalent in spontaneous off-task episodes. These data suggest off-task thought shares common and distinct neural features that are differentiated through their relationship to intention, supporting component process accounts of ongoing thought.",

    "abstract": "Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) densely innervate the forebrain and modulate synaptic plasticity, cortical processing, brain states and oscillations. However, little is known about the functional diversity of cholinergic neurons and whether distinct types support different functions. To examine this question we recorded BFCN in vivo, to examine their behavioral functions, and in vitro, to study their intrinsic properties. We identified two distinct types of BFCN that markedly differ in their firing modes, synchronization properties and behavioral correlates. Bursting cholinergic neurons (BFCNBURST) fired in zero-lag synchrony with each other, phase-locked to cortical theta activity and fired precisely timed bursts of action potentials after reward and punishment. Regular firing cholinergic neurons (BFCNREG) were found predominantly in the posterior basal forebrain, displayed strong theta rhythmicity (5-10 Hz), fired asynchronously with each other and responded with precise single spikes after behavioral outcomes. In an auditory detection task, synchronization of BFCNBURST neurons to auditory cortex predicted the timing of mouse responses, whereas tone-evoked cortical coupling of BFCNREG predicted correct detections. We propose that cortical activation relevant for behavior is controlled by the balance of two cholinergic cell types, where the precise proportion of the strongly activating BFCNBURST follows an anatomical gradient along the antero-posterior axis of the basal forebrain.",

    "abstract": "Some microbes have a fascinating ability to degrade compounds that are toxic for humans in a process called bioremediation. Although these traits help microbes survive the toxins, carrying them can be costly if the benefit of detoxification is shared by all surrounding microbes, whether they detoxify or not. Detoxification can thereby be seen as a public goods game, where non-degrading mutants can sweep through the population and collapse bioremediation. Here, we constructed an evolutionary game theoretical model to optimize bioremediation in a chemostat initially containing \"cooperating\" (detoxifying) microbes. We consider two types of mutants: \"cheaters\" that do not detoxify, and mutants that become resistant to the toxin through private mechanisms that do not benefit others. By manipulating the concentration and flow rate of a toxin into the chemostat, we identified conditions where cooperators can exclude cheaters that differ in their private resistance. However, eventually, cheaters are bound to invade. To overcome this inevitable outcome and maximize detoxification efficiency, cooperators can be periodically reinoculated into the population. Our study investigates the outcome of an evolutionary game combining both public and private goods and demonstrates how environmental parameters can be used to control evolutionary dynamics in practical applications.",

We have generated Hi-C data from primary cardiac tissue and developed a method, peakHiC, for sensitive and quantitative loop calling to uncover the human heart regulatory interactome. We identify complex CTCF-dependent and -independent contact networks, with loops between coding and non-coding gene promoters, shared enhancers and repressive sites. Across the genome, enhancer interaction strength correlates with gene transcriptional output and loop dynamics follows CTCF, cohesin and H3K27Ac occupancy levels. Finally, we demonstrate that intersection of the human heart regulatory interactome with cardiovascular disease variants facilitates prioritizing disease-causative genes.",

A better understanding of how biological factors, such as microbial community composition, influence the lability and fate of organic matter is needed. Here, we explored the extent to which organic matter remineralization is influenced by species-specific metabolic capabilities. We carried out aerobic time-series incubations of Guaymas basin sediments to quantify the dynamics of carbon utilization by two different heterotrophic marine isolates. Continuous measurement of respiratory CO2 production and its carbon isotopic compositions (13C and 14C) shows species-specific differences in the rate, quantity, and type of organic matter remineralized. Each species was incubated with hydrothermally-influenced vs. unimpacted sediments, resulting in a ~3-fold difference in respiratory CO2 yield across the experiments. Genomic analysis indicated that the observed carbon utilization patterns may be attributed in part to the number of gene copies encoding for extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Our results demonstrate that the lability and remineralization of organic matter in marine environments is not only a function of chemical composition and/or environmental conditions, but also a function of the microorganisms that are present and active.",

Intracellular recordings of the neurons activity in response to acoustic stimuli were obtained, while either the ipsilateral or the contralateral hearing organ was cold-deactivated. Afferent activity was abolished at a temperature of about 10{degrees}C. In ON1 contralateral inhibition has no effect on the latency and amplitude of the phasic onset activity, it enhances the decline of the onset activity and decreases the subsequent tonic spiking response to acoustic stimuli. As a consequence the phasic onset activity becomes more salient and reciprocal inhibition may support the detection of sound pulses. Contralateral inhibition had a significant impact on the tonic ON1 response, in line with its presumed function to enhance the bilateral auditory contrast. In ON2, experiments confirmed a bilateral excitatory input, with the ipsilateral input dominating the response, and no inhibitory coupling between the ON2 neurons.",

    "abstract": "To meet the ever-growing demand of antibiotic discovery, new chemical matter and antibiotic targets are urgently needed. Many potent natural product antibiotics which were previously discarded can also provide lead molecules and drug targets. One such example is the structurally unique {beta}-lactone obafluorin, produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 39502. Obafluorin is active against both Grampositive and -negative pathogens, however the biological target was unknown. We now report that obafluorin targets threonyl-tRNA-synthetase and we identify a homologue, ObaO, which confers self-immunity to the obafluorin producer. Disruption of obaO in P. fluorescens ATCC 39502 results in obafluorin sensitivity, whereas expression in sensitive E. coli strains confers resistance. Enzyme assays demonstrate that E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase is fully inhibited by obafluorin, whereas ObaO is only partly susceptible, exhibiting a very unusual partial inhibition mechanism. Altogether, our data highlight the utility of a self-immunity guided approach for the identification of an antibiotic target de novo and will ultimately enable the generation of improved obafluorin variants.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the link between neural activity and perception remains incomplete. Microstimulation and optogenetic experiments have shown that manipulating cortical activity can influence sensory-guided behaviour or elicit artificial percepts. And yet, some perceptual tasks can still be solved when sensory cortex is silenced or removed, suggesting that cortical activity may not always be essential. Reconciling these findings, and providing a quantitative framework linking cortical activity and behaviour, requires knowledge of the identity of the cells being activated during the behaviour, the engagement of the local and downstream networks, and the cortical and behavioural state. Here, we performed two-photon population calcium imaging in L2/3 primary visual cortex (V1) of headfixed mice performing a visual detection task while simultaneously activating specific groups of neurons using targeted two-photon optogenetics during low contrast visual stimulation. Only activation of groups of cells with similar tuning to the relevant visual stimulus led to a measurable bias of detection behaviour. Targeted photostimulation revealed signatures of centre-surround, predominantly inhibitory and like-to-like connectivity motifs in the local network which shaped the visual stimulus representation and partially explained the change in stimulus detectability. Moreover, the behavioural effects depended on overall performance: when the task was challenging for the mouse, V1 activity was more closely linked to performance, and cortical stimulation boosted perception. In contrast, when the task was easy, V1 activity was less informative about performance and cortical stimulation suppressed stimulus detection. Altogether, we find that both the selective routing of information through functionally specific circuits, and the prevailing cortical state, make similarly large contributions to explaining the behavioural response to photostimulation. Our results thus help to reconcile contradictory findings about the involvement of primary sensory cortex in behavioural tasks, suggesting that the influence of cortical activity on behaviour is dynamically reassigned depending on the demands of the task.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary diversification of animals is one of Earths greatest triumphs, yet its origins are still shrouded in mystery. Animals, the monophyletic clade known as Metazoa, evolved wildly divergent multicellular life strategies featuring ciliated sensory epithelia. In many lineages epithelial sensoria became coupled to increasingly complex nervous systems. Currently, different phylogenetic analyses of single-copy genes support mutually-exclusive possibilities that either Porifera or Ctenophora is sister to all other animals. Resolving this dilemma would advance the ecological and evolutionary understanding of the first animals and the evolution of nervous systems. Here we describe a comparative phylogenetic approach based on gene duplications. We computationally identify and analyze gene families with early metazoan duplications using an approach that mitigates apparent gene loss resulting from the miscalling of paralogs. In the transmembrane channel-like (TMC) family of mechano-transducing channels, we find ancient duplications that define separate clades for Eumetazoa (Placozoa + Cnidaria + Bilateria) versus Ctenophora, and one duplication that is shared only by Eumetazoa and Porifera. In the MLX/MLXIP family of bHLH-ZIP regulators of metabolism, we find that all major lineages from Eumetazoa and Porifera (sponges) share a duplication, absent in Ctenophora. These results suggest a new avenue for deducing deep phylogeny by choosing rather than avoiding ancient gene paralogies.",

    "abstract": "Translational control of memory processes is a tightly regulated process where the coordinated interaction and modulation of translation factors provides a permissive environment for protein synthesis during memory formation. Existing methods used to block translation lack the spatiotemporal precision to investigate cell-specific contributions to consolidation of long-term memories. Here, we have developed a novel chemogenetic mouse resource for cell type-specific and drug-inducible protein synthesis inhibition (ciPSI) that utilizes an engineered version of the catalytic kinase domain of dsRNA-activated protein (PKR). ciPSI allows rapid and reversible phosphorylation of eIF2 causing a block on general translation by 50% in vivo. Using this resource, we discovered that temporally structured pan-neuronal protein synthesis is required for consolidation of long-term auditory threat memory. Targeted protein synthesis inhibition in CamK2 expressing glutamatergic neurons in lateral amygdala (LA) impaired long-term memory, which was recovered with artificial chemogenetic reactivation at the cost of stimulus generalization. Conversely, genetically reducing phosphorylation of eIF2 in CamK2 positive neurons in LA enhanced memory strength, but was accompanied with reduced memory fidelity and behavior inflexibility. Our findings provide evidence for a finely tuned translation program during consolidation of long-term threat memories.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many SNPs associated with various common diseases. Understanding the biological functions of these identified SNP associations requires identifying disease/trait relevant tissues or cell types. Here, we develop a network method, CoCoNet, to facilitate the identification of trait-relevant tissues or cell types. Different from existing approaches, CoCoNet incorporates tissue-specific gene co-expression networks constructed from either bulk or single cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies with GWAS data for trait-tissue inference. In particular, CoCoNet relies on a covariance regression network model to express gene-level effect sizes for the given GWAS trait as a function of the tissue-specific co-expression adjacency matrix. With a composite likelihood-based inference algorithm, CoCoNet is scalable to tens of thousands of genes. We validate the performance of CoCoNet through extensive simulations. We apply CoCoNet for an in-depth analysis of four neurological disorders and four autoimmune diseases, where we integrate the corresponding GWASs with bulk RNAseq data from 38 tissues and single cell RNAseq data from 10 cell types. In the real data applications, we show how CoCoNet can help identify specific glial cell types relevant for neurological disorders and identify disease-targeted colon tissues as relevant for autoimmune diseases. Our results also provide empirical evidence supporting one hypothesis of the omnigenic model: that trait-relevant gene co-expression networks underlie disease etiology.",

    "abstract": "The rapid and aggressive spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum carrying the kelch13 C580Y mutation is a growing threat to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia, but there is no evidence of their spread to other regions. We conducted cross-sectional surveys in 2016 and 2017 at two clinics in Wewak, Papua New Guinea (PNG) where we identified three infections caused by C580Y mutants among 239 genotyped clinical samples. One of these mutants exhibited the highest survival rate (6.8%) among all parasites surveyed in ring-stage survival assays (RSA) for artemisinin. Analyses of kelch13 flanking regions, and comparisons of deep sequencing data from 389 clinical samples from PNG, Indonesian Papua and Western Cambodia, suggested an independent origin of the Wewak C580Y mutation, showing that the mutants possess several distinctive genetic features. Identity by descent (IBD) showed that multiple portions of the mutants genomes share a common origin with parasites found in Indonesian Papua, comprising several mutations within genes previously associated with drug resistance, such as mdr1, ferredoxin, atg18 and pnp. These findings suggest that a P. falciparum lineage circulating on the island of New Guinea has gradually acquired a complex ensemble of variants, including kelch13 C580Y, which have affected the parasites drug sensitivity. This worrying development reinforces the need for increased surveillance of the evolving parasite populations on the island, to contain the spread of resistance.",

    "abstract": "The role of genetic architecture in adaptation to novel environments has received considerable attention when the source of adaptation variation is de novo mutation. Relatively less is known when the source of adaptive variation is inter- or intraspecific hybridization. We model hybridization between divergent source populations and subsequent colonization of an unoccupied novel environment using individual-based simulations in order to understand the influence of genetic architecture on the timing of colonization and the mode of adaptation. We find that two distinct categories of genetic architecture facilitate rapid colonization but that they do so in qualitatively different ways. For few and/or tightly linked loci, the mode of adaptation is via the recovery of adaptive parental genotypes. With many unlinked loci, the mode of adaptation is via the generation of novel hybrid genotypes. The first category results in the shortest colonization lag phases across the widest range of parameter space, but further adaptation is mutation limited. The second category takes longer and is more sensitive to genetic variance and dispersal rate, but can facilitate adaptation to environmental conditions which exceed the tolerance of parental populations. These findings have implications for understanding the origins of biological invasions and the success of hybrid populations.",

Here, we applied electron tomography (ET) and manual feature extraction to generate a quantitative 3D model of the murine SC. We quantified the length (90 nm) and width (2 nm) of the TFs. Interestingly, the 80 TFs/m are distributed asymmetrically in the central region of the SC challenging available models of SC organization. Furthermore, our detailed 3D topological analysis does not support a bilayered organization of the central region as proposed earlier. Overall, our quantitative analysis is relevant to understand the functions and dynamics of the SC and provides the basis for analyzing multiprotein complexes in their morphological context using ET.",

    "abstract": "Rates of protein synthesis and the number of translating ribosomes vary greatly between different cells in various cell states. The distribution of assembled, and potentially translating, ribosomes within cells can be visualised in Drosophila by using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) to monitor the interaction between tagged pairs of 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins (RPs) that are close neighbours across inter-subunit junctions in the assembled 80S ribosome. Here we describe transgenes that express two novel RP pairs tagged with Venus-based BiFC fragments that considerably increase the sensitivity of this technique that we termed Ribo-BiFC. This improved method should provide a convenient way of monitoring the local distribution of ribosomes in most Drosophila cells and we suggest that could be implemented in other organisms. We visualized 80S ribosomes in larval photoreceptors and in other neurons. Assembled ribosomes are most abundant in the various neuronal cell bodies, but they are also present along the lengths of axons and are concentrated in growth cones of larval and pupal photoreceptors. Surprisingly, there is relatively less puromycin incorporation in the distal portion of axons in the optic stalk, suggesting that some of the ribosomes that have started translation may not be engaged in elongation in axons that are still growing.",

    "abstract": "Many facets of ecological theory rely on the analysis of invasion processes, and general approaches exist to understand the early stages of an invasion. However, predicting the long-term transformations of communities following an invasion remains a challenging endeavour. We propose an analytical method that uses community structure and invader dynamical features to predict when these impacts can be large, and show it to be applicable across a wide class of dynamical models. Our approach reveals that short-term invasion success and long-term consequences are two distinct axes of variation controlled by different properties of both invader and resident community. Whether a species can invade is controlled by its invasion fitness, which depends on environmental conditions and direct interactions with resident species. But whether this invasion will cause significant transformations, such as extinctions or a regime shift, depends on a specific measure of indirect feedbacks that may involve the entire resident community. Our approach applies to arbitrarily complex communities, from few competing phenotypes in adaptive dynamics to large nonlinear food webs. It hints at new questions to ask as part of any invasion analysis, and suggests that long-term indirect interactions are key determinants of invasion outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Dietary fibre (DF) has multiple health benefits, and wheat products are major sources of DF for human health. However, DF is depleted in white flour, which is most widely consumed, compared to wholegrain. The major type of DF in white wheat flour is the cell wall polysaccharide arabinoxylan (AX). Previous studies have identified the Chinese wheat cultivar Yumai 34 as having unusually high contents of AX in both water-soluble and insoluble forms. We have therefore used populations generated from crosses between Yumai 34 and four other wheat cultivars, three with average contents of AX (Ukrainka, Altigo and Claire) and one also having unusually high AX (Valoris), in order to map QTLs for soluble AX (determined as relative viscosity) of aqueous extracts of wholemeal flours) and total AX (determined by enzyme fingerprinting of white flour). A number of QTL were mapped, but most were only detected in one or two crosses. However, all four crosses showed strong QTLs for high RV/total AX on chromosome 1B, with Yumai 34 being the increasing parent, and a KASP marker for the high AX Yumai 34 allele was validated by analysis of high AX lines derived from Yumai 34 but selected by biochemical analysis. A QTL for RV was mapped on chromosome 6B in Yumai 34 x Valoris, with Valoris being the increasing allele, which was consistent with the observation of transgressive segregation for this trait. The data indicate that breeding can be used to develop wheat with high AX fibre in white flour.",

MAP-ENVIVIDERS was over 10-fold more sensitive for cell-type-specific labeling than previous strategies, enabling us to capture individual cell-type-specific neurons with extremely complex axonal branches and presynaptic axonal boutons, both about one order of magnitude than previously reported and considered.

This is naturally achieved by mechanical loading of the young healthy skeleton. However, these bone anabolic responses fail with age. Here, we applied site specificity analysis to map regional differences in bone anabolic responses to axial loading of the tibia (tri-weekly, for two weeks) between young (19-week-old) and aged (19-month-old), male and female mice. Loading increased bone mass specifically in the proximal tibia in both sexes and ages. Young female mice gained more cortical bone than young males in specific regions of the tibia. However, these site-specific sex difference were lost with age such that bone gain following loading was not significantly different between old males and females. Having previously demonstrated that prior and concurrent disuse enhances bone gain following loading in old females, we established whether this \\\"rescue\\\" is sex-specific. Old male mice were subjected to sciatic neurectomy or sham surgery, and tri-weekly loading was initiated four days after surgery. Disuse augmented cortical bone gain in response to loading in old male mice, but only in the regions of the tibia which were load-responsive in the young. Increased understanding of how locally-activated load-responsive processes lead to site-specific bone formation, and how the age-related diminution of these processes can be site-specifically enhanced by disuse, may lead to the next generation of strategic bone anabolic therapies.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LISex differences in cortical tissue area of young and old mice are not site-specific\\nC_LIO_LIThe loading response in young, but not old, mice is sex- and site-specific\\nC_LIO_LIThe cortical loading response is site-specifically enhanced by disuse in old mice of both sexes\\nC_LIO_LIThe trabecular loading response can be rescued by disuse in old male, but not female, mice\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microgreens are rich functional crops with valuable nutritional elements that have health benefits when used as food supplants. Growth characterization, nutritional composition profile of 21 varieties representing 5 species of the Brassica genus as microgreens were assessed under light-emitting diodes (LEDs) conditions. Microgreens were grown under four different LEDs ratios (%) (R80:B20, R20:B80, R70:G10:B20, and R20:G10:B70). Results indicated that supplemental lighting with green LEDs (R70:G10:B20) enhanced vegetative growth and morphology, while blue LEDs (R20:B80) increased the mineral composition and vitamins content. Interestingly, combining the nutritional content with the growth yield to define the optimal LEDs setup, we found that the best lighting to promote the microgreen growth was supplying the green LEDs combination (R70:G10:B20). Remarkably, under this proper conditions, Kohlrabi purple, Cabbage red, Broccoli, Kale Tucsan, Komatsuna red, Tatsoi, and Cabbage green had the highest growth and nutritional content profile as microgreens which being a health-promoting in a diet support strategy required for the human health under certain isolated of limited food conditions.",

    "abstract": "Rooting cells and pollen tubes - key adaptative innovations that evolved during the colonization and subsequent radiation of plants on land - expand by tip-growth. Tip-growth relies on a tight coordination between the protoplast growth and the synthesis/remodeling of the external cell wall. In root hairs and pollen tubes of the seed plant Arabidopsis thaliana, cell wall integrity (CWI) mechanisms monitor this coordination through the Malectin-like receptor kinases (MLRs) such as AtANXUR1 and AtFERONIA that act upstream of the AtMARIS PTI1-like kinase. Here, we show that rhizoid growth in the early diverging plant, Marchantia polymorpha, is also controlled by an MLR and PTI1-like signaling module. Rhizoids, root hairs and pollen tubes respond similarly to disruption of MLR and PTI1-like encoding genes. Thus, the MLR/PTI1-like signaling module that controls CWI during tip-growth is conserved between M. polymorpha and A. thaliana suggesting it was active in the common ancestor of land plants.",

    "abstract": "We have cloned and characterized a novel fusion protein (Sm3E-TNF), consisting of the monoclonal antibody Sm3E in single-chain Fv fragment format, fused to murine tumor necrosis factor. The protein, which was expressed in mammalian cells and purified as a non-covalent stable homotrimer, bound to the cognate carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and retained tumor necrosis factor activity. A quantitative biodistribution experiment, performed in immunocompetent mice with CT26 colon carcinomas transfected with human CEA, revealed that Sm3E-TNF was able to preferentially accumulate in the tumors with excellent selectivity (tumor:blood ratio = 56:1, twenty-four hours after intravenous administration). The fusion protein mediated a rapid hemorrhagic necrosis of a large portion of the tumor mass, but a rim survived and eventually regrew. Surprisingly, the combination of Sm3E-TNF with 5-fluorouracil led to a reduction of therapeutic activity, while a combination with oxaliplatin led to a prolonged stabilization, with complete tumor eradication in 40% of treated mice. These therapy results were confirmed in a second immunocompetent mouse model of colorectal cancer (CEA-transfected C51 tumors) and provide a rationale for the possible clinical use of oxaliplatin in combination with fully-human antibody-TNF fusions.",

    "abstract": "The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most popular and iconic feline species on the planet, yet in spite of its popularity, the last century has seen massive declines for lion populations worldwide. Genomic resources for endangered species represent an important way forward for the field of conservation, enabling high-resolution studies of demography, disease, and population dynamics. Here, we present a chromosome-level assembly for the captive African lion from the Exotic Feline Rescue Center as a resource for current and subsequent genetic work of the sole social species of the Panthera clade. Our assembly is composed of 10x Genomics Chromium data, Dovetail Hi-C, and Oxford Nanopore long-read data. Synteny is highly conserved between the lion, other Panthera genomes, and the domestic cat. We find variability in the length and levels of homozygosity across the genomes of the lion sequenced here and other previous published resequence data, indicating contrasting histories of recent and ancient small population sizes and/or inbreeding. Demographic analyses reveal similar histories across all individuals except the Asiatic lion, which shows a more rapid decline in population size. This high-quality genome will greatly aid in the continuing research and conservation efforts for the lion.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPrior Go/NoGo studies have localized specific regions and EEG spectra for which traditional approaches have distinguished between Go and NoGo conditions. A more detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and timing of the synchronization of frequency bands would contribute substantially to the clarification of neural mechanisms that underlie performance of the Go/NoGo task. The present study used a machine learning approach to learn the features that distinguish between ERSPs involved in selection and inhibition in a Go/NoGo task. A neural network classifier was used to predict task conditions for each subject to characterize ERSPs associated with Go versus NoGo trials. The final model accurately identified individual task conditions at an overall rate of 92%, estimated by 5-fold cross-validation. The detailed accounting of EEG time-frequency patterns localized to brain sources (i.e., thalamus, preSMA, orbitofrontal cortex, and superior parietal cortex) provides elaboration on previous findings from fMRI and EEG studies and more information about EEG power changes in multiple frequency bands (i.e., primarily theta power increase, alpha decreases, and beta increases and decreases) within these regions underlying the selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials. This extends previous findings, providing more information about neural mechanisms underlying selection and inhibition processes engaged in the Go and NoGo trials, respectively, and may offer insight into therapeutic uses of neuromodulation in neural dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe endothelial glycocalyx and the regulation of its shedding are important to vascular health. Endo-{beta}-D-glucuronidase heparanase-1 (HPSE1) is the only enzyme that can shed heparan sulfate. However, the mechanisms are not well understood.\\n\\nApproach and resultsTo investigate HPSE1 and its endogenous inhibitor, heparanase-2 (HPSE2), we used cell culture, lentiviral protein overexpression, a microfluidic chip model of cell culture under shear stress conditions, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections in mice. We show that HPSE1 activity aggravated Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated response of endothelial cells to LPS. On the contrary, HPSE2 overexpression was protective. The microfluidic chip flow model confirmed that HPSE2 prevented heparan sulfate shedding by HPSE1. Furthermore, heparan sulfate did not interfere with cluster of differentiation-14 (CD14)-dependent LPS binding, but instead reduced the presentation of the LPS-CD14 complex to TLR4. HPSE2 reduced LPS-mediated TLR4 activation by LPS, subsequent cell signaling, and cytokine expression. Moreover, HPSE2-overexpressing endothelial cells remained protected against LPS-mediated loss of cell-cell contacts. In vivo, expression of HPSE2 in plasma and kidney medullary capillaries was decreased in mouse sepsis model. We next applied purified HPSE2 in mice and observed decreases in TNF and IL-6 plasma concentrations after intravenous LPS injections.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data demonstrate the important role of heparan sulfate and the glycocalyx in endothelial cell activation and suggest a protective role of HPSE2 in microvascular inflammation. HPSE2 offers new options for protection against HPSE1-mediated endothelial damage and preventing microvascular disease.\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/705939v1_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (50K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bae526org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a6039org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a36deforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1869ea8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\\n\\nC_FIG O_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a3deborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d71919org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0c8a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4477f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11f1588_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL O_TABLECAPTIONNon standard abbreviations\\n\\nC_TABLECAPTION C_TBL",

    "abstract": "The brain creates a physical response out of signals in a cascade of streaming transformations. These transformations occur over networks, which have been described in anatomical, cyto-, myeloarchitectonic and functional research. The totality of these networks has been modelled and synthesised in phases across a continuous time-space-function axis, through ascending and descending hierarchical levels of association1-3 via changing coalitions of traveling netwaves4-6, where localised disorders might spread locally throughout the neighbouring tissues. This study quantified the model empirically with time-resolving functional magnetic resonance imaging of an imperative, visually-triggered, self-delayed, therefor double-event related response task. The resulting time series unfold in the range of slow cortical potentials the spatio-temporal integrity of a cortical pathway from the source of perception to the mouth of reaction in and out of known functional, anatomical and cytoarchitectonic networks. These pathways are consolidated in phase images described by a small vector matrix, which leads to massive simplification of cortical field theory and even to simple technical applications.",
